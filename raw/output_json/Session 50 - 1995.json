        "file_text": "The United Nations is celebrating its fiftieth\nanniversary. Today, it is up to us to take stock of its\nprogress and its successes, as well as its and shortcomings\nsince its inception, but also, and in particular, to consider\nand assess the experience it has gained, in order to provide\na firmer basis for its future, which, after all, is closely\nlinked with the future of mankind.\nThe people of Burundi, whom I have the honour to\nrepresent in this Assembly, set particular store by this\nsession, which should galvanize all the Member States of\nour Organization to work for the progress and the survival\nof the world as a whole.\nIn Burundi, a number of activities to promote\nawareness of the purposes and principles of the United\nNations have been undertaken. We can assure the Assembly\nthat our country duly acknowledges the eminent role that\nthe United Nations has played and continues to play in\nhelping Burundi return to the road of peace and security.\nWe are pleased that the presidency of this session of\nthe General Assembly, which should be the springboard for\nits revitalization, has been entrusted to Mr. Diogo Freitas\ndo Amaral, who has been blessed with great intellectual and\nmoral qualities and wide political and diplomatic\nexperience. His country and mine enjoy friendly relations\nin all areas. What has already been said about him here\nshow that the congratulations my delegation extends to him\nare well deserved and justify the assistance it will be\npleased to give him as a contribution to the success of his\nnoble mission.\nWe would also like to pay a sincere tribute to his\npredecessor, His Excellency Mr. Amara Essy, Minister for\nForeign Affairs of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire. Throughout his term of\noffice, he applied himself to the tasks resulting from the\npresent developments in the United Nations. In this\nconnection, Foreign Minister Amara Essy has worked\nwholeheartedly to promote our Organization across the\nworld and has brilliantly championed the strengthening of\nthe United Nations and the enhancement of its prestige.\nThis is an excellent opportunity to express our sincere\ngratitude to Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, Secretary-General\nof the United Nations, whom I had the pleasure to receive\nin Bujumbura last July. We are extremely grateful to him\nfor his profound commitment to peace, security and\ndevelopment throughout the world. The resounding appeal\nfor peace and national reconciliation he made to the people\nof Burundi in particular and to Africa in general still rings\nin our ears.\nTwo years have passed since, from this very\nrostrum, His Excellency President Melchior Ndadaye,\nwho was swept to power in Burundi following democratic\nelections, addressed a message of peace, friendship,\nbrotherhood and solidarity to the General Assembly. Since\nthe contemptible assassination of President Ndadaye on\n21 October 1993, my country has laboured under a\npolitical, institutional, social and economic crisis that\npersists to this day. Nevertheless, despite the devastation\nand the political and ethnic massacres, the people of\nBurundi did not yield to despair. In a surge of optimism,\nthe registered political parties and the representatives of\ncivilian society held negotiations and in-depth discussions\non how to bring the country out of the abyss into which\nthe enemies of the fatherland had plunged it. After long\nand arduous debates, the Convention of Government was\nsigned on 10 September 1994; this was followed by the\nrestoration of the presidency and the establishment of a\nNational Coalition Government.\nWe greatly appreciated the decisive contribution\nmade by the United Nations to the people of Burundi\u2019s\nreturn to peace and security. When the crisis broke out,\nthe Secretary-General sent a Special Envoy to the scene.\nFollowing that, he appointed His Excellency Ambassador\nAhmedou Ould Abdallah as Special Representative to\nBurundi, and we extend our profound thanks to him for\nhis patient and tireless efforts to bring the various\npolitical partners together, despite their often deep\ndifferences of opinion at the height of the crisis. The\nUnited Nations sent to Burundi two successive\ndelegations made up of distinguished ambassadors to the\nSecurity Council and headed by a distinguished African\nstatesman, His Excellency Ambassador Ibrahim Gambari\nof Nigeria, to offer us advice and to bring us a message\nof peace and comfort. Other delegations of the United\nNations and various international bodies in the United\nNations system came to Burundi to demonstrate their\nsupport and solidarity. In the context of the promotion of\nhuman rights and education for peace and tolerance, a\nUnited Nations Centre for Human Rights and a United\nNations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization\n(UNESCO) Peace House were established in Burundi.\nThe Organization of African Unity (OAU) also\ndeserves our profound thanks because it has, from the\nvery beginning of the crisis, sought appropriate solutions\nto enable Burundi to regain peace and stability. The work\ndone by the pan-African organization is primarily to the\n23\n\n\ncredit of its Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Salim\nAhmed Salim, who displayed considerable diplomatic and\nhuman skills on behalf of Burundi. His work was later\ncarried on by his Special Representative, His Excellency\nAmbassador L\u00e9andre Bassol\u00e9 of Burkina Faso.\nWe should like to extend our thanks to all of the\nfriendly countries which have assisted us in various ways\nand continue to do so, particularly in the brother countries\nwhich gave shelter to Burundi refugees. We are working to\nenable our compatriots to return home safely and we are\ncoming to grips with the problem of displaced persons.\nThe Convention of Government, which was mentioned\nearlier and the first anniversary of which we have just\ncelebrated, gave us an opportunity to set up State\ninstitutions and organs as well as various kinds of political\nand legal machinery that could restore confidence and\ncooperation among the political partners.\nThe first mission assigned us under this Convention is\nto restore peace and security in the country. Then it will be\na question of restoring the rights of refugees and displaced\npersons, that is, to facilitate their return home with the\nassurance that in an initial phase they will be assured of the\nbasic necessities until they can provide for their own needs.\nThe Government also intends to initiate the economic\nrecovery and national reconstruction programme. However,\nif our subregion continues to produce refugees and to serve\nas a suitable place for illicit trafficking in deadly weapons\nof war, this situation would constitute an ongoing source of\ninsecurity and destabilization for the countries concerned.\nLast February in Bujumbura, when we hosted the Regional\nConference on Refugees, Repatriates and Displaced Persons\nfor the Great Lakes region, organized under the auspices of\nthe OAU in cooperation with the Office of the United\nNations High Commissioner for Refugees, a number of\nconclusions were drawn and resolutions adopted. Today we\nrecognize that the road to be travelled remains a long one\nbecause the resolutions that were adopted remain a dead\nletter.\nIndeed, it is important for the international community\nto become better mobilized to help us eradicate the basic\ncauses of the continued instability and fragility of our lakes\nregion. In our opinion it would be necessary, first of all, for\neveryone to have the same understanding of our history\nand, above all, to accept it as it is. They should also give\nserious consideration to lasting, definitive solutions that\nmust be found for this conflict situation.\nFor our part, we consider that the major problem in\nBurundi lies in the conceptions of, access to and\nmanagement of power among the various political actors\nin the national community.\nWe can affirm that the conflict that Burundi has\nexperienced is far from being ethnic, as many political\nand media circles have alleged. The basis of the problem\nis essentially political, which is why solutions to this\nproblem are condemned to be political also. We must\nreject and denounce the advocates of the policy of\nexclusion, segregation and extermination, which give rise\nto crises, instability and repeated conflicts. We condemn\nthe ideology of hatred, of violence and of genocide\nexploited by so many politicians who wish to attain\npower or wish to remain in power at any cost.\nThe crisis which we are experiencing dates from the\nbeginning of our independence and has deep roots in the\norganization and direction of the country during the\ncolonial period. The various regimes which have\nsucceeded one another in Burundi were powerless to\nresolve this situation. The problem must be addressed by\nthe people of Burundi, assisted by the international\ncommunity and not replaced by it.\nWe rely on the regional Conference on Security,\nStability and Development in the Great Lakes region,\nwhich will be organized under the auspices of the United\nNations, and which will seek to find appropriate, lasting\nand definitive solutions. We should like to thank the\nSecretary-General of the United Nations for having\ndesignated an African diplomat to take charge of the\npreparations for this Conference, to which my country\nattaches real importance.\nMoreover, my delegation appeals to neighbouring\ncountries to help us neutralize the efforts of those who,\nworking from their own territory, have endeavoured to\ndestabilize ours. It would indeed be illusory to want to\nextinguish a fire from within when, outside, militias,\narmed bands or malevolent groups are organizing and\ntraining themselves in order to attack Burundi.\nToday, the country must face attacks waged jointly\nby the Party for the Liberation of the Hutu People\n(PALIPEHUTU), the National Liberation Front\n(FROLINA), the National Council \u2014 improperly labelled\nthe Democratic Defence Council (CNDD) \u2014 and its\narmed branch, the curiously named Forces for the\nDefence of Democracy (FDD). These groups, in collusion\n24\n\n\nwith military-political forces, are responsible for the\ngenocide in neighbouring Rwanda.\nIn addition to these attacks there is another\ndestabilizing force, the pirate radio station cynically\nbaptized \u201cVoice of the People\u201d, or, \u201cDemocracy Radio\u201d,\nwhich inculcates ethnic hatred within the Burundi\npopulation and which is working towards the dissemination\nof a neo-nazi-type ideology in this region of Central Africa\nat the end of this twentieth century. We are relying on the\nvaluable assistance of our neighbouring and brotherly\ncountry, with which we share geography and history and\nwith which we maintain the closest relations, to dismantle\nthis medium of hatred, which is reminiscent in many ways\nof the infamous Free Radio-Television of the Thousand\nHills (la Radio-T\u00e9l\u00e9vision Libre des milles collines)\n(RTLM), which galvanized the massacres last year in\nRwanda.\nWe should like to reaffirm the unswerving attachment\nof the Government of Burundi to the principles of good-\nneighbourliness and non-interference in the internal affairs\nof another State. We respect the bilateral, regional and\ninternational agreements and conventions to which Burundi\nhas freely subscribed. In following these commitments the\nGovernment of Burundi hopes that our immediate\nneighbours and our partners will properly understand our\nproblems and the problems that affect our region. They\nshould understand the complexity and delicacy of the latter\nso that in trying to help us find solutions they will avoid\npouring oil on the fire.\nWe know that, alone, we cannot arrive at harmonious,\nsatisfactory and lasting solutions, and that is why we\nwelcome with open arms the various forms of mediation\naimed at helping us get out of the present crisis and at\nproducing stability within our subregion. However, we\nwould not want such mediation to lead to other, unexpected\nproblems linked to undue interference in our internal\naffairs.\nWe have begun a campaign for the restoration of\npeace, with the support of the Government, the National\nAssembly and the political parties that are signatories to the\nConvention of Government. We are resolved to dismantle\nthe armed gangs, be they within or outside our country. But\nour efforts to restore peace will be futile if we do not work\ntowards eradicating the phenomenon of impunity, which has\nbeen aggravated by our country\u2019s current crisis. In this\ncontext, a request was sent to the United Nations to\nestablish an international judicial commission of inquiry\ninto the crimes committed in Burundi. We express our\ngratitude to the Security Council for the establishment of\nthis commission.\nAlong these lines, we are planning to organize, in\nthe near future, a national debate on the fundamental\nproblems affecting the country, with a view to the\nadoption of a national covenant for peaceful coexistence\nbetween the various constituent parts of the nation and\nalso of a new Constitution reflecting the realities now\nfacing the country.\nLately, the President of the Republic, His Excellency\nMr. Sylvestre Ntibantunganya, has been consulting\nvarious socio-political groups \u2014 professionals, the\nmilitary, representatives of religious communities, women\nand disaffected youth \u2014 to solicit their suggestions for\nensuring the speedy restoration of peace in Burundi. The\nconclusion is inescapable: everyone aspires to peace,\njustice and development. That is why our partners should\nnot be discouraged, nor should they despair, when it\ncomes to Burundi. The programme of national\nreconciliation and reconstruction will require a\nmobilization of appreciable funds, which Burundi alone\ncannot marshal. The reinstallation and reintegration of our\ndisplaced persons, expatriates and those who have been\ndispersed, the reconstruction of the socio-economic\ninfrastructures that were destroyed, the training of our\nyoung people and the relaunching of the overall\nproductive apparatus \u2014 these are my Government\u2019s major\nconcerns.\nWe call upon the international community to support\nus unwaveringly in order that we may implement this vast\nprogramme. We hope that our partners will respond in a\npositive way at the General Round Table of donor\ncountries, scheduled to be held in Geneva shortly, so that\nthe necessary financial resources for the reconstruction of\nBurundi can be mobilized.\nWith respect to the Great Lakes subregion, Burundi\nencourages the Government of Rwanda to continue its\npolicy of national reconciliation and to create the\nconditions of peace and security conducive to the return\nof Rwandan refugees to their homeland. For its part, the\ninternational community must ensure that those\nresponsible for the genocide in Rwanda are punished in\naccordance with the relevant resolutions of the Security\nCouncil. We strongly urge the countries of the subregion\nto cooperate fully with the International Tribunal created\nfor this purpose.\n25\n\n\nAs regards the crisis in Somalia, my country hopes\nthat the protagonists will agree to form a government based\non a broad consensus. We invite our Somali brothers to lay\ndown their arms and to work towards national\nreconciliation \u2014 the only road to lasting peace \u2014 and to\ndevote themselves to rebuilding their country.\nAs for Angola, we welcome the constructive dialogue\nthat has been established between President Jos\u00e9 Eduardo\ndos Santos and the leader of UNITA, Jonas Savimbi. This\nis a positive development, which we hope will lead to a\ncomplete cessation of the hostilities that have taken so\nmany lives among the brotherly people of Angola. We also\nnourish the hope that the Lusaka Peace Agreement will be\nimplemented strictly by the parties so that peace can be\nrestored to Angola. We urge the United Nations to speed up\nthe planned deployment of forces in the context of the\nUnited Nations Angola Verification Mission (UNAVEM\nIII).\nWe also welcome the developments in Liberia, in the\nMiddle East and in the former Yugoslavia. We hope that\nthe recent events in the former Yugoslavia will not inflame\nthe situation further or stand in the way of a solution,\nwhich has been awaited for so long by the international\ncommunity.\nA look at the political configuration of the United\nNations reveals a strange paradox: at a time when hotbeds\nof tension are concentrated in Africa, at a time when\npoverty there has broken every record and at a time when\nnatural and man-made disasters are proliferating, many\ninternational forums are seeking to reduce our continent to\nthe status of a poor relative. At a time when the golden\njubilee of our Organization is being commemorated, Africa\nis the only one of the five continents to be excluded from\npermanent representation on the Security Council. But the\ndangers that loom over Africa, both from within and from\noutside, require that it be at the centre of deliberations and\ndecisions on peace and security. Aside from this reality, the\ndemocratization of the United Nations is tantamount to a\ncategorical imperative. Thus we strongly urge the\nestablishment of a genuine parallel between the emergence\nof democracy on the scale of the Member States and the\nreform of the United Nations, so that Africa could be given\naccess to permanent seats on the Security Council. Under\nthe principle of democracy, the projected reforms of the\nUnited Nations system should reserve for our continent the\nlion\u2019s share, for two reasons: first, Africa, as a vast\ncollective entity, has the right to permanent seats on the\nSecurity Council; and, secondly, Africa has the right to\nparticipate in the Council in a manner commensurate with\nits numerical significance. Once this twofold requirement\nhas been recognized, Africa will be prepared to select\nthose countries that are best suited politically,\ndiplomatically, economically and demographically to sit\npermanently on the Security Council, on behalf of the\nentire continent.\nOn the eve of the twenty-first century, Burundi is\nkeenly aware that the United Nations remains the source\nof salvation for the human race. My country reiterates and\nreaffirms its unswerving dedication to the ideals and\nobjectives of the United Nations. As a concrete\nmanifestation of that dedication, the Government of\nBurundi \u2014 even though it has borne the brunt of the\neffects of the international economic situation and of its\nown, two-year-long, severe national crisis \u2014 has just\ndisbursed more than $76,000 by way of contribution to\nthe regular budget of the United Nations. Nevertheless,\nBurundi must stress the imperative need for the world\nOrganization to become an ever-present shield for peace,\nsecurity and progress. To achieve this, it must evolve with\nthe times and become a genuine universal forum in which\nall countries, regardless of their political, economic,\ngeographical and economic disparities, can join together\nand unite in order to take decisions on the future of\nhumankind.\nThis metamorphosis, to which the countries of the\nUnited Nations so strongly aspire, requires of Member\nStates and other accredited agencies working to that end\nnot only the political will but also and above all the\ncreative genius to revitalize and breathe new life into the\nOrganization, allowing it to meet the challenges as this\ncentury enters its twilight years and to adapt to the vital\nissues of a planet moving inexorably into the third\nmillennium.\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me at the outset, on behalf of the\ndelegation of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, to\ncongratulate Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral on his election\nas President of the General Assembly at this session, a\nhistoric session that coincides with the fiftieth anniversary\nof the United Nations. I am confident that under his\nguidance, our session will be crowned with success.\nLet me take this opportunity also to convey our\nappreciation for the dynamic and effective activities\nundertaken by his predecessor, His Excellency Minister\nAmara Essy. We would like to express our appreciation\nalso for the perseverance shown by His Excellency Mr.\nBoutros Boutros-Ghali in serving the common cause of all\nnations for peace, national independence and\ndevelopment.\nThis session of the General Assembly is a special\noccasion for us to look back at the changes in the world\nand at the growth of the United Nations over the past 50\nyears, since the end of the Second World War. Out of\nthe tumultuous course of mankind\u2019s history in those 50\nyears, let us identify what has changed, what has not, and\nwhat cannot change. Only with such a clear vision will\nwe be able to chart our course into the twenty-first\ncentury and to find the confidence to build a United\nNations that can meet the expectations of all of us.\nWhile the first half of the twentieth century has left\nin the mind of mankind the haunting memories of two\ndreadful world wars, in the second half of this century,\ndespite the fierce local wars that have taken place \u2014 such\nas those in Indochina, Korea and Viet Nam \u2014 nations\nhave been spared the horrors of a global conflagration.\nMoreover, after several decades of an unbridled arms\nrace, the world has chosen the course of reason, striving\nfor the long-term goal of general and complete\ndisarmament, especially with regard to nuclear weapons\nand other weapons of mass destruction.\nThe recent indefinite extension of the Treaty on the\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons gave rise to much\nhope. However, the nuclear testing undertaken right\nafterwards caused disillusion in international public\nopinion and has made it imperative for all nations \u2014 first\nand foremost the nuclear-weapon States \u2014 to redouble\ntheir efforts in a fully responsible manner, so as to\n19\n\n\ncomplete the comprehensive test-ban treaty in the course of\nthe next year.\nWhile the threat of a new world war and a nuclear\nholocaust is receding, peace and security remain elusive for\nmany regions and countries beset by racial, ethnic and\nreligious conflicts, and terrorist activities that take on\ndisquieting proportions. In the intractable case of Bosnia\nand Herzegovina, a peaceful solution should be pursued,\nwithout the imposition of measures, from any quarter\nwhatsoever, that may complicate the situation further and\ncause more suffering to the multi-ethnic population of\nBosnia.\nThe past half-century can also be said to have been a\nshining chapter in the history of the struggle of peoples to\nregain their national independence, sovereignty and the\nright to be the masters of their own destinies, and to strive\nfor well-being, freedom and equality within the\ninternational community. The international community has\nbeen following very closely the peace process in the Middle\nEast and welcomes its recent progress. Only strong political\nwill and respect for the fundamental national rights of the\nPalestinian people and the legitimate interests of all the\nparties concerned can bring about lasting stability in this\nregion of the world.\nIn practice, however, the basic and universal principles\nof sovereignty and sovereign equality continue to be\nignored or violated by reason of the unequal and\nundemocratic set-up of international relations and through\nimpositions upon, and interference in, the internal affairs of\nother countries, for different reasons and with a variety of\njustifications.\nAt the end of this twentieth century, thanks to\nmankind\u2019s achievements in science and technology and in\ncommunication and production, and thanks also to the hard\nwork of all nations, our world as a whole has become more\nprosperous and more alive, with the manifold increase in\nmaterial and non-material flows and exchanges, thus\nfacilitating better mutual understanding and closer\nrelationships among nations. However, our conscience\ncannot rest easy in view of a reality that we cannot ignore:\nthe fact that one-fifth of mankind still lives in abject\npoverty, and the challenges posed by the enormous gap\nbetween the annual per capita gross national product for the\nleast developed countries \u2014 less than $200 \u2014 and that of\nadvanced industrialized countries, which is more than a\nhundred times higher. Furthermore, all nations, no matter\nwhere in the world, face global problems that threaten our\neconomic achievements and the progress made in\nenhancing the quality of life.\nNowadays, mankind has a clearer, more holistic\nawareness of development, peace and security. We\nunderstand better the close correlation and interaction\nbetween economic development and social development,\nbetween internal security and external security, and\nbetween economic, social and military security.\nAnother reality of the world today, which is of far-\nreaching significance to each nation and individual, is the\nincreasing role of international law, which binds nations\nand circumscribes and harmonizes the behaviour of States\nthrough multilateral instruments and institutions. Such a\nrole is all the more crucial in the light of the tendency to\nblur the boundaries between national and international\njurisdiction, as well as to extend the enforcement of one\ncountry\u2019s laws beyond its borders. Recently, international\nopinion has been increasingly concerned about the fact\nthat the implementation of United Nations sanctions is\nshifting towards punishment or retribution for private\npolitical motives, in contravention of the purposes\noriginally assigned by the Charter. Nor can public opinion\nremain unconcerned by the fact that sanctions in reality\naffect mainly the life and health of the innocent civilian\npopulation, and therefore cannot accept the prolongation\nof sanctions regardless of their effectiveness and\nconsequences. In view of this, international opinion\ncannot but protest the imposition of unilateral sanctions\nfor several decades, such as is the case of the embargo\nagainst Cuba. We express our sincere sympathy for the\nhardships experienced by the Cuban people and strongly\nurge that the embargo against Cuba be lifted, and that the\nrelevant resolutions of the General Assembly be promptly\nand effectively implemented.\nIn short, 50 years after the Second World War, the\nworld offers us a scene of vivid contrasts between\ncontinuity and change, between stagnation and\ndevelopment, between division and integration, especially\nthe vast and profound integration that unfolds before us\nunder the impact of the trend towards interdependence,\nregionalization and globalization. Moreover, the powerful\nvitality and steadfast determination which drive peoples\nto preserve their national traditions and cultural identities\ndemonstrate their will to safeguard from within the\ninevitable process of international integration something\nstable and lasting, which links the present of each nation\nto the roots of its traditions, and the need to affirm the\nsingularity of each society, each nation and each\n20\n\n\ncommunity, and not only of each individual. The history of\nthe past 50 years is a clear testimony thereof.\nOver the past half century, the United Nations has\nweathered the tests and trials of the cold war and of the\nimmediate post-cold-war years to endure and grow. Its\nindispensable role as a centre for harmonizing the actions\nof nation States in a world characterized by rapid and\ncomplex changes and increasing interdependence has been\nrecognized by all Members.\nAs I have mentioned, the United Nations has recorded\nsome encouraging achievements for peace and development,\nfor equality and justice. However, given the speed and\nscope of changes taking place in the world, it must be\nrecognized that the United Nations has failed to reform and\nadjust itself in keeping with the new situation and with the\ntrend of the times, and thus to address the needs of nations.\nWe are of the view that the peace-keeping operations of the\nUnited Nations must strictly observe the principle of respect\nfor independence, sovereignty and non-interference in the\ninternal affairs of States, and should go hand in hand with\nthe persevering search for a peaceful solution. The United\nNations ought to draw the lessons of the successes and\nfailures of its recent peace-keeping operations so as to\nbetter discharge the responsibility entrusted to it by the\ncommunity of its Member States. It is certain that in a few\nweeks, during the celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of\nthe United Nations, our Heads of State and Government\nwill voice the hopes that the peoples of the world place in\nour Organization. For this reason, it is imperative that we\nturn the United Nations into an effective instrument to serve\nthe common ideals and interests of mankind in the next\ncentury. The challenge for the United Nations, as it tackles\nthe burning issues of today\u2019s world, is to continue\nupholding the progressive spirit enshrined in its Charter and\nadequately to implement, with all due attention, both the\n\u201cAgenda for Peace\u201d and the \u201cAgenda for Development\u201d,\novercoming the discrepancy between the desirable and the\npossible so that the United Nations can be a true\nrepresentative \u2014 in the fullest sense of the term \u2014 of the\nexpectations and interests of its Members, in its structure\nand organization, its agenda, its mandate and its mode of\noperation. This requires that the General Assembly should\nplay an \u201cessential role\u201d as the Secretary-General reminded\nus at the opening of this session, namely that by virtue of\nthe principle of \u201cequal rights ... of nations large and small\u201d,\nit is the General Assembly that is endowed with the\ndemocratic legitimacy of our global Organization. \n\nMr. Kittikhoun (Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic),\nWe agree with the overall thrust of the draft\ndeclaration on the fiftieth anniversary of the United\nNations and believe that it is particularly important to\nreaffirm the principles of respect for independence,\nsovereignty and sovereign equality, territorial integrity and\nnon-interference in the jurisdiction and the internal affairs\nof nations, the peaceful settlement of disputes and non-\nuse of force or threat to use force. At the same time, the\npositive role that the United Nations has played and\nshould continue to play in helping nations exercise their\nright to self-determination and to development should not\nbe forgotten. The declaration should not fail to address\ntwo topical issues. One is the need for a Security Council\nthat is more effective, more representative and transparent\nin its workings, while the other is the need for adequate\nresources to enable the United Nations fully to carry out\nits mandate. Viet Nam recognizes a plain fact of everyday\nlife, which is that whoever contributes more shall be\nentitled to more rights. But conversely, whoever has more\nrights will have to show greater responsibility. Therefore,\nthe richest countries should set an example by meeting\ntheir financial obligations in full and on time, which is of\nvital significance for our Organization at this juncture. We\nparticularly agree with the stress placed by the draft\ndeclaration on poverty as the scourge visited upon billions\nof people on our planet, as well as on the human person\nas the centre of the whole development process. Those\nare only some preliminary observations.\nIn this incredibly changing world, the Asia-Pacific\nregion in general and South-East Asia in particular are\nentering a new era with profound changes and great\npromises for peaceful cooperation and dynamic\ndevelopment. Most striking is the common consciousness\nand efforts of the whole region directed towards building\na peaceful and stable environment conducive to the\ndevelopment of each country in the region and of the\nregion as a whole. As a country in the dynamic region\nand a member of the Association of South-East Asian\nNations (ASEAN), Viet Nam will make positive\ncontributions toward those common objectives.\nViet Nam\u2019s official membership in ASEAN since\nlast July, the participation of Laos and Cambodia as\nobservers and Myanmar\u2019s accession to the Bali Treaty\nhave opened up prospects for further strengthening\ncooperation throughout the region and for expanding\nASEAN into an association of all 10 countries of the\nregion. These are the foundation and components of a\nSouth-East Asia of peace, stability and prosperity.\nTogether with the other countries concerned, the ASEAN\ncountries recently held the second ASEAN Regional\n21\n\n\nForum, at which the participating countries agreed to\npromote cooperation on an equal footing among all parties,\nby taking the appropriate measures, and in the short term\nby stepping up confidence-building measures in order to\nconsolidate peace and security in the region.\nAlongside that favourable overall trend, there are\npotentially destabilizing factors in the region. The dispute\nin the Eastern Sea and other recent developments remain a\nsource of concern for countries both within and outside the\nregion. Regarding this issue, we would like to reaffirm once\nagain our position, which is that the disputes in the Eastern\nSea should be settled through peaceful negotiations in\naccordance with the principles contained in the Manila\nDeclaration adopted by ASEAN in 1992, as confirmed at\nthe recent ASEAN ministerial meeting in Brunei, and in\nconformity with international law, especially the 1982\nUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, which\nentered into force at the end of 1994. Pending a\nfundamental and lasting solution to these disputes, all\nparties concerned should maintain the status quo and refrain\nfrom any action that might further complicate the situation,\nespecially the use or threat of use of force.\nFor Viet Nam, 1995 has been a year of great historic\nsignificance. As we join the rest of the international\ncommunity in preparing for the fiftieth anniversary of the\nUnited Nations, our people are solemnly celebrating several\nother major events, especially the fiftieth anniversary of the\nproclamation of our independence. During the past half\ncentury, our people have endured tremendous human\nsacrifice and material loss in order to safeguard our national\nindependence. To rebuild and develop our homeland, we\nhave overcome innumerable tests and trials, as well as the\nextremely heavy consequences of long and fierce wars.\nThanks to the determination of the whole nation united in\nmind and in action, our reform and renewal process, now\nin its tenth year, has achieved major initial results, thus\nmaking it possible to move to a new stage of development:\nthe industrialization and modernization of our country.\nRecent years have seen the continuous development of\nour economy, with an average annual growth rate of 8.2\nper cent, an annual increase in exports of 20 per cent, and\na 40 per cent annual increase in foreign investment. The\nstandard of living is steadily improving. Economic\ndevelopment is increasingly linked with social and cultural\ndevelopment. Our objective is to build a strong and\nprosperous Viet Nam with an equitable and civilized\nsociety. Alongside our economic reforms, we have carried\nout political reforms to build a State governed by the rule\nof law, and which is of the people, by the people and for\nthe people. On the basis of our 1992 Constitution, we\nhave promulgated a series of laws, codes and legal\ndecrees in order ever more completely to ensure the rights\nand interests of all citizens, and at the same time to create\na firm legal basis for governing the country. These all-\nround achievements constitute a firm guarantee of social\nand political stability and lay the foundation needed for\nfuture sustainable development.\nAlong with reform in all aspects of social life, Viet\nNam has consistently pursued its foreign policy of broad\nopenness, the thrust of which is to diversify and\nmultilateralize its external relations in order to create a\nstable environment and external conditions conducive to\nthe task of building and defending the country, and to\nenhance Viet Nam\u2019s position on the international scene.\nTo implement this policy, Viet Nam has established\ndiplomatic relations with nearly 160 countries, including\nall the world\u2019s major Powers and leading economic and\npolitical centres. Viet Nam\u2019s accession to full membership\nof ASEAN, the signing of an agreement of cooperation\nwith the European Union, and the normalization and\nestablishment of full diplomatic relations with the United\nStates all took place in July this year. That was no\ncoincidence, but was the outcome of a whole process of\nimplementing a foreign policy inspired by a new spirit, by\nwhich Viet Nam is willing to be the friend of all nations\nin the international community, and to strive for peace,\nnational independence and development. This provides\neloquent testimony to the correctness of our foreign\npolicy and to its consonance with the trends of our times.\nAs it broadens its relations with all countries, Viet\nNam is also endeavouring consistently to improve and\nstrengthen relations with international organizations,\nincluding the international financial and monetary\ninstitutions, and is ready to participate in regional and\nglobal cooperation organizations. Following the\nnormalization of its relations with the International\nMonetary Fund, the World Bank and the Asia\nDevelopment Bank and its participation in the ASEAN\nFree Trade Area, Viet Nam is now actively preparing to\njoin the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum and\nthe World Trade Organization at an appropriate time. Viet\nNam continues to maintain close and effective\ncooperation with the United Nations and with specialized\nagencies of the United Nations system.\nThe achievements of its foreign policy provide a\nnew impetus for Viet Nam to accelerate the process of\nregional and global integration, and to participate more\n22\n\n\neffectively in global forums and institutions, with a view to\ntackling the pressing problems facing all mankind, and to\ncontributing meaningfully to the common endeavour of the\ninternational community to achieve peace, national\nindependence, friendship, cooperation among States and\ndevelopment.\nToday and in the weeks to come, from every point on\nthe horizon, peoples of the world, regardless of language,\nrace or culture, are turning to this Hall, where the\nrepresentatives of 185 countries are assembled at a historic\nmoment marking half a century of the United Nations with\nthe ardent hope and expectation that the Organization will\ntruly enter a new era, in which its own motto, \u201cUnited for\na better world\u201d can become a reality. There is no promise\nmore dear to our hearts and no commitment more solemn\nthan our determination to prepare ourselves for the common\njourney into the twenty-first century, to realize the noble\npurposes of the Charter of the United Nations for a better\nworld and for a fairer and more reasonable world order that\nwill meet the ardent hopes of the present generation and\nthat will build a sound foundation for succeeding\ngenerations.\n\n"

        "file_text": "I extend to you, Sir, my\ndelegation\u2019s felicitations on your well-deserved election\nas President of the General Assembly at its fiftieth\nsession. We have no doubt that with your experience and\nwisdom, you will add much to this historic session. We\nalso pay tribute to your predecessor, His Excellency\nMr. Amara Essy, who presided over the Assembly at its\nforty-ninth session with great distinction and wisdom.\nTo His Excellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, our\nSecretary-General, I would like to pay a special tribute\nfor all he has done for peace and the promotion of the\nUnited Nations Charter.\nTo the Republic of Palau, a new Member of our\nOrganization, I would like to say, \u201cWelcome\u201d. We look\nforward to working closely with that country.\nWe are celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of the\nfounding of our Organization. On this momentous\noccasion, as the Secretary-General aptly observed in his\nreport (A/49/1), we must resolve to\n\u201cappreciate and strengthen the accomplishments of\nthe past, to recognize and meet the challenges of the\npresent, and to design and implement a plan for the\nUnited Nations of the future.\u201d (A/49/1, para. 12)\nWe must seize this historic opportunity to forge a global\nconsensus behind development, in all its dimensions, as\nthe lasting foundation for international peace and security\nand as the greatest hope of humanity.\nPakistan has been strongly committed to the noble\nvision of the United Nations Charter ever since its\nindependence. We have continuously abided by its\n17\n\n\nprinciples. We reaffirm our faith in their timeless validity.\nPakistan will continue to extend its support and cooperation\nto the collective efforts of the world for peace.\nAfter exactly 50 years, retrospection evokes mixed\nfeelings. Yet members of our Organization have much to\ncelebrate. The decolonization process, the elimination of\napartheid, humanitarian assistance and handling of refugee\nsituations are some of the areas where the United Nations\ncan be proud of its achievements. But much remains to be\ndone.\nThe end of the cold war provided a historic\nopportunity to build a new edifice of peace and prosperity:\na system in which international relations would be\nconducted in a spirit of justice, equality and democracy;\nwhere poverty would cease to exist, through international\ncooperation for development; where human rights,\nespecially the right to self-determination, would be\npromoted and protected; and where aggression would be\neffectively and collectively challenged wherever and\nwhenever it occurred.\nRegrettably, this has not happened. Now, more than\never, it seems that the powerful countries are imposing their\nwill on the United Nations. The decisions and the\nresolutions adopted by it reflect the interests of a few rather\nthan the good of all. The provisions of collective security\nare being invoked selectively. Human rights standards are\nbeing defended more vociferously in some situations than\nin others. While in some cases aggression has been\nforcefully and decisively resisted, in others it has remained\nunchecked and even rewarded.\nJammu and Kashmir is a case in question, where the\nMuslim majority continue to be denied their right to self-\ndetermination promised to them by Security Council\nresolutions. These resolutions remain unimplemented. The\ndenial of the right to self-determination led to a massive\nuprising in the Indian-occupied Kashmir in 1989. Demand\nfor the exercise of this fundamental right was met with a\nbrutal reign of terror unleashed by the Indian occupation\nforces. It continues unabated and is being pursued with\nmalicious intensity, with devastating consequences for the\ncivilian population of this internationally recognized\ndisputed territory. In Kashmir the principles of the United\nNations Charter, international law and international morality\nhave been violated with impunity. The massive and\nwidespread human rights violations in Jammu and Kashmir\nhave been graphically documented by a large number of\ninternational human rights organizations.\nSince I stood at this rostrum a year ago, tensions\nhave further escalated in South Asia. One billion people\nof South Asia are holding their breath as threats of war\nkeep emanating from the leaders in New Delhi.\nJammu and Kashmir continues to burn. The sons and\ndaughters of Kashmir continue to be killed, maimed,\nexecuted, tortured and dishonoured. Will the new year of\nthe United Nations bring an end to the rape of Kashmir?\nWill the beginning of the next half century of the United\nNations see the implementation of its resolutions on\nKashmir?\nThe Jammu and Kashmir dispute was not brought to\nthe Security Council by Pakistan. It was India which\nmoved this dispute before the United Nations. The people\nof Kashmir are looking to this body to deliver them their\nright to self-determination, as promised to them by this\nbody, by the international community and by India and\nPakistan.\nSince I stood before the Assembly a year ago,\nhundreds of Kashmiris have been killed by the Indian\nforces. Holy places of the Muslims have been razed to the\nground by the Indian occupation forces. The holiest of the\nholy shrines, Charar-e-Sharif, was burned to ashes. The\ncity of Charar-e-Sharif was torched. Is it not ironical that\nthe great Sufi saint, Noor-ud-Din Wali, buried in the\nshrine there was a man who preached love and tolerance\nfive centuries ago to all humanity, and not just to\nMuslims? Hindus, Buddhists, Christians and Sikhs also\nseek spiritual solace at his grave. The disdainful act of\ndesecration of this symbol of peace and harmony by the\nIndian forces has not extinguished the spirit of freedom in\nKashmir.\nThe occupation forces, now numbering more than\n600,000, use torture, killings and brutality against the\npeople, against its leaders, and even against innocent\njournalists. The people of Kashmir were outraged at the\nkilling of a journalist, Mushtaq Ali, in the bomb blast at\nthe BBC office in Srinagar. The whole of Kashmir went\ninto deep mourning at this wanton killing. But India\nrefuses to look truth in the face.\nThe people of Kashmir and Pakistan are deeply\nshocked at the killing of the Norwegian tourist by the\nkidnappers of the Al-Faran Group. We join our Kashmiri\nbrothers in condemning this horrible act against an\ninnocent tourist, and we demand the release of the\nremaining four tourists. We have extended every possible\ncooperation to countries whose citizens\u2019 lives are still in\n18\n\n\ndanger, but we have a right to ask: Who are Al-Faran?\nNobody seems to have heard of this group ever before.\nThere is too much circumstantial evidence which points an\naccusing finger at New Delhi. We do not want rhetoric; we\ndo not want to score points. We want the safety and the\nfreedom of these innocent tourists. Pakistan calls for an\nindependent and impartial inquiry into the hostage-taking by\nAl-Faran, under the auspices of the United Nations, so that\nthose responsible for this act can be brought to justice.\nIndia continues to harp on the issue of elections in\nJammu and Kashmir. Let it ask the All Parties Hurriyet\nConference, the representative party of all Kashmiri\norganizations in Jammu and Kashmir and the sole voice of\nthe Kashmiri people, whether they want elections, or a\nplebiscite and the implementation of the Security Council\nresolutions.\nKashmir is an international dispute. India cannot\ninternalize it behind the garb of bilateralism. If this \u201cnon-\nprinciple\u201d was allowed to prevail as the basis for the\nsettlement of disputes, then there would be no international\nmorality left. There would be no international order, and\nthe world community could say farewell to peace. It would\nbecome the law of the jungle.\nIn the meantime, along the Line of Control in Kashmir\nour people are being killed daily and injured by cross-\nborder firing and rocketing. Access to over 80,000 of our\npeople in the Neelam Valley has been cut off by daily\nIndian firing.\nIndia claims that Pakistani militants cross into\nKashmir. In good faith and in order to ascertain the veracity\nof the Indian allegations, I wrote to the President of the\nSecurity Council last year asking for the expansion of the\nUnited Nations Military Observer Group in India and\nPakistan (UNMOGIP) on both sides of the Line of Control.\nIndia\u2019s response to this constructive proposal was a firm\n\u201cNo\u201d. Instead, it deployed 800 troops per kilometre and\nbuilt three Security Zones along the Line of Control. I ask:\nCan there be cross-border violations after such heavy\nfortifications? By what logic can they reject our proposal\nfor increasing United Nations observers? The answer is\nobvious. They want merely to score points in international\nforums. They want to build an argument against Pakistan.\nThey want to convince the world that it is not the Kashmiri\npeople who are alienated from India, but Pakistan that is\nturning a blind eye to militants crossing the Line of Control\nfrom our side.\nI ask you to ponder this Indian posture. In history\nthis has always been the language of the aggressor, of\nthose who want to maintain the status quo. I cannot\nbelieve that Indian authorities are so naive as to believe\nthat the Kashmiri uprising is foreign- inspired. Other\nPowers have also made such mistakes in the past, much\nto their dismay and ultimate discomfiture. India must\nlearn from history. The march of history has never been,\nand never will be, altered by a systematic falsification of\nfacts or a string of blatant lies. The people of Kashmir\nhave rejected the Indian occupation. No amount of\nrepression, no amount of killings, gang-rapes, torture or\nmining of villages will deter the people of Jammu and\nKashmir from winning their right to self-determination.\nThis truth is being lost on New Delhi. For our part,\nwe are prepared for dialogue. We are prepared for\nmediation by the Secretary-General or by the President of\nthe Assembly, or by any peace-loving country under any\nmodality, under any arrangement.\nWe are prepared for peace. We want conflict\nresolution. We want talks but the talks must be on the\nsubstantive issue of Jammu and Kashmir. Talks must aim\nat achieving settlement. Talks must be on the basis of a\nstructured agenda. Once the issue of Jammu and Kashmir\nis resolved, it will open the door for a solution to all\nother Indo-Pakistan disputes. But our offers of talks have\nfallen on deaf ears. India now hides behind a new\nsubterfuge that talks should be unconditional, that talks\nmust be without an agenda. We cannot accept this\nbecause during the last 23 years under the Simla\nAgreement, the two Foreign Secretaries met seven times\nwithout any result. Every time a meeting takes place the\nIndian side states that Kashmir is an integral part of India\nand not an international dispute. This is a negation of the\nUnited Nations Security Council resolutions. This is a\nnegation of the Simla Agreement, and I quote article 6 of\nthe Simla Agreement, which states,\n\u201cBoth Governments agree ... to discuss further the\nmodalities and arrangements for the establishment of\ndurable peace and of normalization of relations\u201d,\nincluding\n\u201ca final settlement of Jammu and Kashmir\u201d.\nThe Simla Agreement is fully within the framework of\nthe United Nations Charter.\n19\n\n\nThen we are told that the Security Council resolutions\nare outdated. What will the world look like if countries\nwere allowed unilaterally to reject United Nations\nresolutions, and if this deviationist stance were to become\na universal principle of international morality? Can morality\nbecome outdated? Can evil become good with time?\nInstead, India has gone on to a feverish arms race.\nWhen they exploded their nuclear bomb in 1974, we told\nthem not to push South Asia into a nuclear arms race. But\nour warnings were not heeded and now, along with its\nmassive blue-water navy, which threatens the shores of\nAfrica and Asia, they have launched into an arms race in\nSouth Asia. Their Prithvi missiles are Pakistan-specific. The\nPrithvi missile is a tension multiplier: it gives Pakistan only\nthree minutes\u2019 response time.\nWhat are they arming themselves for? Who threatens\nthem in Asia? Their leaders talk of extending the Indian\nmilitary and naval might to the shores of the Indian Ocean.\nIn this day and age this approach is downright\nanachronistic.\nDuring the Eighth Summit of the South Asian\nAssociation for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), which was\nheld in New Delhi in May this year, President Leghari\nurged Prime Minister Narasimha Rao and the Indian\nleadership not to take this fateful step. He urged the Indian\nleadership to come to the table and solve the core Kashmir\ndispute. He also warned that if India continued with this\nfeverish race for arms, and now for missiles, then Pakistan\nwould have no choice but to rethink its options within the\nMissile Technology Control Regime (MTCR).\nHaving fought three wars to defend its territory, the\npeople of Pakistan feel threatened. That is why peace is\nimportant. That is why peace is vital for Pakistan. But I\nwant to make it absolutely clear \u2014 and let there be no\ndoubt about it in anyone\u2019s mind \u2014 that the people of\nPakistan have the will to survive, and survive they will with\ndignity and honour.\nOne fifth of humanity, a billion people, live in the\nseven countries of South Asia. The world is passing us by.\nOur people are trapped in poverty, in hunger, in disease and\nunemployment. Don\u2019t our people deserve better? Don\u2019t they\ndeserve a chance? Don\u2019t six countries have a right to live\nin peace in South Asia? It is our earnest hope that those in\nNew Delhi who threaten war should look at the state of\npoverty of their own people. We hope that they have the\npolitical will to ensure the peaceful settlement of disputes,\nand there will be many peace dividends if peace comes to\nSouth Asia.\nPeace will be worth their while. Trade will flourish,\nmega- projects in the Gulf, from Iran and from Central\nAsia will bring prosperity to our peoples. I hope that\nbetter counsel will prevail in New Delhi and I hope there\nare still men of peace and vision left in India who will\nnot be the prisoners of the acrimonies of history but will\nlook to the future of a billion people.\nThe Secretary-General, in his 1995 report on the\nwork of the Organization (A/50/1), has recognized the\naggravation of relations between India and Pakistan as a\nresult of increasing incidents of violence in Jammu and\nKashmir. We would like, in particular, to facilitate the\nsearch for a lasting solution to the Kashmir dispute. We\nhope that India will also accept the United Nations\nSecretary-General\u2019s offer of good offices, as Pakistan has\ndone. We also sincerely hope that the United Nations\nGeneral Assembly will use its authority to exert pressure\non India to stop immediately the brutal violations of\nhuman rights and to implement the Security Council\nresolutions which ask for the holding of a plebiscite in\nJammu and Kashmir.\nWhat has been happening in Bosnia and\nHerzegovina for the past few years is a monumental\ntragedy. The world has witnessed a Member State of the\nUnited Nations being made victim of brutal aggression\nand its people subjected to atrocities, massive violations\nof human rights, ethnic cleansing and the abhorrent\npractice of genocide \u2014 acts which would put the horrors\nof the Second World War to shame. The killing fields of\nSrebrenica and Zepa are sadly reminiscent of Auschwitz\nand Buchenwald. Yet the international response has been\ntotally inadequate and has often come too late. The\nBosnian Muslims were left to defend themselves against\na vastly superior military machine, their hands tied by an\nunjustified arms embargo.\nPakistan strongly reiterates its firm support for the\ndemand by the Bosnian people for the lifting of the arms\nembargo. For its part, Pakistan remains strongly\ncommitted to offering every possible assistance to the\npeople and Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina. We\nmust seek credible international guarantees for the\npreservation of the unity and territorial integrity of Bosnia\nand Herzegovina.\nIf one step is taken towards peace, the world of\nIslam is prepared to take two steps more. We have taken\n20\n\n\nnote of the action taken by the North Atlantic Treaty\nOrganization (NATO) countries and of the establishment of\nthe rapid reaction force. We urge the NATO countries not\nto relent on the air strikes until the Serbian aggressors and\ndelinquents are made to pay a price for their deeds and to\nact like civilized people. Unless peace is fully restored and\na just and equitable settlement is in place, the OIC will\nreserve its right to challenge the illegal United Nations arms\nembargo on the Bosnian people.\nWe fully support the Croatian efforts to recover\nKrajina and their other territories from Serbian military\noccupation. We demand that in the settlement Srebrenica\nand Zepa be restored to their original United Nations-\ndesignated safe-area status. We also demand that Kosovo\nand Sanjak be protected from Serbian \u201cethnic cleansing\u201d.\nThe Declaration of Principles signed recently in Geneva is\nsomething we consider well-begun but only half-done.\nThere are many pitfalls, and we see many dangers in the\nimplementation of the Declaration of Principles. A lot more\nvision and courage on the part of the world community will\nbe required if the entire peace plan is to be fully\nimplemented. We hope that the United Nations, the\nEuropean Union and NATO will demonstrate the courage\nrequired to resolve the crisis in the Balkans.\nThe situation in Afghanistan makes us very sad. The\npeople of Afghanistan wait in anguish for peace to return\nto their tortured land. There appears to be no end to the\nfighting between the various groups. One and a half million\nAfghans are still in my country. They too, like us, look to\nthe United Nations and to the OIC to bring peace to their\nland.\nI should like to state here unequivocally, and with all\nthe responsibility at our command, that in no way have we\ninterfered in the internal affairs of Afghanistan. We would\nalso urge that no other country do so. We would urge other\nStates not to increase the suffering of the Afghan people by\nsupporting one group or the other. We should all support\nUnited Nations Special Representative Mahmoud Mestiri\u2019s\nmission to bring peace to Afghanistan, a peace based on\naccommodation for all factions and all groups. This peace\ncan be achieved only through mutual accommodation and\nnational reconciliation. In the last 18 months, our Mission\nhas twice been subjected to mob attacks. In the second one,\n26 of our officials were injured, including Ambassador Qazi\nHumayun, and one staffer was killed. This is most\nunfortunate. We hope that the sanctity of the Mission will\nbe respected and that the Vienna Conventions will be\nhonoured.\nFor over a decade, Pakistan supported the legitimate\nstruggle of our Afghan brothers against foreign\nintervention. Once this intervention was ended, Pakistan\npromoted accords among the Afghan parties and factions\nfor a peaceful transition from war to peace. It was as a\nconsequence of the compromise achieved in the\nIslamabad accord of May 1992 that President Rabbani\ntook office. His Government was to be a transitional one\nand was to prepare for a broad-based and popular\ngovernment representing all regions and political forces in\nAfghanistan. Unfortunately, as the Secretary- General\u2019s\nSpecial Representative, Mr. Mestiri, has clearly stated, the\nregime in Kabul did not allow the promised transition to\na representative government to take place.\nIn large measure because of this refusal to live up to\nsolemn agreements, fighting in Afghanistan has been\nendemic during the past few years. The fortunes of war\nrecently turned against President Rabbani\u2019s regime\nbecause it became increasingly unpopular with the Afghan\npeople. A regime in Kabul whose de facto legitimacy we\nhave not questioned, a regime in Kabul that today\ncontrols only 5 of about 32 provinces in Afghanistan: this\nregime has tested our patience again and again.\nThis regime chooses to punish unarmed and innocent\nstaffers and the Ambassador. It chooses to burn down our\nEmbassy and its premises. But this has not made\nPakistanis angry at the Afghan nation. It has merely made\nus sad, because this regime has forgotten the 14 years of\nthe support given and the sacrifices made by the people\nof Pakistan for their freedom. Instead, it chooses to please\nthose who destroyed their country, who killed and\nmaimed millions of Afghan men, women and children,\nwho destroyed houses, who destroyed people\u2019s lives, who\nplanted millions of land-mines across the country \u2014 a\nlarge number of which have yet to be removed. By these\nwanton acts, which go against the Vienna Conventions,\nthe Kabul regime wants to win the favour of those who\nseek to fish in the troubled waters of Afghanistan.\nThe Kabul regime seeks to survive with the help of\nmilitary support from the enemies of the Afghan nation,\nwhile it rules through a minority. It seeks to conquer\nAfghanistan through military force. This is against\nhistory. This will not happen. The regime is forgetting the\ncode of honour of the Afghan nation. While we in\nPakistan are sad at what has happened to our countrymen\nin Kabul, the chivalrous Afghan people are angered and\nincensed. We take no responsibility for what the Afghan\npeople will do to vindicate their honour. They know that\nthere never was, and never will be, interference from\n21\n\n\nPakistan. The world knows that a faltering regime always\nwants to lay its follies and its internal defeats at the\ndoorsteps of others, and for this the Afghan nation will\ndemand, and get, retribution.\nHowever, this provocation will not deter us from our\nsteadfast path of neutrality towards the Afghan people and\nthe unity of Afghanistan or from non-interference in\nAfghanistan\u2019s internal affairs or our abiding friendship and\nbrotherhood with the Afghan nation. In the meantime, we\nwould like to assure the people of Afghanistan that we shall\nstand by them in their hour of trial. We shall not abandon\nthem.\nPakistan was closely associated with the third round of\nUnited Nations-sponsored inter-Tajik talks. While I pay\ntribute to the United Nations Special Representative,\nAmbassador P\u00edriz-Ball\u00f3n, for his statesmanship, which led\nto the main elements for peace in Tajikistan, let me add\nthat our role too was to bring about national reconciliation\nin that country. We shall continue to cooperate with the\nUnited Nations to bring about complete peace in our\nfriendly neighbour Tajikistan.\nThe events in Azerbaijan, too, are a matter of deep\nconcern to us. We fully support the efforts of President\nGaider Aliyev for an equitable settlement of the Nagorny-\nKarabakh dispute; a settlement which is based on the\nremoval of aggression against Azerbaijan.\nWe fully support the Middle East peace process. We\nhope that the Palestine Liberation Organization-Israeli\naccord is implemented in letter and spirit without any\nrecourse to delay by Israel. We have supported the Jordan-\nIsraeli peace accord and favour a negotiated settlement of\nrelated issues, especially the Golan Heights, southern\nLebanon and Jerusalem.\nPakistan continues to be deeply concerned over the\nsituation in Somalia. The United Nations, along with the\nOrganization of African Unity, the Arab League and the\nOrganization of Islamic Conference must endeavour to\npromote an early political solution in that country and its\neventual reconstruction.\nIn other areas which impinge on the peace and\nstability of the world can be seen the lack of progress in\nthe field of disarmament of weapons of mass destruction,\nparticularly in the field of nuclear weapons.\nThe end of the bipolar world based on hostile camps\nhas removed the impediments to pursuing the goal of\nnuclear disarmament. Yet the goal remains elusive. It is\nincomprehensible why commitments cannot be translated\ninto reality. The agreements reached on the reduction of\nstrategic arms still fall far short of the expectations raised\nby the end of the cold war. The world should resolve to\nremove the scourge of nuclear weapons from the face of\nthis earth.\nUntil nuclear disarmament is realized, the nuclear-\nweapon States should give unconditional security\nassurances to the non-nuclear-weapon States. In this\ncontext, the Conference on Disarmament should establish\nan ad hoc committee right at the beginning of 1996 to\nnegotiate a legally binding convention on security\nassurances. The Conference on Disarmament should also\ncontinue its work on a comprehensive test-ban treaty for\nits early conclusion.\nParallel to all these global efforts, regional avenues\nshould be promoted for nuclear non-proliferation. The\nconcept of nuclear-weapon-free zones is finally being\ntranslated into reality in different parts of the world.\nUnfortunately, the proposal Pakistan made 20 years ago\nto establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in South Asia has\nnot even taken off because of the negative attitude of\ncertain States in the region. Nevertheless, Pakistan has\ncontinued to advocate efforts to eliminate the dangers of\nproliferation from South Asia. To that end, we have made\nseveral suggestions. Regrettably, they have not evoked a\npositive response from India.\nPakistan has also proposed conventional\ndisarmament at the regional and subregional levels. We\nhope that the Conference on Disarmament will deliberate\nupon this approach and evolve guidelines to bring at par\nthe weaponry and forces of the regional States.\nIn our view, the emerging role of the United Nations\nas a peace maker and a peace-keeper would greatly help\nin achieving peace and harmony at the regional as well as\nthe global levels. We believe that preventive diplomacy is\nthe cornerstone of United Nations peace efforts. Pakistan\nhas been actively cooperating and participating in a major\nway in United Nations peace-keeping efforts. It is a\nmatter of immense satisfaction that today Pakistan is the\nthird largest troop-contributing country to United Nations\npeace-keeping operations.\nPakistan believes that certain operational realities\nmust be justified for the success of such operations. We\n22\n\n\nneed a clear commitment from the international community,\naccompanied by a clear political direction and a unified\ncommand structure.\nIn order to ensure better and effective implementation\nof Security Council resolutions, there is a need for thorough\nconsultations between the members of the Council, as well\nas actual troop-contributing countries and the Secretariat, at\nall stages of any peace-keeping operation.\nAs we enter the new millennium, our collective\nobjective should be to maximize economic growth leading\ntowards the ultimate objective of human development. To\npromote peace and prosperity, it is essential to facilitate\nrather than restrain the application of modern technology\nfor economic and social development.\nAdequate official resources should be channelled to\nthose developing countries which are implementing far-\nreaching economic reforms and liberalization measures. A\nnet flow of official assistance should be directed in\nparticular towards the eradication of poverty, human and\nsocial development programmes and sustainable growth in\nthe developing countries. This is particularly true of Africa,\na continent which has been largely bypassed by the\neconomics of the twentieth century. For our part, Pakistan\nextends full support to the United Nations development\nassistance plans for Africa and for the Sahel.\nPakistan is encouraged by the conclusion of the\nUruguay Round, despite the partial and unequal response to\nthe trade interests of the developing countries. The global\neconomy is finally coming out of recession. New growth is\nlikely to be generated mostly in the developing countries,\nwhose integration into the world\u2019s financial and trading\nsystem can immensely contribute towards global output.\nThere is, therefore, a unique opportunity to create a just,\nfair, equitable and non-discriminatory global economy.\nFree markets and open economies do not imply a\ndisregard for the plight of the poor and the disadvantaged.\nThis principle must be applied as much among nations as\nwithin nations. The aim must be to improve living\nconditions for all within a dynamic economic framework.\nPakistan welcomes the constructive outcome of the recently\nheld Conference on Population and Development, the\nWorld Summit for Social Development and the Fourth\nWorld Conference on Women.\nWe in Pakistan are particularly aware of the need to\naddress the problems of the deprived segments of our\nsociety. Development initiatives, such as the Social Action\nProgramme, are being formulated within the constitutional\nframework. Our Constitution contains a number of articles\nrelated to social integration with particular reference to\nwomen and children and religious and ethnic minorities,\nas well as those living in poverty. Special efforts are\nbeing made to ensure the full participation of women in\nnation building. Pakistan\u2019s approach to employment and\npoverty eradication combines policies for national growth,\nemployment and price stabilization with programmes that\ntarget the poor and the vulnerable.\nPakistan would like to reiterate the importance it has\nalways attached to the reform of the United Nations.\nPakistan supports the reaffirmation made by the Non-\nAligned Movement that both the reform and expansion\naspects of the Security Council should take into account\nthe principles of the sovereign equality of States and\nequitable geographical distribution, as well as the need for\ntransparency, accountability and democratization in the\nworking methods and procedures of the Security Council.\nPakistan remains strongly opposed to centres of privilege\nwithin the United Nations system. These are\nanachronistic, anti-democratic and contrary to the\nprinciple of sovereign equality.\nIn conclusion, the challenges that Member States of\nthe United Nations confront are indeed forbidding. Yet\nthe opportunities for genuine peace and universal\nprosperity are most promising. With good will and\ncooperation, all Member States can make significant\nprogress at this historic session towards the vision of\npeace, progress and human solidarity envisaged in the\nCharter of the United Nations. This is an extraordinary\nmoment of opportunity. The decisions we take today will\ndetermine whether the new era will be one of hope and\nprosperity or one of despair and deprivation. The choices\nto build a peaceful world are therefore entirely in our own\nhands.\n\n"

        "file_text": "We\nare meeting on the eve of the fiftieth anniversary of the\nUnited Nations in order to assess, as we do each year, the\nprogress made by our Organization, an institution which\nwas built to uphold peace and solidarity among men.\nTo judge by its agenda, this session very much\nresembles past sessions, but clearly this year\u2019s session has\na much deeper meaning, because it marks the passing of\n50 years for the Organization, 50 years during which the\ncommon destiny of diverse peoples has been consolidated\nand advanced, despite many challenges and perils.\nIt is significant on the eve of this fiftieth anniversary\nto see the representative of an ancient European nation\npresiding over the work of the fiftieth session. Indeed, the\ncontinent to which Portugal belongs, with its historic role,\nhas always been a major actor in the mechanisms of\ninternational relations. The election of a President from\nPortugal testifies to unanimous recognition by the\ninternational community and is also a tribute to the\nPresident\u2019s talent and great diplomatic abilities.\nI take this opportunity to address our warm\ncongratulations to the President\u2019s predecessor, our brother\nand friend, Amara Essy, of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, who so ably\nand with great dedication guided the work of the forty-\nninth session.\nIt is also significant that this symbolic session is\ntaking place during the mandate of Mr. Boutros Boutros-\nGhali, elected some three years ago to head this\nOrganization. Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali is also known as\none of the skilled negotiators who, through their foresight\nand diplomatic talent, have cleared the way for peace in\nthe Middle East. Today, he is working tirelessly in the\nnoble and challenging mission of having the United\nNations live up to its noble ideals, its inviolable principles\nand its central purposes.\nThe Republic of Mali became a Member of the\nUnited Nations 35 years ago, on 28 September 1960, only\nsix days after its accession to national and international\nsovereignty on 22 September 1960.\nMali, together with some 30 other African States,\nthus expanded the family of independent and free nations,\nbringing to the United Nations the vitality, humanism and\ngenerosity of the peoples of Africa.\nThe international personality of Mali \u2014 a\npersonality that has been forged through the centuries \u2014\nis based first of all on the ability of its people to live in\nharmony with their neighbours and on Mali\u2019s openness to\nthe world, its sense of solidarity and its steadfast\ncommitment to defending the values of mankind.\nThe Republic of Mali will continue to be dedicated\nto that vocation despite the set-backs and\nmisunderstandings that are inherent in contacts between\ndiverse cultures and traditions because we have the firm\nconviction that ethnic and cultural diversity constitute a\nsource of mutual enrichment, and a powerful stimulant to\neconomic, social and cultural progress.\n40\n\n\nIndeed, by its geographical position, Mali is at the\ncrossroads between northern Africa and sub-Saharan Africa.\nIt is a nation enriched by centuries of playing the role of a\nmelting-pot of diverse cultures.\nToday, fortunately, Mali lives in an atmosphere of\ngood will, ethnic pluralism, religious pluralism, political\npluralism, social and cultural pluralism.\nThe national problem in the northern part of our\ncountry has been making news because of partisan,\nunfounded allegations broadcast across the world by lobbies\nwhose sole objective is to destabilize young States. The\ncrisis that shook the northern part of Mali by its murderous\nand destructive character is one of the harshest tests that\nmy country has experienced. With the restoration and\nconsolidation of peace and the return of Malian refugees on\na massive scale, the feelings of rejection of the State, noted\nwith the blockages and ensuing violent reactions, have\nbecome an anachronism in a State that is founded on the\nrule of law, a State where neither the language of arms nor\nthat of any other form of violence is admissible as a form\nof expression of the right to representation.\nThe successful meeting in Timbuktu between the\nGovernment and the development partners in northern Mali\nfrom 15 to 18 July 1995, is not only a symbol of exemplary\ninternational solidarity but provided an opportunity for\ninternational opinion to take note of the firm will of all\nsectors of Malian society to tackle, first and foremost, the\ntasks of development.\nBorn after a painful confinement on 26 March 1991,\nthe date when a popular revolution triumphed, democracy\nhas become a permanent and ever-present fact in the daily\nlife of the people of Mali, who have had to pay a heavy\nprice to achieve it.\nThe democratic revolution which took place four years\nago in Mali is a part of a general movement throughout the\nworld to knock down the fortresses of oppression and\nalienation of peoples. It gave rise to a young democratic\nState which, despite the shortcomings inherent in any\nhuman undertaking, does represent a successful example of\nthe rapid construction of a State built on the rule of law.\nConcerned with consolidating this democratic process,\nthe Government of Mali initiated, and successfully carried\nout a year ago in the framework of a search for a general\nconsensus on all of the problems of the nation, wide\nregional conferences followed by a national conference.\nThis forum allowed all of the forces of the nation to debate\nin a transparent context all of the concerns of the people\nand enabled the governors and the governed to develop\nconsensual solutions to face the challenges relating to the\nfuture of the nation and the development of the country.\nMay I emphasize that democratic Mali has made it\na point of honour to respect human rights and the rights\nof peoples. Thus a distinguished panel met on 10\nDecember 1994, the anniversary of the Universal\nDeclaration on Human Rights, bringing together noted\ninternational jurists who, in a completely transparent\ncontext, held public hearings with the Government of\nMali on its human rights management. This was a bold\nexercise which set a valuable example and enabled us to\ndemonstrate that respect for human rights and the\nestablishment of a State based on the rule of law have\nnow become a reality in Mali.\nIn Mali, as in many countries, history accelerated at\na dizzying pace towards the end of the 1980s.\nThe fall of the Berlin Wall was a symbol of the end\nof the division of the world into two rival ideological and\nmilitary blocs. This foreshadowed fundamental and\nirreversible changes in international relations and led to a\nnew thinking on relations of force between great and\nmid-sized Powers.\nThe end of this bipolar world was expected to make\nthe risk of a world war disappear. Mankind hoped to see\nthe realization of its legitimate aspirations to peace and\nsecurity. That hope quickly waned when we realized that\nthe period following the fall of the Berlin Wall became a\nperiod of heart-rending conflicts throughout the world.\nWe have been seeing a terrible cycle of violence and\ndestruction shaking the very foundations of the unity,\nterritorial integrity and sovereignty of many countries.\nAfrica, it is said, is a land of fire on the belly of the\nworld. It remains a suffering continent. It carries within\nit deep divisions and we see unbearable images of\nendless lines of refugees fleeing from their own country.\nThe problem of refugees remains a tragedy, one which\nthe international community must rapidly face and\nresolve.\nThe inter-ethnic massacres in Burundi and Rwanda\nwhich led hundreds of thousands of victims to flee their\nhomes are powerful challenges to human conscience and\nmorality.\n41\n\n\nThe situation in Rwanda calls for a constant effort on\nthe part of the United Nations to restore peace and enable\nhundreds of thousands of refugees to return undisturbed to\ntheir homes.\nThe tragedy of Rwanda, which does dishonour to the\nhuman race, demands for that reason that the international\ncommunity seek a way to implement solutions to ensure\nthat that country shall achieve harmonious and definitive\ninter-ethnic coexistence. Hence, Mali, which has a military\ncontingent in Rwanda, suggests that Rwanda should receive\nsubstantial assistance from the international community.\nAmong the armed conflicts that afflict our continent is\nthat of Somalia. In that country, the situation remains\nchaotic as a result of the intransigence and ambition of the\nwarlords. The States of that region have already made\nmajor efforts in the search for peace and we pay tribute to\nthem. They should, with the assistance of the international\ncommunity of course, redouble their efforts in order to\nachieve solutions acceptable to all the parties.\nShould they succeed, the efforts under way in Liberia\ncould set an example for the settlement of local conflicts\nthrough subregional initiatives. Since the 19 August signing\nof the Abuja agreement by the parties to the conflict, a\ntransitional Government of National Union has been\nestablished in the capital, Monrovia, with a view to holding\nfree and fair elections: a sure sign of the return of peace to\nLiberia.\nWith regard to crisis-settlement in Africa, Angola\nprovides a source of great satisfaction with the signing of\nthe Lusaka Protocol of 20 November 1994, and especially\nwith the meetings at Lusaka and at Cape Town between\nPresident Jos\u00e9 Eduardo dos Santos and Mr. Jonas Savimbi.\nThat impetus towards peace is being consolidated with the\nparticipation of the Uni\u00e3o Nacional para a Independ\u00eancia\nTotal de Angola (UNITA) in the exercise of power. I take\nthis opportunity to offer warm congratulations to all the\nAfrican Heads of State and to the Secretary-General and his\nSpecial Representative on their remarkable contributions to\nthe restoration of peace in Angola.\nMali also follows with interest the question of Western\nSahara; we sincerely hope that the organization and\nupcoming holding of a referendum on self-determination\nwill lead to permanent peace in this north-western part of\nour continent.\nAs the President of the Republic of Mali, Mr. Alpha\nOumar Konar\u00e9, has always stressed, Mali earnestly\nencourages the creation of an African-run central\nmachinery to prevent, manage and settle conflicts in\nAfrica. We invite the international community to support\nthis initiative. The world must understand that the\nprevention of conflicts costs mankind less than dealing\nwith their consequences. The Organization of African\nUnity (OAU) and the United Nations must grow\nincreasingly involved in anticipating conflicts and less\ndependent on seeking remedies after the illness has taken\nhold.\nA major political development of the 1990s has\ncertainly been the gradual return of peace to the Middle\nEast with the signing of the Israeli-Palestinian agreement\nin 1993. We earnestly hope that talks on the Golan\nbetween Israel and Syria and the new agreement on\nextending Palestinian autonomy to the West Bank will put\nthe final seal on a comprehensive peace in the region. In\nthe Middle East as elsewhere in the world, Mali continues\nto make its modest contribution to the quest for\ninternational peace and security.\nWithin the United Nations, the Non-Aligned\nMovement, the OAU and all other regional and\nsubregional groups, my country quickly saw the need for\na new, broader vision of international relations, the only\ncredible alternative to the division of the world into two\nrival blocs, whose bitter competition could have led\nmankind into catastrophe. The end of the bipolar world\nconfirms the correctness and relevance of that political\nperception. That is why, consistent with our convictions,\nwe think that for developing countries the United Nations\nremains the most appropriate framework to plumb the true\naspirations of mankind: the inevitable needs of\ndevelopment and the establishment of relations of greater\nsolidarity between countries of the North and of the\nSouth. We must understand that growing poverty and\ndestitution are at the root of violence and armed conflict.\nHence, development questions remain in the\nforefront of the concerns of all countries. Today,\neconomic performance is a criterion for assessing the\npower of a State in the community of nations. Here,\nunfortunately, Africa remains on the sidelines. Indeed,\ndespite the resumption early last year of world economic\ngrowth after several years of stagnation, the situation of\nAfrica, resulting from its marginalization, continues to be\nof great concern.\nThe efforts of Africa\u2019s developing countries through\neconomic reform, structural adjustment and\nencouragement of the private sector have been wiped out\n42\n\n\nby fluctuations in commodity prices and by excessive costs\nof debt service. At the same time, direct foreign investment\nin the continent remains weak. Moreover, Africa\u2019s\nburdensome debt is constantly growing, now consuming\n25 per cent of our export earnings. The tragedy of this\nsituation lies in its concurrence with a resurgence of natural\ndisasters and the persistence or exacerbation of illnesses\nsuch as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and,\nespecially, malaria.\n\u201cAn Agenda for Development\u201d recognizes the right of\ndeveloping countries \u2014 especially the least developed\ncountries \u2014 to development; it must reorient the objectives\nand priorities of the United Nations system towards\nsocio-economic programmes and activities aimed at\neliminating poverty and developing human resources\nthrough education, training, social integration and the\ncreation of productive jobs.\nUnfortunately, the United Nations New Agenda for the\nDevelopment of Africa in the 1990s remains no more than\na devout wish. The only initiative under that programme \u2014\nthe establishment of a diversification fund for African\ncommodities \u2014 has not succeeded owing to the clear\nreticence of some developed countries. This proves, if proof\nwere needed, the scant interest in Africa\u2019s legitimate claims\nfor reinvigorating the continent\u2019s growth and development.\nInternational trade relations have been marked by the\nconclusion of the Uruguay Round of negotiations and the\nestablishment of the World Trade Organization. Developing\ncountries expect complete implementation of the Final Act\nof the Uruguay Round, especially with respect to\ncompensatory mechanisms for the least developed countries,\nfor net food importers and for those which will experience\nnegative effects from the elimination of the generalized\nsystem of preferences.\nAccording to concurring estimates by the Organization\nfor Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and\nthe United Nations Conference on Trade and Development\n(UNCTAD), the overall result of the eighth negotiating\ncycle will benefit the industrialized countries only. To take\nthe example of Africa, OECD studies project losses\nexceeding $2 billion by the year 2002. In this connection,\nthe World Trade Organization should offer bold decisions\nand recommendations in favour of Africa.\nEnvironmental questions are of major concern, for the\nvery survival of mankind depends on a balanced ecology.\nWe fervently hope that the decisions and recommendations\nof the United Nations Conference on Environment and\nDevelopment will be quickly implemented in order to\nsave our planet from dangerous, fatal deterioration. My\ncountry, which has experienced the effects of drought and\ndesertification and which must still address their\nconsequences, attaches great value to the United Nations\nConvention to Combat Desertification in Those Countries\nExperiencing Serious Drought and/or Desertification,\nParticularly in Africa, concluded at Paris on\n17 June 1994.\nAmong the priority challenges facing the\ninternational community are social questions, including\noverpopulation, the production, trafficking and use of\ndrugs, unemployment, violence, social disintegration and\nthe role of women in economic and social development.\nWe are convinced that the International Conference\non Population and Development, held at Cairo, marked\nthe beginning of a new process with respect to population\nand development strategy. Likewise, the recommendations\nof the World Summit for Social Development, held last\nMarch at Copenhagen, should help ease the fate of the\nmost severely disadvantaged. The Fourth World\nConference on Women, held at Beijing from 4 to\n15 September 1995, constituted a praiseworthy concrete\ninitiative to take true account of the role of women in\neconomic and social activities.\nLike most other African States, Mali remains a poor\ncountry faced with major problems \u2014 structural and\nrelated to our circumstances \u2014 of economic development.\nThe implementation of our programme of action for the\n1990s is founded on strategies scrupulously based on\nagreements with the Bretton Woods institutions on\neconomic and financial policies for the decade. Besides\nstemming from our national will, our country\u2019s basic\nguidelines are in perfect keeping with a strategy for\nsustainable development and with the United Nations\nProgramme of Action for the Least Developed Countries\nfor the 1990s.\nThe Republic of Mali is working tirelessly to resume\ndialogue on strengthening international economic\ncooperation for development through partnership. In Mali\nthis has been reflected in round tables with our\ndevelopment partners in key sectors of the national\neconomy.\nOn population policy, our country\u2019s activities include\nthe establishment of a decentralized institutional\ncoordinating machinery for the implementation of\npopulation policy throughout the country, and work in\n43\n\n\nvarious areas of economic and social development.\nMoreover, the United Nations Population Fund programme\nwith Mali has been adapted to the content and policies of\nthe Programme of Action adopted at the International\nConference on Population and Development.\nWe in Mali think that the implementation of these\nvarious United Nations programmes and activities, based\nfirst and foremost on an increasingly sustained national\neffort, requires more vigorous mobilization of both\nmultilateral and bilateral assistance. Thus, it is increasingly\nurgent for rich and industrialized countries to provide the\nUnited Nations and its specialized agencies with the\nresources they need to properly implement the various plans\nand programmes of action adopted since the beginning of\nthe 1990s. That is the only way in which the twenty-first\ncentury can see a widespread economic takeoff and shared\nprosperity for all.\nThe Republic of Mali is unreservedly committed to\nmore open international cooperation based on solidarity.\nStronger still is our readiness to work towards economic\nintegration within Africa, most of whose States cannot\nachieve sustainable and balanced development on their own.\nWorking through regional groupings, African countries\nmust carry out an economic policy of complementarity with\nrespect to their national production, and must limit all\ncompetition that is harmful and that gives rise to the serious\nproblem of negative resource flows. These economic\nentities, established by interdependent States, must enjoy all\nnecessary support from development partners.\nThe United Nations, born in the wake of the greatest\ntrauma mankind has ever known, set as its goal the building\nof a new world through law. A powerful mechanism in the\nservice of peace, solidarity and development had been\ncreated. Never before has the world produced such an\nimpressive arsenal of texts, conventions, declarations and\nprogrammes of action, all aimed at defining the rules of\ninternational conduct, preventing war and conflict,\nguaranteeing peaceful coexistence and promoting\ndevelopment. With the United Nations, a new international\nethic was born. The victorious Powers of the Second World\nWar, which retain the formidable right of veto, had a moral\nduty to make that ethic a permanent one.\nHaving been conceived through relationships of force,\nthe United Nations unfortunately grew fragile owing to bloc\nand Power rivalries. Hence, the Security Council, which is\nnone the less the main body responsible for the\nmaintenance of international peace and security, was often\nparalysed in carrying out its basic mandate. In the course of\nthis half-century, several serious conflicts nearly led to a\nthird world confrontation. While the world has seen a\nperiod of non-war at the global level, people themselves\nhave been afflicted by the balance of terror imposed by\nthe nuclear Powers.\nThe new international political context that has\nprevailed since the end of the 1980s is increasingly fertile\nground for an international consensus favouring a needed\nrehabilitation of the United Nations and a restoration of\nits authority in carrying out its basic mandates. There\nremains an urgent need to undertake the restructuring and\nrevitalization of United Nations structures to make them\nmore effective: to take more rapid, fairer decisions and to\nbe better able to monitor, respond and sanction wherever\nand whenever necessary in the interests of the\ninternational community.\nThat, indeed, is the mission of the United Nations,\nwhich has established peace-keeping operations since\n1948. It is the duty of all States to provide these peace-\nkeeping operations with sufficient human and material\nresources, so that no one can doubt the Organization\u2019s\ncredibility.\nWherever they are deployed, such operations must\nalso face serious attacks on human rights and the rights of\npeoples. In that connection, the tragic situation in Bosnia\nand Herzegovina merits the full attention of the General\nAssembly. In accordance with United Nations resolutions,\nthe international community must restore the sovereignty\nof the Bosnian people and the territorial integrity of their\nRepublic. The delegation of Mali, which also endorses the\nrelevant resolutions of the Organization of the Islamic\nConference, considers that the challenge to the\ninternational community in this former Yugoslav republic\nmust be addressed with determination to stop it from\nbecoming a dangerous precedent in international relations.\nA world based on law must be supported by the\nideal of a world of justice. The need to provide\nassistance, so often invoked by the United Nations and by\nregional organizations, has relativized the principle of\nnon-interference in the internal affairs of a State when the\ninternational community finds in that State flagrant\nviolations of human rights and the rights of peoples.\nThe United Nations has thus carried out an act of\njustice and law in reestablishing republican institutions in\nHaiti. It is also in the name of law and justice that Mali\ncalls for the lifting of international sanctions against\nLibya and Iraq, whose peoples want nothing more than\n44\n\n\nhappiness, well-being and peace. Maintaining these\nsanctions, which affect only the Libyan and Iraqi peoples,\nruns frankly counter to morality and to our duty to assist\nand show solidarity with those peoples.\nThe twentieth century will have been a century of\nenormous progress in all spheres, in the course of which\nmankind will have demonstrated its impressive creative\ncapacity. It is an important symbol that it was during this\ncentury, just a few months ago, that the international\ncommunity reaffirmed its determination to ban forever the\nproliferation and use of nuclear weapons by the indefinite\nextension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\nWeapons (NPT). The rejection of the nuclear weapon marks\nan irreversible choice by the world\u2019s peoples: in favour of\npeace and development.\nIt is surprising that nuclear-weapon States have not\nunderstood the extraordinary trust that the rest of the\ninternational community has shown in them by its\noverwhelming accession to the Treaty on the\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons; that trust requires\nresponsibility on the part of nuclear-weapon States. Those\nStates must meet the challenge of peace by putting a\ncomplete and immediate end to real and simulated testing\nand by gradually destroying their nuclear arsenals.\nAs we come to the end of the second millennium, we\nsee a world-wide movement for democracy and freedom.\nThe Organization has everywhere encouraged the quest for\njustice and the free expression of peoples. To consolidate\nits gains and to become permanent, this vast movement\nmust be accompanied by the democratization of\ninternational relations. But unfortunately, that\ndemocratization is late in coming. The President of the\nRepublic of Mali has described the situation in this way:\n\u201cPresent inequalities among individuals, among\ncommunities and among States unmistakably raise the\nquestion of justice, linked at the national level with\norder and morality ... The world is composed of\nongoing disparities, which give rise to conflict and\nviolence. We must all understand the peril we incur by\nfailing to reorder present structures that are\nunfavourable to the less well off and that benefit the\nmore powerful. We need a world of greater solidarity;\na less selfish and more humane world\u201d.\nIt is, indeed, sad to note that international relations\ncontinue to be governed from the standpoint of carving the\nworld up into spheres of influence and spheres of interests,\neven though new political and economic changes in\ndeveloping countries demand new behaviour by our\ndevelopment partners, specifically the industrialized\ncountries. It is increasingly clear that on the whole\ninternational cooperation is being fueled by economic\ncriteria alone, to the detriment of the values of solidarity\nand justice. Yet the challenges facing mankind are\ncommon challenges. They include environmental\ndegradation, pollution, toxic waste, sickness, hunger,\npoverty and malnutrition. The balance of the planet and\nthe survival of mankind depend on the collective solutions\nwe find to these serious problems.\nIt cannot be overstressed that only international\nrelations based on solidarity, fairness and justice can\nenable us to face the challenge; and these are within our\ngrasp. The maintenance of peace in the coming\nmillennium will depend on the international community\u2019s\nability to foster development for all. Hence, it is urgent to\nrestore the values of solidarity, justice and democracy in\ninternational relations in order to save succeeding\ngenerations.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, I should like to say first how\npleased France is to see you personally presiding over the\nwork of the General Assembly. Beyond your personal\nmerits, which I acknowledge with pleasure, your election\nunderscores the important contribution to the activities of\nthe Organization of Portugal, a member of the European\nUnion with which France feels particularly close.\nThe United Nations is 50 years old. As the Heads of\nState and Government of the European Union solemnly\nemphasized in Cannes last June, the collective work since\nthe Second World War has been considerable. The\nEuropean Council on that occasion paid tribute to the\nmajor contribution of the United Nations to this collective\nwork and gave some examples: decolonization, the\nmaintenance of international peace and security,\ndisarmament, development, humanitarian aid and, of\ncourse, the protection of human rights.\nBut the successes of the Organization do not belong\nsolely to history. This year has shown the vitality of the\nUnited Nations. In Copenhagen, the social dimension of\ndevelopment, the struggle against exclusion and for\nproductive employment, which are both major challenges\nfor all our societies, are now within the domain of our\nOrganization. In Beijing, the principle of strict equality\nbetween men and women and the right of women to\ndecide freely about their lives in all matters have finally\nbeen endorsed once and for all as universal values. In\nNew York, the United Nations has begun preparatory\nwork towards the establishment of a world criminal court.\nThis project signals decisive progress for international\nhumanitarian law.\nIn Vienna, at this very moment, a conference on the\nscourge of inhumane weapons is being held. France is\nworking in particular to eradicate the scourge of the\nspread of anti-personnel mines. In 1993, it decided upon\na unilateral moratorium on the export of these mines.\nNow the time has come to go one step farther.\nAccordingly, I wish to confirm that France has decided to\nadopt a unilateral moratorium on the production of all\ncategories of anti-personnel mines. It is therefore\n12\n\n\nimposing upon itself a ban on the manufacture of such\nweapons. France also pledges from this point on to destroy\ngradually its stock of anti-personnel mines. I call on all\nMember States to join with us and do the same thing.\nThis year has also been marked by the success of the\nNew York Review and Extension Conference of the States\nparties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\nWeapons. This success was a major step towards\ndisarmament. France proposes that this coming year should\nbe a time for further progress in this domain: disarmament\nshould be our common goal and it should encompass all\naspects of disarmament. France calls upon the States that\nhave not yet adhered to this Treaty to do so without further\ndelay. The struggle against the proliferation of nuclear\nweapons must be universal. I suggest that all the States\nwhich have already signed this Treaty multiply concerted\nefforts to persuade the States which have not yet signed to\njoin them.\nIn addition, it is important to follow through on the\nnew objectives decided by the review Conference of the\nNon-Proliferation Treaty in May. Among these, the most\nimportant is the conclusion, no later than 1996, of the\ncomprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty now being negotiated\nin Geneva. The President of the French Republic,\nMr. Jacques Chirac, most solemnly reaffirmed on 13 June\n1995 France\u2019s determination to achieve this goal and to\nensure that the ban is total. France is pleased that other\nnuclear Powers have in turn made the same commitment.\nIt calls on all nuclear Powers to ensure, together with all\nthe Member States of the Organization, that this pledge is\nduly confirmed in the text of the future treaty and that the\nnegotiation of the treaty is completed before the autumn of\n1996.\nI take this opportunity to recall the reasons that led\nFrance to complete the programme of nuclear tests that was\ntemporarily suspended in 1992. The final series of tests\nnow under way has no other purpose than to enable us to\nsign the treaty banning nuclear tests definitively. There\nwere some who imagined and others who wished to make\nbelieve that we might reconsider such a decision. This will\nnot happen. Once again I repeat, this is a final test series,\nlimited to what is strictly necessary and held under\nconditions that have been proved to be harmless. It will\nenable us to adhere as early as possible to the future treaty\nbanning tests definitively.\nThe disarmament effort must of course be directed\ntowards reducing existing stockpiles of nuclear weapons.\nSubstantial progress has been achieved over the past few\nyears with the destruction of a significant number of\nwarheads by the two main Powers. I would recall that\nFrance for its part, although it has never contributed to\nnuclear overarmament, reduced the nuclear warheads it\nhad deployed by 15 per cent between 1991 and 1995.\nDisarmament, however, does not apply solely to\nnuclear weapons. With regard to chemical weapons, I call\nupon all the Member States to ratify, or for those which\nhave not yet done so to adhere to, the 1992 Convention\nbanning chemical weapons. I regret that France is the\nonly permanent member of the Security Council that has\nratified this Convention. I hope that the other permanent\nmembers will do so in the coming months.\nWe must continue the effort to reduce conventional\nforces in Europe. France took its full part in the\nagreement on conventional force reductions in Europe. It\nproposes that the conference which will be held in May\n1996 to examine the implementation of this agreement\nshould focus on compliance by all States with a treaty\nthat is the keystone of security in Europe. This conference\nshould also be the occasion for further progress.\nThere remains the highly sensitive issue of the\nConvention banning biological weapons. A serious\nverification system has to be set up. I hope that the\nworking group responsible for this matter in Geneva\nquickly establishes such a system.\nMy country cannot accept the argument put forward\nby some that the Organization has failed in its task. We\nreject the accusations of passivity and helplessness that\nare sometimes made against it. Nevertheless, we cannot\nhide the fact that the celebration of the fiftieth anniversary\nwill not be as joyful and as optimistic as we would have\nliked. The image of the Organization in public opinion is\nconfused, even negative at times. We should try together\nand with a clear head to identify the reasons for such a\nsituation. I am convinced they have nothing to do with\nany disaffection with the Organization. Never have the\naspirations of our peoples, especially the youth of the\nworld, so matched the objectives of the Charter: peace\nand disarmament, environmental protection, solidarity\nwith the very poor, aid to those who suffer, the promotion\nof democracy, of liberty and basic human rights, and the\ncollective struggle against the major scourges of the end\nof the century, namely drugs, terrorism and AIDS. In the\nlast few years, we have witnessed the emergence of a\nbody of common values on a world scale. These are the\nvalues which the United Nations, like France, upholds;\nthey are the values of peace.\n13\n\n\nIn Europe we built with our neighbours a Community\nand then a European Union, and in doing so we turned a\npage of a history that had so often led us to confrontation\nwith each other. Since 1945 Europe has known a period of\nunparalleled peace. The European Union is on the verge of\nbeing enlarged again. France warmly welcomes the\nforthcoming membership of its neighbours in Central,\nEastern and Mediterranean Europe, and will do everything\nto make it a great success. In this way, the unity of our\ncontinent is gradually being organized.\nThe extension of the boundaries of the European\nUnion does not lead it to close in on itself. Quite the\ncontrary, Europe is opening up to nearby neighbours from\nthe South, as the Euro-Mediterranean Conference in\nBarcelona will demonstrate. I should like to emphasize the\nfundamental importance of that Conference. Europe also\nwants to develop its relations with Asia; in this regard, the\nfirst Europe-Asia Summit, scheduled for March 1996, will\nbe a clear illustration. Lastly, Europe is deepening its\npartnership with Russia as well as enhancing its close ties\nwith the United States and other partners.\nI would like to insist on the fact that the European\nUnion, under the impetus of the French presidency, has\nconfirmed its privileged relationship with the African,\nCaribbean and Pacific countries in the context of the Lom\u00e9\nConvention and its special place in North-South relations as\nthe leading donor of development assistance.\nIn all those areas, Europe has set the example.\nThese values of peace are also at work in the Middle\nEast. France welcomes the important results that have\nalready been achieved under the peace process. I am\nthinking of the Declaration of Principles of 13 September\n1993 and the Jordanian-Israeli peace treaty of 26 October\n1994. But, above all, I am pleased to see that the principles\nagreed upon in Oslo have at last borne fruit with the long-\nawaited initialling of the interim agreement this Sunday.\nWith this, a major turning-point, manifested by the\ndeclaration of principles, has been given concrete form. The\nIsraeli-Palestinian peace process is now irreversible. I also\nhope that the talks between Israel and Syria will soon\nresume and that negotiations will start between Israel and\nLebanon so that a just and lasting peace, in accordance with\nSecurity Council resolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973) and\n425 (1978), be guaranteed throughout the region.\nAs the French President, Mr. Jacques Chirac, stated at\nthe celebration of the fiftieth anniversary at Geneva, the\nworld needs the United Nations. And it knows it, as proved\nby the increasing number of tasks Member States have\nentrusted to the Organization.\nTherefore, today\u2019s doubts have another origin. I see\ntwo major causes. First, the United Nations is not shown\nsufficient respect, probably because of a lack of political\nwill and resources. Secondly, the Organization has yet to\ndemonstrate its ability to reform itself.\nLet me speak of respect first. One will never be able\nlay sufficient stress on the devastating effect of the sight\nof the Blue Berets of the United Nations Protection Force\n(UNPROFOR) held hostage last spring, in chains and\nhumiliated in their dignity as men and soldiers. In\nSomalia, in Rwanda prior to Operation Turquoise, in the\nformer Yugoslavia since the outbreak of the conflict, the\nsoldiers of peace had already found themselves in\nsituations that the United Nations accepted but that no\nMember State would ever have tolerated. It is not\nsurprising that the image of the Organization has thereby\nsuffered.\nI want to make myself clear. It is not a matter of\nquestioning the enormous work that has been\naccomplished by the United Nations peace-keeping forces\nsince the end of the cold war: Namibia, Cambodia,\nMozambique, El Salvador and Haiti owe to those forces\nprogress that would have been impossible without the\nUnited Nations. In Somalia, the United Nations saved\nthousands of lives. Its intervention in the countries of the\nformer Yugoslavia made it possible to prevent the war\nfrom spreading to Macedonia, to contain and dampen the\nconflict within central Bosnia and Croatia, and, above all,\nto ensure the survival of the populations in certain safe\nareas, in Sarajevo in particular, for three years. However,\nwe have been helpless witnesses to unacceptable\nsuffering, to shameful operations of so-called \u201cethnic\ncleansing\u201d and to crimes against humanity, which the\ninternational community was unable to prevent and before\nwhich it remained passive.\nThese tragic events have shown the dangers of\nmixing humanitarian and military missions and the risks\nincurred when the mission conferred by the United\nNations is lacking in clarity. The Organization needs to\nmake itself respected when it intervenes in a conflict. Last\nspring, France proposed to its partners that the time to\nreact had come at last. It suggested a change in attitude\nand policy, with the formation of a powerfully armed\nRapid Reaction Force. We have since begun, in liaison\nwith the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO),\ndecisive action to lift the siege of Sarajevo. This has\n14\n\n\nenabled the United Nations to recover the respect of all\nparties.\nThis strengthening of the United Nations capacities for\naction has no other objective than to place force at the\nservice of law. Only a political solution can truly settle the\nconflicts brought about by the dissolution of the former\nYugoslavia.\nThat is why France, together with its partners in the\nEuropean Union and within the Contact Group, has taken\na clear position in favour of a settlement based on two\nmain principles, namely, respect for international law and\nthe support of the settlement by all the populations\nconcerned.\nRespect for international law entails a rejection of any\nsolution which, imposed by force, would mean breaking\nwith the founding principles of our Organization. Bosnia\nand Herzegovina is a recognized State and a Member of the\nUnited Nations. Its territorial integrity and sovereignty must\nbe preserved. There is nothing to discuss or negotiate on\nthose two matters.\nThose who have chosen to break the law and who\nhave committed the crimes of which we are all aware will\nbe held responsible individually. The International Criminal\nTribunal, whose creation was proposed by France in 1992,\nmust fully exert its jurisdiction.\nIt is also important that all the citizens of Bosnia and\nHerzegovina should be able to assert their specific character\nthrough representative entities. Let each entity have direct\nmanagement of its own affairs and even be able to maintain\nspecial relations with States whose populations share the\nsame affinities. All this is legitimate so long as the\nmanagement of common interests and the exercise of the\nfunctions of sovereignty are not brought into question.\nThe agreement on the principles of a settlement\nproposed to the protagonists in this conflict by the Contact\nGroup at Geneva on 8 September of this year and accepted\nby their representatives, meets these two criteria. This is\nwhy France has welcomed it, approves it and will support\nit. The agreement and subsequent actions represent an\nencouraging step, but they are only a first step. The extent\nof what remains to be done to end the tragedy of Bosnia\nclearly shows the major role that the United Nations will\nhave to take. In that mission, it can rely on France\u2019s\nunwavering support. It must also rely on the support of the\ninternational community. Peace will be the work of all.\nThe decline in the respect shown the Organization is\nevident in another domain that also affects its survival,\nnamely, its financing. It is not normal for the Secretary-\nGeneral of the world\u2019s largest Organization, faced with\nthe threat of imminent bankruptcy, to have fewer avenues\nof recourse in dealing with his debtors than the smallest\nof our businesses. It is not acceptable for Member\nStates \u2014 and I am not thinking here only of those that\nare experiencing real economic difficulties \u2014 to show\nsuch scant respect for the Organization by ignoring the\nlegal obligations they have freely accepted.\nFrance would like to see the United Nations stronger\nand more respected. For this to occur, however, it is also\nessential that the Organization be reformed and adapted.\nThe Secretary-General has spared no effort to open\nthe way to reform. Under his aegis, significant progress\nhas been made in the management of the Organization.\nAll the debates in these past few years were undertaken\nat his initiative and have been based on his proposals in\nthe Agenda for Peace and the Agenda for Development.\nFrance is awaiting with the greatest interest the Agenda\nfor Democracy, which will complete this triptych in a\nfield in which the United Nations is called on to take the\nleading role. The Organization has need, more than ever,\nof its Secretary-General in order to adapt to the demands\nof the twenty-first century.\nHowever, it also requires the political will of its\nMember States, and this is not sufficiently in evidence. At\nthe opening of this fiftieth session, my wish is a simple\none. Let us concentrate on the projects that have already\nbeen begun so that they can be completed soon, within\nthe coming year. France will contribute to this, and I\nshould like in this respect to submit a few proposals.\nOne of our main objectives will be to reach an\nagreement on enlarging the Security Council. Enlargement\nwill be successful only if the Council continues in a\nlasting way to be representative of the community of\nnations through a reasonable increase in the number of its\nmembers.\nI should like to reaffirm this today: the Security\nCouncil will have to welcome Germany and Japan as\npermanent members, as well as some major States of the\ndeveloping world. It would also be desirable, naturally,\nfor the Council simultaneously to be opened to some new\nnon-permanent members.\n15\n\n\nThe negotiation on the enlargement of the Security\nCouncil now can and should be concluded quickly. Let us\nwait no longer. It is equally imperative for the discussion\non United Nations financing to produce results in the next\nfew months.\nBut we must be honest with ourselves. This\nnegotiation depends in part on the response to the United\nStates\u2019 request for a reduction in its assessed contribution\nto the budget for peace-keeping operations. I shall not try\nto disguise France\u2019s genuine doubts as to the legitimacy of\nthis request.\nNone the less, for the higher interests of the\nOrganization, my country is ready to examine this question\nwithout any a priori conclusions. It does, however, set\ncertain imperative conditions. The first condition is that any\nnew scale must respect fully the real capacity of Member\nStates to pay. On this point I should like once again to pay\ntribute to your country, Mr. President. Portugal decided this\nyear, of its own accord, to increase its contribution to the\nbudget for peace-keeping operations. The second condition\nis that the agreement must make it possible for the\nOrganization to start off again on sound bases. All existing\narrears will therefore have to be paid up. The third\ncondition is that automatic sanctions should be applied to\nthose who do not pay appropriately in order to prevent a\nrecurrence of the current crisis.\nThis is the modest price of enabling the United\nNations to devote itself less nervously to its two principal\nmissions: peace-keeping and development.\nPeace-keeping is the domain of the Security Council,\nthe only body empowered to decide on the use of force and\nto determine the principles and mandate of operations\ncarried out in the interest of international peace and\nsecurity.\nWe have to learn the lessons of the experiences of\nrecent years. Aside from traditional peace-keeping, the\nUnited Nations may find itself obliged, in accordance with\nthe mandate entrusted to it by the Security Council, to\nresort to force, within the limitations of its means, in order\nto preserve whatever can be preserved. United Nations\nmilitary action is often the sole recourse available to the\ninternational community.\nIt is therefore essential to increase the efficiency of the\nUnited Nations in the service of peace. Among the most\npressing matters, I wish to underline the need to set up\ncapacities for rapid intervention, in the framework of the\nvital process begun two years ago concerning stand-by\nforces. I wish also to mention the need to improve the\ncommand of operations and the interest in a still greater\nuse of preventive diplomacy.\nI would like to say a few words about a situation\nthat is of grave concern to France and that calls\nspecifically for urgent action in preventive diplomacy on\na large scale. I am referring to the situation in the Great\nLakes region of Africa.\nSince the assassination of Burundi\u2019s President,\nMr. Ndadaye, and the unprecedented tragedy that struck\nRwanda, this entire region has been deeply destabilized.\nMore than 2 million Rwandans and Burundis are living\noutside their country in terrible conditions, with the\ndifficulties that all this entails for the host countries. The\nabsence of lasting political solutions, the climate of\ninsecurity and fear that is kept alive by all the extremists,\nthe suspicion reigning on all sides, the risk of new\ntragedies \u2014 all this compels us to address together and in\ndepth the fundamental problems in this area, taking into\naccount their extreme complexity and the trauma caused\nby the genocide that has plunged Rwanda into mourning.\nFrance remains convinced that only a comprehensive\nregional approach that is political in character will make\nit possible to do this. The principle of a conference on\npeace, stability and security in the Great Lakes region is\nnow accepted, and we welcome the recent appointment of\na Special Representative by the Secretary-General. But\ntime is of the essence.\nThis conference must be carefully prepared, with the\nactive participation of the States most directly involved\nand interested in its success, and it must lead to the\nestablishment of a stability pact for the African Great\nLakes region. There are three elements that I believe to\nbe essential in this respect: first, the adoption of\nprinciples for the return of the refugees and for national\nreconciliation, along with a commitment by States not to\ntolerate any activity hostile to their neighbours on their\nterritory; secondly, the conclusion of bilateral or\nmultilateral agreements among the States concerned to\nenshrine these principles and commitments and to give\nthem substance; and, finally, the organization of a follow-\nup mechanism under the aegis of the Security Council.\nFrance holds the conviction that development\nassistance is the second, or perhaps the first, raison d\u2019\u00eatre\nof the United Nations. Here, too, the balance sheet invites\nreflection. How can we not have questions about the\n16\n\n\nfeebleness of results, the persistence of extreme poverty, or\nat times even famine, these crises that erase all prospects of\ndevelopment and bring indescribable suffering to\npopulations? How can we not have questions about the\nreduced contributions of the world\u2019s richest countries?\nThese failures have gone onto the record. Now we\nmust act, reform and take the best advantage of the\nexperience we have acquired. The institutions of the United\nNations and their network of representatives in the field are\nstrong points. The development agencies have to refocus\ntheir activity specifically on their objectives. They have to\nset real priorities aimed at addressing real needs \u2014 in other\nwords, first and foremost the needs of the least developed\ncountries.\nBut it would be shocking if, as I sometimes predict\nwill happen, reform were boosted for the sole purpose of\nreducing still further the contribution of the richest States\nin the struggle against human poverty.\nFrance, together with its partners in the European\nUnion, hopes to bring about, through An Agenda for\nDevelopment a mobilization for development on new\nfoundations. The situation is too disturbing to set the\ninterests of the States of the North and South in opposition\nto each other. We are all bound by a higher duty: the global\nstruggle against poverty.\nIf, before this session comes to a close, we are able to\nenlarge the Security Council, to place United Nations\nfinancing on solid bases, to give the Organization the\nmeans to intervene rapidly and effectively to maintain peace\nand, finally, to modernize the modalities and institutions for\ndevelopment assistance, we will truly have celebrated the\nfiftieth anniversary of the United Nations, above and\nbeyond all the speech-making, in a fitting manner: by our\nactions.\nAllow me finally to mention a project that is\nparticularly dear to me: to re-establish, on the occasion of\nthis anniversary, the universality of our Organization, which\nis reflected in the diversity of cultures and languages\nmanifested here.\nLinguistic pluralism is essential. It reflects the right of\neach Member State to understand the others, but also its\nduty to make itself understood. A draft resolution on this\nsubject will be submitted to the Assembly; it will deal with\nthe use of languages in the Assembly\u2019s deliberations and in\nthe Secretariat, and I hope it will enshrine the need to retain\nsufficient resources to ensure the provisions of translation\nand interpretation services. I am convinced that we will\nreach a consensus in this regard.\nOur Organization has deliberately taken its actions\nfor the long term. Recent events may obscure\nachievements that are nevertheless solid, the results of\ncollective, patient, courageous work. But the gains are\nthere. It is up to each of us to make them known and\nconsolidate them so that the United Nations may continue\nto fulfil the indispensable role entrusted to it 50 years\nago.\n"

        "file_text": "I warmly congratulate the\nPresident on his election to preside over the fiftieth session\nof the General Assembly. We take confidence from the fact\nthat his experience and distinction will be available to guide\nus in our deliberations at this historic session. I am\nespecially pleased to extend my congratulations to the\nrepresentative of a country with which we have the closest\nand most friendly relations as a fellow member of the\nEuropean Union.\nI wish at the outset to congratulate the parties to the\nlatest peace accord in the Middle East, which will be signed\nin Washington tomorrow. It has required great\nstatesmanship, courage and perseverance on the part of\nPalestinian and Israeli leaders alike to reach this agreement.\nWe in Ireland will continue to play our part in supporting\nthe peace process, together with our partners in the\nEuropean Union.\nIn the same spirit, we warmly welcome the agreement\nreached yesterday in New York, which we all hope will lay\nthe foundation for a lasting peace in Bosnia and\nHerzegovina and throughout the region.\nIf I choose to highlight two issues at the very\nbeginning of my remarks, Sir, you will understand, I am\nsure, that it is because these two issues have created such\na resonance around the world. The first issue to which I\nrefer is the Fourth World Conference on Women. Ireland\nstands committed to the principle that human rights are\nindivisible \u2014 the rights of one are the rights of all. No\nsystem based on a universal commitment to human rights\ncan survive if the rights of women are not seen as an\nintegral factor in the equation.\nWomen suffer disproportionately from the effects of\nwar and armed conflict, whether it be as casualties from\nland-mines or as the victims of systematic rape. Women\nand children form the great majority of the more than 1\nbillion people living in poverty around the world today.\nWomen in most societies are prevented from participating\nfully in the decision-making processes and have unequal\naccess to power. Women continue to be prevented from\nfully exercising their sexual and reproductive rights,\nincluding the newly recognized right to have control over,\nand decide freely and responsibly on, matters related to\ntheir sexuality, free of coercion, discrimination and\nviolence.\nThe Fourth World Conference on Women, held\nearlier this month in Beijing, addressed these and other\nissues of relevance to women. The Declaration and the\nPlatform adopted by the Conference pose a major\nchallenge to Governments and the international\ncommunity to overcome the obstacles which continue to\nface women around the world. They also represent a\nsolemn commitment by Governments and the whole\nUnited Nations system to take all necessary measures to\neliminate all forms of discrimination against women and\nto remove all obstacles to gender equality and the\nadvancement and empowerment of women. On behalf of\nthe Irish Government I pledge here that we will do\neverything in our power to ensure that this commitment\nis honoured and implemented.\nThe second issue to which I must refer is the\nresumption of nuclear testing by the French and Chinese\nGovernments. It would be wrong if I were to address this\ngathering and ignore decisions that have \u2014 almost\nliterally \u2014 sent shock waves around the world.\nWe in Ireland, confronted as we are by the\never-present anxiety posed by ageing nuclear facilities on\nour neighbouring island, have had many occasions over\nthe years to know the worry caused by the potential of\nnuclear power. The great majority of the Irish people,\ntherefore, easily understand and share the deep concern of\nthe peoples of the South Pacific. Nor can we fail to\nrecognize the dismay and dejection caused by the\nresumption of nuclear testing in the immediate aftermath\nof the successful outcome of the Non-Proliferation Treaty\nReview and Extension Conference. The finalization of the\ncomprehensive test-ban treaty early next year remains an\nabsolute imperative.\nThe President of the General Assembly is taking\noffice at an exceptional time in the history of the United\n23\n\n\nNations. Next month the Heads of State or Government will\nmeet here in special session to commemorate the fiftieth\nanniversary of the Organization. The General Assembly,\ninspired by this anniversary, should mark a decisive new\nphase for the United Nations.\nThe world faces a daunting array of new problems\nwhich require the United Nations to adapt and revitalize its\nresources. The representative of Spain, Foreign Minister\nSolana, speaking on behalf of the European Union, set out\nthese challenges in his speech here yesterday to this\nAssembly. Ireland associates itself fully with these remarks.\nThe fiftieth anniversary coincides with a more critical\nattitude towards the United Nations in many countries.\nThere is a growing readiness to highlight shortcomings and\nfailures rather than the longer-term record of real and\nsubstantial success. We cannot ignore this criticism,\nparticularly when it comes from many who are ordinarily\nthe strongest advocates of the United Nations. The United\nNations, like any other organization, can only benefit from\nrigorous examination and adaptation.\nBut no organization can of itself provide wholesale\nremedies for removing the hatred, the fear, the distrust and\nthe divisions in the world. Many of the shortcomings for\nwhich the Organization is frequently criticized have more\nto do with a flagging of the collective will to demonstrate\nthe determination, generosity, courage and tolerance to live\nup to the obligations of the Charter.\nThe Charter remains the bedrock for what lies ahead,\nas it has been for all that has been achieved over those 50\nyears. The United Nations has a remarkable record on\nwhich to build: it has enshrined the universal obligation of\nrespect for law and good conduct between States as the\ncentre-piece of international relations; it served in numerous\nways during the long years of the cold war to dull the edge\nof great-Power rivalry and reduce the dangers of global\nconfrontation; it provided an indispensable framework for\nthe negotiation of crucial arms-control agreements which\nhold the promise of a world free of weapons of mass\ndestruction; it facilitated the process of decolonization and\nhelped bring about the dismantling of apartheid; it\nprevented numerous conflicts through its peace-keeping\noperations and restored stability to many parts of the world;\nit set the basic international standards for human rights and\nmonitors their observance; it has sustained efforts to\neliminate poverty, alleviate distress and deprivation, and\nimprove the health and living standards of millions of the\nworld\u2019s most vulnerable citizens.\nWe may ask, what of the recent past? The United\nNations has seen great recent achievements \u2014 in\nMozambique, in Cambodia, in Haiti, in El Salvador, to\ntake some examples. The peoples of those countries can\nbear witness to new hopes for a better and more secure\nfuture.\nIn other local and regional conflicts, however, the\nUnited Nations experience, in the face of extraordinarily\ncomplex and painful circumstances, has seen serious\nsetbacks. The human misery resulting from the wars in\nformer Yugoslavia, Rwanda and Somalia has shocked the\nworld.\nAlmost 50 years after the adoption of the Universal\nDeclaration, human rights violations remain a major\nwidespread problem. With a resurgence of regional\nconflict and ethnic tensions in many parts of the world,\nwe have been confronted with virtually every imaginable\nhuman rights abuse. In contemporary warfare, more than\n90 per cent of the casualties are non-combatants who are\noften directly targeted because of their ethnic or religious\naffiliations.\nChildren, like women, are especially vulnerable.\nDuring the last decade, nearly 2 million children have\ndied in wars and more than 5 million have been forced\ninto refugee camps. More children die in wars than\nsoldiers. At the present time throughout the world there\nare almost 30 million refugees and displaced persons in\nneed of assistance. In the Great Lakes region of Africa,\nas the refugee nightmare deepens, we require urgent and\nconcerted action to avert any danger of new tragedies.\nThe scale of all these problems has already stretched\nto the limits our ability to respond, and has heightened the\nproblem of United Nations credibility. It is against this\nbackground that we the Member States must revitalize the\nUnited Nations in its mission and equip it with the means\nto react with vigour and determination to the new crises\nwhich constantly arise. This means improving the\nresponse to humanitarian emergencies. But it also means\ntackling more effectively their root causes, poverty and\ndeprivation, preventing conflicts before they arise, and\nmore quickly containing and resolving them when they\ndo.\nThe Secretary-General\u2019s Agenda for Peace and\nAgenda for Development are landmark documents that set\nout clear priorities and a programme for action.\n24\n\n\nOne of the many bitter lessons that we have to draw\nfrom recent experience in Rwanda and Bosnia is that the\ntraditional deployment of peace-keeping units is no longer,\non its own, a sufficient response to the type of crises which\nwe face. In the past, peace-keeping operations were\nprimarily concerned with policing cease-fires between\nMember States, pending diplomatic efforts to resolve the\nsubstantive political issues. That, unfortunately, is no longer\nthe case: 11 of the 13 operations established since 1991\nhave involved internal conflicts. Peace-keeping contingents\nincreasingly find themselves operating in situations where\ngovernment and civil order have broken down. There are no\nlonger clear points of reference for such operations which\nhave become politically and logistically more complex, and\nfinancially more onerous.\nThere are a number of ways in which the management\nand conduct of peace-keeping operations must be improved.\nPerhaps most urgent is the need to improve the response\ncapability of the United Nations in dealing with sudden or\ncomplex emergencies. Important initiatives have already\nbeen taken in this regard with the development of the\nUnited Nations stand-by arrangements system. Such\narrangements might perhaps be extended to other areas to\nensure that a full range of humanitarian, logistical and civil\ndefence as well as military options is available to the\nUnited Nations in dealing with the many crises which it is\ncalled upon to address. In Ireland we are actively exploring\nthe possibility of bringing together a humanitarian liaison\ngroup comprising experts from a wide range of fields which\ncould be deployed at short notice when emergencies occur.\nCommand and control of United Nations operations\nalso needs to be improved. Greater attention needs to be\npaid to ensuring that the distinction between peace-keeping\nand peace enforcement is not blurred in devising mandates\nfor operations, if the confidence and willingness of troop-\ncontributing countries to continue providing troops is to be\nmaintained.\nRegional organizations can also play a valuable role in\nsupport of United Nations peace-keeping activities. It is of\ncourse essential that such organizations in carrying out their\nrole do so strictly in accordance with the mandate which\nthe Security Council has laid down. The United Nations\nshould benefit from the support of regional organizations,\nas the Charter envisages, but should not in doing so\nrelinquish its overall control and responsibility.\nMy delegation shares the concerns which the\nSecretary-General has expressed about the safety of United\nNations personnel in the field. We would like to see the\nUnited Nations Convention on the safety and security of\nUnited Nations personnel enter into force as soon as\npossible.\nOur concern extends to all personnel who find\nthemselves in dangerous situations, including\nhumanitarian experts working with non-governmental\norganizations, who are frequently the first to arrive in the\nfield in the early, and often most dangerous, stages of an\nemergency.\nOn the basis of the recommendations of the\nSecretary-General, we need to look again at how we can\ndevelop the United Nations capacity for preventive\ndiplomacy, early warning and mediation, and for timely\nintervention in disputes before they escalate out of\ncontrol.\nIreland continues to believe that the task of\npreventing conflict would also be facilitated by the\ncreation of a mediation body which would work closely\nwith the Secretary-General and the Security Council.\nThe dispatch of special teams of advisers and\nmonitors to areas of crisis and tension should be placed\non a more assured and regular basis than in the past. I\nbelieve that a small investment here would be amply and\nquickly repaid.\nThere is a growing acceptance that violations of\nhumanitarian law are a threat to international peace and\nsecurity. The case for the establishment of a permanent\ninternational criminal court is therefore more obvious than\never before. It is only through such a body that the\ninternational community can effectively demonstrate that\nmassive human rights violations will never go\nunpunished.\nThe international community is attempting to break\nthe pattern of violence in Rwanda and the former\nYugoslavia by ensuring that those who are guilty of\nhuman rights abuses are punished and that minimum\nstandards of accountability are set so as to deter future\noffenders. We have rightly responded by establishing\nteams of United Nations human rights monitors as well as\nad hoc tribunals to try the perpetrators of war crimes.\nThis is a good beginning. It is also necessary to devise\nmeasures which would extend vigilance and provide early\nwarning of potential situations of human rights abuse. The\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights,\nsupported by human rights monitors, is already playing a\n25\n\n\nkey role in meeting this objective. He must be given our\nfull cooperation and adequate financial support.\nThe promotion of the universality of human rights\nachieved a significant breakthrough with the Vienna\nDeclaration and Programme of Action. However, our\nconcerns are that implementation will suffer unless there is\na significant increase in the proportion of the regular budget\ndevoted to human rights activity. As a demonstration of our\nown national commitment, the Irish Government has this\nyear increased substantially its contribution to the various\nUnited Nations voluntary funds in the field of human rights.\nIt is now time for the United Nations to pay more\nattention to constructing the foundations for peace through\ndevelopment. As part of the process of renewal, we need to\nwork in partnership to pursue a new approach to\ncooperation for development \u2014 a cooperation which\nredresses the imbalances and has as an objective the\nrealization of sustainable human development for all.\nIreland has consistently supported the elaboration of\n\u201cAn Agenda for Development\u201d, and we look forward to a\nsubstantive and relevant outcome.\nMost of the zones of insecurity in the world are to be\nfound in developing countries, and the Charter clearly\nrecognizes that lack of development is one of the root\ncauses of conflict between States.\nThis year is the one hundred and fiftieth anniversary\nof the Great Famine in Ireland, a catastrophe of enormous\nproportions, which has had a lasting and searing impact on\nIrish life. Its memory is still very much alive, and it has\nreinforced the Irish commitment to the prevention of similar\ncatastrophes in other parts of the world.\nWhile many areas of the world, including my own\ncountry, have seen great economic and social progress over\nthe past 50 years, the developing world, especially in\nAfrica, has not enjoyed the benefits of this progress. How\ncan we explain the fact that, in a world of plenty, one fifth\nof the world\u2019s population still goes to bed hungry?\nEarlier this year the World Summit for Social\nDevelopment agreed on a consensus approach to the\ndevelopment of international norms in the economic, social\nand related spheres. We now need to act at both the\ninternational and the national levels to implement the\ncommitments and consolidate the achievements.\nIn recent years new opportunities have opened up for\ndisarmament; we should now move decisively to grasp\nthem. Never has the continued presence of huge arsenals\nof mass destruction been so out of step with the hopes\nand aspirations of the international community. Never has\nthe logic underpinning nuclear deterrence been so much\nin need of fundamental and critical reassessment.\nThere has been progress in some areas. The Treaty\non the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) has\nbeen made permanent and its Parties have been made\nmore accountable. Renewed commitments to nuclear\nnon-proliferation and disarmament were accepted by all\nparticipants at the NPT review and extension Conference.\nMy country looks to all nuclear-weapon States, and in\nparticular the five permanent member States of the\nSecurity Council, to keep faith with the spirit and letter of\nthese commitments.\nWe welcome the progress being made in the\nnegotiations for a comprehensive test-ban treaty. Their\nconclusion next year would be warmly greeted by public\nopinion in our countries and would facilitate new steps in\nthe field of nuclear disarmament, in particular the\nsuccessful conclusion of a treaty which would ban the\nproduction of fissile materials for weapons purposes.\nIreland is deeply committed to stemming the\nexcessive flow of conventional arms worldwide, and we\nsupport the objective of a ban on anti-personnel\nland-mines, which have caused civilian suffering on a\nhuge scale. The elaboration of a United Nations code of\nconduct on conventional arms transfers, which I have\nproposed to the Assembly, remains a valuable practical\npriority in developing greater international controls over\nthe flow of conventional weapons.\nIn conducting its mission and fulfilling its\nresponsibilities under the Charter, the United Nations\nmust also begin a process of institutional reform and\nrenewal. This should begin with the Security Council. The\nSecurity Council needs to be enlarged in order to increase\nits effectiveness and its ability to act, both clearly and\nunambiguously, as the expression of the common will of\nMember States.\nEnlargement should enhance the representative\ncharacter of the Security Council, taking into account the\nemergence of new economic and political powers as well\nas the increase in United Nations membership. It should\nalso enhance equitable geographic representation, and it\nshould not diminish the possibility for smaller Member\n26\n\n\nStates to serve. Enlargement should take place in both the\npermanent and non-permanent categories of membership.\nAfter two years of discussion we have now reached the\npoint where we should begin to clarify the elements of a\nbalanced solution.\nThe Secretary-General has made it very clear to us\nthat the Organization is now facing an unprecedented\nfinancial crisis. How can we expect the United Nations to\ndischarge the responsibilities given to it by Member States\nif the Member States themselves are unwilling to meet their\nbasic obligations under the Charter to provide the necessary\nresources? Unless urgent steps are taken, what we say here\nwill be no more than empty words.\nMy delegation fully understands the reason why the\nSecretary-General has found it necessary to take various\nmeasures to reduce costs. We support the thrust of his\nproposals. However, as the European Union has made clear,\nwe view with considerable concern the decision of the\nSecretary-General, as part of these cost-saving measures, to\nsuspend payment of all troop reimbursement costs. Even as\na short-term measure, this imposes a heavy and unfair\nburden on troop-contributing countries, particularly those\nwhich, like Ireland, have fully discharged all their financial\nobligations to the Organization.\nIf all Member States were to declare here their\nintentions to pay assessed contributions in full, on time and\nwithout conditions, both for peacekeeping and the regular\nbudget, this single commitment would do more than any\nother to strengthen the United Nations capacity to act\neffectively.\nWhen I spoke last year to the Assembly about the\nNorthern Ireland situation, I stressed the importance of the\nannouncement, a few weeks earlier, of the complete\ncessation of military operations by the IRA. This was\nfollowed, some weeks afterwards, by a similar\nannouncement by representatives of the loyalist\nparamilitaries. Thankfully, the guns have now been silent in\nNorthern Ireland for the past year. This has brought the gift\nof peace, and the gift of hope, to a situation where both had\nbeen sorely lacking.\nThe gift of peace has been profoundly welcome. The\nunremitting toll of death and destruction which disfigured\nNorthern Ireland for the past generation has been halted.\nThe economic opportunities offered by peace have rapidly\nbegun to be exploited. Freed from the shadow of terrorism,\nhuman contacts have multiplied across the divide in\nNorthern Ireland and between both parts of the island.\nThe paramilitary leaders, through the maintenance of\ntheir cease-fires, have made an important first\ncontribution to the climate of hope. However, only the\ntwo Governments and the political leaders in Northern\nIreland can consolidate the hope implicit in the cessation\nof violence by underpinning it with an agreed political\nsettlement which can enjoy the consent and allegiance of\nall. That is now the paramount goal.\nIn the Joint Declaration of 15 December 1993, the\nBritish and Irish Governments acknowledged as their goal\n\u201cto remove the causes of conflict, to overcome the\nlegacy of history and to heal the divisions which\nhave resulted\u201d.\nThis task can now be addressed free of the\npolarizing and distorting influences which terrorism, and\nthe countermeasures it calls forth, exert on the political\nprocess. It is vital that this unprecedented opportunity\nshould be grasped.\nA settlement of the Northern Ireland conflict requires\nthe engagement and cooperation of both Governments and\nof the political leaders of both communities in Northern\nIreland. The close cooperation of the two Governments\nhas been the enabling condition for the progress to date.\nThe Anglo-Irish Agreement of 1985 and the Joint\nDeclaration of 1993 are landmark documents in that\nprocess. Last February we published the New Framework\nfor Agreement, setting out the shared assessment of the\ntwo Governments on how a balanced and honourable\naccommodation could be envisaged across all the key\nrelationships. While this is not a blueprint to be imposed\non the parties, it reflects long and careful consideration\nbetween the two Governments on how the underlying\nrealities should be addressed and is designed to give\nimpetus and direction to the process of negotiations.\nThe role of the two Governments is crucial because\nthe Northern Ireland conflict is primarily about the wider\nBritish or Irish allegiances resolutely cherished by the two\ncommunities there. For that reason, there can be no purely\ninternal solution. Innovative thinking and potentially\ndifficult decisions will be required on both sides of the\nIrish Sea if the two Governments are to create the context\nand conditions where the conflicting allegiances can at\nlast be reconciled.\nThe success of these intergovernmental efforts will,\nhowever, be measured ultimately by attitudes of the two\ncommunities within Northern Ireland. The attitude of the\n27\n\n\nnationalist tradition has been characterized by an ever\ngrowing acceptance of the principle that there would be no\nchange in the status of Northern Ireland without the consent\nof a majority of the people there.\nThey look in turn to the unionist community for an\nacknowledgement that the principle of consent, as well as\nbeing a rightful protection for unionists against the\nimposition of a united Ireland against the wishes of a\nmajority of the people in Northern Ireland, also implies the\nrights of nationalists in Northern Ireland to be governed by\nstructures which are relevant and responsive in terms of\ntheir allegiance and aspirations. The denial of the principle\nof consent, and of mutual respect, has been costly in the\npast. The relative weights of the communities within\nNorthern Ireland, as in Ireland as a whole, mean that\ncoercion is quite simply impossible, even if anyone were\nfoolish enough to attempt it. Cooperation and consent at all\nlevels are not just the best policy, but the only possible\npolicy.\nBecause of this reality, the politics of the peace\nprocess must be resolutely inclusive. Any viable settlement\nmust deal with each community as it defines itself, not as\nothers would find it convenient for it to be. For that reason,\nI welcome the fact that the new leader of Ulster unionism\nis among the most forceful and assertive representatives of\nhis community\u2019s philosophy.\nThe test of statesmanship for any leader in Northern\nIreland and the kind of solution we seek are not about\nabating the rights of either community. They are about\nfinding ways to respect them which are compatible with\nequally important rights on the other side. We know that\ntalks can succeed only if both communities in Northern\nIreland are reliably and authentically represented at those\ntalks. Nationalism should be represented in its integrity at\nthose talks, and so also must unionism. Both have to spell\nout how they propose to accommodate satisfactorily a\ntradition and an identity which is not their own.\nBoth Governments have explicitly set inclusive and\ncomprehensive negotiations as their goal, yet these have not\nyet begun. That failure is frustrating and threatens to\ndissipate the momentum towards a lasting peace. It would\nbe ironic and dangerous if those who have been persuaded\nto abandon violence were now to be denied the chance to\nmake their case politically. It is vital, therefore, that\nobstacles in the way of comprehensive negotiations should\nnow be overcome.\nOne of the most difficult obstacles is that the\ncontinued existence of arsenals of guns and explosives is\na source of fear, anxiety and mistrust. The Irish\nGovernment, for its part, is absolutely determined that all\narms should be erased from the political equation as soon\nas possible. Any debate is about the best means of\nachieving this, not about whether it should be done.\nIt is because of the importance of this goal that we\nwish to situate it in the context where it is most likely to\nbe achieved in practice. We seek to avoid, as far as\npossible, symbolic overtones of surrender or of a\none-sided admission of guilt. In this context, no less than\nin other contexts in Northern Ireland, the concepts of\nvictory and defeat will never offer a solution.\nTo make the decommissioning of weapons a\nprecondition for entry into negotiations, as opposed to an\nimportant goal to be realized in that process, ignores the\npsychology and motivation of those on both sides in\nIreland who have resorted to violence and the lessons of\nconflict resolution elsewhere. We should treat\nnegotiations, as far as possible, as a practical step. Rather\nthan surrounding entry into negotiations with\npreconditions, we should instead seek to build golden\nbridges to enable and encourage all to take part.\nWe need all those who have been part of the\nproblem to become, as far as possible, part of the\nsolution. Given the depth and cost of the problem,\nparticipation in negotiations should be treated as a\nnecessity and a duty, not a privilege to be jealously\nwithheld or awarded. If we multiply preconditions, we are\nin danger of saying, in effect, that negotiations can take\nplace only when the problems they are supposed to\naddress have already been largely solved.\nIn saying this, I do not wish to be in any way\ndismissive of the genuine difficulty many people in\nNorthern Ireland have in dealing on an equal footing with\nthose who have in the past used or condoned violence and\ncoercion. It is clear that there is ample room for further\nguarantees and assurances aimed at building trust and\nconfidence in relation to this sensitive issue. If these\nguarantees and assurances can be authoritatively and\ncredibly underscored by a respected and objective outside\nagency, so much the better. That is why the idea of an\ninternational dimension to this confidence-building\nprocess is so appealing. We continue to work on it, in the\nhope that it can provide a bridge for all sides to overcome\nthe present difficulty.\n28\n\n\nThe Secretary-General has eloquently expressed the\nessence of our task in this anniversary year by saying,\n\u201cTo support the United Nations is not, and never has\nbeen, to subsidize a separate, independent entity.\nToday, more than ever, to support the United Nations\nis to participate in the only world Organization\ncomposed of all humanity and in the service of all\nhumanity.\n\u201cToday, a half-century later, it is our duty and\nour privilege to take this project to its next stage \u2014\nthe achievement of an age of peace, development and\nsecurity.\u201d\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me at the outset, on behalf of my delegation, to\nextend my warm congratulations to you, Sir, on your\nelection to the presidency of the fiftieth session of the\nUnited Nations General Assembly. Coinciding as it does\nwith the commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the\nOrganization, your election is indeed evidence of the\nesteem in which you and your country, Portugal, are held\nby the international community. You can be assured of\nthe full cooperation of the delegation of Niger.\nTo your predecessor, Foreign Minister Amara Essy,\nwho has just added to his rich career the record of a job\nwell done here, I convey my best wishes for success in\nhis future activities.\nIn this transitional year in our Organization\u2019s history,\nI should also like to pay tribute to the Secretary-General,\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for the dynamic manner in\nwhich he is performing his duties at the head of our\nOrganization.\n10\n\n\nA half century has gone by since the creation of the\nUnited Nations at San Francisco in 1945. Hence, this year\u2019s\nsession affords us a unique opportunity to recognize the\nimportance of the historic gesture by which the leaders of\nthe day created the Organization as well as to renew our\nfaith in the ideals and principles of the Charter, which\nunquestionably stands as one of the most important\ndocuments available to mankind for building the world of\ntomorrow. For young States like Niger, which acceded to\ninternational sovereignty 35 years ago, it would be remiss\nto overlook the forceful role the United Nations has played\nin the emancipation of peoples and its invaluable\ncontribution to the progress of mankind as a crucible of\ninternational cooperation in the political, economic, social\nand cultural spheres.\nFifty years after the creation of the United Nations the\nthreats created by the cold war, which long paralysed it,\nhave disappeared, making way for healthier and more\nconstructive cooperation between States. This new climate\nenabled the Organization to extend, a year ago, an\nemotional welcome to South Africa following its successful\nvictory over the system of apartheid, thus closing after\nmany years one of the most painful items on its agenda.\nSince the Madrid Conference, the Middle East too has\nmoved along the irreversible path to peace, crowned by the\nsignature on 13 September 1993 of the Agreements on\nautonomy for the Gaza Strip and Jericho.\nHowever, this new climate has also created other kinds\nof threats, threats as formidable as those of the cold-war\nperiod and just as disturbing to the peace of many peoples.\nConflicts that intermingle nationalism, ethnic rivalries and\nreligious intolerance have erupted in many parts of the\nworld. Democracy, notwithstanding the progress it has\nmade, is finding it hard to take root in countries where\nworsening poverty, malnutrition, disease and environmental\ndeterioration mete out indescribable suffering.\nIn other words, the global context in which the present\nsession of the General Assembly is meeting is far from\ngiving grounds for complete optimism. This session should\nfurnish us with an opportunity for a fruitful analysis of\nways to create a better world, a world free of such\natrocities, a world in which mankind will no longer suffer\nand in which the ideals of peace, true development and\njustice will prevail.\nThe situation of my country, Niger, like that of many\nother African States, is still fraught with difficulties of all\nkinds arising out of a disastrous economic environment. A\n50 per cent devaluation of our currency, the CFA franc,\nin January 1994 dealt a severe blow to the living standard\nof the population.\n\nThe economic recovery expected as a result of this\nfairly drastic monetary step has been delayed, for the\ncollective and uniform nature of the measure made it\nunsuitable to the specific situations in the various\ncountries affected. Unable to count on a significant\nincrease in its raw-material exports, Niger has, on the\ncontrary, experienced an unreasonable increase in the\npressure of its external debt and the cost of imports.\nDespite that, my Government, in conjunction with the\nBretton Woods institutions, has undertaken a programme\nof economic structural adjustment based on a policy of\nsystematic restructuring of the public and semi-public\nsectors combined with a balancing of macroeconomic\naggregates based on a substantial improvement in State\nrevenues and a reining in of public expenditure.\nPolitically speaking, the democratic process entered\ninto in 1990 is being pursued and expanded, although it\ncontinues to experience the growing pains that accompany\nany new experiment \u2014 excesses and abuses of new-found\nfreedoms, a tendency to civic impunity, the excessive\ngrowth of all kinds of interest groups, special interests,\nand so on. However, the existence of active trade unions,\nan independent and free press and a dynamic civil society\nare creating the basis for a lasting democratic structure\ncapable of ensuring respect for the rule of law and\ncontributing to the gradual growth of a democratic\nculture.\nAfter less than four years of institutionalized\ndemocracy, Niger held elections for President and for the\nLegislature. The holding of the last set of elections for the\nLegislature, advanced to January 1995, was entrusted to\nan independent electoral commission headed by a\nmagistrate and made up primarily of persons from the\nNon-Governmental Organization sector, and from human\nrights organizations and organizations advocating\ndemocracy. Several international observers witnessed the\nvote and all of them said that it was a model of\ntransparency and equity. These elections resulted in a\nmajority in Parliament for the opposition parties. Thus,\nsince that time, Niger has been living under a regime\nwhere the presidential minority does not coincide with the\nparliamentary majority. This so-called cohabitation regime\nis the most delicate form of the distribution of\n11\n\n\nconstitutional powers and of relations between the different\ninstitutions of the Republic. Despite all the difficulties\ninherent in the exceptionally delicate and unprecedented\nexperience we are undergoing, the regular functioning of\nthe institutional machinery has never been found wanting.\nThe Supreme Court, the institution entrusted with\ninterpreting the Constitution and stating the law on the basis\nof which the operation of the Republic\u2019s institutions can be\nensured, has played a crucial role. Systematic reliance on\nthe machinery of law has been an option of principle\nsupported by the entire political community, which\nconstitutes its dedication to the rule of law and to the\nstability as well as the security of the country.\nIt is precisely to ensure the country\u2019s security and\nstability that my Government undertook all the efforts that\nfinally led to the Agreement of 24 April 1995, between the\nGovernment and the leaders of the Tuareg rebellion, joined\ntogether in the Armed Resistance Organization. As the\nAssembly knows, since 1991 there has been in the northern\npart of Niger an armed rebellion claiming to represent the\nTuareg community and calling for the establishment of a\nfederal regime, which it believes is the only one that can\nprovide its people with free self-government. The\ndiscussions undertaken with the leaders of the rebellion\nconstantly stressed the need to avoid useless bloodshed, and\nto focus on dialogue, the major focus of which would be\nthe best interests of the country. Thanks to mediation\nefforts by the friendly countries of Algeria, Burkina Faso\nand France, to which I once again extend the gratitude of\nthe Nigerian people, we were able on 24 April 1995 to sign\na definitive peace agreement. That agreement, based on the\nprinciple of respect for the constitution, which enshrines the\nindivisibility of the Republic, emphasizes two main\nelements: first, at the political level, the agreement\nrecommends the acceleration of the establishment of\ndecentralized structures and a consequent devolution of\nadministrative and political powers to those structures;\nsecondly, at the economic level, the agreement recommends\nthe implementation of a special programme of economic\nand social development in the northern part of the country.\nWith respect to the first aspect of the commitments\nundertaken in this important agreement, the responsibility\nof the Government is almost exclusive. But that is not true\nof the second aspect. Indeed, it is quite clear that the\nmotives for this rebellion, which started at the very time\nwhen the country had embarked on the road to democracy\nand institutionalization of freedoms, are primarily\neconomic. The northern area of Niger, after the past few\nyears of cyclical draught, was in a highly precarious\ncondition due to the upheaval of its ecosystem. Livestock\ngrazing became highly problematic, condemning nomadic\ncommunities to wandering and inducing in them a feeling\nof malaise, which quickly led to claims for a separate\nidentity. The only way to deal appropriately with this\nrebellion, which is, after all, only a symptom of the real\ndifficulties faced by these people, is to restore hope to all\nof these hard-hit regions. That is why the peace\nagreement provides for the holding on 30 and\n31 October 1995 of a round-table meeting involving all\nthe countries and institutions linked to Niger, with a view\nto preparing a special development programme for the\nnorthern area. I appeal to all those who wish to help\nNiger definitively restore and consolidate peace to kindly\nlend their support to this undertaking.\nOn the international level, the tragic conflicts in\nRwanda, Somalia, Liberia and the former Yugoslavia \u2014\nto refer only to them \u2014 bear witness eloquently to the\nfragility of the international order that emerged from the\nend of the cold war, and also to the inability of present\nstructures to provide an adequate collective response\nwhen national stability breaks down and when the ensuing\ninternal conflicts give rise to unspeakable suffering.\nThe situation of Rwanda is among those which,\ngiven their gravity and their undermining of the basic\nprinciples of our Organization, deserve special attention.\nMy country is following with great attention the efforts\nundertaken for a year now by the authorities of Rwanda\nto overcome the consequences of the tragic events that\ntook place there and to consolidate the work for national\nreconciliation and lasting peace.\nThe situation in Liberia, after a series of initiatives\nleading to the establishment of a new Council of State,\nhas taken a truly positive turn. This is an opportunity for\nme to extend my congratulations to the Economic\nCommunity of West African States (ECOWAS) and to all\nthose whose help has been so useful, in particular\nPresident Sani Abacha of Nigeria and President Rawlings\nof Ghana. I wish to congratulate the people of Liberia on\ntheir courage and encourage them to persevere on the\npath of peace and hope that they have paid so dear a\nprice to find again.\nIn Angola, Niger is following closely the progress\nachieved along the path to peace and we congratulate\nPresident Dos Santos and Mr. Savimbi. Niger is following\nwith the same attention the developing situation in\nWestern Sahara and we deplore the slow pace of the\nprocess for the restoration of peace there.\n12\n\n\nWith regard to the sanctions imposed on Libya by the\nSecurity Council, Niger believes that the constructive\nproposals made by the authorities of that country constitute\na serious basis for a resolution of this crisis, whose\nconsequences are so burdensome to the Libyan population\nand to neighbouring countries such as Niger.\nOutside of our continent, Niger welcomed the signing\non 13 September 1993 in Washington of the Agreements\nbetween the Palestine Liberation Organization and Israel\nenvisaging autonomy for the Gaza Strip and Jericho. The\nensuing dynamic led \u2014 after very hard work \u2014 to a\nsignificant breakthrough with the signing of the Agreement\non 28 September 1995 in Washington which extends\nautonomy to the West Bank.\nThe long tragedy in Bosnia and Herzegovina, a\nMember State of the United Nations, gives rise to many\nquestions about the capacity of our Organization to ensure\nrespect even for its principles. The Muslim population of\nthat country has suffered too much from the inconsistencies,\nimprovisations and hesitations of the international\ncommunity, while the Bosnian Serbs, grand masters of\nfait accompli politics, have been allowed to calmly continue\ntheir abominable practice of \u201cethnic cleansing\u201d, calling\nseriously into question the sovereignty and territorial\nintegrity of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\nNiger welcomed the military pressure exercised upon\nthe Serbs by our Organization and the North Atlantic Treaty\nOrganization last September, and we warmly welcome the\nlatest peace initiatives led by the United States of America\nwith a view to the return of peace to that region. We hope\nthat this great stride will provide a basis for bringing about\njust and lasting peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\nFifty years after its creation, the United Nations must\nstrengthen its mission of promoting dialogue and\ncooperation between peoples. It must, even more than in\nthe past, work to limit tensions as far as possible, and to\nsettle conflicts when they erupt but, in particular, to prevent\nsituations that could threaten international peace and\nsecurity.\nIn this spirit, in this special year in the life of our\ncommon Organization and in accordance with the principle\nof universality enshrined in Article 4 of the Charter, Niger\nhas advocated the establishment of an ad hoc committee to\nlook into the question of the representation of Taiwan.\nThe end of the cold war has not helped to shield the\nworld from the emergence of local conflicts any more than\nit has made it possible to remove the heavy burden\nweighing on mankind as a result of the stockpiling and\nimprovement of weapons. However, it is now an\nestablished fact that disarmament and the non-\nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction have a\npivotal role to play in preventing conflicts and promoting\npeace and social and economic development. For this\nreason, we can congratulate ourselves on the results of the\n1995 Review and Extension Conference of the Parties to\nthe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.\nThis Conference, in addition to agreeing on an indefinite\nextension of the Treaty, agreed that a comprehensive\nnuclear test-ban treaty would be concluded in 1996 at the\nlatest. Niger wishes to reaffirm its deep desire to see the\nnegotiations now under way lead to the conclusion of a\ntreaty that comprehensively bans nuclear tests, that is\nuniversal and that can be effectively monitored.\nOur attempts to prevent the proliferation of nuclear,\nchemical and biological weapons should not make us lose\nsight of the threat of conventional weapons and the need\nto control them.\nNiger is pleased to applaud here Mali\u2019s initiative\nwhich this year led the Secretary-General of our\nOrganization to dispatch a mission to the subregion of\nWest Africa to assess the negative impact of the illicit\ncirculation of small arms upon the States of the\nsubregion. We support the recommendations made by the\nSecretary-General following that mission and we retain\nthe hope that the international community, which gave\nmassive support to the relevant resolution, will give the\nbacking that is indispensable for the implementation of\nthese recommendations.\nIn recent years, our Organization has invested\nheavily in conflict prevention and management. Many\nresources and a great deal of time have been devoted to\nthis area, sometimes to the detriment of development\nmeasures. My delegation, however, remains convinced\nthat there is no greater threat to peace than the current\nstalemate in dialogue between rich and poor countries and\nthe widening of the various inequalities that have ensued.\nThis session is taking place at a time when the world\neconomic situation is riven by deep-seated imbalances.\nAlthough some regions have seen considerable progress,\nin other regions delays are becoming worse every year,\nsometimes leading to unprecedented crises. The poorest\ncountries seem to have been left on the sidelines of the\nprogress that the world economy has enjoyed. In some\ncountries the very structures of the State have fallen into\n13\n\n\ncomplete disrepair and populations have been plunged into\nthe deepest distress. Poverty, hunger and illiteracy plague\nmore than one-fifth of the world\u2019s population and in many\nparts of the world the situation is becoming dangerously\nworse.\nThe African continent is requesting, as a priority and\nurgently, the solidarity of the international community. The\nweaknesses of its structures persist and frequently grow\nworse. The current improvement in growth rates are still\ntoo weak to compensate for 15 years of economic decline.\nEconomic performances are disappointing even in countries\nthat have undertaken considerable reform.\nDespite the international community\u2019s commitments in\nthe framework of major conferences and summits of every\nkind, flows of official development assistance are falling off\nevery year. At a time when developing countries need it\nmost to support their reforms, official development\nassistance has fallen drastically and the general malaise\nsurrounding this assistance, christened \u201cdonor fatigue\u201d, is\ngrowing worse and worse.\nMy country regrets that not even the Economic and\nSocial Council high level segment on the development of\nAfrica, including the implementation of the United Nations\nNew Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s,\nnor the Mid-Term Global Review of the Implementation of\nthe Programme of Action for the Least Developed\nCountries for the 1990s which has just ended, has made it\npossible for the international community to arrive at a set\nof concrete measures that can reverse this trend by creating\nconditions for sustained and lasting economic recovery and\ndevelopment in the poorest countries.\nThe silent crisis of poverty, disease and illiteracy\nshould inspire the international community to tackle the\nroots of the evil by adopting a preventive and more\nconsistent approach to the resolution of these problems. The\nroots of the problem include the burden of external debt\nwhich continues to hamper the development efforts of\ndeveloping countries. Although we recognize the efforts to\nreschedule and write off debt under the Naples Terms, we\nmust point out that this is not enough.\nDonor countries are fully aware that they, along with\nthe multilateral financial institutions, are the main creditors\nof our countries and that a large part of the debt servicing\nthey finance simply returns to their treasuries and those of\nmultilateral institutions.\nFinancial flows on favourable terms are not usually\nenough to make up the financing deficit of poor countries.\nComprehensive and lasting solutions are needed if\nproblems are to be solved once and for all.\nThe radical structural reforms that developing\ncountries, especially the least developed among them,\nhave undertaken in their economies have proved to be\nvery costly in social and political terms and have not been\ngiven sufficient support by the international community.\nAlthough structural adjustment remains indispensable to\nremedy serious economic imbalances, the needs and\npriorities of the poorest and most vulnerable people\nshould not be neglected. Adjustment and transformation\nmust be designed to improve the well-being of\npopulations. There is good reason to encourage in practice\nGovernments to persevere, but they must also be helped\nto attenuate the severe impact of such reforms. The\nstruggle against poverty was one of the principal topics of\nthe World Summit for Social Development in\nCopenhagen last March. The international community\nmade courageous commitments, which we welcome, in\nparticular the commitment to supply the financial\nresources necessary for integrated strategies to combat\npoverty, unemployment and social exclusion. We remain\nhopeful that these commitments will be translated into\naction and initiatives at both the national and international\nlevels.\nThe Fourth World Conference on Women that has\njust recently ended in Beijing is also a landmark of our\ntime in so far as the international community reaffirmed\nthere the importance of the role of women, the main actor\nin and beneficiary of development, and committed itself\nto devoting greater resources to improving the status of\nwomen and their access to the political and economic life\nof our countries.\nThe Agenda for Development, which is now being\ndrafted and unanimously heralded as complementing the\n\u201cAgenda for Peace\u201d should provide the international\ncommunity with a new opportunity, in addition to just\nreaffirming principles, to focus on producing resources\ncommensurate with the task of implementing concrete\ndevelopment initiatives.\nA whole series of world conferences in recent years\nhas enabled us to forge a new vision of global\ndevelopment and to define the measures needed to turn\nthat vision into reality. The international community must\nurgently give tangible proof of its commitment to\nprogress along the path it has chosen.\n14\n\n\nAny delay can only make the remedy that much more\ndifficult and costly. The commemoration of the fiftieth\nanniversary of the United Nations, marking a half-century\nof the existence of our Organization, is highly symbolic and\nwe would be ill advised not to make judicious use of these\nsymbols. This is such a rare occasion that I believe we\nmust take advantage of it.\n"

And we assure him of our fullest\ncooperation and support in the tasks that devolve upon him.\nMay I take this opportunity to express our sincere\nappreciation to the President\u2019s distinguished predecessor,\nHis Excellency Mr. Amara Essy of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, for the\nadmirable and effective manner in which he conducted the\nbusiness of the forty-ninth session.\nLet me also renew my delegation\u2019s homage to\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali for the efficient and committed\nmanner in which he is carrying out his mission as\nSecretary-General.\nEvery year, we seize the opportunity of the session of\nthe General Assembly to share our views and concerns\nabout the state of international relations. In this fiftieth year\nof the existence of our Organization, I particularly wish to\naddress the Assembly from the perspective of a small island\nState.\nThe end of the cold war and the breakup of the Soviet\nbloc, the globalization of the world economy and the\nestablishment of the World Trade Organization to oversee\ninternational trade, the emergence of China as an economic\ngiant, the liberalization of the Indian economy and South\nAfrica\u2019s return to the community of nations, in such a short\nspan of time, have all contributed to rapid changes in the\nglobal economic scene.\nMy country shares the belief that regionalization is\na first prerequisite for smooth integration into a global\neconomic pattern. It was natural, therefore, that the region\nof the Indian Ocean could not remain isolated from the\nmovement towards regionalization, despite the fact that\nthe Indian Ocean countries form a heterogeneous zone\nwith a multiplicity of economic systems, political\ntraditions and cultural experiences. It is in this perspective\nthat Mauritius hosted, in March this year, the Indian\nOcean Rim (IOR) initiative. Built on the foundations of\nhistoric interchanges between nations in the Indian Ocean,\nthe IOR initiative could be seen both as a geographical\nreality and a natural economic entity. Its objective, as\nclearly outlined at the first meeting, is to establish a\nregional forum, tripartite in nature, that will bring together\nrepresentatives of Governments, business and academia\nfor the purpose of promoting economic cooperation in the\nregion. Although the IOR initiative has been launched\nwith an initial group, may I hasten to add that the IOR is\nopen to all the countries of the Indian Ocean region. As\nwe go along, the initiative will expand progressively to\ninclude other countries, on the basis of a coherent\nprogramme and plan of action.\nOther existing groupings, such as the Common\nMarket for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA), the\nSouthern African Development Community (SADC) \u2014 to\nwhich organization my country has recently been\nadmitted \u2014 and the Indian Ocean Commission, have\nalready contributed significantly to greater interaction in\nour region, and it is our hope that this new initiative will\nfurther pave the way for a dynamic integration of the\nIndian Ocean region into the global economic pattern. In\nthis regard, we look forward to, and will highly\nappreciate, the support of major regional groups and\ncountries in the implementation of this laudable initiative.\nIndeed, while we are making considerable efforts to\nensure the prosperity and advancement of our countries,\nwe are also very much aware that this cannot be achieved\nwithout the assistance of major players in the global\neconomy. At the same time, it is important that, at a time\nof growing interdependence among States and economies,\nefforts must be made to include developing countries in\nthe international economic decision-making process so as\nto achieve effective management of the global economy.\nThe Bretton Woods institutions \u2014 namely, the\nWorld Bank and the International Monetary Fund \u2014\n16\n\n\nshould be able to devise new ways and means of\nresponding to the development needs, priorities and\nspecificities of developing countries by providing adequate\nresources without stringent conditionalities. I should like\nhere to appeal to the international financial institutions to\nput aside, when circumstances demand, their first and\nforemost role of bankers and act more as partners in the\nglobal development process. For it is becoming increasingly\nclear that development problems cannot be solved by\ncountries on their own, whatever be their sense of\ncommitment and purpose. Africa, where countries are\nafflicted by deep-seated and chronic problems, is one such\nexample.\nMy country, therefore, welcomes the views expressed\nby the Secretary-General in his Agenda for Development,\nand in particular supports his d\u00e9marches to alleviate\nproblems and sufferings on the African continent. We wish\nin this regard to see the rapid implementation of the United\nNations New Agenda for the Development in Africa in the\n1990s and the Cairo Agenda for Action on Relaunching\nAfrican Economic and Social Development, as well as the\nrecommendations of the Bandung Asia-Africa Forum.\nAfrica, we know, is not alone, and we were gratified in\nSeptember last year by President Clinton\u2019s statement at the\nreception for African nations to the effect that\n\u201cThe United States has been, and will continue to be,\na partner in Africa\u2019s success story\u201d.\nThis is comforting, and we wish to see more concrete steps\nin this direction.\nI wish also to seize this opportunity to pay tribute to\ntwo decades of partnership between the countries of Africa,\nthe Caribbean and the Pacific and those of the European\nUnion, through the Lom\u00e9 Conventions. In a few weeks\u2019\ntime Mauritius will have the privilege and honour of\nhosting the signing of the second financial protocol of\nLom\u00e9 IV. While I pay tribute to this concrete example of\neffective partnership between the North and the South, it is\nour sincere hope that our partners of the European Union\nwill continue to support its traditional friends despite\nemerging demands nearer home.\nEconomic and socio-cultural progress cannot be\nsustained if man does not remain at the centre of\ndevelopment. In this context, education, training and\ninformation play a fundamental role. We firmly believe that\nit is extremely important to invest in human resources. In\nkeeping with this belief, education and training are provided\nfree of charge at primary and secondary levels in my\ncountry, to boys and girls and to men and women alike.\nAn educated and trained individual is in a better\nposition to respond and adapt to the changing needs of\nsociety and the developments taking place around him. As\nsuch, he is able to provide faster and better results. One\nof the scourges of developing nations remains an\ninadequate level of education and the lack of training\nfacilities and access to the latest information. Developing\ncountries, in fact, run the risk of being left outside the\nnetwork of rapidly evolving information technology. And\nyet can anyone deny the absolute need for small island\nStates like mine to be connected to the rest of the world\nthrough up-to-date information networks? Therefore,\nwhile the eradication of illiteracy and the provision of\neducation facilities should continue to remain a top\npriority of the United Nations, we should add to this the\ntransfer of information technology.\nWomen are a major agent of development, and they\nhave often been disadvantaged in their quest for education\nand training. Of course, to the United Nations, the\nadvancement of women is not a new cause. The year\n1975 was proclaimed International Women\u2019s Year,\nfollowed by the United Nations Decade for Women. Since\nthen, major United Nations conferences, such as the Earth\nSummit, in Rio, the World Conference on Human Rights,\nin Vienna, and others have repeatedly brought the plight\nof women to the fore, the most significant being the\nrecent Beijing Conference. The agreements concluded at\nBeijing recognized the pivotal role of women in our\nsociety and laid down the foundations for their\nparticipation as equal partners in development activities.\nMore important, however, will be the \u201cafter\u201d Beijing \u2014\nthe need to get down to the implementation of decisions\narrived at and the need to find ways and means of\nbuilding the bridges to allow for greater involvement of\nwomen in national and international matters.\nThe world this year befittingly witnessed two other\nimportant United Nations conferences: the World Summit\nfor Social Development in Copenhagen and the Review\nand Extension Conference of the States Parties to the\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons\n(NPT) in New York.\nThe Summit on Social Development called attention\nto the impact of the world economic system on the poor\nand underprivileged and helped to project new ideas for\nalternative models of social development. It also allowed\n17\n\n\nthe renewal of the world commitment to resolve the\nproblems of poverty, unemployment and social exclusion.\nFor its part, the non-proliferation Treaty, which came\ninto force in 1970, is important in several ways. It\nenshrines an undertaking between the five nuclear-weapon\nStates to begin serious nuclear disarmament negotiations\nand the non-nuclear countries not to acquire nuclear\nweapons in return for access to peaceful nuclear\ntechnology. It is a major international agreement the aim of\nwhich is to curb the spread of nuclear weapons and build\nconfidence among the nuclear-weapon States towards a\nreduction of their arsenals. The Treaty also provides the\nbasis for legitimate trade in nuclear technology for peaceful\npurposes.\nThe indefinite extension of the nuclear\nnon-proliferation Treaty in May this year can be considered\na landmark in the history of mankind, which has committed\nitself to free the world from the threat of nuclear weapons.\nUnfortunately, the optimism generated by the indefinite\nextension of the Treaty was short-lived in the wake of the\nresumption of recent nuclear testings. These activities are\ndefinitely not encouraging signs for the conclusion of a\ncomprehensive test-ban treaty in the foreseeable future.\nIn our region, however, we are confident that the\nAfrican Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone Treaty, which was\nrecently finalized in South Africa, will go a long way\ntowards contributing to international peace and security. It\ncovers a large part of the Indian Ocean and the Atlantic\nOcean, both containing major sea routes of the world. My\ndelegation sincerely hopes to see the speedy entry into force\nof this Treaty, which, among other issues, encompasses the\nintegrality of the territory of States members of the\nOrganization of African Unity as a nuclear-weapon-free\nzone.\nThe Vienna Conference was a turning-point for world\nperception of human rights. We hope that the principles and\nobjectives enshrined in the 1993 Vienna Declaration and\nProgramme of Action on human rights may in time be\nrecognized and effectively respected in all corners of the\nworld. My country has always upheld human rights and\nfavoured their promotion and protection. But at the same\ntime, in the field of human rights, we believe that we have\nto move with caution lest we run the risk of damaging the\ninterests of those very individuals and societies that we are\npurporting to protect in the short run.\nNevertheless, this should not prevent us from\ncombining our best efforts in all good faith to bring about\na just and equitable society by trying to win the\nconfidence of the peoples, societies and Governments\nrather than by threatening them economically, militarily\nor otherwise. The upholding of human values and uplift\nof humanity should continue to remain our main concern\nat all times and in the best interests of humanity. It is for\nthis reason that we should seize every opportunity to\napplaud the restoration of human rights and democracy,\nregardless of other considerations. We are delighted,\ntherefore, at the long-awaited liberation of Mrs. Aung San\nSuu Kyi this year, which we feel has opened up new\navenues for dialogue in Myanmar.\nDuring the past few years in particular, the United\nNations has become increasingly identified in the public\nperception with the Blue Helmets. The growing focus on\nthe activities of the peace-keepers is such that their\nsuccesses and failures often affect the credibility of our\nOrganization. Peace-keeping is an important tool for\nconflict resolution; its success depends to a large extent\non a strong political will on the part of Member States, a\nclear mandate to the peace-keepers and solid material,\nlogistical and financial support. However, one of the main\nfactors for conflict resolution remains the early\nidentification of potential conflicts and tensions. While\narms and weapons can be used to threaten and\ntemporarily silence those involved in the conflicts, lasting\npeace can be achieved only through moral persuasion, the\nremoval of fear and despair, and the instilling of hope and\nsecurity in the minds of people. The need, therefore, to\nstrengthen the arms of preventive diplomacy becomes\nimperative.\nIn the recent past, the United Nations has been\nincreasingly called upon to carry out peace-keeping and\npeacemaking operations. In fact, the number of demands\nmade on the Organization is now straining its resources\nalmost to the breaking-point. The erratic and reluctant\ndisbursement of contributions by some Member States has\nhighlighted the shortcomings of such operations and\nexposed the limits of this approach in ensuring peace and\nstability. We therefore need more than ever to place much\ngreater emphasis on preventive diplomacy and allocate\nmore resources to this activity. We believe that, in the\nlong run, the cost of supporting programmes in\n18\n\n\npreventive diplomacy would be far outweighed by the\nactual costs of dispatching Blue Helmets around the world.\nIn this respect, we urge the international community\nstrongly to support regional initiatives, such as the\nmechanism for conflict prevention, management and\nresolution of the Organization of African Unity (OAU). The\nexperience of my country as a result of my own personal\nparticipation in several ministerial missions organized by\nthe OAU in the context of this mechanism has convinced\nus to put greater reliance in this approach. My delegation\nwould therefore like to appeal to this body to make a strong\ncommitment to the realization of this very important\nprogramme.\nThe establishment of an early-warning system and\nthreat-assessment unit at the United Nations could equally\nsupport the proposed OAU early-warning system. This\nwould go a long way towards preparing the United Nations\nto deal with the contemporary challenges of peace-keeping\nand peace-building at a more realistic cost. Yet I would\nappeal for more cohesion and harmonization among the\nvarious conflict-prevention and conflict-resolution\nmechanisms in order to avoid duplication of efforts.\n(spoke in French)\nAt this point, my delegation should like to refer to the\nincreasing activities of the francophone movement in the\nareas of conflict prevention and peace-keeping. We\nwelcome the encouraging results of the work of the recent\nconference of French-speaking countries on conflict\nprevention, which took place in Canada. Among the\nrecommendations of that conference, we note in particular\nthe one relating to the support of the francophone\nmovement for the pan-African mechanism for conflict\nprevention, management and resolution.\nIt is true that the movement has no great means at its\ndisposal, but it has none the less been able to lend\nconsiderable support in the recent past to certain United\nNations programme in the area of human rights and the\nprocess of democratization. With respect to those two areas,\nI also wish to highlight the important activities of the\nmovement over the past two years in the countries of the\nAfrican Great Lakes region following the tragic events that\ntook place there.\nIn December, at Cotonou, my Prime Minister will be\npassing on the presidency of the movement to the President\nof Benin. I wish to take this opportunity to express my\ngreat satisfaction at the way in which, during his term of\noffice, the political dimension of the French-speaking\nmovement\u2019s work on the international level has\ndeveloped. I should like to express the hope that this\npolitical facet of the movement will in future be able to\nplay a growing role in international forums in striving for\nthe realization of lasting peace in the world.\n(spoke in English)\nWe are already witnessing promising developments\nin conflict resolution in regions such as Angola,\nMozambique and the Middle East. We commend the\nrecent initiatives in Bosnia and exhort all parties\nconcerned to continue to intensify their efforts to find a\nlong-term solution, and hope that the long-awaited peace\nin this region is achieved not under the threat of guns, but\nthrough the goodwill, understanding and tolerance of all\nconcerned.\nMy delegation recognizes that the fiftieth anniversary\nof the United Nations provides a golden opportunity for\nthe re-examination and the renewal of the United Nations\nsystem, and welcomes the initiative launched in the\nGeneral Assembly to negotiate a reform of the Security\nCouncil. We believe that the present 15-member\ncomposition of the Security Council does not reflect the\nrealities of the economic and political changes of the past\ndecades. In its present composition, the Security Council\ncan neither claim to take into account the positions of\nnations in the next 50 years, nor reasonably pretend to\nspeak on behalf of 185 nations for the maintenance of\nworld peace and security. The Security Council has\nindeed the main task of maintaining peace and security.\nHowever, the concept of world security has itself\nundergone a huge transformation. We are now more at\nrisk from the threat of economic, social, cultural and\nreligious upheavals and turmoils than from the outbreak\nof war resulting from conflicts between States or a group\nof States. Consequently, if the Security Council is to\ncommand full respect in all parts of the world and enjoy\nlegitimacy, it should undergo a complete overhaul.\nIn the context of the current exercise on the\nexpansion of the Security Council, we believe that the\nclaim of India, the largest parliamentary democracy, to a\npermanent seat on the Security Council is legitimate. In\nthe same spirit, countries from other regions, including\nsmall island States, could equally aspire to permanent\nseats in an expanded Security Council.\nThe world has gradually been reduced to a global\nvillage. The regions of the world and their peoples,\n19\n\n\nalthough still widely separated geographically, are fast\nrealizing that the future of the world community lies in a\ncommon shared goal. We are increasingly becoming aware\nthat the world is one family, and that if we are to assure a\nbrighter and better future for coming generations, we have\nno other choice than to continue our efforts towards\npreserving and promoting a strong United Nations that will\nbe able to pursue a common purpose for a world of equity,\njustice and shared economic progress.\nIn Mauritius, in spite of the existence of many cultures\nand religions, we have been successful in promoting\npeaceful coexistence. We have always believed that no\nmeaningful progress can be achieved in the absence of\npeace and harmony. We have always believed in our people\nand have actively promoted the culture of tolerance and\nmutual respect. We remain deeply committed to the\nprinciples of democracy and justice. The path of tolerance\nand mutual respect for different faiths and religions and the\nacceptance of unity in diversity laid down under the\ninspiring leadership of the Father of the Nation, Sir\nSeewoosagur Ramgoolam, since independence in 1968 and\nfollowed through relentlessly by our present Prime Minister,\nSir Anerood Jugnauth have been largely responsible for the\nharmonious way of life in Mauritius.\nIn conclusion, I should like on the occasion of the\nfiftieth anniversary of our Organization to share with the\ninternational community our rich experience of living in\npeace and harmony.\n"

        "file_text": "At the outset allow me, on\nbehalf of my country\u2019s delegation, to congratulate Mr.\nDiogo Freitas do Amaral on his election to the presidency\nof this important session of the General Assembly. His\nunanimous election to this high office attests to the role that\nhis friendly country, Portugal, with which my country has\nenjoyed centuries of ties, plays in the international arena.\nHis election is also testimony to his ability and wide\ndiplomatic experience which, we are sure, will enable the\nGeneral Assembly to achieve the results we hope for.\nI should also like to take this opportunity to pay\nspecial tribute to his predecessor, Mr. Amara Essy, the\nForeign Minister of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, for the skill and\nconstructive manner in which he steered the work of the\nforty-ninth session.\nThe convening of this session coincides with the\nfiftieth anniversary of the international community\u2019s\nagreement to establish the United Nations in order to\nsafeguard international peace and security after the\nexperience of two world wars. We are aware of the\nsignificant role that the United Nations has played ever\nsince the end of the Second World War in maintaining the\nbalance between the world Powers during what was known\nas the cold war era. That outstanding role of the United\nNations was at the heart of the international cooperation\nthat was given concrete form in enabling the peoples of the\nthird world, with the help of the United Nations, to free\nthemselves from the shackles of colonialism in Africa, Asia\nand South America. The United Nations bodies and\nspecialized agencies helped the newly independent States to\norganize their socio-economic resources thanks to the\npersistent efforts of the Secretaries-General who headed the\nSecretariat and the respective Executive Secretaries of the\nspecialized agencies. Here it is only fitting to remember\nMr. Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld, the Organization\u2019s second\nSecretary-General, who gave his life while working on\nbehalf of the United Nations in the Congo in 1961. We\nshould also remember those who were at the helm of the\nSecretariat beside Mr. Hammarskj\u00f6ld \u2014 Mr. Trygve Lie,\nthe first Secretary-General, U Thant, Mr. Kurt Waldheim,\nMr. J\u00e1vier Perez de Cu\u00e9llar and the current Secretary-\nGeneral, Mr. Boutros Boutros- Ghali \u2014 who have all\nplayed a significant role in strengthening mutual\nunderstanding amongst nations and helped the world to\nfind peaceful solutions to its conflicts.\nThe history of the United Nations is full of many\nother figures who played an important role in promoting\nits march and in serving international peace and security.\nBy way of example I mention Count Bernadotte, the\nInternational Peace Mediator in Palestine; General Burns,\nthe Commander of the International Emergency Force in\nthe Middle East; Mr. Gunnar Jarring, the International\nPeace Mediator between the Arabs and Israelis after the\nwar of 1967; Mr. James Grant, the late Executive Director\nof the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund; Sadruddin Aga\nKhan, the United Nations High Commissioner for\nRefugees for many years; the late Olaf Palme, former\nPrime Minister of Sweden; the late Willy Brandt, former\nChancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany;\nMr. Brian Urquhart, the former Under-Secretary-General\nfor Political Affairs; and many other brilliant figures who\nworked tirelessly and faithfully in these corridors.\nWe should also like to mention in particular the\ngreat achievements of the United Nations in the\nframework of its specialized agencies. Nobody can deny\nthe achievements of these agencies in their respective\nfields of competence such as food and agriculture, science\nand education, civil aviation, architecture, reconstruction,\nhealth, postal services and telecommunications,\nmeteorology, intellectual property, development, the\nliberalization of trade, not to mention the brilliant\nachievements of the humanitarian and development\norganizations such as the United Nations Environment\nProgramme (UNEP), United Nations Children\u2019s Fund\n(UNICEF), the Office of the United Nations High\nCommissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the United\nNations Development Programme (UNDP) and the United\nNations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees\nin the Near East (UNRWA) as well as the remarkable\nrole played by the other relevant regional organizations\nand committees within the framework of the United\nNations.\nThese achievements constitute part of the rich assets\naccumulated by the United Nations over the 50 years that\nhave elapsed since it was established with the aim of\nmaintaining international peace and security. We believe\n18\n\n\nthat although the Organization has come a long way in\nlaying the foundations of international peace and security,\nglobal peace in its broadest sense has yet to be achieved.\nTherefore, it is incumbent upon us all to support the United\nNations in its forward movement in that direction so that\nthe edifice of peace and international security may be\ncompleted and maintained.\nThe establishment of the World Trade Organization\n(WTO) with the aim of organizing and coordinating world\ntrade, eliminating the obstacles that obstruct access to\nforeign markets and encouraging the movement of capital\nand investment is another milestone on the way towards\nconsolidating the edifice of international peace and security.\nThe WTO should receive every support from the\ninternational community. The agreement on its\nestablishment under the auspices of the United Nations\nshould be an incentive and a challenge to the developing\ncountries to promote the level of their economic and social\ndevelopment, increase their productive capacity and upgrade\nthe level of their services in order for them to qualify to\nintegrate their interests with those of the developed\ncountries.\nBy the same token, the establishment of the WTO\nwith the aim of achieving international economic balance\non a basis of justice, equality and sustainable development,\nin no way remits the developed countries\u2019 obligations\ntowards supporting and assisting the developing countries\nin working for that integration of their economies with the\neconomies of the developed countries. As a matter of fact,\nthose obligations are stipulated in the WTO agreement.\nIn the context of the United Nations action to\nconsolidate the foundations of international peace and\nsecurity, the Organization has managed, after 14 years of\nstrenuous efforts, to conclude the United Nations\nConvention on the Law of the Sea in 1982. The entry into\nforce of that Convention on 16 November 1994 is but\nanother example of international cooperation in order to\nestablish an equitable, just international order to govern the\nocean space. Also, the recent efforts in this context with\nregard to Part XI of this important international Convention\nwill no doubt enhance its universality.\nIn the area of disarmament, the United Nations has\nperformed an outstanding role, even at the height of the\ncold war, as evinced by the signing of the Treaty on the\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). The signing\nby more than 159 States of the Convention on the\nProhibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling\nand Use of Chemical Weapons and on Their Destruction is\nyet another historic United Nations achievement. The\nConvention was the first to deal with the elimination of\nthis category of overkill weapons on a global scale. It\npaved the way for agreement on the elimination of all\nother weapons of mass destruction.\nAs regards the protection of the environment, the\ninternational community has witnessed the dedication of\nworld leaders at the 1992 Rio Conference to the task of\nhalting the degradation of the environment. The United\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the\nConvention on Biological Diversity and Agenda 21 that\nresulted from this unique Conference have laid the\nfoundations of a world partnership that addresses the\nproblems of desertification, poverty and the degradation\nof the ecosystem which arise from the unrestrained use of\nnatural resources.\nAll these conventions and programmes have gone on\nthe record book as uncontested achievements\naccomplished by the United Nations. Such achievements\napart, however, the United Nations has proved to be\nunable to cope with regional political issues that have\ninternational dimensions and are closely related to risks\nthat could jeopardize international peace and security.\nWhen the cold war ended, regional problems erupted on\nthe heels of each other and faced the United Nations and\nregional organizations alike with a real challenge.\nWith regard to the Middle East question, which we\nbelieve to be one of the most significant issues that\nconcern the world at large, an important breakthrough has\ntaken place on 28 September 1995, when the Israeli and\nPalestinian sides signed an historic accord in Washington\nD.C. that provides for the expansion of Palestinian self-\nrule. While we commend the accord, we voice the hope\nthat it will enable the Palestinian people to achieve the\nobjective of extending its authority over its own land and\nof building its national entity. My country also hopes that\nthe progress achieved on the Palestinian-Israeli track will\nlead to the activation of the Syrian-Israeli and the\nLebanese-Israeli tracks. Lack of progress on those two\ntracks is a negative signal that does not serve the interests\nof a just and comprehensive peace. If such peace is to be\nachieved, we believe that the negotiators on all sides have\nto put behind them all the residual suspicions and political\nnegativism of the past, free their political will and look at\nthe present with a futuristic vision of a world that no\nlonger knows geographical boundaries thanks to the\ntechnological progress we now witness in every aspect of\nlife.\n19\n\n\nIn Iraq, the Iraqi Government has yet to respond to all\nthe requirements of the relevant Security Council\nresolutions so as to allow the lifting of the embargo\nimposed by the United Nations on Iraq. We, in common\nwith others, were greatly surprised at the serious, important\ninformation disclosed recently by the Iraqi Government\nregarding its programme of weapons of mass destruction.\nRegardless of the reasons that led Iraq not to disclose these\nprogrammes in the past, the confidence of the international\ncommunity in Iraq has been dealt a severe blow because\nIraq had concealed this information in spite of the requests\nfrom the Special Commission. In the light of these new\ndevelopments which necessitate the continuation of the\nwork of the Special Commission for a long time to come,\nmy country appeals to the international community to\ndouble its efforts towards mitigating the suffering of the\nbrotherly people of Iraq. By the same token, Iraq is\nrequired, now more than ever before, to reconsider its\nrejection of Security Council resolution 986 (1995) which,\nin our view, provides Iraq with a good opportunity to\nreduce some of the suffering of the brotherly people of\nIraq.\nWe call on Iraq once again seriously to provide all the\ninformation and means still in its possession to the Special\nCommission. We hope that Iraq\u2019s compliance and\ncooperation in this matter will give the United Nations\naccess to the crucial information regarding the Iraqi\nprogrammes on weapons of mass destruction and pave the\nway towards the eventual lifting of the embargo from\nwhich the Iraqi people have endured record suffering over\nthe past five years.\nIn the context of Iraq\u2019s commitment to Security\nCouncil resolutions, in particular resolution 686 (1991), we\ncall on the Iraqi Government to cooperate further with the\ntripartite Committee that deals with the question of Kuwaiti\ndetainees and the expatriates of other countries detained in\nIraq, and to provide the said committee with detailed\ninformation on those detainees. Any progress made in this\ndirection will be viewed as a demonstration of the good\nintentions of Iraq and its desire to cooperate with other\nStates.\nIn Somalia, despite the persistent efforts of the United\nNations and other regional organizations, the situation in\nthat country gives no cause for optimism due to the total\ndisregard some Somali leaderships show towards the\ninterests of the brotherly people of Somalia.\nIn Afghanistan, although the United Nations has\ndeployed and continues to deploy special efforts to restore\npeace to this war-ravaged country, there is no abatement\nof the hostilities and bloodshed caused by the strife of the\ndifferent factions in that country. On the other hand, we\nview with optimism the progress achieved in the peace\nprocesses undertaken by the United Nations in Angola,\nMozambique, and Liberia, and call upon the international\ncommunity to deploy all possible efforts towards the\nmitigation of the suffering of the people of Rwanda who\ncontinue to be in the grip of ethnic and political conflicts\nbetween the warring factions in their country.\nIn the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, despite\nthe United Nations and the commendable efforts of its\npeace-keeping forces to halt the bloodshed in this\nfledgling republic in the heart of Europe, the insurrection\nof the Bosnian Serbs and their continued defiance of the\ninternational community have resulted in frustrating all\nthose concerted efforts. The recent events in Krajina and\nthe North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) air raids\non Serbian positions have restored a certain degree of\nbalance between Bosnia and the Serbs who seem to\nunderstand nothing but the logic of force. This has shown\nthe validity of the logical call to enable the Government\nof the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina to exercise its\nlegitimate right to self-defence.\nIn this connection, obviously, the Agreement of\nPrinciple signed under the supervision of the Contract\nGroup at Geneva on 3 September 1995 by the Foreign\nMinisters of the Republics of Bosnia and Herzegovina,\nCroatia, and the former Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia\nand Montenegro) constitutes a significant step towards\npeace. However, it is the duty of the international\ncommunity to exert great efforts to overcome the\ndifficulties facing the United Nations and to ensure that\nthe principles agreed on are translated into lasting peace\nin the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\nThere is no doubt that such regional issues face the\nUnited Nations with a real challenge and pose serious\nthreats to international peace and security. In addition,\nthey have created human tragedies as a result of such\natrocities as \u201cethnic cleansing\u201d and the horrors of famine\nand mass killings, not to mention the heavy financial\nburden they have put on the resources of the world\neconomy and on the people who have fallen victim to the\natrocities. In the light of all this, how can the United\nNations face up to all these responsibilities at a time\nwhen its ability to deploy efforts is receding because of\nthe over-bureaucratization of its various organs and failure\nby many Member States to honour their financial\nobligations? The situation is complex, but it is one that\n20\n\n\ncan be dealt with by restructuring United Nations organs in\na more cost-effective manner so that the goals set may be\nachieved over the short-, medium- and long-term in\nconsonance with basic objectives so that the Organization\nmay enter the coming century equipped with firm\ninstructions to make international peace and security the\nbasic underpinnings of social and economic development.\nWith regard to the Security Council, my country feels\nthat while preserving the tasks entrusted to it, we must also\nfind an effective mechanism to enable the General\nAssembly to make an effective contribution in dealing with\ncrucial international issues so that all Member States may\nparticipate in implementing United Nations resolutions and\nprogrammes in line with the provisions of the Charter, in\nthe interests of international peace and security as well as\neconomic and social development. Proceeding from this,\nmy delegation calls upon the international community to\nsupport the efforts of the United Nations as the principal\nbody entrusted with addressing various crucial questions\nthroughout the world. Those are our policies at all levels.\nAt the regional level, my country seeks to build bridges of\ndialogue and cooperation between all countries in the belief\nthat this serves the interests of international peace and\nsecurity. We also seek to encourage and support all regional\nand international groupings in the same spirit and with the\nsame goals in view. At the national level, my country\ndeeply believes that the maintenance of regional and\ninternational peace provides the most important means of\nimplementing our national economic and social plans. With\nGod\u2019s will, we have managed to settle with our neighbours\nthe problems regarding our borders, which has afforded us\na golden opportunity to channel our national capabilities\ntowards the implementation of our ambitious national\neconomic and social programmes.\nBenefiting from the past wealth of economic\nexperience and in pursuit of the economic objective Oman\ncharted 25 years ago, my Government, with the assistance\nof such international bodies as the World Bank and other\neconomic experts, organized a conference on the future\nperspectives of the Omani economy by the year 2020,\nwhich was held at Muscat, the capital, on 3 and 4 June\n1995. With the participation of a broad segment of the\npublic and private sectors of Omani society and a select\nnumber of international organizations and world economic\nfigures, that conference laid out the basic lines of the\nOmani strategy for future Omani development, among\nwhich are the development of human resources, the\npromotion of women\u2019s participation therein, the\ndevelopment of the private sector so that it may become the\ndriving force of the national economy, the encouragement\nof economic diversity, the encouragement of a suitable\neconomic balance between the economy of Oman and the\nrest of the world and the conservation of the environment\nand its exploitation for peaceful purposes. My\nGovernment\u2019s peaceful endeavour to implement those\nstrategies represents the best means by which my country\nwill enter the next century on a solid basis, that would\nenable the Omani people to expand their economic\nresources and benefit from the technological progress we\nfeel will govern the world economy and all its means of\nproduction and marketing.\nThis option, with regard to the means of national\ndevelopment, will surely serve the cause of peace and\nsecurity. God willing, we look forward to a future filled\nwith promise for our future generations.\n"

        "file_text": "May I be permitted\nto offer to His Excellency Mr. Freitas do Amaral my\nsincere congratulations on his election to the high post of\nPresident of the golden fiftieth session of the General\nAssembly. I am confident that, under his able\nstewardship, the Assembly will succeed in advancing the\nnoble aims and objectives of our Charter. I wish also to\nrecord my delegation\u2019s profound appreciation to his\npredecessor, Ambassador Amara Essy of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire,\nwho presided most ably over the various activities of our\nAssembly during the forty-ninth session.\nThe year 1995 is to be singled out for its landmark\nanniversaries. The fiftieth anniversary of the end of the\nSecond World War is being observed worldwide with a\nrenewed sense of comprehension of its painful lessons.\nThis coincides with the golden jubilee of the\nfounding of the United Nations, which embodies in its\nCharter the aspirations of our forefathers who, having\nstood actual witnesses to the horrors of a most devastating\nwar, pledged to save succeeding generations from the\nscourge of war and settle international disputes by\npeaceful means.\nAt the time of this historic celebration it is only\nfitting to pay tribute to the architects of the Charter,\nwhose vision inspired it with continued viability and\nvalidity.\n15\n\n\nThe family of the United Nations has come to\nembrace 185 sovereign States, a fact that unequivocally\nattests to the genuine universality and validity of its\nunderlying purposes and principles. The world Organization\nhas throughout served as a powerful engine for bringing\nabout dramatic changes both in the domain of international\nrelations and in the development process of nations.\nThe United Nations is to be credited with impressive\naccomplishments in strengthening international peace and\nsecurity, marshalling the efforts of the international\ncommunity to put an end to colonialism and apartheid,\nensuring the independence and sovereignty of developing\ncountries and supporting their socio-economic development,\nadvocating human rights and fundamental freedoms and\nprotecting and preserving the environment, as well as in\npromoting education, culture, science and health.\nIt can be said that at the heart of these\naccomplishments lies the international community\u2019s\ngrowing realization of the prevalence of global priorities\nand the objective trends in historical developments, along\nwith the wisdom of mastering the philosophy of fine-tuning\nthe differing interests of States.\nHowever, the book of the Organization\u2019s half-century\nhistory does not consist exclusively of success stories.\nThere are chapters portraying the set-backs and failures of\nthe United Nations when it was effectively handicapped by\nthe then prevalent ideological antagonisms and military-bloc\nconfrontation. There were times when sovereign States\ncould not exercise their right to become Members of the\nUnited Nations. Mongolia, for one, which steadfastly sided\nwith the Allied forces and other peace-loving nations during\nthe Second World War, and made its humble contribution\nto the great victory, was until 1961 prevented from\nexercising its legitimate right to join the world\nOrganization.\nThe upcoming solemn celebration of the fiftieth\nanniversary of the United Nations by the largest ever\ngathering of world leaders demonstrates that the\ninternational community, by associating its present and its\nfuture with the United Nations, is placing its hopes and\naspirations in the Organization. We hope that the special\ncommemorative meeting will be crowned with the adoption\nof the visionary document reaffirming the underlying\npurposes and principles of the Charter and outlining\nforward-looking strategies commensurate with the\nchallenges of the new millennium. In this regard, the\nSecretary-General\u2019s stimulating reports \u201cAn Agenda for\nPeace\u201d and \u201cAn Agenda for Development\u201d and their\nsubsequent supplements help greatly in revamping our\nconcepts of peace, security and development, as well as\nin our collective reflection on our future.\nThe United Nations has served as a catalyst for\nconvening a series of global conferences \u2014 conferences\non the protection of children, on the environment, on\nhuman rights, on population and social development and\non the advancement of women \u2014 resulting in the\nformulation of common strategies and specific platforms\nfor action, now and into the twenty-first century. In order\nto ensure the full implementation of this comprehensive\nstrategy of sustainable human development it is\nimperative to streamline the existing machinery for\nmultilateral cooperation. Here, I wish to emphasize the\nurgent need for reform to take in the entire system of the\nUnited Nations, including the Bretton Woods institutions,\nby, inter alia, increasing the effectiveness of organizations\nin the economic and social fields, as well as improving\ntheir coordination.\nMomentous post-cold-war change has, in fact, failed\nto embrace international economic relations \u2014 an area of\nmajor concern to the United Nations. The persisting\ninequities and imbalances, as well as protectionist\ntendencies, the growing external-debt burden, the inability\nto participate equally in international decision-making and\ndeclining official development assistance flows, weigh\nheavily on the efforts of the developing countries\neffectively to address the pressing socio-economic\nproblems that they face.\nMongolia fully supports the efforts of the Non-\nAligned Movement and the Group of 77 to call the\nattention of the international community, and of the\nGroup of Seven in particular, to the question of\naddressing these acute problems. It goes without saying\nthat this common objective can be attained only through\njoint North-South action.\nThe persistence and proliferation of wars and crisis\nsituations testify to the fact that conventional attitudes\ntowards the use of force as a standard means of settling\ndisputes have not been done away with and that the worth\nof the human person and his or her right to life continue\nto be denied.\nAgainst this backdrop, the United Nations has seen\nover the last few years a marked expansion in its\nactivities in the area of peace-keeping, peacemaking and\npreventive diplomacy. Despite the difficulties encountered\nand the growing complexity of their missions, the peace-\n16\n\n\nkeeping operations have largely succeeded in places where\nthey have intervened for the purposes of restoring peace\nand normality. The failures suffered by the United Nations\nshould not, however, frustrate its efforts in the future.\nLessons drawn from these failures should help the\nOrganization to weigh its potentials and limitations\nrealistically and to act within mandates that are clear and\nattainable.\nIf the Security Council is to reflect today\u2019s realities\nand to live up to the challenges ahead, the reform\nprocess \u2014 democratization of its working methods and the\nintroduction of greater transparency into its activities \u2014\nshould be further intensified. It is Mongolia\u2019s considered\nview that expansion of the Security Council should be\nbased on the principles of fairness and equitable\nrepresentation. This should be ensured by, inter alia, the\nadmission of countries with a global reach, like Japan and\nGermany, as well as representatives of developing\ncountries.\nIt is important to take specific steps to ensure the full\nimplementation of the resolution on the protection and\nsecurity of small States adopted at the last session.\nMongolia welcomes the Secretary-General\u2019s report on the\nspecific development needs of small Member States, and\nexpects that the ideas and recommendations that it contains\nwill be duly reflected in the activities of the United\nNations.\nMongolia highly appreciates the international\ncommunity\u2019s understanding of the problems and hardships\nfaced by countries in transition and the support for their\nefforts to integrate into the world economy. We deem it\nimportant that the General Assembly has decided to\nconsider this issue at its fifty-first session. My delegation\nhopes that the report on this subject to be prepared by the\nSecretary-General will take due account of the\ncharacteristics of all countries \u2014 in particular, geographic\nlocation, climatic conditions and infrastructure development,\namong others.\nWe applaud the entry into force of the Convention on\nthe Law of the Sea, which is widely acclaimed as one of\nthe historic achievements of United Nations cooperative\nefforts. There is no need to emphasize the importance of\nthat Convention to countries like Mongolia, which is a\ngeographically disadvantaged, land-locked developing\ncountry with an unfavourable road and transportation\nenvironment.\nThe Mongolian delegation expresses its hope that the\nGeneral Assembly will at its present session endorse the\nrecommendations adopted last June by the Second\nMeeting of Governmental Experts from Land-locked and\nTransit Developing Countries and Representatives of\nDonor Countries and Financial and Development\nInstitutions.\nWe believe that the World Trade Organization will\nfacilitate the integration of developing countries into the\ninternational trading system and ensure the protection of\ntheir interests through benefits derived from the trade-\ndiscipline mechanism.\nThe disarmament agenda was highlighted this year\nby the Review and Extension Conference of the Parties to\nthe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons\n(NPT), which considered the operation of the Treaty and\ndecided on its indefinite extension.\nAmong the important objectives and principles\naimed at strengthening the nuclear disarmament process\nwith practical measures, special mention should be made\nof those related to the conclusion of a comprehensive test-\nban treaty. It is, however, deplorable that two nuclear-\nweapon States Parties to the Non-Proliferation Treaty,\ncontrary to the commitments undertaken, are conducting\nnuclear tests and have announced their intention to\ncontinue them. A zero-yield comprehensive test-ban\nrecently announced by the United States Administration\nwill, in our view, speed up the negotiations on the treaty\nso that it may be concluded next year.\nWe wish to express our concern over the slow pace\nof ratification of the chemical weapons Convention, which\nis unnecessarily delaying its entry into force. We call\nupon those countries that have not yet done so to ratify\nthe Convention as soon as possible.\nMongolia welcomes the interim agreement on the\nsecond stage of autonomy reached by the Palestine\nLiberation Organization (PLO) and Israel within the\nframework of achieving the full realization of the\nPalestinian people\u2019s right to self-determination. That\nagreement represents a major step towards consolidating\nthe peace process in the Middle East.\nMy delegation also expresses its satisfaction at the\nrecent agreements regarding the former Yugoslavia, which\ngive us hope for the eventual solution of the protracted\ncrisis there.\n17\n\n\nWe believe that the Eleventh Conference of Heads of\nState or Government of Non-Aligned Countries, which will\ntake place in Colombia shortly, will outline the tasks of the\nMovement in the years to come and will make its\ncontribution to the efforts of the world community aimed at\nsolving a host of interrelated problems of strengthening\ninternational peace and security and promoting development\nand progress.\nIt is of great importance that with the strengthening of\npeace, stability and economic growth in the Asia-Pacific\nregion, the contours of regional and subregional cooperation\nare becoming more pronounced. The progress achieved in\nresolving the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula has had\na positive bearing on the prospects of overall settlement in\nthat part of our region.\nMongolia, in line with its foreign-policy priorities, is\nendeavouring to participate more actively in the process of\nregional integration. We trust that this stance will enjoy\ngreater support from other Governments.\nMore than five years have elapsed since Mongolia\nembarked upon the road of democracy and economic\nliberalization. A solid foundation for a new political fabric\nand its legal guarantees has been laid down. The economic\ndecline has been checked, and signs of recovery are being\ndiscerned. We are gratified by the support and assistance of\nthe world community, donor countries and international\norganizations, which continue to play an important role in\nconsolidating these positive beginnings.\nHowever, the hardships of transition are still being\nacutely felt as, inter alia, our gross national product is quite\nfar from its pre-crisis level, living standards are in decline\nand poverty is on the rise. Under these circumstances, my\nGovernment, in addition to mobilizing its own resources to\nthe utmost, is compelled to seek further assistance from\noutside. In this regard, we look forward to the fifth donor\nmeeting, to be held in Tokyo early next year.\nIn conclusion, may I express my confidence that at\nthis commemorative session the General Assembly will\nconsider the items on its agenda in a constructive manner\nand will adopt decisions responding to the challenges\nahead.\n"

        "file_text": "It is a pleasure for me to\ncongratulate you on your election to the presidency of the\nfiftieth session of the General Assembly. Your unanimous\nelection to this lofty post is a tribute paid by the\ninternational community to your country and to you\npersonally. It also bespeaks recognition of your abilities and\nskills. To your predecessor, Mr. Amara Essy, the president\nof the forty-ninth session, who demonstrated great\ndedication and a high level of efficiency, we should like to\nextend our deep appreciation for his efforts and skill.\nOn this occasion, I cannot fail to express my\ndelegation\u2019s appreciation to the Secretary-General of our\nOrganization, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for his tireless\nefforts to enhance the United Nations and increase its\neffectiveness. Through his \u201cSupplement to An Agenda for\nPeace'\u201d, he has demonstrated once again high initiative in\nseeking to enable the United Nations to rise to the\nchallenges of today\u2019s highly complex world.\nThis session of the General Assembly convenes on an\nimportant occasion. In a few days, celebrations will\ncommence to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the\nfounding of the United Nations with the aim of sparing\nhumanity the repetition of the suffering it had endured as a\nresult of two world wars. This historical occasion, which\nmarks the end of the post-war era with all its ramifications,\naffords us an opportunity to take stock, while we celebrate,\nof the Organization\u2019s progress over the past five decades,\nto evaluate its performance, and to seek the ways and\nmeans whereby it could overcome the negatives that in\nthe past prevented it from achieving its goals. In so doing,\nwe should put forward plans and programmes of action\nthat would revitalize the United Nations and enable it to\nface up to the challenges of the future and to establish a\nbetter world that would be consonant with principles of\nthe Charter and the common values and aspirations of all\nnations.\nLast year, the world witnessed certain encouraging\ndevelopments. The efforts deployed to promote\ninternational cooperation in the interests of economic and\nsocial development, to reduce environmental degradation\nand to combat the phenomena of poverty, terrorism and\ndrugs continued apace. The dispute in Mozambique was\nsettled by peaceful means and peace in Central America\nhas been consolidated. All these developments and\ntendencies give cause for hope. However, we should not\nallow ourselves to be overly elated. Civil wars and\nregional conflicts continue to wreak havoc and to\nundermine security and stability in many parts of the\nworld. In the post-cold-war world there are many other\nchallenges, which I shall address presently. Before I do\nso, however, I seek your indulgence in allowing me to\nturn to another question that is not far-removed from the\npresent international situation and the way small countries\nhave come to be treated especially when they adopt\nindependent policies and positions. I refer here to the\ndispute between my country and France, the United\nKingdom, and the United States of America over the Pan\nAm flight 103 incident, and the crash of the French UTA\naircraft. This dispute would not have continued for such\na long time had the right approach been adopted and had\nthere been any acceptance of the call for dialogue and\nnegotiation in seeking to settle the dispute.\nAs you know, over several years, and in complete\nsecrecy, certain bodies that are claimed to be independent\ninvestigated the two incidents. Suddenly and without the\npresentation of any evidence, Britain and the United\nStates of America surprised the world by declaring that\nthe Pan Am flight 103 incident was the work of two\nLibyans nationals. At the same time, France declared that\ncircumstantial evidence pointed at the involvement of\nseveral Libyans in the attack against UTA flight 772.\nAlthough those who made the allegations did not\ncorroborate them by any document, testimony or fact, the\nLibyan Arab Jamahiriya, upon being notified of the\nallegations, announced that it was ready to cooperate in\nuncovering the facts surrounding the two incidents. I do\nnot see any need to repeat the measures we have taken in\n12\n\n\nthis regard, since I have enumerated them at the past two\nsessions of this Assembly. Moreover, we have informed all\nMember States of our positions and initiatives, in this\nrespect, in official documents that have been circulated to\nthem. However, I should like to remind, briefly, that my\ncountry has condemned terrorism in all its forms, and has\ndeclared its commitment to the implementation of any\naction decided upon by the international community to\ncombat terrorism. My country has also cooperated with the\nGovernment of the United Kingdom. British officials have\nthemselves voiced satisfaction with Libya\u2019s response.\nContacts have been initiated and are continuing with the\nFrench authorities with a view to determining the\ncircumstances of the crash of the French aircraft. My\ncountry has spared no effort in searching for a feasible\ncourse of action with regard to the two individuals who\nhave been suspected of having something to do with the\nincident of the American plane. Libyan judicial authorities\nstarted to investigate this case but had to suspend the\ninvestigation because of the refusal of both the United\nStates and British authorities to submit any documents or\npapers in their possession. Despite the fact that the issue of\nthe trial of the two suspects is determined by the 1971\nMontreal Convention, which gives Libya the right to try\nthem, the refusal by Britain and the United States to abide\nby this Convention, to which they are both parties,\nprompted Libya to seek other solutions to the issue of the\ntrial. In this respect, Libya has submitted several proposals,\nincluding one that calls for resorting to the International\nCourt of Justice, or trying the two suspects before a court\nwhose venue should be agreed upon by the parties\nconcerned.\nAlthough the United States and British Governments\nhave both announced that their allegations have been built\non specific facts and reliable information, the facts that\nhave come to light over the past three years refute such\nassertions. In addition to the statement by the Palestinian\nnational, Yusuf Sha\u2019aban, before a Lebanese court, there\nare the statements of the manager of a Swiss electronics\ncompany which undermine the most important basis for\naccusing the two Libyan nationals. The information\npublished in Tracking the Octopus, a recent work of\ninvestigative journalism, points an accusing finger at other\nquarters. Despite all this, Libya continued to cooperate in\nseeking to reveal all the facts surrounding the Pan Am\nflight 103 incident. Proceeding from this, Libya accepted\nthe proposal of the League of Arab States, which calls for\ntrying the two suspected individuals by Scottish judges,\nunder Scottish law, at the seat of the International Court of\nJustice at the Hague.\nThe many secrets and mysterious dimensions of the\nLockerbie incident which have been uncovered have now\nbeen brought into sharp focus by, inter alia, the television\ndocumentary \u201cThe Maltese Double-Cross\u201d, William\nChasey\u2019s book The Lockerbie Cover-Up and Geoff\nSimmons\u2019 book \u201cLibya: The Struggle for Survival\u201d. In\naddition, several articles on this question have appeared\nin various newspapers, including the article published by\nThe Guardian of London on 29 June 1995. All these\ndocumentary revelations by the media refute the\naccusations levelled at the two Libyans, and provide\nevidence that the incident was planned by professional\nagencies to cover up certain suspect activities. Despite all\nthis, Libya, which, from the very beginning, declared that\nit is most interested in unearthing the truth regarding this\nincident, has not retreated from its declared position,\nnamely that it has no objection whatsoever to the trial of\nits two suspected nationals before a court of law.\nLibya\u2019s overriding concern in all this is to ensure\nthat its two nationals get a just, fair and neutral trial, that\nwould be free from any emotional or media influences\nand which would be conducted in accordance with the\nrules of international law which Libya has always upheld\nand adhered to. The International Court of Justice can\ntestify to our adherence to and respect for international\nlaw, as has been proven in three cases, the latest being\nthe judgment by the Court in relation to the territorial\ndispute between the Jamahiriya and Chad. Although the\njudgment was against our position, Libya, out of respect\nfor international law, accepted the ruling of the Court and\nimplemented it in a constructive manner. This confirms\nLibya\u2019s respect for international legality, to which one of\nthe big Powers pays lip service all the time, but does not\napply. It even refuses to resort to the International Court\nof Justice because this big Power believes in the law of\nforce not the force of law.\nIt is evident that the Governments of the United\nStates and Britain are not keen on revealing the truth\nabout the perpetrators of the tragic Lockerbie incident. It\nhas become abundantly clear that involving Libya in this\nincident was a premeditated act that aimed at achieving\ncertain objectives. Otherwise, why should the two\nGovernments object to the trial of the two suspected\nindividuals before the judiciary of a third country or\nbefore the International Court of Justice when this has\nbeen acceptable to the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya and has\nbeen supported by most members of the international\ncommunity, as represented by their regional organizations:\nthe League of Arab States, the Organization of the\nIslamic Conference, the Organization of African Unity,\n13\n\n\nand the Non-Aligned Movement? What prevents the two\nGovernments from accepting the path of dialogue and\nnegotiation as stipulated by the Charter of the United\nNations? Why is the Security Council being prevented from\nresponding to repeated calls and appeals by over two thirds\nof the membership of the United Nations on whose behalf\nthe Security Council is supposed to act? And why the\ndouble standards when it comes to dealing with issues of\ninternational legality? Furthermore, how can a certain major\nPower explain the fact that while it claims to be keen on\npreserving this legality, its record shows that it has the least\nregard for the will of the international community, a fact\nthat is attested to by that major Power\u2019s continued support\nof a certain State and protection of that State from\npunishment for its refusal to implement international\nresolutions which now total 143, including dozens that have\nbeen adopted by the Security Council?\nThe rejection by the two Governments, of the United\nStates and Britain, of all Libyan proposals and of all\nregional initiatives proves that they want this crisis to\ncontinue for as long as possible. Evidence of this can be\nfound in the fact that the more Libya\u2019s positions are\nwelcomed and the more widespread becomes the call for\nlifting the sanctions imposed on the Libyan people, the\nmore the two Governments hasten to oppose such positions\nunder the false pretext of Libya\u2019s non-response to the\nresolutions of the Council, thus keeping the Libyan people\nhostage to unjustified sanctions. As if these countries are\nnot content with the difficulties and pains suffered by the\nLibyan people at the hands of colonialists and fascists \u2014\npeople who fought on its territory, a war that killed and\ndisplaced hundreds of thousands of its people, and planted\nin their farms and under their homes millions of mines that\nstill explode and injure innocent Libyans. These mines also\nhinder Libya\u2019s efforts to combat desertification, protect the\nenvironment, and expand economic and social development.\nIt even seems that these countries are not content with the\nsuffering of the Libyan people so far, including the acts of\nterrorism to which the Libyan people have been subjected\nsuch as the deliberate downing of a Libyan civilian plane\nby Israeli military aircraft in 1973, which killed all its 108\npassengers. Also, in 1986, hundreds of American fighters\nbombed Libyan cities while their residents were asleep.\nThis aggression claimed the lives of many people and\nresulted in heavy material damage. Later, it was proved that\nthe pretext used by the United States of America for this\nact of aggression was false and baseless. The deep desire to\npunish the Libyan people also became clear when these\ncountries insisted on depriving its civilian aircraft of\nnecessary spare parts. In 1992, this led to the crash of one\nof those aircraft and the death of all its 157 passengers.\nAll this begs the question: is it a desire to discover\nthe truth, or is it a desire, a thirst to wreak revenge on\nLibya because of the defeat of the United States fleet in\n1805? So, where is the truth? Is it the thirst for revenge,\na vendetta waged by a major Power against a small\ncountry, a vendetta that goes back 150 years?\nThe Libyan Arab Jamahiriya has sought a speedy\nand just solution to the dispute with France, Britain and\nthe United States of America. All Libya asked was that\nthe problem should be settled in accordance with the\nprinciples of the United Nations and the rules of\ninternational law. For this purpose, we have knocked on\nmany doors, but our efforts, and those of others, to solve\nthe dispute and to lift the sanctions have faced continued\nrejection. Furthermore, there are hints that other measures\nmay be adopted to tighten the sanctions against us under\nthe pretext that Libya has not responded to the demands\nof the Security Council. This is not true. It merely\nrepresents manipulation and trickery with regard to the\ninterpretation of those resolutions.\nNow that I have reviewed this crisis for the fourth\ntime before the General Assembly and in order to avoid\nany further ramifications, we believe it is now incumbent\nupon this august assembly to intervene and to act in\naccordance with the powers entrusted to it by the Charter\nin order to get the three countries to respond to the\nrepeated calls for an urgent and peaceful solution to this\nproblem, in accordance with Chapter VI of the Charter of\nthe United Nations. This assembly should also urge the\nSecurity Council to reconsider its resolutions in order to\nlift the sanctions. Resorting to sanctions is not the proper\nway to solve differences between States, especially when\nsuch sanctions are unjustifiably imposed, as is the case\nwith the sanctions imposed against the Libyan people.\nThese sanctions have led to the freezing of Libya\u2019s assets,\nand prevented it from getting spare parts, including the\nparts needed for power plants and desalination machines.\nThis in turn has hampered the Libyan people\u2019s efforts\nwith regard to development, and paralysed the activities\nof most economic sectors. The more serious aspect of the\neffects of these sanctions is the enormity of the material\nand human losses which I need not review here in detail,\nsince we have detailed them in several official documents,\nthe latest of which is United Nations document\nS/1995/474 dated 12 June 1995. Suffice it to mention here\nthat the number of people injured in road accidents has\nreached 12,700 of whom 1,870 have died of their injuries\nwhile others continue to suffer from permanent injuries.\nMaterial damage has exceeded ten billion dollars.\nMoreover, the adverse effects of the sanctions have not\n14\n\n\nbeen limited to the Libyan people. They have affected\nneighbouring countries and all the peoples of the region.\nHere, I must repeat that the longer these sanctions continue,\nthe more people will die and the greater the suffering and\nthe damage. There is no reason whatsoever for remaining\nsilent on the subject of injustice and the continuation of this\nwrong. For the Assembly\u2019s information a road accident\nwhich took place two days ago on the road from Tripoli to\nTunis resulted in the death of three members of a Maltese\ndelegation.\nAs I have previously stated, the international political\nsituation has witnessed new positive developments which\nmy country welcomes. However, we must recognize that\nnumerous challenges still face peace in the world and that,\nconsequently, the international community is called upon to\nmobilize all its capabilities in facing up to those challenges.\nThe continued deterioration of the situation in Somalia\nand the intensification of tensions in that country require\nmore regional efforts to persuade Somali leaders to enter\ninto additional political commitments and to work for the\nrestoration of peace and permanent stability to their\ncountry. Seeking to make the world more secure and more\nstable requires supporting national reconciliation efforts in\nAfghanistan, promoting a satisfactory solution to the\nproblem of Cyprus, solving the problems in Rwanda and\nBurundi and settling the disputes in Angola and Liberia. It\nalso requires putting an end to the repeated setbacks to\npeace efforts in the Balkans, as well as sparing the people\nof Bosnia and Herzegovina, and other peoples of the former\nYugoslavia, more pain and suffering.\nIn order to establish permanent stability in the Gulf\nregion, the unity and territorial integrity of Iraq must be\nrespected, and all interference in its internal affairs must\ncease. Furthermore, the sanctions from which the Iraqi\npeople have been suffering should be lifted.\nIn the context of any effort to consolidate world peace,\nserious action must be taken to resolve the problems of the\nMiddle East. It is unacceptable that the Palestinian people\nshould continue to be displaced from their land, while those\nwho stay on that land are brutally treated. The\noverwhelming majority of the international community,\nwhich has continued to support the legitimate rights of the\nPalestinian people over the past four decades, should take\nfirm action to put an end to the Israeli practices against the\nPalestinians and the other inhabitants of the occupied Arab\nterritories in the Golan and southern Lebanon. The Israelis\nmust be deterred, in accordance with the Charter of the\nUnited Nations, from their continued defiance of the will of\nthe international community. The incontrovertible truth is\nthat occupation and expansion are the real aim of the\nIsraelis. Their former and present positions and practices\nindicate that they do not want a just and comprehensive\npeace. Their joining the so-called peace process is a mere\nsmoke-screen, a mask they hide behind in order to\nperpetrate further occupation and enhance their\nsuperiority.\nA just, comprehensive and lasting solution to the\nproblems of the Middle East cannot be achieved by\nceding the administration of local affairs in Gaza and\nJericho, but rather by the liberation of all occupied Arab\nterritories and the full enforcement of all the rights of the\nPalestinian people \u2014 first and foremost being their return\nto their homeland, self-determination, and the\nestablishment of their own independent state in Palestine,\nwith Al-Quds as its capital, a state where Arabs and Jews\nalike would live together. There is no alternative to this\nsolution. The solutions being put forward these days,\nregardless of all the talk about how desirable their results\nwould be, will not lead to the results aspired to by the\nPalestinians, simply because those solutions are unrealistic\nand ignore the facts of history.\nThe continued existence of nuclear weapons and the\nincreased stockpiling of these and other weapons of mass\ndestruction are among the principal concerns of the\ninternational community. When the first review\nConference of the States parties to the Non-Proliferation\nTreaty (NPT) was held in the first half of this year, it was\nhoped that that Conference would lead to satisfactory\nresults. However, what actually happened was that certain\nnuclear Powers brought to bear unprecedented pressures\nthat made it possible for the NPT to be extended\nindefinitely. My country declared its opposition to this\nextension, and we remain convinced that extending the\nTreaty in that manner would never serve the objective of\nnuclear-weapon disarmament.\nThe NPT has not achieved universality, and its many\nshortcomings have not been properly addressed. In our\nview, ridding the world of nuclear terror will not be\nachieved through gains obtained by manoeuvres and\nunconventional measures, but rather through serious\nmeasures, which must be taken by the nuclear States. In\nthis context, the procurement of nuclear materials must be\nended, and nuclear States must commit themselves to a\ndeadline for the complete elimination of all nuclear\nweapons. These States should put an end to nuclear tests\nand conclude, at the earliest possible time, a\ncomprehensive test-ban treaty. Furthermore, the nuclear\n15\n\n\nStates should demonstrate the political will required to\nconclude an effective treaty guaranteeing the security and\nsafety of non-nuclear States.\nAnother situation that requires speedy corrective action\ninvolves the unjustified restriction on the transfer to\nnon-nuclear States of nuclear technology for peaceful\npurposes. Above all, measures should be taken to guarantee\nthe universality of the NPT. My country attaches the\ngreatest importance to this issue, because the region to\nwhich we belong suffers from a security imbalance, owing\nto the Israelis\u2019 tremendous nuclear capability \u2014 they have\nmore than 200 nuclear warheads and nuclear facilities that\nare not subjected to international inspection. This represents\na threat to the security and safety of the peoples of the\nregion. No one should keep silent about a situation of this\nkind or accept the extension of the NPT as long as such a\nsituation continues.\nIf the indefinite extension of the NPT is to be with the\ncomplete support of all, international action must be taken\nto meet all these widely expressed requirements and to\nguarantee accession by all to the Treaty, including, in\nparticular, the Israelis, who must agree to subject their\nnuclear facilities to the safeguards regime of the\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency, as well as fixing a\ntimetable for the dismantling and destruction of their\nnuclear stockpiles.\nIn reviewing the international economic situation, it\nbecomes clear that the economic development of most\ndeveloping countries, especially in Africa, is still sluggish\nand subject to fluctuations and imbalances. The present\nindicators give the impression that this situation is likely to\ndeteriorate further unless effective measures are taken to\nreverse it. The fact is that the economic difficulties of the\ndeveloping countries are not the result of a lack of\nlegislation or plans. For example, Africa has adopted plans\nand strategies to promote development and has concluded\na treaty that aims at economic integration. However, the\nproblem lies in the unjust criteria still prevalent in\ninternational economic relations. These require realistic and\nresponsible solutions without the imposition of politically\nmotivated conditions.\nThe conferences that have been held over the past few\nyears have created new opportunities to improve the\nprevailing economic and social situation. We hope that the\nconsensus agreements emanating from those conferences\nwill generate the necessary political will for the\nimplementation of the resolutions taken by those and other\ninternational forums, including the commitments announced\nduring the United Nations Conference on Environment\nand Development. What is more urgent is the need to\ntake immediate action to address the external causes of\neconomic deterioration in developing countries, namely\nthe increasing tendency towards protectionism, declining\nterms of trade, shrinking official development assistance\nand restrictions on the transfer of technology.\nIn addition, it is necessary to deal with unjust\npractices in international economic relations such as\ncoercive economic measures, including boycotts, the\nfreezing of assets, the confiscation of property and the\nprohibition of the export of spare parts, which has been\napplied by certain developed countries against a number\nof developing countries, including my own. Such\nmeasures not only impede development and run counter\nto the Charter of the United Nations, to the resolutions of\nthe General Assembly and to the orientation towards the\nestablishment of a system of international economic\nrelations based on justice and fairness, but also constitute\na violation of the norms of international law. The Western\ncountries that manufacture the needed spare parts, medical\nsupplies and water-desalination and power-generating\nequipment, by taking such coercive measures, violate their\ncommitments under free-trade agreements. This should\nserve as a warning to whoever deals with those countries,\nbecause there is no guarantee that such measures will not\nbe applied to them as well.\nLast year and the year before, wide-ranging\ndiscussions were held on the restructuring of the United\nNations. These discussions have shown that there is a\nneed to review and change the procedures and methods of\nwork of the Security Council so that it may be able to\nseriously and fairly address questions that touch on\ninternational peace and security. During the meetings of\nthe Working Group established by the General Assembly\nto look into the question of equitable representation in\nand increase in the membership of the Security Council,\nas well as into other related matters, my country declared\nits support of the call for enhancing the powers of the\nGeneral Assembly, including giving it the right to deal\nwith questions of peace and security in the world, in\nconformity with the provisions of the Charter. My country\nreiterates its conviction that reforming the Security\nCouncil and increasing its membership should be part and\nparcel of an integrate process of reform that must be\nguided by the principles of the sovereign equality of\nStates, equitable geographical distribution and the need to\ndemocratize the procedures and methods applied in the\nSecurity Council, including the process of\ndecision-making.\n16\n\n\nLibya has been among the first to call for the\nelimination of all the obstacles that hamper the work of the\nSecurity Council, particularly, the veto power. Today my\ncountry takes satisfaction in the fact that this call, which\nLibya made 20 years ago, now has the support of many\ncountries. This shows that those countries have now\nbecome convinced that there is no longer any justification\nfor the power of the veto and that its continued existence\nbreaches one of the principles of the United Nations,\nnamely, the equality of States. It is that veto power which\nimpedes all efforts aimed at the democratization of the\nmembership and functions of United Nations bodies.\nSince becoming a Member of the United Nations, my\ncountry has played an active role in and contributed to\nmany achievements of which the Organization can be\nproud. My country will also contribute to whatever the\nOrganization seeks to achieve in the future. Based on this,\nwe have actively participated in the international\nConferences recently organized by the United Nations on\npopulation, social development, human rights, and women.\nThis we did in the same spirit that inspires our country\u2019s\ninternational activities at other levels. That is why Libya\nhas participated in all efforts aimed at strengthening the\nArab Maghreb Union. We are proud to see that this Union\nhas advanced steadily and has taken serious initiatives to\nserve the peoples of the Union and to protect their gains.\nLibya works with the same determination to adopt effective\nmeasures to enhance cooperation and strengthen confidence\nand security in the Mediterranean region in order to remove\nthe causes of tensions there. This includes our efforts to\nclose foreign military bases in the Mediterranean region and\nto secure the withdrawal of military fleets from its waters.\nProceeding from its positions of principle, Libya has been\nat the forefront of the defenders of the aspirations of\npeoples, whether in the field of decolonization, the\nprotection and maintenance of human rights, or the\nenhancement of the role principles of justice and fairness\nshould play in international relations.\nLibya has also sought to solve a number of regional\ndisputes by peaceful means. In this spirit, it has undertaken\nseveral mediation missions including, for example,\nassistance in solving the problems in the southern\nPhilippines and helping to arrest the deterioration of the\ndispute between Sudan and Uganda, as well as those\nbetween Nigeria and Cameroon and Greece and Turkey.\nLibya has also contributed to efforts aimed at halting the\nescalation of the dispute between India and Pakistan, and\nhas helped in containing events in north Niger and Mali.\nIn this current session in particular, Libya takes\npride in the fact that these positions have had wide-\nranging effects that were reflected in the trust placed in\nmy country by Arab States and the group of African\nStates which unanimously nominated Libya to the\nmembership of the Security Council for the coming two\nyears. While expressing its high appreciation of this Arab\nand African stand, Libya would like to thank, in advance,\nall the countries that will support our candidature for that\nseat. We should also like to confirm to everybody that\nLibya will support all efforts aimed at the realization of\nthe purposes of the United Nations and, in cooperation\nwith members of the Security Council and other members\nof the Organization, will work to enhance the role of the\nUnited Nations in the maintenance of international peace\nand security, and in closing ranks with other countries in\nfacing up to the dangers that threaten peace and security\nin the world.\nAt the beginning of this statement, I said that this\nsession of the General Assembly had a special\nsignificance. This is due to the fact that we believe that\nthe historical occasion under the aura of which this\nsession convenes, namely, the celebration of the fiftieth\nanniversary of the United Nations, will afford us all an\nopportunity that should be seized \u2014 an opportunity to\nrealize peace, security and prosperity for humanity.\nIn our view, the starting point in this direction lies\nin hard work to establish the structure of a new\ninternational order. Such an order, however, should not be\nbuilt according to the wishes of the few who seek to\nimpose their hegemony on others in deciding the fate of\nthe world, and to dictate their own methods of dealing\nwith international relations.\nThe new order that would satisfy us all should be\nbuilt on the common aspirations of all. It should be an\norder that guarantees full equality to all countries; an\norder that must respect the free political, economic and\nsocial choices of all peoples. The new order should\nprotect and enhance human rights. It should create\nconditions conducive to the settlement of disputes and\nconflicts and to the resolution of differences among States\nby peaceful means. It should be an order which provides\nsecurity and stability, and should make it possible for all\nnations to aspire after development and to be optimistic\nabout the future. This new order should embody the noble\nconcepts and ideals enshrined in the Charter; namely, the\nneed to unite our strength to save humanity from the\nscourge of war, to realize justice, to respect the\nobligations arising from treaties and other sources of\n17\n\n\ninternational law, and to promote better standards of life in\ngreater freedom.\n"

        "file_text": "\nIt gives me\ngreat pleasure to make use of our common language to\ncongratulate you, Sir, on your election. We are honoured\nto see a Portuguese statesman, a friend of Brazil, and a\nrepresentative of our commonwealth of Portuguese-\nspeaking countries presiding over this session of the\nGeneral Assembly, a session that is bound to become a\nmilestone in the history of the United Nations. My\nGovernment is confident that, under your skilled\nguidance, our deliberations will forge the kind of\nunderstanding and commitment capable of asserting the\ncredibility and pre-eminence of our Organization in world\naffairs.\nLet me also express our heartfelt appreciation to\nanother friend of Brazil, Minister Amara Essy of C\u00f4te\nd\u2019Ivoire, for his outstanding work at the helm of the\nforty-ninth session of the General Assembly.\n(spoke in English)\nI wish to congratulate the Secretary-General,\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, and the Secretariat for their\ncontinued dedication to the United Nations and for their\nrelentless work in carrying out their duties to the\ninternational community.\nIn opening this debate today, Brazil wishes to renew\nits unwavering commitment to the principles and purposes\nembodied in the Charter of the United Nations. These\nprinciples and purposes set a mandate for peace and\n\n\ndevelopment, and are as relevant today as they were 50\nyears ago. They coincide entirely with the aspirations of\nBrazilian society. Our Constitution reflects them as the\nsupreme values of our political and social life in\ndemocracy.\nI am proud to address the Assembly as the\nrepresentative of a country that has widened its\ncommitments to democracy and human rights, to\nsustainable development with economic stability, to peace\nand disarmament \u2014 a country at peace with itself,\nconstantly striving to extend its presence in the world by\nstrengthening traditional partnerships and fostering new\nones. We expect from our partners an attitude of\ncooperation commensurate with Brazil\u2019s growing\nparticipation in world markets and with its contribution to\ninternational peace and security.\nDemocracy in Brazil continues to show extraordinary\nvitality under the leadership of President Fernando Henrique\nCardoso. Our institutional framework is being strengthened,\nand progress in the social sphere is generating a renewed\nsense of citizenship among Brazilians.\nWhile strictly enforcing existing mechanisms,\nPresident Cardoso is proposing legislation that will ensure\nthe full observance of human rights. Both at home and\nabroad, Brazil\u2019s human rights policies are based on\ntransparency and full cooperation with civil society.\nTogether with strong governmental action to tackle the\ncountry\u2019s social problems, measures to promote and protect\nhuman rights will greatly contribute to redress the unjust\ndistribution of wealth that unfortunately still prevails in\nBrazil.\nLong-needed structural reforms and privatization are\nbeing carried out, paving the way for the consolidation of\neconomic stability and sustained economic growth.\nBrazil has achieved a high degree of economic\nopenness, thus accelerating its integration into the\ninternational economy and creating more favourable\nconditions for increased participation in international trade,\ntechnology transfers and productive capital flows. Inflation\nhas been reduced to the lowest level in a quarter of a\ncentury, allowing the country to pursue policies that benefit\nthe poor and the underprivileged.\nWe are also engaged in a broad and dynamic process\nof open economic integration with our neighbours, adding\neconomic substance to the political harmony that we enjoy\nin our region. MERCOSUR \u2014 a customs union bringing\ntogether Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay \u2014 is\na highly successful political and economic reality, a\npartner ready for business and cooperation with all\ncountries and regions.\nBrazil has taken significant steps to further\nstrengthen its commitments to disarmament and to the\nnon-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.\nPresident Cardoso publicly stated that Brazil has forgone\nthe development, acquisition and export of long-range\nmilitary missiles. Congress is about to approve the\nChemical Weapons Convention, and comprehensive\nlegislation on export controls of dual-use technology is\nbeing finalized. Having decided unilaterally to abide by\nthe Missile Technology Control Regime\u2019s guidelines, the\nBrazilian Government is currently discussing its\nparticipation in the regime.\nBrazil\u2019s commitment to peace and understanding was\nclearly illustrated by its recent role, alongside the other\nthree Guarantor countries of the Rio de Janeiro Protocol,\nin bringing together two friendly nations in our region \u2014\nEcuador and Peru.\nBrazilian forces are actively participating in various\nUnited Nations peace-keeping efforts, particularly in\nAngola, a country that shares with Brazil a common\nheritage and is finally on the verge of healing the wounds\ninflicted by years of internal strife. We are also proud of\nthe role played by our Government and our forces in the\npeaceful transition to an elected government in\nMozambique.\nAfter too many years of difficulties, Brazilians have\nrecovered their pride. The country has entered a cycle of\nlong-term growth and greater long-term opportunities, an\nera of optimism and confidence. It is in this spirit that\nBrazilian diplomacy is prepared to approach the world\nand to work within the United Nations.\nAs I reflect upon the events that have taken place\nover this past year, I am tempted to say that\n\u201cit was the best of times; it was the worst of times\u201d.\nIt has been a time for legitimate hope, but also a\ntime of fear and horror; a time for accomplishments, but\nalso a time of frustration; a time for confidence in a\nbrighter future for mankind, but also a time of regret for\nthe fact that peace, freedom, justice and well-being are\nstill unattained in many places in the world; a time in\nwhich risks and opportunities coexist side by side.\n2\n\n\nCurrent patterns in international affairs converge on\nthe twin concepts that inspired the revolution of the 1990s:\ndemocracy and economic freedom with social justice. This\nis the main thrust that will shape the coming century and\nensure liberty and prosperity for all.\nThe very concept of power has changed. A country\u2019s\nsovereignty and its capacity to satisfy the needs of its\npeople depend increasingly on good social indicators,\npolitical stability, economic competitiveness, and scientific\nand technological progress, not on military strength. It is\nnow widely understood that the fulfilment of national pride\nlies in democracy, development, trade and economic wealth,\nrather than in the quest for hegemony or territorial gains.\nA new era of freedom is at hand. Countries are\npeacefully seeking their place in their regions and in the\nworld, helping in the creation of wealth through trade and\ncooperation. Emerging economies have become a\nsignificant force around the world, benefiting from\nglobalization, greater economic freedom and the continued\ngrowth of international trade. Economic integration has led\nto stronger regional ties.\nReconstruction and enhanced participation in\ninternational affairs are seen in many parts of the world,\njust as others continue to prosper and grow in peace. New\nor renewed partnerships have emerged in the five\ncontinents.\nThe Middle East is finally following the path of\ndialogue and understanding, through a peace process that\nwe firmly support and encourage. Angola and Mozambique\nare the new promises of southern Africa, furthering regional\npeace and conciliation as the South Africans have done.\nLatin America, and in particular the Southern Cone\ncountries, has continued to show vitality both at the\npolitical level, with democracy fully at work, and at the\neconomic level, with freedom and openness leading to the\nresumption of growth and the expansion of trade.\nThe United Nations has kept its role in the\nmaintenance of international peace and security. A broader\nagenda for the remainder of this century is under\nconsideration. Positive initiatives are under way to ensure\nthat the Organization is capable of more effectively\npromoting peace and development. Reform of the system is\nalso due to make it more responsive to the challenges that\nlie ahead.\nThe promotion of civil liberties and the quest for\nequal rights among women and men, minorities and\nmajorities, weak and strong are shaping the debate,\nguiding action and strengthening citizenship all over the\nworld.\nThese are indeed times of positive change. But even\nas one celebrates these positive trends, one is painfully\naware of the manifold threats posed by the persistence of\npoverty and violence in many areas of the world. The\nimages of the former Yugoslavia are living proof of past\nfailures and present challenges and misperceptions. They\nremind us of how much needs to be done to fulfil the\npromises embodied in the United Nations Charter.\nExtreme poverty and unemployment emerge as\nperhaps the most pervasive of the international issues,\naffecting developed and developing countries alike,\ncorroding the social fabric while fostering extremism on\nthe part of individuals and engendering short-sighted\nsolutions on the part of governments.\nTerrorism, drug trafficking, organized crime,\nxenophobia and racism, ethnic cleansing, religious\nfanaticism and intolerance, and persistent violations of\nbasic human rights continue to afflict millions of human\nbeings. Misguided economic policies, financial\nspeculation and the volatility of capital flows threaten\nmarkets on a global scale. Emerging economies, striving\nto consolidate stability and the resumption of growth\nwhile dealing with variables such as interest rates and\ncommodity prices, have become increasingly vulnerable.\nDisarmament continues to be an elusive goal. The\npromises heralded by the end of the cold war seem to\nhave vanished in a cloud of vague excuses. The so-called\npeace dividends have yet to materialize. The world is\ntheoretically less threatening and dangerous.\nCompetitiveness, technological capability, economic\nstrength and social indicators have become the standards\nof national power. Yet, more positive moves in\ndisarmament and non-proliferation have been offset by\nanachronistic economic practices and irresponsible\nmilitary endeavours.\nSome countries continue to seek military strength\nand strategic power. Even as commitment to\nnon-proliferation and support for nuclear disarmament\ngain ground in Latin America, Africa and parts of Asia,\nnuclear tests painfully remind us of the threats and\nhorrors that haunted the collective imagination during the\ncold-war years. Besides endangering the environment they\n3\n\n\nencourage the resumption of a purposeless arms race in\nvarious parts of the world.\nNuclear testing undermines efforts towards\ndisarmament and jeopardizes the conclusion of a\ncomprehensive nuclear-test ban. Instead of helping the\ninternational community strengthen collective security\nmechanisms, certain countries persist in testing and\nimproving their nuclear arsenals. We deplore it.\nSo where does the United Nations stand in the current\ninternational scene? How can it deal with the conflicting\nand ambivalent forces operating in the world today? Where\ndoes its responsibility begin and where does it end? What\ncan we do to realize the vision of our founding fathers?\nThese are some of the questions that come to mind as we\nprepare to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of our\nOrganization.\nIt is certainly true that the Organization may have\nseemed at times to be overwhelmed by the challenges\nbefore it. But it is also true that the shortcomings over these\npast 50 years would have been greater had it not been for\nthe United Nations, a universal conscience, an instrument\nfor peace and understanding, as no other instrument has\never been, with a moral authority that the peoples of the\nworld have learned to recognize and support.\nIn 1941 when the United Nations was but a distant\ndream overcast by war, Franklin Delano Roosevelt defined\nthe four freedoms upon which a true community of nations\nshould be built. They were \u2014 and I find it useful to recall\nRoosevelt\u2019s own inspiring words \u2014 the freedom of speech\nand expression; the freedom of every person to worship\nGod in his own way; the freedom from want, which\n\u201ctranslated into world terms, means economic\nunderstandings which will secure to every nation a\nhealthy peace time life for its inhabitants\u201d;\nand the freedom from fear, which\n\u201ctranslated into world terms, means a world-wide\nreduction of armaments to such a point and in such a\nthorough fashion that no nation will be in a position\nto commit an act of physical aggression against any\nneighbor\u201d.\nProviding mankind with these four freedoms was the\nchallenge that ultimately gave birth to the United Nations.\nYet, these four freedoms are still largely unattained. They\nremain an inspiration and a goal.\nIn the past 50 years, the nations of the world have\nused this podium to voice their hopes and concerns and\nto express their feelings about a true international\npartnership based on peace and prosperity. The United\nNations has undoubtedly represented a call for consensus,\na moral and ethic force, a promoter of political will and\naction, a substitute for confrontation and dispute.\nThe time has come for us to carefully assess the\nachievements and shortcomings of the United Nations in\norder to set the course for the next half-century. The time\nhas come for us to create the conditions for the United\nNations of the twenty-first century.\nIn the aftermath of the Second World War the idea\nof an international body such as the United Nations may\nhave seemed utopian, especially in the light of the failure\nof the League of Nations and of the tragedies and crimes\nthat resulted from the pursuit of power politics, the kind\nof politics that led the world into war and its horrors.\nWhile avoiding utopianism, the United Nations was\ndesigned to provide actual instruments of diplomatic\ninteraction capable of replacing power politics by ethical\nvalues and of promoting conflict prevention and conflict\nresolution through negotiation and dialogue.\nWith a pledge to peace and security on the one hand\nand to development on the other, the United Nations\nhelped to write important chapters of contemporary\nhistory, such as the building of a new pattern of\nrelationship between developed and developing countries,\nthe search for development, disarmament, the protection\nof human rights and human dignity, decolonization, the\nstruggle against apartheid and the condemnation of\ntyranny and oppression.\nIn this process important organizations such as the\nUnited Nations Conference on Trade and Development\n(UNCTAD), and decisive forums such as the United\nNations Conference on Environment and Development\n(UNCED), and the several other United Nations\nconferences dedicated to global issues, have played a\nparamount role. In these forums we have enhanced\ncommitments in the areas of cooperation for development,\nthe law of the sea, the rights of children, the environment\nand sustainable development, human rights, population,\nsocial development and the rights of women.\nWe have certainly accomplished one part of our\ndreams. So why not set our eyes on further\naccomplishments? We look at the recent past and find the\n4\n\n\nUnited Nations at the centre of the most important\ninternational events. Even when its action has been\nconstrained by circumstances, the United Nations always\ndisplayed moral strength. We look at the present and we\nsee a United Nations limited by its structure, struggling\nvery hard to take advantage of its own experience to adapt\nto changing world realities in order to remain the foremost\ninternational force.\nAnd so Brazil confidently looks to the future. Peace\nand development in the years to come will depend largely\non our capacity to renew and reform the United Nations. In\ninstitutions, as in human beings, reassessment and reform\nare a sign of vitality, of maturity, of responsibility. As\nBrazil has already pointed out a normative gap has opened\nup between some of the provisions of the Charter and the\nrealities of today\u2019s world.\nThe fact is that most of the structures of the United\nNations remain those crafted 50 years ago. Back then, the\nworld was entering a new phase of power politics and\nconfrontation that no longer applies. The membership of the\nUnited Nations was less than one third of what it is today.\nThe concept of development was not at the core of an\ninternational agenda. Significant players in the developed\nand in the developing world had yet to achieve the\ninfluential role they have today.\nNew realities demand innovative solutions. Greater\nexpectations require stronger commitments. Nothing is more\nemblematic of the need to bring the United Nations into\nline with the realities of the post-cold-war world than the\nreform of the Security Council. As a catalyst for other\nmuch-needed reforms within the United Nations system,\nreform of the Security Council is an imperative that should\nno longer be put off.\nIn order to carry out its mandate in the field of\ninternational peace and security on behalf of all Member\nStates, the Security Council must have unquestionable\nlegitimacy. As is well known, legitimacy ultimately rests on\nrepresentativeness.\nReform cannot entail a wholesale or indiscriminate\nenlargement of the Security Council, much less an\ninsufficient one predicated on the convenience of a limited\nnumber of States. Above all, it will be essential to ensure\na more equitable representation of developed and\ndeveloping countries with both the capacity to act and an\neffective presence on a global scale.\nThe emergence of new economic powers and of a\nnumber of developing countries with global projection has\nsignificantly altered the dynamics of world politics. These\nplayers have come to the forefront of the international\nscene and should be present in the core group of\npermanent members, so that the Council\u2019s composition\nbecomes more balanced and better reflects the diversity of\nworld views.\nA qualitative increase in the number of permanent\nmembers of the Security Council, together with an\nenlargement of the non-permanent membership, would\ncorrespond to the necessity of making it more\nauthoritative and efficient in carrying out its increased\nresponsibilities in the post-cold-war era.\nReform is not about the individual prestige of any\ncountry but about the prestige of the Security Council\nitself. Brazil, for its part, is ready to assume its\nresponsibilities in this endeavour.\nThe same attention that is being given to improving\nthe United Nations performance in the area of peace and\nsecurity must be given to efforts in the area of\nstrengthening international cooperation for development.\nPoverty and unemployment both in industrialized and in\ndeveloping nations, economic instability and misguided\neconomic policies affecting individual countries, as well\nas the persistence or the rise of various forms of\nprotectionism, are factors that adversely affect sustained\ngrowth worldwide. These are issues that must be accorded\nhigh priority.\nUnemployment cannot be used as a pretext that will\nultimately lead to protectionism directed mainly against\nthe developing countries. There is no use in trying to\nalleviate unemployment by accusing other people, by\ncreating new forms of disguised protectionism, by putting\na new strain on international relations. We must\nstrengthen the role of the World Trade Organization as\nthe mainstay of an open and non-discriminatory\nmultilateral trade system. We must promote a broader\ncoordination of macroeconomic policies and foster\nregional economic integration, and provide better and\nmore effective cooperation in the areas of health,\nsanitation, education, the administration of justice and\nother areas of great social impact. We must widen the\ndecision-making circles in order to include countries\nwhose contribution to these objectives can be\ninstrumental.\n5\n\n\nThe United Nations should be able to ensure\nimplementation of the commitments reached at the highest\nlevel at the United Nations Conference on the Environment\nand Development, for much needs to be done to fulfil the\npromises that were made in Rio de Janeiro regarding\ninternational cooperation for sustainable development. The\nsame kind of follow-up should apply to the commitments\nreached at subsequent international conferences on global\nissues.\nThese are the main goals to be achieved by a reform\nof the United Nations institutions that directly or indirectly\ndeal with the issue of sustainable development. We firmly\nbelieve that a broad vision of reform of the United Nations\ninstitutions will lead to an improved, more efficient and\nrevitalized Organization. For, as once stated in this very\nforum by a distinguished Brazilian statesman, Oswaldo\nAranha, who presided over the first special session of the\nGeneral Assembly, in 1947:\n\u201cAbove all, it is within our power to make the United\nNations the sum total of justice, security and peace, or\nthrough our lack of wisdom to allow it to be\ntransformed into one more sword to be wielded\nblindly by force and instinct.\u201d (Official Records of the\nGeneral Assembly, First Special Session, 68th plenary\nmeeting, pp. 3 and 4)\nThe United Nations will stand as the greatest symbol\nof the twentieth century as long as it is able to keep its\nvitality and effectively promote peace and development.\nBrazil is also committed to peace and democracy and\nbelieves that if all peoples of the world are free to express\ntheir ideas and to build their own destinies, democracy will\nbe strengthened and will continue to serve the purpose of\ndevelopment and social justice. Brazil is also committed to,\nand knows that development depends on, an international\nenvironment of peace, cooperation and economic freedom.\nAs our Heads of State and Government prepare to\ngather in New York in October to celebrate the\naccomplishments of our Organization, let us hasten to\ncreate the necessary conditions for them to build for the\nfuture with the same impetus and boldness that inspired the\ninternational community 50 years ago. Let us make sure\nthat through our unfaltering commitment and our timely\naction the United Nations will emerge stronger from the\nfiftieth session of the General Assembly.\n"

        "file_text": " May I first of all on behalf of the\nDominican Republic and on behalf of its Constitutional\nPresident, Mr. Joaqu\u00edn Balaguer, express our sincerest\ncongratulations to the President of the fiftieth session of\nthe General Assembly.\nSecondly, I wish to express our profound gratitude\nto the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of\nC\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, His Excellency Mr. Amara Essy, who\npresided over the forty-ninth session and, particularly, to\nthe Secretary-General, who, by his extraordinary efforts\nand tireless dedication in a world marked by challenges\nand breaches of the peace, wages a daily combat for the\nfull implementation of the purposes and principles of the\nUnited Nations Charter.\nThe Dominican Republic can affirm with pride on\nthis fiftieth anniversary of the establishment of the United\nNations its role as a founding Member of the United\nNations, which signed the San Francisco Charter within\nthe international order that rose from the ashes of the\nSecond World War, whose fiftieth anniversary we also\ncommemorate, and as a country that defends the principle\nof sovereignty as the inalienable right of the people.\nFifty years after the creation of the United Nations\nin 1945, the world is in a state of transition toward what\nhas been termed a new world order, moving from\nbipolarity to unipolarity in a multipolar world, following\nupon the world built in Yalta and in the Bretton Woods\nagreements.\nThe 1945 order was based on a balance of power\nand on the United Nations as a reflection of the real\ndesire to seek security and universal peace \u2014 and the\nOrganization has managed, since its creation, to avert\nanother nuclear holocaust.\n16\nGeneral Assembly 22nd plenary meeting\nFiftieth session 13 October 1995\nSmall countries such as the Dominican Republic,\nstaunch guardians of their national sovereignty, have\nwitnessed during the five decades since 1945 this order\ncreated through the United Nations and its specialized\nagencies, with Bretton Woods, the North Atlantic Treaty\nOrganization (NATO), the Council for Economic Aid\n(COMECON), the Warsaw Pact, and the European\nEconomic Community \u2014 today the European Union; the\nevolution of countries with market economies and those\nwith centrally planned economies, and the decolonization\nprocesses which have resulted in the establishment of many\nindependent States. All this has left an indelible imprint on\nthe annals of contemporary history and has been rich in\nlessons for all the nations of the world \u2014 lessons, in a\nword, on relations between North and South.\nThe order which emerged from Bretton Woods was\nreflected in the International Monetary Fund (IMF); the\nInternational Bank for Reconstruction and Development\n(IBRD); and the aborted International Trade Organization\nof 1947, which was replaced by the General Agreement on\nTariffs and Trade (GATT), from which the agricultural\nsector, services and intellectual property were excluded. All\nthis explains why 46 years later, with the Uruguay Round\nof Multilateral Trade Negotiations and the birth, in 1993, of\nthe World Trade Organization (WTO), we are giving\nmultilateral shape to world trade in order to overcome\nbilateral barriers and, above all, the protectionism that was\npractised by the industrial countries.\nIn these five decades, the small countries had to\nstruggle mightily to uphold the principles of democracy,\nincluding respect for human rights, and to defend their right\nto access to the markets of the industrialized countries\nagainst tariff and non-tariff barriers, quotas, and downward\nspiralling in the prices of their raw materials. We can,\nhowever, point with pride to the way we fought for our\ndemands for greater symmetry and fairness in commercial\nand economic relations. This in the end led to the\nestablishment of the United Nations Conference on Trade\nand Development (UNCTAD).\nThe San Francisco Charter illuminated like a\npowerful beacon the road to the future of the countries that\nhad had to experience the difficult period of the bipolar\nworld. For its part, the Dominican Republic, committed as\nalways to the principles of the Charter, was able to attain\nthe functional democracy we enjoy today. This took place\nwithin a world that has some 30 integration processes and\nhas seen the emergence of three strong economic-\nintegration blocs with their spheres of influence \u2014 such as\nthe European Union and the North American Free Trade\nAgreement (NAFTA) \u2014 in addition to the Free Trade\nZone of the Americas, which will probably be established\nin the year 2005; and, for Eastern Asia, the Asia-Pacific\nEconomic Cooperation Council (APEC). There are also\nthe political repercussions these processes have had on a\nworld where the dreams for centrally planned economies\nhave faded. Our country is now a member of the recently\nestablished Association of Caribbean States (ACS).\nThis new world order that has now become the\nglobal village foreseen by Marshall McLuhan, within a\nglobalized, international economy, will not be without\ntensions, for we do not yet fully grasp the cultural\nplurality of nations and the strong search for identity in\nregions and within ethnic and religious groups. Contrary\nto the popular phrase, history has not come to an end. A\nnew process is beginning with the expression by peoples\nand regions of their national identity.\nThe globalization of trade would seem to transcend\nthe borders of the nation-State and create a concept of a\nregion-State, given the fragmentation of national\naggregate assets.\nWithin the family of nations we feel proud to have\nbeen not only one of the 51 States that participated in the\nSan Francisco Conference, but also one of the first to\nhave ratified, in resolution 962 of our National Congress,\nthe Charter of the United Nations, which was promulgated\nby our Executive Branch on 11 August 1945.\nOn the fiftieth anniversary of that memorable date\nwe wish to pay tribute to those members of the\nDominican delegation who signed that historic document:\nManuel Pe\u00f1a Batlle, Emilio Garc\u00eda Godoy, Gilberto\nS\u00e1nchez Lustrino, Tulio Franco y Franco and Minerva\nBernardino. We are a nation deeply committed to the\nproper functioning of democratic institutions, having\nattained a commendable political stability in our\ncontinent\u2019s community of nations.\nIn this context, the United Nations will be making a\npraiseworthy contribution to the process of maintaining\nstability in our country by responding to the request of\nthe Dominican Republic for reimbursement of the funds\nspent in implementing the economic embargo imposed on\nour neighbour, Haiti. The Dominican Republic has\nsubmitted that request to the Secretariat and our\nGovernment is now awaiting a response.\nAs a developing country the Dominican Republic\nmust face many challenges in the sensitive areas of drug\n17\nGeneral Assembly 22nd plenary meeting\nFiftieth session 13 October 1995\ntrafficking and drug consumption. This is a problem our\ncountry has met with a State policy that provides for severe\npunishments for offences related to this crime against\nhumanity. At the present time legislation is pending in our\nNational Congress to punish money-laundering, which is an\nactivity related to the criminal drug traffic. We are also\ncoordinating our policies with the international community,\nsince in this field more than any other international\ncooperation is required.\nIt is fitting here to congratulate the United Nations\nSecretariat on the successful holding of the Fourth World\nConference on Women at Beijing. That Conference\nrepresents a milestone in the Organization\u2019s history because\nof the recognition it has granted to that noble human being\nwho makes up half of all humanity and is the mother of the\nother half.\nIn that connection we would reiterate at this fiftieth\nsession, just as we did at the last session, our concern at the\nSecretary-General\u2019s proposal to merge the International\nResearch and Training Institute for the Advancement of\nWomen (INSTRAW) with the United Nations Development\nFund for Women (UNIFEM). The General Assembly\nshould recall Economic and Social Council resolution\n1979/4 of 9 May 1979, which established the permanent\nheadquarters of the Institute in the Dominican Republic.\nWe wish to reiterate \u2014 with the utmost courtesy, but\nalso with the utmost firmness \u2014 our request that\nINSTRAW and UNIFEM not be merged, maintaining the\ncommitments contained in General Assembly resolution\n34/157 of 17 December 1979 and the agreement that\nestablished INSTRAW in Santo Domingo so that our first\ncity of America may remain the headquarters of that\nimportant Institute. This would also be in keeping with the\nextraordinary importance of the recently concluded\nConference on Women.\nWe are now only six years from the beginning of the\ntwenty-first century, in the year 2001, and our thoughts turn\nto an assessment of the past 50 years since the founding of\nthe United Nations. We should also be visualizing the\nfoundations and the shape of the new world order for the\nbuilding of a future based on security and world peace.\nThis will require a qualitative change in the United Nations,\nremoving the sacrosanct aura surrounding the veto power of\nthe great Powers in the Security Council and promoting a\ndemocratic system of coexistence among States and\npeoples.\nThe United Nations and we, its Member States, will\nhave to meet the challenge of the demographic or so-\ncalled population bomb with growth estimated at 84\nmillion persons per year, and related problems, such as\nthe fact that in 1990 only 40 per cent of the world\u2019s\npopulation lived in rural sectors and over 50 per cent in\nurban centres of over 100,000 inhabitants. The number of\npersons suffering malnutrition is estimated to reach 512\nmillion by the end of the century. Children without\nschooling will number 315 million, and there will be 889\nmillion illiterate persons. Those living without sanitation\nsystems will reach 1,750 million. Dealing with those\nproblems will be a real challenge.\nThe new context of the world order will require a\nthree-pronged approach involving an ecological response,\na political response and an economic response.\nAlthough the United Nations Environment\nProgramme was an important step forward for the\nprotection of the biosphere, consideration should be given\nthe possibility of creating, after proper study, an\necological response embodied in a United Nations\nenvironmental security council composed of Member\nStates with a permanent 15-member executive committee\nand a secretary-general with executive powers.\nThe political response would come from the reform\nof the United Nations Charter. In this connection, we\nshould bear in mind that Article 109 of the Charter,\nwhich was written in 1945, provides for the convening of\na General Conference within a 10-year period for the\npurpose of reviewing the Charter. In addition, on 22 April\n1991 a number of former Heads of State and political\nleaders appealed for a renewal of the United Nations.\nToday, it is appropriate to envisage the inclusion of\nGermany, Japan and India as members of the Security\nCouncil, as well as the inclusion of representatives of\nthird-world countries.\nCharter reform would, of course, imply the exercise\nof the powers of the Secretary-General supported by\nunder-secretaries for environmental, political and\neconomic affairs.\nIn addition, the economic response should come\nfrom a clear and precise definition of the role of the\nUnited Nations within the new order. Since, in the\neconomic sphere, the Group of 7 has already been\ncoordinating its policies through a kind of security\ncouncil, with the recent addition of Russia, we might\nenvisage its incorporation into the United Nations as a\n18\nGeneral Assembly 22nd plenary meeting\nFiftieth session 13 October 1995\nsort of Economic Council that might include, in addition,\nthe countries of southern Asia and the Pacific, as well as\nLatin America and other regions. It could eventually\nbecome a Group of 18, linked to the General Assembly, the\nEconomic and Social Council, the specialized agencies and\nthe regional commissions.\nThe Dominican Republic hopes that the ideas and\nsuggestions that have been put forward, many now under\nstudy and being proposed in various forums, will be viewed\nas a good-will contribution by a small nation \u2014 a nation\nthat is small but proud of its participation in the\ninternational community.\nFor that reason, we cannot, as a small nation that\nbelieves in unity within diversity, fail to mention our\nsupport for the agenda item \u2014 proposed by Burkina Faso,\nCosta Rica, Dominica, Grenada, Guatemala, Guinea-\nBissau, the Solomon Islands, Nicaragua, Niger, Panama,\nthe Central American Republic, Saint Lucia, Saint\nVincent and the Grenadines, Swaziland and our country,\nthe Dominican Republic \u2014 regarding the special situation\nof the Republic of China in Taiwan in the international\ncontext, based on the principle of universality and in\naccordance with the established model of parallel\nrepresentation of divided countries in the United Nations.\nThe Republic of China on Taiwan, a Founding\nMember of the United Nations, has a population of\n21 million, a high level of economic development and full\npolitical democracy. It has been a model to all developing\nnations. Its aspiration to participate in the United Nations\nonce again is something positive for the international\ncommunity. The Organization must not ignore its\nexistence. The Dominican Republic supports the\nestablishment of an ad hoc committee to seek a\nsatisfactory resolution of this matter.\nAt this fiftieth session, the General Assembly should\ntake stock of the achievements of the United Nations in\nits 50 years of existence as well as of the unfulfilled\nobjectives in the area of the maintenance of international\npeace and security. But above all it should adopt a vision\nof the future that will enable us to build a democratic\nsystem of coexistence among States and peoples, inspired\nby the profound human aspiration to lasting peace. May\nmerciful God help us attain these goals.\n"

        "file_text": "I would like first of all to\nextend sincere congratulations to the President on his\nunanimous election at this historic fiftieth session of the\nGeneral Assembly. While expressing my delegation\u2019s full\nconfidence that he will steer our deliberations to a\nsuccessful conclusion, I wish also to seize this opportunity\nto assure him of my delegation\u2019s full support and\ncooperation in the discharge of this heavy responsibility\nentrusted to him.\nIt gives me great pleasure to commend my colleague,\nyour predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Amara Essy, Foreign\nMinister of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, for the very able and outstanding\nmanner in which he presided over the General Assembly at\nits forty-ninth session.\nLet me also take this opportunity to pay tribute to our\nSecretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for all the\nefforts he has been making to ensure that the United\nNations is as effective and as efficient as possible.\nAs we enter the second half of the last decade of the\ntwentieth century, there are two interrelated and vital issues\nwhich will continue to pose major challenges to the\ninternational community: peace and development. There can\nbe no doubt that the degree to which the United Nations is\neffective in promoting peace and in ensuring development\nfor all is the most appropriate yardstick for judging how\neffective and vital the United Nations has been and will be\nin fulfilling the purposes for which it came into being. We\npay tribute to the Secretary-General for having accorded\nthese two major concerns of the international community\nthe importance they so rightly deserve in his Agenda for\nPeace and Agenda for Development.\nThe few years that have elapsed since the end of the\ncold war confrontation have made us all realize that peace\nand security can hardly be ensured through mere concord\nbetween and among the major Powers. The removal of\nthe threat hanging over humanity that was the undesirable\nsymbol of the cold war is, and will remain, a major\nachievement that can never be minimized. All those\ndevoted to peace must and should, within the United\nNations and other forums, continue to contribute their due\nshare towards ensuring that humanity is absolutely secure\nfrom the potential dangers posed by nuclear weapons, a\nnoble task towards the achievement of which a genuinely\ncomprehensive test-ban treaty constitutes a major step\nforward and a top priority. It is the earnest hope of\nEthiopia and of Africa that this goal would be attained as\nsoon as possible.\nHowever, as much as we derive satisfaction from the\nremoval of threats to peace and security associated with\nthe period of the cold war, what the past few years have\nmade abundantly clear is that the challenges we face in\nensuring peace and security are no less daunting, and no\nless of serious concern today, than they were in the cold\nwar period.\nThe types of conflicts that have been manifesting\nthemselves in recent years, not only in Africa, but also in\nother parts of the world, have been more of an intra-State\nthan an inter-State nature. The Secretary-General of our\nOrganization has justifiably argued in a convincing\nmanner in his \u201cSupplement to An Agenda for Peace'\u201d\n(A/50/60) how difficult it has become for the United\nNations, under these circumstances, to fulfil effectively its\npeace-keeping obligations. No doubt, no matter how\ndifficult the task, the United Nations should and must\ncontinue to assume major responsibility for international\npeace and security in all parts of the world, including\nAfrica.\nWe, member States of the Organization of African\nUnity (OAU), have, in the course of the past few years,\nbeen in the process of augmenting OAU\u2019s capacity to\nplay a meaningful role in the area of the prevention,\nmanagement and resolution of conflicts on our continent.\nThis effort will continue. But it is vital that the\ninternational community lend its support to this African\ninitiative as some have already done. Above all, it is\nimperative that a more effective cooperation be created\nbetween the United Nations and the Organization of\n29\n\n\nAfrican Unity in this area, and we are looking forward to\nthe consultation at the highest level between the two, which\nis scheduled to take place soon. In this regard, on its part\nas the current Chairman of the Organization of African\nUnity, Ethiopia is fully committed to the promotion of full\ncooperation between the two organizations.\nIt is the view of my delegation, however, that no\nmatter how effective the United Nations becomes in\nmobilizing resources for peace-keeping, no matter how\nrefined the techniques utilized are, the achievement of\npeace would remain as remote as ever as long as the\nunderlying causes of conflict, in Africa or elsewhere, are\nnot removed or mitigated. The search for peace, it is said,\nis in our minds; but it also has to do with conditions under\nwhich people live.\nIn Africa, certainly, and this could be true in other\nparts of the world as well, the major sources of conflicts\nare in one way or another intertwined with economic\nhardship and social problems confronted by the majority of\nour peoples. It is impossible to assume that the difficulty\nwe have had in freeing the African continent from the\nscourges of war is unrelated to the despair and the loss of\nconfidence in the future on the part of the majority of our\npeoples - despair and lack of confidence in the future, the\nexplanation for which lies in the ever-deteriorating\neconomic situation faced by the overwhelming majority of\nour countries.\nIt was largely as a result of the precipitous decline of\nthe economies of African States in the 1980s - rightly\ncharacterized as a lost decade for Africa - that the General\nAssembly adopted in December 1991 the United Nations\nNew Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s as\na framework of partnership between Africa and the\ninternational community. It is now obvious that the\ncommitments made by Africa\u2019s development partners have\nso far remained unfulfilled. However, the majority of\nAfrican countries have made substantial progress towards\nmeeting their commitments in political areas and in\ncarrying out the functioning of their economies more\nefficiently.\nIn an era when the interdependence of nations is all\ntoo apparent and at a time when we all acknowledge that\npeace and security have become indivisible, the lack of\nsufficient commitment to the removal of obstacles to the\ndevelopment of Africa and other areas experiencing a\nsimilar situation, should be seen as a source of serious\nconcern, with its immense implications for regional and\ninternational peace and security. To the extent that, in areas\nof the world such as Africa, peace can never be made to\nbe durable without development, the best approach to and\nthe most effective method for the prevention of conflicts\nis one that focuses on preventive measures in economic\nand social fields.\nAs a minimum measure, developing countries,\nparticularly African States, which dominate the list of\nleast developed countries, need to be freed from the\nvarious impediments retarding and stunting their\neconomic growth and development. One such very critical\nproblem faced by African economies is the debt burden\nand the debt-servicing obligations, which continue to\nfrustrate the ability of African countries to pull\nthemselves out of the economic crisis that they have been\nfacing for well over two decades. No part of the world\nhas been as much affected by the debt burden as Africa.\nWe do acknowledge some steps that have been taken, and\nthe promises made with respect to bilateral debt, including\nat the Group of Seven Summit in Halifax. But the\nmagnitude of the problem faced by African countries is\nsuch that nothing less than the most determined effort,\npolitical will and commitment by creditor nations to assist\nAfrica overcome this major constraint would suffice for\nAfrica to relaunch and revitalize itself for economic\ngrowth and development.\nOn the eve of the twenty-first century, one-fifth of\nthe world\u2019s population is struggling amidst abject poverty.\nAll the circumstances indicate that unless the problem of\nmassive poverty is solved, it will be difficult for people\nto actively participate in development in any meaningful\nway under conditions of freedom and democracy. Thus,\nit is absolutely necessary to assist poverty-eradication\nmeasures in African countries in an integral and\nmultidimensional manner. In this regard we emphasize the\nurgency of implementing the Programme of Action of the\nWorld Summit for Social Development, which aims at the\neradication of poverty. We also appreciate the concern\nvoiced on the preponderance of poverty at the recent\nGroup of Seven Summit in Halifax, Canada.\n\nIt is also imperative that Africa\u2019s partners in\neconomic cooperation take the necessary steps to ensure\nthat full access to their markets is ensured to Africa\u2019s\nexports. We still have to contend with the paradox that\nwhile liberalization is promoted as a condition for\npartnership with Africa, the same nations that lay down\n30\n\n\nsuch prescriptions are often seen to be failing to live up to\nthose standards.\nThe newly created situation in world trade following\nthe establishment of the World Trade Organization has\nmade the difficulty faced by Africa and other developing\ncountries in this area all the more complex and daunting,\nand if flexibility in the application of agreements is not\nintroduced, in favour of African countries, the consequences\ncould be very serious.\nIt is the conviction of the Ethiopian delegation that, in\nthe final analysis, each of our countries, including those of\nAfrica, should assume full responsibility for the economic\nand political future of its peoples. The call on the\ninternational community to do the maximum possible for\nAfrica in the economic area is an appeal to help remove the\nobstacles hindering the development of the continent so that\nAfrica can regenerate itself through the efforts of its own\npeoples.\nThis is most particularly true with respect to food\nsecurity, without which Africa, including my own country,\ncan never regain its self-respect and dignity and be taken\nseriously as an effective actor on the international scene. I\nwish, in this regard, to commend the Food and Agriculture\nOrganization of the United Nations (FAO) for its proposal\nto convene a world food summit in 1996, a move which\nhas been fully endorsed by African Heads of State and\nGovernment.\nIt is true that we in Africa also need to put our own\nhouse in order. We cannot afford to look for external\nexcuses for maladies that are sometimes of our own\ncreation. In this respect, Africa\u2019s economic ills are not\ntotally unrelated to the mismanagement of its economies by\nits own leaders. Nor can it be denied that some of the\nconflicts in our continent have been caused by\nill-governance and by the denial of democratic rights to the\npeoples of the continent. The path that my own country,\nEthiopia, has traversed during the past two decades is very\ninstructive in this regard.\nIt was little more than four years ago that the\nEthiopian peoples managed to get rid of a military\ndictatorship that had for 17 years brutalized the society,\nbrought its social fabric to the breaking point, almost\ndestroyed the country\u2019s economy through mismanagement\nand the imposition of stifling State control, and militarized\nthe society. For our new Government, which was\nestablished soon after the overthrow of the military\ndictatorship, the responsibilities of restoring peace and\nsecurity to the country, introducing democracy and respect\nfor human rights, and rehabilitating and reforming the\neconomy were daunting tasks that needed to be tackled\nsimultaneously and immediately. But we feel that we have\npassed the test, and our success in putting in place in our\ncountry the first-ever democratically elected Government\nin the long history of Ethiopia is a source of great\nsatisfaction to our peoples.\nOur vision for Ethiopia is one in which all its\npeoples would be proud of belonging to it. This is an\nEthiopia inspired by grass roots democracy and a genuine\ndevolution of power within a federal system as stipulated\nin the Constitution of the Federal Democratic Republic of\nEthiopia - a country which would be one of the pillars of\npeace and cooperation in its own subregion and in the\nAfrican continent as a whole. My country attaches great\nimportance to full cooperation with countries of its\nsubregion with a view to promoting peace and laying the\nfoundation for joint efforts aimed at the economic revival\nof our area.\nNo part of our continent has suffered as much as the\nHorn of Africa in the past two decades, as a result of\ncivil wars and instability. Some of the conflicts in our\nsubregion still remain unresolved. There are many reasons\nwhy the countries and the peoples of our subregion\nshould and must be preoccupied with the need to establish\ndurable peace. But this is by no means an easy task,\nparticularly when some find it difficult to live within the\nbounds of international legality, to respect the principles\nof international law governing inter-State relations and to\nobserve the norms of civilized international behaviour.\nBut no matter how challenging the task, Ethiopia will\ncontinue to be committed to promoting peace, stability\nand cooperation throughout Africa in general and in its\nsubregion in particular.\nThis is a very historic session of the General\nAssembly. We are preparing to celebrate the fiftieth\nanniversary of the establishment of our Organization. As\na founding Member of the United Nations, Ethiopia takes\npride in its achievements. We also long for increased\ncontributions to the promotion of the sacred principles\nenshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, whose\nimplementation is so vital for ensuring peace, security and\ndevelopment for all.\nIf the global community could not effectively\nrespond to the call for poverty alleviation, economic and\nsocial development, the achievement of peace and\n31\n\n\nstability, nothing less would be at stake than the survival of\nour Organization itself.\nThis unique opportunity should be seized to chart a\nnew path for the Organization - a new beginning whose\nfeatures should be a more democratic and a more\nrepresentative United Nations. The various organs of the\nUnited Nations, including the Security Council, should\nconduct their business with absolute transparency and\naccountability. It is my delegation\u2019s earnest hope, therefore,\nthat at this session important steps will be taken to make\nthe United Nations more credible, more legitimate and more\neffective.\nI wish to close my statement by reiterating and\nreaffirming my country\u2019s commitment to the United\nNations and its devotion to efforts designed to protect and\nto revitalize the Organization.\n"

        "file_text": "It gives me great pleasure to\ncongratulate Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral on his election\nto the high office of President of the General Assembly.\nUnder his able and wise guidance, this historic session\nshould become a milestone in the enhancement of the\nstature of this universal forum.\nI should like also to thank his predecessor, His\nExcellency Amara Essy, for his valuable contribution to the\nwork of the forty-ninth session of the General Assembly.\nHalf a century ago, the world was witnessing, as we\nare today, the end of one era and the beginning of a new\none. In days fraught with foreboding but also filled with\nhope, another generation established this Organization.\nThere was ambition in their design and an idealism about\nhow a better world could be achieved. After a war that had\nbrought untold sorrow to humankind, 51 nations joined\ntogether for the common purpose of promoting peace,\ndevelopment, equality, justice and human rights. Their aim\nwas to create a collective security system that would save\nfuture generations from the scourge of war, but for more\nthan four decades the notion of collective security remained\nfrozen. It was only after the end of the cold war that new\nhopes emerged for its revival.\nWe live in extraordinary times, times full of stark\ncontrasts. The end of bipolarity freed the international\ncommunity from political and ideological constraints.\nToday, a sense of global responsibility is growing. It is\nbeing widely recognized that only democracy, the rule of\nlaw and a market economy can guide us towards a\npromising future. Awareness of an era of a global society\nis spreading \u2014 but so are xenophobic and ethnic\nnationalism, racism and intolerance. Wars of aggression\nhave erupted in different parts of the globe. We have\nwitnessed the cruellest of crimes committed against\nhumanity since the end of the Second World War. Global\nproblems such as environmental degradation, poverty,\nstarvation, terrorism, organized crime, illicit drugs and\ntrafficking in arms require the concerted action of all\nnations. Today, we are well aware that the international\ncommunity must address a human community that is\nprofoundly transnational. There is a pressing need for a\nstronger and more effective role for the United Nations.\nAt its fiftieth anniversary, the United Nations can be\nproud of its work in fighting underdevelopment, social\nscourges and illiteracy, illicit drugs and diseases;\nprotecting the environment; eliminating all traces of\ncolonialism and apartheid; combating racism; accelerating\nthe disarmament process; supplying emergency relief to\ncountries and peoples struck by natural disasters and\nwars; and promoting democracy and universal respect for\nhuman rights.\nSuccessful as these activities have been, the main\nresponsibility of the United Nations is obviously the\nmaintenance of international peace and security \u2014 and it\nis in this area that set-backs have been more harmful to\nthe United Nations. Regrettably, ongoing conflicts and\ntragedies have overshadowed the United Nations success\nstory and have damaged its image and credibility. We\nhave to face this reality and take stock of what we have\nachieved and where we have failed.\nThis is the most opportune time to engage in a\nself-criticism, to revisit the Charter of the United Nations,\nto go back to its basic notions. This is also the most\nopportune time to look ahead with realism and vision, to\nadapt the United Nations to the new world environment\nand to make it the real centre of collective security and\nglobal solidarity.\nThe United Nations experience shows that we\nsucceeded when we reached a global consensus and we\nfailed when we pursued our narrow individual interests.\nHistory will judge us by what we do today. We, the\npeoples of the United Nations, must address the\nchallenges of our times with the vision of the founders of\nthe United Nations. We must seize this historic\n32\n\n\nopportunity to forge workable and durable mechanisms for\neffectively responding to the problems that confront us.\nTogether, we have to make our Organization more\nsuccessful in order to make the world a better place for all\nhumankind to live in, so that children may not regret\nhaving been born into this world.\nWhen the problems we face transcend national\nboundaries, international cooperation is the only appropriate\nand effective response. Facilitating this cooperation is the\nraison d\u2019\u00eatre of this Organization.\nAlthough not exactly embodied in the Charter, the\ncreation of the concept of peace-keeping and the subsequent\nactivities aimed at its application have added to the efforts\ntowards peace. However, peacemaking and peace\nenforcement, the really essential tenets of the original\nvision, have yet to be fulfilled. Let us not forget that the\nfounders of the United Nations intended an organization\nthat would not hesitate to implement international law.\nTo prepare our Organization for the next century,\npriority attention should be focused on the Security\nCouncil, on the tools and mechanisms of collective security\nand on the concepts of human security and sustainable\ndevelopment. The ongoing efforts for the restructuring of\nthe United Nations in general should be considered and\nnegotiated within this framework and in a far-reaching\nmanner.\nThe central issue before us is the enhancement of the\nrepresentative character of the Security Council and the\ndemocratization of its methods of work. The wide-ranging\ndemands to render the Council more representative,\nresponsive, transparent and accountable should be met. We\nare strongly in favour of a genuine and comprehensive\nreform. After two years of deliberations by the Open-ended\nWorking Group, many useful ideas and proposals are now\nbefore us that necessitate further reflection.\nI should like to draw the attention of members to the\nrevised version of our proposal for the enlargement of the\nSecurity Council. We believe that a Council with at least 25\nmembers would be more representative and thus be more\neffective. We also hold the view that the Council should be\nenlarged by the addition of 10 non-permanent members.\nThus the existing ratio of permanent and non-permanent\nmembers could be reorganized so that the permanent\nmembers were one fifth of the Council instead of one third.\nThese additional seats should rotate among a predetermined\nlist of about 30 to 40 countries. Those countries could be\nselected within the geographical groups, according to a set\nof objective criteria, which could change over time.\nTherefore, the list would be flexible and would be\nupdated after a certain period of time, to adapt to\nchanges. Consequently, a new concept of constituencies\nin the distribution of seats in the Council would be\nintroduced.\nIn this respect, we believe that the extension of the\nconcept of separate constituencies for the distribution of\nelective seats is also worth considering. Setting up new\nconstituencies for election could be one of the most\nappropriate ways to rectify the shortcomings and\ninjustices of the present election system. This idea of\nelectoral reform would enable us to find ways and means\nwithin the geographical groups to ensure a fair, equitable\nand orderly working system of rotation for all the\nnon-permanent seats. I hope that our proposal, along with\nothers along similar lines, will receive careful\nconsideration.\nIn its Chapter VII, the Charter provides the Security\nCouncil with important mechanisms for the maintenance\nof international peace and security. Cognizant of the two\npertinent reports of the Secretary-General, namely, \u201cAn\nAgenda for Peace\u201d and \u201cThe Supplement to the Agenda\nfor Peace\u201d, I should like to express the views of my\nGovernment on these crucial issues.\nFirst and foremost, we need to put the concept of\npreventive diplomacy on the top of our agenda. Indeed,\nthe idea of preventive diplomacy is embodied in the letter\nand spirit of the Charter. It is the most cost-effective way\nof conflict prevention. We also believe that the\napplication of certain measures of preventive diplomacy\nsuch as fact-finding missions, preventive deployment and\nearly-warning capabilities should be more timely.\nIn recent years, United Nations peace-keeping\nactivities have vastly expanded. As an active participant\nin these activities, Turkey stands ready to further its\nassistance to the United Nations. We have also decided to\nparticipate in the United Nations stand-by forces.\nAnother idea of the founders which is extremely\nrelevant today is reflected in Chapter VIII of the Charter.\nThe challenges we are facing today exceed the means and\nresources of the United Nations. In this respect, the\nregional organizations have much to contribute to the\nmaintenance of peace and security. The need for a new\ncollective security architecture of mutually reinforcing\ninstitutions has become more compelling. The cooperation\nbetween the United Nations and the regional organizations\n33\n\n\nshould be viewed as complementary in nature. On the other\nhand, given the unique characteristics of each situation and\nthe varied mandates, as well as structures of the regional\norganizations, we believe that an attempt to establish a\nuniversal model for their relationship with the United\nNations may be counter-productive.\nUnited Nations-imposed sanctions constitute an\neffective measure for determined action against the\nviolators of international law. Nevertheless, there are\nserious shortcomings which need to be addressed. In this\ncontext, we share the Secretary-General\u2019s views that\n\u201cSanctions are a measure taken collectively by the\nUnited Nations to maintain or restore international\npeace and security. The costs involved ... should be\nborne ... by all Member States and not exclusively by\nthe few who have the misfortune to be neighbours or\nmajor economic partners of the target country\u201d\n(A/50/60, para. 73).\nIn addition to this observation, the lack of efficient\nconsultation mechanisms, as well as secrecy in the\ndecision-making process of the Security Council for the\nimposition and review of sanctions, are also causing\nconcern to the general membership. We are convinced that\ntransparency in the activities of the Council with respect to\nsanctions will ensure wider support for their\nimplementation.\nThe aggression and genocide in Bosnia and\nHerzegovina continue to be a historical test-case for the\ncredibility of the United Nations and for the role it could\nplay in shaping the future of the international system. The\nprestige and moral authority of the United Nations are\nbeing challenged. For a long time, the open defiance of\ninternational law and the blatant violations of Security\nCouncil resolutions remained unchecked. We even\nwitnessed, with deep indignation and sorrow, the fall of\nUnited Nations-designated safe areas last July. The\naggressor intensified its attacks on other safe areas. The\nlong-awaited appropriate response to the aggressor came\nonly after another marketplace massacre in Sarajevo. The\nUnited Nations-North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)\njoint operation, belated as it may be, has been a very\nimportant step in the right direction. The involvement of the\nrapid reaction force in the operation has also been totally in\nconformity with the mandate as set out in various Security\nCouncil resolutions.\nTurkey, also a Balkan country, is strongly in favour of\na negotiated settlement. However, peace should not have\npriority over justice. We must never forget that no peace,\nthroughout history, has ever been a lasting one when it\nwas based on rewarding injustice. With these thoughts in\nmind, and setting out from the Agreed Basic Principles of\nGeneva and New York, we should like to hope that a just\nand viable peace can be built on the basis of the\nmulti-cultural, multi-ethnic, multi-religious character of\nBosnia and Herzegovina. Hence, we firmly believe that\nthe Bosniac-Croat Federation should set a model for the\nfuture of the Union of two entities. We attach the utmost\nimportance to the reference made in the agreed principles\nto the preservation of the sovereignty, unity and territorial\nintegrity of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina\nwithin its existing international borders. It is in line with\nthis reasoning that we welcome the steps taken on the\nroad towards peace. We should not lose sight of the fact\nthat determined action and diplomacy backed by force\nhave increased the chances of a real peace process.\nThe conclusion of a negotiated settlement must be\nfollowed by the establishment of a peace implementation\nforce. Turkey is ready to undertake responsibilities within\nthis force. The reconstruction and rehabilitation of Bosnia\nand Herzegovina will be the key for the viability of the\nsettlement. Turkey is also determined to take an active\npart in this process.\nAt this critical juncture, we firmly believe that the\ninternational community should remain vigilant until the\nfinal settlement is sealed.\nTurkey has always held the view that the stability of\nMacedonia is an indispensable requisite for peace and\nstability in the Balkans. Moreover, we have consistently\nmaintained that the economic sanctions imposed on that\ncountry, coupled with the policy intended to isolate it\nfrom the international community, were completely unjust\nand unwarranted.\nTurkey therefore welcomes the interim accord\nconcluded between Macedonia and Greece on 13\nSeptember 1995. We are encouraged by this development,\nwhich promises to hold the key to the normalization of\nrelations between these two neighbouring countries.\nIt is not inconceivable that neighbouring countries\nmay have bilateral problems. The same also holds true for\nTurkey and Greece. And we believe that it is only natural\nthat these problems should be overcome through a\nmeaningful, comprehensive and result-oriented dialogue\nand mutual goodwill. Such a dialogue will not only serve\nthe best interests of both nations, but will also contribute\n34\n\n\nto a climate of peace, stability and prosperity in our region.\nWe remain ready to address the whole range of issues that\nstand between us in a constructive manner.\nAs in the Balkans, legality and legitimacy have yet to\nbe restored throughout the Caucasus region. Despite\nexisting differences and ongoing conflicts, we hope that the\npeoples of this region will display the courage to look\nahead. The countries of the region should understand that\na just and viable peace has much to offer. Only then will\nshared prosperity be within reach and only then will\ndemocracy and the rule of law take root. That is our vision\nfor this region. But this vision can become a reality only\nwhen those who continue to violate international law heed\nthe calls of the Security Council and the Organization for\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), as contained\nin relevant resolutions and decisions. Injustice and\naggression cannot and should not be rewarded.\nRegrettably, the main obstacle to peace and stability in\nthe region continues to be the occupation of one fifth of\nAzerbaijani territory by Armenian forces. As a result, more\nthan 1 million Azeris have been displaced. We reiterate our\ncall for the immediate, unconditional and complete\nwithdrawal of the occupying forces. We are determined to\ncontribute to the efforts within the OSCE Minsk Group for\na peaceful settlement and for the reversal of the\nconsequences of aggression. In this regard, we look forward\nto the creation of an OSCE multinational peace-keeping\nforce based on the decisions of the Budapest Summit, a\nforce to which we remain ready to contribute.\nTurkey also continues to follow developments in\nGeorgia very closely. We hope to see the establishment of\npeaceful conditions in this friendly and neighbourly country\nwithout further delay. We are committed to the peace\nprocess in that country. With this in mind, we are actively\nparticipating in the work of the United Nations Observer\nMission in Georgia (UNOMIG).\nThe dramatic situation in Afghanistan, a country with\nwhich we have strong historical bonds, deeply worries us.\nThe ongoing fratricidal conflict has added to the sufferings\nof millions of innocent civilians. We are equally concerned\nwith the ominous possibility that this conflict may acquire\na regional dimension. We regret that the earlier efforts of\nAmbassador Mestiri have been rendered ineffective despite\nthe commitments of all the warring parties. We hope that\nthe recently renewed efforts of Ambassador Mestiri, along\nwith those of the Organization of the Islamic Conference\n(OIC), will pave the way for a viable settlement based on\nthe unity and territorial integrity of Afghanistan.\nTurkey is located at the crossroads of continents and\ncultures. The post-cold-war geopolitics of Eurasia have\ngiven us a pivotal role in this region. Most of the newly\nindependent States of the Balkans, the Caucasus and\nCentral Asia have historical, cultural, fraternal and\nlinguistic ties with Turkey. With a keen sense of history\nand moral obligation, we have been striving to exert our\nshare of the efforts needed for the harmonization of\ncivilizations. To this end, as well as to contribute to\nefforts aimed at preventing the spread of ethnic conflicts\nand hegemonic tendencies, we have been active in\nendeavours to develop cooperative regional initiatives.\nThe Black Sea Economic Cooperation and the\nenlargement of the Economic Cooperation Organization\nare cases in point. In addition, since the beginning of\n1992 we have implemented an economic assistance\npackage in over 50 countries on three continents.\nAs regards the Cyprus issue, we regret that despite\nthe existence of sufficient material for a just and viable\nsolution, as well as for the implementation of the package\nof confidence-building measures proposed by the United\nNations, the negotiating process still appears to be\nblocked. President Denktas took initiatives to facilitate\nthis process, reaffirmed his commitment to a bicommunal,\nbizonal federal solution and expressed his readiness to\nimplement the package of confidence-building measures\nin the manner set out by the Secretary-General. He also\nproposed other good-will measures and invited the Greek\nCypriot leader to the negotiating table. Regrettably, the\nGreek Cypriot side did not respond to this constructive\napproach.\nThe Greek Cypriot side continues to reject the\nimplementation of the confidence-building measures and\nto set preconditions for the resumption of the talks. It is\nincreasingly distancing itself from the negotiating process\nby shifting the focus to European Union membership with\na view to altering the established parameters of a United\nNations-sponsored overall settlement.\nDespite these discouraging developments, we still\nbelieve that both sides in the island could find ways and\nmeans to reconcile their differences on the basis of the\nestablished parameters. To this end, we reiterate our\nsupport for the good offices mission of the\nSecretary-General and continue to encourage a freely\nnegotiated settlement.\nThe momentum gained in the Middle East peace\nprocess makes us optimistic that confrontation can be\nreplaced by cooperation. The Israeli-Palestinian and the\n35\n\n\nensuing Israeli-Jordanian agreements are historic turning\npoints for the installation of a new way of thinking in the\nregion. The road, however, is still full of stumbling blocks.\nAs we all know, there have been violent attempts by\nextremists on all sides to undermine the peace process.\nDespite these attempts, it is vitally important that the parties\nkeep to their commitments and continue on their journey of\nhope.\nTomorrow, another historic agreement between Israel\nand Palestine will be signed in Washington. I hope to\nattend the signing ceremony. I wish to commend the\narchitects of this interim agreement for their great courage\nand determination. We fully support this remarkable\nachievement.\nFor over five years now, the international community\nhas been expecting Iraq to comply fully with the\nrequirements of all the relevant Security Council\nresolutions. Meanwhile, as reported by the Chairman of the\nUnited Nations Special Commission, the recent revelations\nof the Iraqi authorities on their operational capability to\nconduct biological warfare have created a credibility\nproblem for Iraq within the Security Council. We hope that\nIraq will take definite measures to restore international\nconfidence in its future cooperation with the Commission\nwithin the framework of Security Council resolution 687\n(1991). Furthermore, the implementation of Security\nCouncil resolution 986 (1995) would, in our view, be a\nsource of relief, albeit limited, for the Iraqi people. Here, I\nwould like to reiterate unreservedly the firm position which\nwe have expressed from this rostrum on many occasions:\nWe attach the utmost importance to the territorial integrity\nand unity of Iraq. This is vital for peace and stability in the\nMiddle East.\nI should also like to stress that, in no circumstances,\nwill Turkey allow terrorist activities emanating from\nnorthern Iraq.\nTerrorism poses one of the greatest threats to\nhumanity in our age. It is also a threat to international\npeace and security. Terrorism violates fundamental human\nrights, particularly the right to life. It aims to destroy the\nfoundations of civil society. We must join our forces to\nfight back vigorously. This requires effective international\ncooperation. Accordingly, the United Nations has a central\nrole to play in our common struggle against terrorism. The\nGeneral Assembly resolutions on human rights and\nterrorism \u2014 resolutions 48/122 and 49/185 \u2014 and on the\nDeclaration on Measures to Eliminate International\nTerrorism \u2014 resolution 49/60 \u2014 are significant milestones\nwhich lay the groundwork for our cooperation. We must\nalso introduce a plan of action for their successful\nimplementation.\nSimilarly, the United Nations should continue to play\nits role in preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass\ndestruction which pose another major threat to humanity.\nIn this vein, preserving the integrity of, and full\ncompliance with, existing arms-control and disarmament\ninstruments at regional and global levels are of primary\nimportance.\nThis year we are celebrating the United Nations\nYear for Tolerance. The promotion of a culture of\ntolerance is vital for consolidating democracy and for\npreventing ethnic conflicts. There is also a growing\nawareness that development, peace and democracy are\ninterlinked. People-centred development aimed at ensuring\nuniversal security based on equality and sustainability is\nthe imperative of our times.\nIn this connection I wish to emphasize the emerging\nglobal consensus in support of a common plan of action\ntowards a better world resulting from the major\ninternational conferences, which began in Rio de Janeiro\nin 1992, continued in Vienna, Cairo, Copenhagen, New\nYork and Beijing. We know that we still have a long road\nto travel in reconciling opinions and identifying common\nsolutions. The implementation of the conclusions of these\nconferences is and should be our priority.\nThe last of these major United Nations conferences,\nthe United Nations Conference on Human Settlements\n(Habitat II), will be held in June 1996 in Istanbul. The\nfact that more than one billion people are inadequately\nhoused makes the subject of the Conference all the more\nsignificant. The City Summit in Istanbul will be a major\nstage in the assessment of the dimensions of this problem\nand in searching for viable solutions. Participation at the\nhighest level would contribute greatly to the success of\nthis important Conference.\nIn conclusion, let me repeat my opening call to the\ninternational community: we must build on our past to\nfashion a new vision, a new commitment, a new plan of\naction for a better world. Our plan of action should\nembody our best values, our noblest dreams, our most\nambitious aspirations. To do less is to surrender to\ndespair. The people of the world should know that\ngenocide is not inevitable. Aggression is not inescapable.\nPoverty is not unavoidable. But the responsibility falls on\nall of us. We cannot escape the challenge. We must\n36\n\n\nembrace it and not falter in creating a United Nations that\nis more responsive to our hopes and expectations, a United\nNations that will remain true to the vision of its founders.\n"

        "file_text": "I am\nhonoured to address the fiftieth session of the General\nAssembly. I wish at the outset to extend to His\nExcellency Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral my\ncongratulations on his election to preside over the General\nAssembly. We are pleased that the stewardship of this\nanniversary session is entrusted to a distinguished and\nseasoned diplomat. I wish to express my confidence in his\ncapable leadership and assure him of the cooperation of\nmy Government in the discharge of the mandate of his\noffice.\nIn this connection I wish to thank his distinguished\npredecessor, His Excellency Mr. Amara Essy of\nC\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, for his dedication and excellent guidance\nof the work of the Assembly during its forty-ninth\nsession.\nI also wish to convey my Government\u2019s gratitude to\nthe Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for his\ntireless efforts in the search for peaceful solutions to the\nmany volatile situations and humanitarian and\ndevelopment issues around the world that are challenging\nthe Organization\u2019s attention.\nMy Government takes this opportunity to extend a\nwarm welcome to our neighbour, the Republic of Palau,\nthe newest Member of the United Nations.\nA few weeks from today, Member States of the\nUnited Nations will join together to celebrate the fiftieth\nanniversary of the Organization, taking note of its\naccomplishments and its share of failures with a view to\ncharting an effective role for its future.\nThe new global map before us today presents the\nOrganization with a unique opportunity as the primary\nglobal institution. The challenge of leadership is before\nus. However, this opportunity will be missed if financial\nresources and the political will of its Member States are\nlacking.\nIn this connection we wish to support the statement\nmade by the Chairman of the Group of 77 and by China\nlast week with respect to the progress report of the High-\n24\n\n\nlevel Open-ended Working Group on the Financial Situation\nof the United Nations.\nI also wish to express my Government\u2019s strong\nsupport for the ongoing programme of reforms within the\nOrganization. We support institutional reforms that will\neliminate duplication of work, waste and fraud and thereby\nenhance the effectiveness of the Organization.\nWith reference to the scale of assessments, my\nGovernment finds merit in the argument that the principle\nof the capacity to pay seems to have fallen by the wayside\nin the determination of assessments. Studies point out\ndisturbing disparities in the existing scale as compared with\nindividual Member countries\u2019 share of the global economy.\nNaturally, it is the smallest Member States that are being\npenalized by such disparities. My Government associates\nitself with the report issued by the Committee on\nContributions at its fifty-fifth session, held in June of this\nyear, which called for a lowering of the floor.\nThe issue of human rights, implicit in the United\nNations Charter, has been the topic of many debates and\ninternational conferences in the context of the work of the\nUnited Nations. We welcome the programmes of action\ngenerated by these meetings and hope that the international\ncommunity will find the determination to allocate the\nnecessary resources for their implementation.\nMy Government joined in the consensus of the parties\nfor the unconditional extension of the Treaty on the Non-\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) five months ago.\nWith regard to the ongoing negotiations with respect to a\ncomprehensive test-ban treaty, my Government welcomes\nthe commitment by the United States to a zero- yield\nthreshold, and we urge similar assurances by the other\nnuclear-weapon States.\nOn the other hand, during the past few months we\nhave been deeply troubled by the occurrence of nuclear-test\nexplosions in China and the South Pacific. These events can\nbe seen only as detrimental to the principles of the Treaty\non the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and\nendangering the prospects for success in negotiating a\ncomprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty.\nIn the important area of development, my Government\nfully supports the ongoing work on the Agenda for\nDevelopment and the call for new approaches that would\nelevate development and economic policy to their deserved\nplace, on a par with world peace and security. In the\nSecretary-General\u2019s recommendations of 11 November\n1994, he stated that the\n\u201cUnited Nations cannot be a strong force for peace\nunless it is also a strong force for development.\u201d\n(A/49/665, para. 9)\nMy Government fully associates itself with the declaration\nof the Foreign Ministers of the Group of 77 calling for\nrestoration of the issue of development to the heart of the\nUnited Nations agenda, the centrality of the United\nNations in promoting international cooperation for\ndevelopment and the creation of a balance between\nUnited Nations activities for development and its other\nactivities.\nMy Government welcomes the entry into force of\nthe United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea in\nNovember of last year, as well as the establishment of the\nInternational Seabed Authority. While there is much work\nahead in months to come with respect to the Seabed\nAuthority and the International Tribunal for the Law of\nthe Sea, we are confident that the spirit of compromise\nthat brought us to where we are today will continue to\nprevail and guide our efforts.\nIn this connection, my Government is also very\npleased with the successful outcome of the negotiations\non straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks\nthis past July. My Government looks forward to the\nsigning of the relevant agreement in December of this\nyear. At this juncture, allow me to express my\nGovernment\u2019s appreciation to Ambassador Satya Nandan\nof the Republic of Fiji for his excellent leadership as\nChairman of the Conference on that subject. As Pacific\nislanders, we take pride in the immense contributions of\none of our own sons.\nThe Government of the Federated States of\nMicronesia is firmly committed to environmentally\nsustainable development. We urge all members to follow\nclosely the crucial work of the Commission on\nSustainable Development this year and to support the\nimportant work of Under-Secretary-General Nitin Desai\nand the Secretariat in this difficult but essential\nendeavour. In this connection, we continue to place great\nimportance on the implementation of the Programme of\nAction for the Sustainable Development of Small Island\nDeveloping States.\nAt its meeting last month the South Pacific Forum\nadopted the Convention to Ban the Importation into\n25\n\n\nForum Island Countries of Hazardous and Radioactive\nWastes and to Control the Transboundary Movement and\nManagement of Hazardous Wastes within the South Pacific\nRegion, also referred to as the Waigani Convention. It is an\nimportant arrangement that strengthens and supplements the\neffect of the Basel and London Conventions within our\nregion.\nThe subject of climate change and global warming,\nphenomena that are influenced by mankind\u2019s emissions of\ngreenhouse gases into the atmosphere, remains of deep\nconcern to the people of the Federated States of Micronesia.\nUnfortunately, though, it seems that much of the world\ndoes not at present share our feeling of urgency regarding\nthe continuing debate over this problem.\nThe developments during the past year relating to the\nFramework Convention on Climate Change have to some\nextent been encouraging, but the process still suffers greatly\nfrom the strong political and economic forces that obscure\nthe Convention\u2019s clearly stated objective: the stabilization\nof greenhouse gases in the atmosphere at safe levels.\nEveryone agrees that this objective can be reached only\nthrough difficult adjustments within the industrialized\ncountries and assistance to the developing world in\nacquiring environmentally clean technologies. It is also\nunderstood that this must be done in stages over a certain\nperiod of time. But the first steps must be initiated at once.\nThe First Conference of the parties of the Convention,\nheld in Berlin earlier this year, made the very crucial\ndetermination that the initial undertakings by industrialized\ncountries to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions were\ninadequate. Regrettably, the Conference did not see fit to\nadopt as a next step the protocol formally submitted by the\nAlliance of Small Island States, which would have applied\na reduction formula endorsed by scientists back in 1988 as\nreasonable and necessary. Instead, the best the Conference\ncould do was to mandate a working group to develop\nduring the next two years a protocol or other legal\ninstrument requiring specific future reductions. At the first\nmeeting of this working group, held recently in Geneva, it\nwas clear that powerful forces remain dedicated to\ndefeating this process by whatever means they can apply.\nOpponents of the Framework Convention have been\nvery ingenious in casting doubts over scientific knowledge\nrelating to climate change, but we hope that the upcoming\nsecond assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on\nClimate Change will establish once and for all the clear\nlegitimacy of this concern and the need for action. The\nPanel has found, among other things, a likelihood of\ncontinuing sea-level rise of more than 18 inches, or half\na metre, by the year 2100 if nothing is done. Besides the\nobvious disastrous effects upon islands and their\npopulations, many heavily populated river deltas and their\ncities would be made uninhabitable.\nThe eminent Director of the University of\nMaryland\u2019s Laboratory for Coastal Research recently\ndescribed the measurement of sea-level rise as the\n\u201cdipstick of climate change\u201d. I would respectfully suggest\nthat while sea-level rise is certainly the indicator, it is our\nislands and low-lying coastal areas that are the dipstick,\nbut we are helplessly fixed and immovable.\nI therefore call on this body at this session to take\ndue notice of the accumulating knowledge relating to\nclimate change and to reaffirm the urgent need for\nmeaningful greenhouse gases emissions-reduction\nmeasures within the context of the Framework\nConvention.\nI am pleased to inform this Assembly that the\nGovernment of the Federated States of Micronesia has\nrecently ratified the Convention on desertification, and my\nGovernment will deposit its instrument of ratification in\ndue course.\nThe Federated States of Micronesia sees an\ninterrelationship between the three environmental\nConventions \u2014 on biological diversity, climate change\nand desertification, respectively. And only through a\ncollective approach and support can we have a chance to\nrestore, protect and sustain our global environment. My\nGovernment joins in solidarity with all Members to work\ntowards solutions through global cooperation.\nThe current series of underground test explosions\nwhich France has carried out in the South Pacific, and\nwhich it is continuing in the face of unprecedented\ninternational outrage, is regrettable for many reasons, but\nI focus here on the particular danger which these tests\npose to the environment of our Pacific region.\nThe history of nuclear testing in the Pacific region,\nboth north and south, is an ugly chronicle of willingness\nto gamble with the lives and homes of millions of island\ninhabitants. In the region of Micronesia, and in particular\nthe Marshall Islands, despite broad assurances that testing\nwas safe, we are learning only now, years later, that the\ndisastrous effects on the health of island peoples have\nbeen far worse than science could have predicted at the\ntime.\n26\n\n\nAn established principle of international law prescribes\nthat a State must ensure that its actions within its\njurisdiction or control do not cause damage within other\nStates or within areas beyond the limits of its national\njurisdiction. That principle is embodied in article 4 of the\nConvention for the Protection of the Natural Resources and\nEnvironment of the South Pacific Region, otherwise known\nas the Noumea Convention. Together with nine Pacific\ncountries and the United States, France is a party to that\nConvention. It is also an expressed principle in the\nConvention on Biological Diversity, to which France is also\na State party.\nThe Noumea Convention and the Convention on\nbiological diversity also contain clear requirements\nregarding advance, transparent environmental impact\nassessments of projects which might have harmful effects\non the environment. No in-depth, comprehensive\nenvironmental impact assessment of France\u2019s underground\nnuclear testing programme in the South Pacific has ever\nbeen carried out.\nFrance has sought to reassure the world by saying that\nthe test area will be open to any assessment desired, as\nsoon as its present tests are over. Without question, France\nwill bear a heavy responsibility to ensure against future\nleakage, the probability of which is very high. Picture the\nshattered substratum of a small atoll which has undergone\nover 120 nuclear explosions, one of which caused a tidal\nwave. Surely, each succeeding explosion increases the\nlikelihood of leakage from the accumulation of radioactive\nmaterials concentrated below. In my Government\u2019s view,\nthe proposition deserves assessment before further tests\nproceed, especially since France\u2019s obligation under both of\nthe treaties I have mentioned includes observance of the\n\u201cprecautionary principle\u201d.\nWe hope that the collective voice of this body at this\nsession will finally convince France that it must respect the\ninterests of the Pacific region and the world by ending the\nnuclear degradation of Polynesian atolls and taking the\nnecessary actions to prevent future radioactive leakage from\nthem.\nA common thread throughout these remarks has been\none of hope because, at its fiftieth anniversary, more than\never, this Organization is the greatest hope for a future in\nwhich nations, in cooperation with one another, can address\nthe bewildering array of problems whose implications,\nwhile local in their effects, far transcend national\nboundaries.\nOur small, relatively young nation, remote and\nunderdeveloped, joins with many others in similar\ncircumstances in feeling blessed that, at this juncture in\nhistory, there is a sense of universality within the\ncommunity of nations. At a time when the earlier\n\u201cdoomsday mentality\u201d no longer lies at the foundation of\ninternational relations, it gives us hope that the passing of\nthat phase will now make room for more serious\ncontemplation of the future of the planet we all must\nshare.\nIt is good that we are celebrating this important\nmilestone in human history, this fiftieth anniversary of\nour forum for the world\u2019s nations, but if it is to be more\nthan just a forum, we must all keep a vision of our\npurpose in coming here each year and in expending so\nmuch effort throughout the year at conferences and at\nhome to exchange our respective views.\nIn the end, we must find ways to transcend the\nnational assumptions about each other and determine to\ncreate a level of real cooperation which will consolidate\nthe effectiveness of our individual efforts. That is why\ntoday the United Nations is more important than ever \u2014\nindeed, why it is crucial. It is through this Organization,\nand through no other, that the breakthrough to which I\nrefer can be achieved.\nAnd so I close, as I opened, with reference to the\nopportunity that makes this Organization our strongest\nbasis for confidence and our hope for the future. We\nknow that we are not alone in these views, and we look\nforward to working very hard during this, the fiftieth\nsession of the General Assembly, to do our part in\nmaking it, not only a well-deserved celebration, but a\nspringboard to a bountiful future to which our\ndescendants will look back and say, \u201cThey did not let us\ndown.\u201d\n"

        "file_text": "\nOn behalf of the Rwandese people and of my delegation,\nas well as on my own behalf, allow me to extend to\nHis Excellency Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral my warm\nand sincere congratulations on his unanimous election as\nPresident of the General Assembly at its fiftieth session.\nThis choice does credit to his talent and experience as a\ndiplomat and statesman, as well as to his country.\nI am also pleased to take this opportunity to express\nour appreciation and admiration to his predecessor,\nHis Excellency Mr. Amara Essy of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, whose\ndedication, competence and commitment during the forty-\nninth session of the Assembly do honour to that great\ndiplomat, who embodies the pride of his country and of\nAfrica as a whole.\nAllow me also, on behalf of the Rwandese\nGovernment of National Unity, to thank the Secretary-\nGeneral, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for the skill and\ndetermination he has shown in discharging his duties,\nqualities that have scored some notable successes for our\nOrganization and have strengthened its credibility and the\nesteem in which it is held.\n20\n\n\nLet me take this opportunity to welcome into this\nconcert of nations the Republic of Palau, admitted as the\n185th Member of the United Nations. The presence here of\nits delegation expands the horizons of the Organization and\nopens one additional door of cooperation for us.\nFor my delegation and myself it is a special privilege\nto take part in this the fiftieth session, which includes the\ncommemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the United\nNations. My delegation is pleased, on behalf of the\nRwandan people and Government, to be a part of the\nconcert of nations in celebrating this anniversary. The\ncreation of this Organization following the Second World\nWar was aimed at preserving future generations from the\nscourge of war, genocide and other evils that had afflicted\nthe human race for centuries.\nThe United Nations thus drafted a Charter whose\nfundamental principles are based on human rights, justice\nand peace. My delegation wishes to take this opportunity to\npay tribute to the founding countries of this indispensable\nOrganization, who took the initiative to create a world\ninstitution. From the time of its creation, the United Nations\nhas been an ideal forum for the peace-, justice- and\nprogress-loving peoples of the world. The celebration of its\nfiftieth anniversary is an opportunity for us to take stock of\nthe road we have travelled, to pause and look at our\nobjectives and to revise our programmes with a view to\nbeing better prepared for the future. My delegation is\npleased that for half a century the United Nations has\nspared us world wars, and that it has been an indispensable\ninstitution for the promotion and maintenance of peace.\nAs for the developing countries \u2014 those of the\nAfrican continent in particular \u2014 during these 50 years the\nOrganization has played an important role in the liberation\nof many countries from the colonial yoke, and the\nestablishment of numerous United Nations specialized\nagencies has turned it into an instrument of development in\nall economic, social, political and cultural spheres. If,\nthanks to the existence of this worthy Organization, the\nworld has been able to avoid other world wars, it has not\nsucceeded in averting hundreds of conflicts between its\nMembers or in intervening between Member States which,\nfor a number of reasons, have engaged in such conflicts by\nsupporting third countries. Since 1945 wars without\nexception have shifted from the northern to the southern\nhemisphere.\nFollowing the end of the cold war it has become\nimperative to reform and restructure the United Nations to\nenable it to respond to the aspirations of its Members,\nespecially developing countries that receive the least\nbenefit.\nAs for the Security Council, we must ensure\nequitable geographical representation and increase the\nnumbers of permanent and non-permanent seats. This\nrestructuring must provide Africa with some permanent\nseats, with all the rights and duties that these entail. This\nis the continent\u2019s right, not a privilege. The Security\nCouncil is in great need of democratization and the\nintroduction of greater transparency, both among its\nmembers and vis-\u00e0-vis other organs of the United Nations\nand other States Members of the Organization.\nMy delegation supports the idea of reforming the\nUnited Nations in order to achieve greater efficiency and\nto avoid duplication in the Organization and between it\nand the specialized agencies. Such reform should be\naimed at strengthening certain institutions and, therefore,\nshould not be interpreted as having any other purpose,\nsuch as the reduction of Member States\u2019 contributions.\nI should like to conclude this introduction by\nrecalling once again that justice and development are key\nelements for the reigning of peace and security in the\nworld. That is the raison d\u2019\u00eatre of this Organization and\nthe highest desire of the Government and delegation of\nRwanda.\nThis is the first time, since the tragedy of the\ngenocide and planned massacres in Rwanda began to\nafflict our country and people and the world at large, for\nmembers of the new Government of National Unity of\nRwanda to participate in this debate at the United Nations\nGeneral Assembly.\nWe know quite well that speaking at the General\nAssembly is not a simple rite, after which we can just go\nhome. We know that speeches made in this prestigious\nforum are listened to, analysed and scrutinized, especially\nbecause they are opportunities for nations to express the\nwill, aspirations and priorities of their peoples, as well as\ntheir positions on international issues of the day; they\nmust go beyond purely national egoisms and contribute to\ninternational understanding and solidarity.\nThe crime against humanity committed in Rwanda\nwere crimes not just against the Rwandan people but also\nagainst the members of this body, who should give us a\nfew moments to submit some reflections on the first and\n21\n\n\nforemost victim of that crime, which, unfortunately, is my\nown country, Rwanda. With respect to this tragedy, it is\npainful for us to have to emphasize the conduct of the\nUnited Nations, its failure, on the day it decided to\nwithdraw the 2,500 Blue Helmets who were in Rwanda\nwhen the genocide and massacres began, thus abandoning\na whole defenceless population and delivering it into the\nhands of the killers.\nThis was clearly a case of failure to assist a people in\ndanger, a population in peril. A million human lives were\nlost in these tragic, planned events, as if it had been\ndecided to erase from the map of the world at a single\nstroke a whole country with a population of that size.\nIt is important to remind the Assembly that this was\nnot at all a civil war in Rwanda. Rather, it involved militias\nof the former single party and their supporters, military\nofficials of the former Rwandan armed forces and former\npoliticians, who were engaged in a manhunt against\ninnocent, defenceless people \u2014 a manhunt against all the\nTutsis in the country and all the moderate Hutus, as well as\ntheir parents, other relatives, friends and everyone else\nclose to them.\nIn this manhunt the victims were stripped of their right\nto life. They were forced to pay their own killers for the\nright to die from a bullet in the head rather than be killed\nwith a machete or forced to dig their own graves, into\nwhich they would be thrown alive. The price of a bullet in\nthe head or in the heart ranged from 5,000 Rwandan francs\nto 30,000 Rwandan francs in the countryside, and from\n50,000 Rwandan francs to 1 million Rwandan francs or\nmore in the cities.\nWhen the armed forces of the Rwandan Patriotic Front\nand the democratic forces of change had achieved a\nmilitary and political victory against these Nazis of Africa,\nthe United Nations, at the request of the Government of\nNational Unity \u2014 formed by the groups I have\nmentioned \u2014 created the International Tribunal for Rwanda\nand entrusted it with the trial of those guilty of the\nmassacres and genocide in the country.\nPerhaps this is the appropriate time for the United\nNations to restore respect for it by a people still suffering\nthe abandonment to which it fell victim in April 1994. That\npeople looks to the United Nations, which did not protect\nit from genocide and massacre, to prove itself capable this\ntime of trying and sentencing those whom it could not or\nwould not stop from killing.\nThe United Nations cannot afford the luxury of yet\nanother failure in Rwanda. President Arap Moi of Kenya\nhas announced that he will not cooperate with the\nInternational Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda. That could\nbe a precedent if we are not careful. The President of\nKenya as well as the United Nations should take care to\nmeasure the degree of poison that the President of Kenya\nis calmly distilling in the subregion of the Great Lakes by\nannouncing publicly that if the investigators of the\nInternational Tribunal for Rwanda dare to set foot in\nKenya seeking persons who committed the genocide in\nRwanda they would be imprisoned by the Government of\nKenya. We fear that this could be the beginning of the\nfailure of the United Nations and the International\nCriminal Tribunal for Rwanda in bringing to justice the\ncommanders, the planners and those who carried out the\ngenocide and massacres last year in Rwanda. Thus, we\nawait a decision from the Security Council on what it\nintends to do with respect to the refusal by Kenya to\ncooperate with the pursuit of persons who have\ncommitted genocide who are taking shelter in Kenya, and\nothers who may follow them on the basis of the\nassurances offered by the President of Kenya in defiance\nof Security Council resolution 978 (1995) in this respect.\nThe Government of National Unity of the Republic\nof Rwanda, wishing to promote peace and security in\nRwanda and the subregion, decided when it took office on\n19 July 1994 to make the repatriation of refugees its\nhighest priority. We must recall here that the recent\nRwandan refugees are not the first ones. They date from\n1959 and the bloody events of 1961, 1963, 1965, 1967,\n1972, 1973 and 1990. The number of refugees has\nsteadily increased and has now reached the figure of more\nthan 1 million. The international community remained\nsilent about the repeated refusal by the former President\nof Rwanda to allow these people to return home; he\nproclaimed that the country was overcrowded and was too\nsmall, that there was no room for anyone else, and that\nthe more than 1 million Rwandan refugees would have to\nremain forever in exile where they had found refuge for\nmore than 30 years.\nFor the new Government of National Unity of\nRwanda \u2014 unlike the Governments that preceded it \u2014\nthe repatriation of refugees is part of the process of\nrehabilitating the human capital that is so much needed by\nour Government, which has decided to make human\nbeings the focus of its concerns, for it is the people of a\ncountry who are the most important source of its wealth,\nand its greatest asset. It is the population that produces,\nand it must therefore be taught and re-taught the positive\n22\n\n\nvalues of tolerance and respect for life and justice \u2014 in this\ncase, respect for security, health, and social and socio-\nprofessional well-being.\nRwanda, a non-permanent member of the Security\nCouncil has always shouldered its responsibilities in the\npromotion of peace and security in the world \u2014 in Bosnia,\nSomalia, Liberia, Angola, Chechnya and everywhere that\narmed conflicts have broken out.\nFaithful to those principles the Rwandan Government\nsupports any initiative likely to create room for peace\nanywhere in the world, especially in our subregion. Thus\nwe were present at the Conference in Brazzaville, Congo;\nthe Conference in Nairobi, Kenya, in January 1995; and the\nBujumbura Conference in February 1995. The Rwandan\nGovernment requests that the conclusions of the Nairobi\nand Bujumbura Conferences be implemented in order to\nensure the rapid repatriation of Rwandan refugees before\nconsidering any additional conferences are held. We find it\ndifficult to see what the purpose or goal of such additional\nconferences would be.\nAs I had occasion to say at the beginning of my\nstatement, to make a speech at this prestigious rostrum of\nthe United Nations is for any nation an opportunity to\nexpress its views and the way it envisages the future of its\npeople and the world in the light of the experience of the\npast. That is especially the case on this fiftieth anniversary\nof the United Nations, which is a time to take stock not\nonly for the Organization itself but also for the nations that\nare its Members.\nRwanda, for as long as it has existed as a country and\nnation, has been living in a state of constant imbalance that\nhas inflicted on it a whole series of frustrations: the\nimbalances of the monarchic period, when all Tutsis were\nforcibly assimilated into the ruling clan; the imbalances of\na badly managed colonial era, which engendered its innate\nfrustrations; and the imbalances of the post-independence\nperiod, which also created its own frustrations, conflicts and\npower struggles in the neocolonial world. All these\nimbalances and the resulting frustrations led Rwanda\ndirectly into the large-scale massacres and genocide that\ntook place from April to July 1994.\nAt present, under the leadership since 19 July 1994 of\nthe Government of National Unity which emerged from\npolitical formations that had fought against the Fascist\nideology of the former single party and its supporters,\nRwanda has left the orbit of constant imbalance, the source\nof the majority of the ills of which it had been the victim\nup to that time. Today Rwanda is in what I would call a\ntime of restored balance, in which all progressive people\nin Rwanda have decided to work together hand in hand,\ngoing beyond any ethnic and regional divisions for the\nsake of the survival of the Rwandan people and nation as\na whole. This time of restored balance is a precious\nmoment in the history of Rwanda, in our history, and we\nwish to assure the Assembly of this. The Rwandan people\nand Government call upon the United Nations and the\nentire international community present here to continue to\nlend their moral, political, material and financial support\nto the Rwandan Republic and people during the fragile\nand delicate period of this restored balance. For a country\nthat has so long lived in a virtually permanent state of\nimbalance, this moment of restored balance is a great and\nprecious moment. It is like a child which has just been\nborn and which one must look after very carefully lest it\nslip out of one\u2019s grasp. Help us, then, to preserve this\nprecious moment of restored equilibrium, for the sake of\nthe future of the Rwandan nation and all the people of\nRwanda.\nIn this respect, we urge journalists and political\nanalysts throughout the world to support the efforts\ntowards unity and national reconciliation of the Rwandan\npeople, which have regained their identity. We ask those\njournalists and political analysts to abandon the simplistic\nterms and ideas of the past, to which they have had the\nhabit of resorting whenever they have spoken about\nAfrica and the peoples of Africa, of Rwanda in particular.\nWe beg them to leave the pre-established corridors, not to\nremain prisoners of these often simplistic terms and ideas\nof the past, and not to view everything in Rwanda in\nterms of ethnic dichotomies. Complexity, pure and\nsimple, exists in Rwanda. We must understand it in order\nto better understand a people which has today regained its\nidentity and its balance and is united in favour of true,\nlasting national reconciliation, one that is not sensational\nor superficial, which, rather, seeks to take deep roots.\nThe Rwandan Government is determined to spare no\neffort to establish all the necessary conditions for the\nresumption of economic activities, the deep-going national\nreconciliation we mentioned a moment ago and the\ndemocratization process. In addition to determination, it\nneeds human, material and financial resources to carry out\nits immense programme of national reconciliation,\nreconstruction and rehabilitation. This is why the\nGovernment and the people of Rwanda need\nunderstanding and assistance from the African community\nand the international community \u2014 so that a Rwandan\nnation can be built on an unshakable foundation and the\n23\n\n\nRwandan people can enjoy a genuine national\nreconciliation.\nMy country, Rwanda, is concerned about numerous\nproblems, both political and socio-economic, of the Great\nLakes subregion. In this connection, the idea of holding a\nregional conference on peace and stability in the Great\nLakes region has recently been put forward. However, as\nwe have made clear on other occasions, no one has so far\nbeen able to explain what would be original about such a\nconference, especially with regard to how its substance\nwould differ from that of the conferences on the same\nsubject held in Nairobi in January 1995 and in Bujumbura\nin February of the same year.\nRwanda considers that for the sake of credibility and\nefficiency, all the measures deemed appropriate in Nairobi\nand Bujumbura should first be put to the test, and the\nnecessary conclusions drawn, before envisaging other\nstrategies.\nIn political and security matters, the unrest and\ninsecurity caused by the rearmament of militias and the\nformer Rwandan armed forces constitute a threat to peace\nin the subregion. In this connection, the Rwanda\nGovernment welcomes the establishment of an international\ncommission assigned to investigate the illegal arms traffic\nintended to destabilize Rwanda and its neighbouring\ncountries.\nIn the economic area, the Rwandan Government\nbelongs to subregional and regional groupings whose aim\nis to integrate the States of the African Great Lakes region.\nMy Government is determined to direct its efforts towards\nregional economic unity so that the States of the subregion\ncan enjoy peaceful understanding and fruitful cooperation.\nRegarding Africa, my Government welcomes the\nreconciliation efforts of the brotherly people of Angola. My\ndelegation hopes that, for the well-being of its peoples, that\ncountry will achieve a lasting peace. The Rwandan\ndelegation welcomes the fact that the parties concerned\nrecently reached an accord on several important questions\nand adopted an accelerated time-table for the\nimplementation of the Lusaka Protocol with a view to\nputting a definitive stop to the war and achieving national\nreconciliation in Angola.\nWe also welcome the political success recorded by the\npeople of Mozambique for reconciliation and democracy. In\nthe same spirit, we urge our Somali brothers to resume\ndialogue in order to rebuild their nation for the benefit of\nthe country\u2019s population, which has suffered so much. My\nGovernment welcomes the dialogue initiated between\nbrothers in Liberia, who yesterday were enemies, with a\nview to bringing definitive peace to Liberia. In this\nconnection, the official installation of the Council of State\non 1 September 1995 makes it possible to hope that the\npeace process has begun anew. We urge the international\ncommunity to do its part in helping that war-torn country.\nIn the Middle East, the peace process initiated with\nthe Israeli-Palestinian accord of 28 September 1995 is\nencouraging. We also support the peace process under\nway in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\nIn conclusion, my delegation hopes that on entering\nthe twenty-first century the United Nations will be well\nadapted to the challenges of tomorrow\u2019s world. Rwanda,\nfor its part, assures the Organization that it will do all it\ncan to establish peace within its borders and preserve\npeace throughout the world. That is our mission.\n"

        "file_text": "I should like, on behalf of the\nGovernment of Japan, to begin my statement at the General\nAssembly by extending my felicitations on the fiftieth\nanniversary of the United Nations. I also wish to offer my\nsincere congratulations to Your Excellency, Professor\nFreitas do Amaral, on your assumption of the presidency of\nthis commemorative session of the General Assembly.\nHalf a century has passed since the United Nations\nwas founded. When we recall that its predecessor, the\nLeague of Nations, endured for just a little over 20 years,\nwe should consider the very longevity of this Organization\na blessing. But that is not the end of the story. As we look\nahead to the future, the mission of the United Nations will\nbecome increasingly important. I am thus particularly\nmoved to have been given the honour and privilege of\nrepresenting the Government of Japan at this historic and\nsignificant session of the General Assembly.\nAlthough during the past 50 years confrontation\nbetween the super-Powers at times paralysed the peace-\nkeeping functions of the United Nations, the structure of\nthe international community has recently undergone\ntremendous change. Within this span of time, the world\npopulation has more than doubled, and this explosive\nincrease has resulted in serious problems on a global\nscale. Moreover, with the rapid proliferation of regional\nconflicts in the years since the end of the cold war, there\nare an estimated 30 million refugees in the world today.\nAnd, as Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali pointed\nout in his recent statement in Geneva, as we approach the\nend of the twentieth century, 1.3 billion people are living\nin absolute poverty and more than 1.5 billion do not\nreceive even the most basic health care. Needless to say,\nthere remain the increasingly grave problems of\nenvironmental degradation, including global warming,\ndeforestation and marine pollution.\nThe United Nations is the only universal\ninternational organization that exists to cope with these\ngrave problems to ensure that the international community\nenjoys peace and prosperity. Thus it is necessary at this\ntime for the United Nations genuinely to strengthen its\nfunctions and to take concrete action for reforms in the\nfinancial, economic and social, and political fields.\nCooperation with the United Nations has always been an\nimportant pillar of Japan\u2019s foreign policy. I should like at\nthe outset to state that Japan is resolved hereafter to\nstrengthen further such cooperation and to contribute\nactively to the strengthening of the Organization\u2019s\nfunctions.\n\n\nThe first point I wish to make with regard to the\ncrucially important international challenges in this new\npost-cold-war era is that the development of developing\ncountries should be pursued from a new perspective. The\nachievement of greater economic self-reliance by\ndeveloping countries through development is conducive to\nthe growth of the global economy as a whole and will, in\nturn, help stabilize the new international order.\nDevelopment issues have until now tended to become\npoliticized in the context of East-West confrontation and\nhave not been addressed from the essential perspective of\ndevelopment. Today, however, an environment is emerging\nin which the problems of the economic and social\ndevelopment of developing countries can be squarely\naddressed from a perspective of cooperation and\npartnership. On this occasion, I should like to reaffirm the\nneed to formulate a more comprehensive development\nstrategy for achieving peace and prosperity throughout the\ninternational community.\nIn addressing development issues, I believe that\nofficial development assistance will continue to play an\nimportant role. Japan, recalling the assistance it received\nfrom other countries in the past, and now as the world\u2019s\nlargest aid donor, will continue its efforts to expand its\nofficial development assistance.\nOn the other hand, however, the development strategy\nthat we are to pursue hereafter cannot be concerned simply\nwith development assistance. For example, when one\nconsiders the extraordinary economic performance of the\nEast Asia region, one cannot but clearly recognize the\nimportance of fostering the market mechanism and of\npromoting the liberalization of trade and investment. I\nshould also like to emphasize once again the need to\nmaintain and strengthen the multilateral open-trading\nsystem, at the centre of which is the World Trade\nOrganization, established earlier this year.\nIn this connection, I wish to refer to the Asia-Pacific\nEconomic Cooperation (APEC) as a good example of open\nregional cooperation that rejects exclusive regionalism. As\nthe presiding nation at this year\u2019s APEC conference, to be\nheld in Osaka in November, Japan intends to contribute\nactively to the further promotion of such regional\ncooperation under APEC.\nThe concept of social development is increasingly\nimportant in ensuring that economic development and\ngrowth will lead to the enhancement of individual welfare\nand the security and prosperity of society as a whole\nthrough the promotion of education and training, respect\nfor human rights and the advancement of the status of\nwomen. Japan is working to enhance its international\ncooperation in all of these areas. It attaches particular\nimportance to the role of women in development and\nthus, at the recent Fourth World Conference on Women,\nin Beijing, it announced a new policy to expand its\ndevelopment assistance in the three priority areas of\nraising the educational standards, improving the health\nand promoting the economic and social participation of\nwomen.\nIn the formulation of the new development strategy\nwhich I proposed earlier, a comprehensive approach is\nneeded. Such an approach would include not only official\ndevelopment assistance, but a variety of policy measures\nin such areas as trade, investment, macroeconomic\npolicies, technology transfer and building social\ninfrastructure. In addition, it is also important to take a\ndifferentiated approach which applies the best policy mix\naccording to the respective country\u2019s stage of\ndevelopment.\nBased on this fundamental philosophy, I should like\nto present the following three concrete guidelines.\nFirst, realistic development targets which clearly\nindicate the anticipated results of development should be\nestablished, and developing countries and donor countries\nshould work together to achieve those targets. I should\nlike, for example, to propose that the United Nations, with\nthe cooperation of such bodies as the United Nations\nUniversity, undertake a study to establish development\ntargets. These targets would combine indices measuring\nthe economic growth of a developing country by, for\nexample, an increase of its gross national product to a\nfixed level within a certain time-frame, with indices\nshowing the degree of social development according to,\namong other things, literacy and infant mortality rates.\nSecondly, it is important to promote participatory\ndevelopment that involves, in addition to central\nGovernments, new development actors such as\nnon-governmental organizations and local governments.\nThirdly, South-South cooperation should be further\npromoted. I would propose that necessary financial\nmeasures be considered, including the establishment of an\neffective mechanism for this purpose within the United\nNations Development Programme.\n2\n\n\nWhile there is a diminished likelihood of a large-scale\nconfrontation or conflict between nations today, as\ncompared with the cold-war era, regional conflicts which\nstem from religious or ethnic rivalries are of increasingly\nserious concern. Because poverty is in many cases a cause\nof these conflicts, it is essential that development issues be\nurgently addressed. At the same time, it is also the case that\na conflict itself poses a major obstacle to the achievement\nof development, resulting in a vicious circle.\nThe efforts of the countries concerned, as well as\nthose of other countries in the region, are, of course, basic\nto the settlement of regional conflicts. But, in addition, the\ninternational community too must seriously address itself to\nthe resolution of conflicts, and for this purpose the\nfunctions of the United Nations should be strengthened.\nPeace-keeping operations, building upon the efforts of\nthe parties concerned, are an effective means of helping to\nsettle disputes. Their deployment can also play an important\nrole in preventing conflicts. It is thus essential that the\ninternational community continue to support such operations\nand work for their further reform. Japan actively cooperates\nwith United Nations peace-keeping operations and intends\nto participate in the United Nations Disengagement\nObserver Force in the Golan Heights. Moreover, responding\nto the rapidly expanding refugee problems resulting from\nthese numerous conflicts, Japan continues to support the\nactivities of such organs as the Office of the United Nations\nHigh Commissioner for Refugees.\nIt is also important that the United Nations, as well as\nits Member States, place greater emphasis on conflict\nprevention. Japan supports the strengthening of United\nNations efforts in the area of preventive diplomacy,\nincluding the dispatch of fact-finding missions and the offer\nof political support through its good offices or mediation\nefforts.\nIt is for the purpose of promoting conflict prevention\nand settlement that Japan, with the United Nations and the\nUnited Nations University, is co-sponsoring the High-Level\nSymposium on Peace and Development: Problems of\nConflict in Africa, which will be convened next month.\nOf all the regional disputes being witnessed in the\nworld today, particular reference should be made to the\nconflict in the former Yugoslavia. Peace will not be\nachieved in that conflict through the use of force by the\nparties concerned; it must be sought through negotiation.\nAnd now there is a window of opportunity for the parties\nto engage in peace talks. It is essential that that opportunity\nnot be lost but that all concerned spare no effort to\nachieve peace. Japan continues to support the efforts\ntowards peace being made by the countries concerned as\nwell as the activities of the United Nations. It is also\nextending appropriate cooperation, including humanitarian\nassistance. Once the conflict is brought to an end and\npeace is restored, Japan intends to cooperate in the\nrehabilitation of the region in conjunction with other\nconcerned countries and relevant international\norganizations.\nI turn now to the situation in the Middle East. Japan\nhas been actively contributing to efforts towards a\npeaceful settlement. Japan welcomes the agreement\nreached on 24 September in the negotiations on the\nexpansion of Palestinian interim self-rule and believes it\nwill be a major step forward in the peace process.\nPromoting disarmament and strengthening the regime\nfor the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction\nare essential to the maintenance of international peace and\nstability. As countries curtail excessive military spending\nthrough arms-reduction efforts, the resources thus saved\ncan be allocated to development objectives. Conversely,\nprogress in economic development must not lead to arms\nbuild-ups, and for this reason too it is necessary to\nredouble disarmament efforts.\nIn this year that marks the fiftieth anniversary of the\natomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan\nwelcomed the decision to extend indefinitely the Treaty\non the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT),\nwhich is an important contribution to strengthening the\nbasis of the non-proliferation regime and represents\nsignificant progress towards the ultimate elimination of\nnuclear weapons.\nAs an important step towards nuclear disarmament,\nrenewed efforts should be made to complete negotiations\non a comprehensive test-ban treaty by next spring and to\nsign it by the autumn of 1996, at the latest. Japan, with\nfirm political will and together with other countries, will\ndo its utmost to attain this crucially important goal. As\nfor the scope of the treaty\u2019s provisions against nuclear\ntesting, we deeply appreciate the announcements made by\nFrance, the United States and the United Kingdom\nindicating their support for a total ban on all nuclear\ntesting and we hope that the other nuclear-weapon States\nwill likewise adopt that position without delay. I should\nlike to reiterate here the proposal which I made in my\naddress to this body last year that, once the treaty is\nconcluded, the signing ceremony be held in Japan.\n3\n\n\nI cannot but deeply deplore the nuclear tests conducted\nby certain countries immediately after the indefinite\nextension of the NPT was approved unanimously by the\nStates Parties to the Treaty and just as the international\ncommunity has begun to make further progress towards a\nnuclear-free world. I should like on this occasion to\nreaffirm that the nuclear-weapon States, which are accorded\na special status under the NPT, have an obligation to\nrespond to the trust shown in them by non-nuclear-weapon\nStates by engaging in genuine nuclear-disarmament efforts.\nJapan has consistently called for the cessation of nuclear\ntesting and at this session of the General Assembly intends\nto sponsor a draft resolution calling for the cessation of\nnuclear testing. I hope that it receives the support and\ncooperation of all Member States.\nIn addition, I would appeal to all States to work\nvigorously for the reduction and control of conventional\nweapons. The United Nations Register of Conventional\nArms, the purpose of which is to enhance the transparency\nof arms transfers, has proved a great success, recording\nmore than 90 per cent of the transfers of conventional\nweapons that have taken place throughout the world. I\nstrongly encourage many more States to participate in the\nRegister. The prompt establishment of an international\nmechanism for controlling the export of conventional\nweapons is also an important issue.\nThe problem of uncleared land-mines is not only a\nhumanitarian issue but one that poses a serious obstacle to\neconomic rehabilitation. International cooperation and the\ndevelopment of technology for clearing these mines are\nurgently required. As we look to the future, it is equally\nimportant to consider and strengthen the framework of\ninternational regulations with respect to the use, production,\ntransfer and so on of anti-personnel land- mines.\nAnother serious problem facing the international\ncommunity is that of the proliferation of small arms. It is\nJapan\u2019s intention to submit to the General Assembly at this\nsession a draft resolution on the establishment, under the\nSecretary-General, of a panel of experts to address this\nissue.\nAs I stated at the beginning of my remarks, we should\nseize the historic opportunity presented by the fiftieth\nanniversary of the United Nations to realize concrete\nreforms aimed at strengthening the functions of the\nOrganization, the importance of which continues to grow.\nI should like on this occasion to present my views\nconcerning reforms to be undertaken in three areas, namely,\nfinancial reform, reforms in the economic and social\nfields and reform of the Security Council.\nUnless the efficiency of its bodies is enhanced and\nits financial base is made sound and strong, a genuine\nstrengthening of the functions of the United Nations will\nnot be achieved. At present the unpaid contributions of\nMember States to the United Nations amount to well over\nUS$ 3 billion. It is imperative that we as Member States\nrecognize this situation as an impending crisis and face up\nto it. I call upon all Member States to make every effort\nto pay in full and as soon as possible their assessed\ncontributions that are in arrears. At the same time I\nshould like to stress the need for a comprehensive review\nof the method by which the financial burden is shared\namong Member States, in a manner that does not place\nexcessive burdens on any of them. As the second-largest\ncontributor to the United Nations, Japan, despite its severe\nfinancial situation, has assumed considerable responsible\nfor United Nations financing. On this occasion I wish to\nemphasize that serious discussion of the fundamental\nreform of United Nations financing and the realization of\na fair and equitable system of burden-sharing are key to\nthe strengthening of the functions of the United Nations.\nNow, with the situation more conducive to\naddressing development issues from a new perspective, it\nis imperative that we tackle global issues more\neffectively, particularly those relating to the environment,\nbut also human rights, refugees, population, AIDS and\nnarcotics.\nIn so doing we must work with greater earnestness\nto strengthen the United Nations system in economic and\nsocial fields. Specifically, it is necessary to improve the\nefficiency and review the mandates of the various\norganizations and agencies active in these fields and to\npromote more effective coordination between them,\nincluding international financial institutions.\nFrom this point of view, Japan attaches great\nimportance to the discussion on \u201cAn Agenda for\nDevelopment\u201d, and by contributing actively to that\ndiscussion it is endeavouring to promote reform in\neconomic and social fields. In particular, there is an\nurgent need to revitalize the functions of the Economic\nand Social Council, including the further utilization of its\nvarious functional committees.\nThe reform of the Security Council is of the utmost\nimportance in strengthening the United Nations in the\npolitical field. The primary objective of Security Council\n4\n\n\nreform is to strengthen its function by enhancing its\nlegitimacy and effectiveness. Towards this end, Japan\nbelieves it is necessary to expand the Security Council by\nadding to its permanent membership countries in a position\nto assume global responsibilities, and also to increase by an\nappropriate number the non-permanent membership.\nAs I stated here last year, Japan, with the endorsement\nof many countries, is prepared to discharge its\nresponsibilities as a permanent member of the Security\nCouncil, in accordance with its basic philosophy regarding\ninternational contributions, including the non-resort to the\nuse of force prohibited by its Constitution. On this point, I\nshould like to take this opportunity once again to express\nmy appreciation to the many countries that have indicated\ntheir support for Japan\u2019s permanent membership on the\nSecurity Council.\nBuilding on the results of the discussions conducted in\nthe Working Group over the past two years, particularly on\nthe substantive progress made during the last session of the\nGeneral Assembly, and also taking advantage of the\nmomentum provided by the fiftieth anniversary of the\nUnited Nations, I would urge all Member States to redouble\ntheir efforts to reach an agreement on a broad framework\nfor reform by the end of the current session, in September\n1996.\nThis year, which marks the fiftieth anniversary of the\nend of the Second World War, Japan has looked squarely\nat its past history and has renewed its commitment to\npeace. Japan is among the countries that have benefited\nmost from the peace and stability of the international\ncommunity over the past 50 years. I earnestly hope that\nother countries throughout the world will likewise enjoy the\nblessings that have accrued to Japan as a result of\ninternational peace and prosperity.\nI should like to conclude my statement today by\nreaffirming Japan\u2019s determination to contribute to the best\nof its ability to the building of a stronger United Nations\nfor the future, as well as to establishing a new international\norder for peace and prosperity based upon the principles of\nfreedom and democracy.\n"

        "file_text": "In another two weeks we will\nbe commemorating the fiftieth anniversary of this\nOrganization. We shall do so with much ceremony. I\nwould hope, however, that we will go beyond the\nceremonial to take the opportunity which the occasion\nprovides us to reflect further on the role of the\nOrganization and on the ways and means by which its\nperformance can be enhanced to serve better the needs of\nits Members in the coming twenty-first century.\nWe offer Mr. Freitas do Amaral our warmest\ncongratulations on his election. We are confident that,\nwith his demonstrated ability and skills, he will advance\nus even further in our task of reforming and restructuring\n4\n\n\nthe Organization so that it may successfully confront the\nchallenges which the post-cold-war era has brought. He\nmay be sure that we will fully cooperate with him to make\nthe deliberations of the fiftieth session of this Assembly as\nconstructive as possible.\nMy Government is grateful to the outgoing President\nof the Assembly, Mr. Amara Essy of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, for the\ninitiatives which he took during his term of office to\nimprove the functioning of the institution at this critical\ntime of its existence.\nWe would also wish to say a special word of\nappreciation to the distinguished Secretary-General,\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, and his staff for their\ncontinuing devotion to the servicing of our many\nrequirements. Their support for our efforts will undoubtedly\nguarantee our ultimate success.\nIt is vitally important that the dynamism and\neffectiveness of the United Nations be increased if it is\nadequately to discharge its many tasks. Since the\nOrganization was founded almost five decades ago, the\nworld has changed considerably and international problems\nhave become much more complex. The United Nations\ntoday bears a heavier load of responsibility than ever\nbefore. Ironically, at the same time, it is saddled with a\ndeepening financial crisis which makes its effectiveness and\nits very future highly uncertain. This situation cannot\ncontinue without adverse consequences for the world\ncommunity.\nThe expanding nature of many peace-keeping\noperations not only places an added financial strain on the\nfinances of the United Nations, but is especially\nburdensome for small developing countries, such as mine,\nwhich are finding it increasingly difficult to fulfil our\nfinancial obligations to the Organization. Support for these\noperations represents a continuing drain on our limited\nresources and hampers our own efforts at development. Yet\nas conflicts multiply the United Nations will be called upon\nto mount more operations to keep the peace.\nGiven the urgency of these demands, we have no\nchoice but to try and meet them. The time has therefore\ncome for us to put the financing of these undertakings on\na more reliable footing. We urge all States, especially the\nmajor defaulting countries, to honour fully their obligations\nto the Organization.\nIt must be a matter of growing concern to the\ninternational community that the peace and prosperity\nexpected in the aftermath of the cold war have not\nmaterialized. The world continues to face some of the\nworst threats to international stability. Violent conflicts\narising from resurgent nationalisms and religious\nintolerance between and within States have proliferated.\nThe unresolved situations in Afghanistan, Rwanda, parts\nof the former Soviet Union and the former Yugoslavia\nhave caused severe loss of life and destruction to property\nand have given rise to humanitarian crises of immense\nproportions.\nThe situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina remains\nuncertain. The suffering of the Bosnian people, the total\ndisregard for the safe havens and the constant threat to\nthe international peace-keeping force demands that the\ninternational community take effective measures to end\nthis senseless conflict. We welcome the prospects of a\npeaceful settlement which have resulted from the latest\ndiplomatic initiative. With the international Tribunal for\nthe former Yugoslavia now established, we hope that\nthose responsible for the atrocities committed against the\nBosnian people will be brought to trial.\nWe are equally concerned with the situation in\nCyprus which, despite the efforts of the Secretary-\nGeneral, appears to be worsening. There are reports of\nescalating tensions. We urge both sides to the dispute to\nrespond urgently to his call for a negotiated solution\nwhich would preserve the island\u2019s sovereignty and\nterritorial integrity.\nAlthough the Middle East continues to be volatile,\nwe have reason today to believe that a comprehensive\npeace can be a reality in the not-too-distant future. The\naccords already signed between Israel and the Palestinians\non the one hand and Israel and Jordan on the other show\na willingness to reach a just and lasting solution. These\nachievements should serve as a catalyst for new\ninitiatives. Many issues such as the refugee problem,\nsecurity arrangements and borders, fundamental to the\nPalestine question, remain to be settled. The recent high-\nlevel negotiations between the Prime Minister of Israel\nand the President of Palestine must be considered a\npositive development. We hope that all remaining\ndifficulties can be resolved in good faith by both sides\nwith the help of this Organization and the international\ncommunity.\nIn our own region we are pleased to see that peace\nand stability have been restored to a large degree in Haiti.\nMuch has been accomplished since the return of the\ndemocratically elected President Jean-Bertrand Aristide in\n5\n\n\nOctober 1994. We note in particular the practical steps\ntaken by the Government of Haiti to organize free and fair\nlegislative elections, as called for in Security Council\nresolution 940 (1994). The first of these elections has\nshown that more has to be done in terms of establishing an\neffective electoral machinery. The role of the International\nCivilian Mission and the United Nations Mission in Haiti\n(UNMIH) in assisting the Haitian authorities to reinforce\ndemocracy remains crucial. The sustained commitment of\nthe international community is indispensable to the\nprospects for long-term progress in Haiti. My Government\nis ready to provide whatever assistance it can to achieve\nthis goal.\nToday more than ever, the people of the world are\nmaking the United Nations the repository of their hopes.\nThe Organization must therefore do its utmost to satisfy\nthese expanded expectations. It must undertake whatever\ninstitutional reforms are necessary for adapting itself to the\nnew international context. The urgency of our agenda\nmakes it imperative for us to conclude as early as possible\nthe work under way in the many Working Groups to secure\nthe rationalization of our agenda, as well as the reform of\nthe major organs of the United Nations. These reforms,\nwhich we believe to be essential and urgent, must be\ncarried out with transparency and on a consensual basis.\nThey must be realistic and be aimed at increasing\nefficiency. Above all, they must be in full accordance with\nthe democratic purposes and principles of the Charter.\nIn so far as the reform of the Security Council is\nconcerned, my Government supports an appropriate increase\nin membership. Such an increase should take account of the\nsize of the current membership of the Organization and be\nreflective of the principle of equitable geographical\nrepresentation. The discussions in the Working Group that\nwas set up in accordance with resolution 48/26 have\nproduced several interesting proposals for reform. These\nshould now be more closely examined and evaluated to\ndetermine their feasibility. It is possible, we believe, to find\nan arrangement that would respond satisfactorily to the need\nfor enhancing the Council\u2019s capacity to preserve\ninternational peace and security in the post-cold-war era.\nA major responsibility of any reformed Council should\nbe to give further impetus to the disarmament process. The\ndecision taken by the 1995 Review and Extension\nConference on the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\nNuclear Weapons (NPT) to extend the agreement\nindefinitely reflects the commitment of all parties involved\nto work towards the elimination of nuclear weapons. The\nextension of the Treaty, however, is not an end in itself. It\nmust be followed by further steps towards complete\nnuclear disarmament, the dissemination of nuclear know-\nhow for peaceful purposes, adequate security assurances\nto non-nuclear-weapon States and the establishment of\nnuclear-weapon free zones. Especially important is the\nneed to conclude a comprehensive test-ban treaty in order\nto preclude nuclear-weapon States from undertaking\nfurther hazardous experiments. We urge the Conference\non Disarmament to proceed as expeditiously as possible\nto the elaboration of a universal and effective treaty\nwithin a fixed time frame.\nThe nuclear threat, as well as other hazards to which\nwe are exposed, must make us all actually aware of our\nobligation to protect our fragile environment. Since the\nUnited Nations Conference on Environment and\nDevelopment, we have made some progress in a number\nof areas with regard to the implementation of Agenda 21.\nWe have seen the coming into force of the Convention on\nBiological Diversity, the Convention on Climate Change\nand the Convention to Combat Desertification, as well as\nthe holding in Barbados of the Global Conference on the\nSustainable Development of Small Island Developing\nStates and the adoption of the Barbados Programme of\nAction. Much more, however, remains to be done if we\nare adequately to honour the commitments made in Rio.\nThe terrible destruction inflicted recently by\npowerful hurricanes on several sister States in the\nCaribbean Community shows how vulnerable small States\nare to environmental disasters. Only two months ago my\nown country suffered major ecological damage as a result\nof severe leakages from the tailings pond dam at the\nOmai Gold Mines in the Essequibo region, causing some\n1.2 million cubic metres of cyanide slurry to be\ndischarged into the environment. Aquatic life in the river\nwas endangered, while the inhabitants of nearby villages\nwere exposed to serious health hazards. Fortunately, the\nGovernment of Guyana was able, with the assistance of\nfriendly Governments and agencies of the United Nations\nsystem, to contain the danger. These disasters, both\nnatural and man-made, point to the need for urgent\ninternational action to protect small countries such as\nours.\nYet, three years after the Rio Conference, the\ncommitments to provide financial resources to implement\nAgenda 21 remain largely on paper. The target of 0.7 per\ncent of official development assistance is still to be\nrealized. New resources have simply not been available to\nundertake some of the programmes specified in the\nAgenda. Nor have we witnessed any significant transfer\n6\n\n\nof suitable technology to developing countries. While the\ndeveloping countries are ready to discharge their\nobligations, developed countries balk at making their\ncontribution. The global partnership, which was so highly\nadvocated and praised at the United Nations Conference on\nEnvironment and Development, is yet to be formed.\nWe are nevertheless encouraged by the adoption last\nAugust of the Draft Agreement for the Implementation of\nthe Provisions of the United Nations Convention on the\nLaw of the Sea of 10 December 1982 relating to the\nConservation and Management of Straddling Fish Stocks\nand Highly Migratory Fish Stocks. We hope that this\nAgreement, which will be opened for signature on\n4 December 1995, will ensure the long-term conservation\nand sustainable use of the living resources of the high seas\nidentified in Agenda 21. This Agreement and the larger\nUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, which\ncame into force in November 1994, are important to the\nsustainable development of the fishing industry in small\nStates such as ours. We urge their full observance and\nimplementation.\nOverall economic development remains the single\nmost important challenge facing Member States and,\nconsequently, the United Nations. At various conferences,\nincluding the World Summit for Social Development, which\nwas held in Copenhagen, Denmark, last March, we have\nrepeatedly expressed our political will to address our\ndiverse economic and social problems. We came away from\nCopenhagen ready to act, but we remain uncertain as to the\nway forward. Now that the Beijing Conference on women\nis behind us, the international community needs to summon\neven greater determination if it is to translate into action the\nbold decisions we have taken in this series of important\nsummit meetings. These decisions should now be\nconsolidated, and specific machinery set up for their\nimplementation. It would indeed be a great pity if the\npainfully negotiated results of these high-level deliberations\nwere left to evaporate.\nThe great divide between rich and poor, both among\nand within nations, must be considered a threat to world\npeace. The plight of developing countries, particularly the\nleast-developed countries, compels urgent action. The\nproblems of development, or rather of underdevelopment,\ncan no longer be dealt with adequately on an ad hoc and\npiecemeal basis or through questionable structural-\nadjustment measures. What is required is fundamental\nreform of the international economic system, which\ncontinues to marginalize developing countries into a\nposition of perpetual dependence. It is necessary to define\nnew strategies and to agree on new modalities to reverse\nthe present inequities in international economic relations.\nThe developing countries are willing to do their part\nin providing an environment favourable to growth.\nHowever, they urgently need significant debt relief,\ngreater financial investment flows, the transfer of\nappropriate technology, the elimination of tariff and\nnon-tariff barriers and just remuneration for commodities\nand raw materials. These are not new prescriptions; they\nare generally known to be essential for development.\nThus far, however, developed countries have evinced\nnotable reluctance to follow them, preferring instead to\ndispense small amounts of bilateral aid. Most of them\nhave now further reduced this limited assistance. The root\nproblems therefore remain unresolved.\nThe signing, in Marrakesh in 1994, of the Uruguay\nRound agreements has provided some hope that the\nplaying-field for international trade will be levelled to\ninduce the participation of developing countries. The\nrecently created World Trade Organization, if properly\noriented, may be able to provide a rule-based system that\ncould encourage such participation. There is much to be\nsaid for the introduction of predictability into international\neconomic relations, and we should therefore work to\nensure that it is provided in whatever agreements we\nreach. The \u201cAgenda for Development\u201d, which we are in\nthe process of elaborating, must embody the rights and\nobligations accepted by the parties.\nIn this context, Guyana attaches great importance to\nthe conclusion of work on the Agenda. We view the\nAgenda as an overarching framework for international\ncooperation for development. We are therefore concerned\nthat, while we work to establish the framework, we\nshould also secure the necessary commitment of resources\nfor effective implementation. In this regard, we believe\nthat South-South cooperation should be considered as an\nintegral and important element of international\ncooperation for development. International support for\ngreater South-South cooperation cannot but enhance the\nprospects for world development, thereby increasing the\npotentialities of interdependence and partnership.\nEconomic growth cannot be sustained for long\nunless each individual citizen and each individual\ncommunity has a stake in that growth and is empowered\nto take an active part in the development process.\nMoreover, economic growth would be meaningless if it\nwere not equitably distributed. A society cannot find\nfulfilment in growth. Indeed, the development process\n7\n\n\nitself is severely hampered if a society does not take\nadequate care of its vulnerable groups: women, children,\nethnic minorities, the handicapped and the homeless.\nDevelopment must therefore have a social dimension.\nConscious of this need, the President of Guyana,\nHis Excellency Mr. Cheddi Jagan, has advanced the concept\nof a new global human order. An essential feature of this\norder would be the consensus that has now emerged in\nrespect of development and governance, the role of the\nState and the market and sustainable environmentalism.\nWhile this consensus is to be welcomed, it is attended by\nnew social, economic and political problems which will\neffectively prevent it from taking us forward. The solution\nof these problems calls for a new global commitment to\nhuman ideals and universal human development. In his own\naddress to the Assembly, President Jagan will expand on\nthis proposal with a view to securing an appropriate\ndeclaration on a new global order to which all States can\nsubscribe.\nAs I said at the outset of my statement, we must not\nbe content with merely celebrating the fiftieth anniversary\nof the United Nations. The critical situation in which the\nworld now finds itself demands from us a supreme effort to\nmake full use of the opportunities which this historical\nconjuncture offers. The possibilities of interdependence and\ninternational cooperation have never been greater. We owe\nit to ourselves and to future generations to grasp the chance\nwe now have for creating a truly just and humane society\nof nations.\n"

        "file_text": "First of all I wish to\ncongratulate Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral on his election\nto the distinguished post of President of the General\nAssembly at its fiftieth, jubilee session. I am sure that his\npersonal and professional qualities will serve as a solid\nguarantee that during this particularly important session the\nUnited Nations will achieve new concrete steps in its search\nfor ways to meet the complicated challenges facing\nhumanity.\nI wish to express our gratitude to his predecessor,\nMr. Amara Essy, and to the Secretary-General of the\nOrganization, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali.\nWe are proud that Belarus was at the origin of the\ncreation of the United Nations and became one of the\nfounding Members of the Organization, having signed the\nCharter of the United Nations at San Francisco. That\nhonourable right was a testimony to the international\nrecognition of the contribution made by the people of\nBelarus to the defeat of fascism during the Second World\nWar, the homage paid to the millions of Belarusians who\ngave their lives in the struggle for liberty and of the right\nof the Belarusian people to exist as a nation with its own\nhistory, culture and future.\nEmerging from the ashes of the Second World War,\nthe United Nations has experienced the most serious\ncrises and conflicts, the cold war and d\u00e9tente,\nconsiderable changes in the political map of the world\nand the break-up and formation of unions and blocs of\nStates. The Organization has coped creditably with these\nchallenges. Thanks to the United Nations humankind, for\nthe first time in its history, has acquired the opportunity\nto live for half a century in peace. The contribution of the\nUnited Nations to the process of the peaceful settlement\nof many conflicts is well known. One of the most\nimportant achievements of the United Nations is that the\nworld has rid itself of such odious phenomena as\napartheid and is close to a complete eradication of\ncolonialism, another no less odious remnant of the past.\nIt is also appropriate to note the role of the United\nNations in elaborating and adopting universal documents\nin the sphere of human rights, as well as in establishing\nthe supremacy of international law.\nThe hopes and expectations of the peoples associated\nwith the United Nations are convincing evidence of the\nimportant role of the Organization at this stage. The tasks\nthat the United Nations is facing today seem to be much\nmore complicated than those of the past, when they were\ndictated by the pernicious but understandable logic of\nconfrontation. Today it is necessary to solve the\nchallenges of the future world order; and this implies the\nnecessity to reform the United Nations system. Reform of\nthe United Nations, including that of the Security Council,\none of its principal organs responsible for the\nmaintenance of international peace and security, is the\nwatchword of the day, and is in many respects an\nextremely complicated matter. But each State can and\nshould make its own contribution to the formation of the\nrenewed United Nations. This will enable the\n6\n\n\nOrganization to reflect the diversity of the contemporary\nworld, the interdependence of States, the equality of great\nand small and the security and development of all. The\nreform of the United Nations should result in a more\neffective Organization as a whole. The reform of the\nSecurity Council may be carried out only on the basis of a\nreasonable increase in the membership of the Council, with\nstrict respect for the principle of the equitable geographical\ndistribution of additional seats among all the regions of the\nworld. The Belarusian delegation is convinced that the\nallocation of an additional seat for a non-permanent\nmember of the Council to the Eastern European regional\ngroup is fully justified and will ensure a new, emerging\nbalance of interests.\nI am sure that the United Nations will be able to adapt\nitself fully to the present realities, as well as duly to\nrespond to the demands and foreseeable global challenges\nof the twenty-first century.\nAmong the most serious problems the world\ncommunity is facing nowadays are regional conflicts. Such\nconflicts are not a new problem, but in their present\ndimensions they represent a new challenge for the United\nNations. We are fully convinced that, in striving for their\nsettlement, the United Nations should not yield to the\ntemptation to use military force to accelerate the process.\nPeace-keeping and peace enforcement are two different and\nin many respects exactly opposite methods, and not links in\nthe same continuing chain of crisis resolution. We consider\nit very important not to go beyond the limits to violence\nand ruthlessness that are incompatible with the nature of the\nOrganization.\nOur delegation notes with satisfaction the progress\nmade in the settlement of the Middle East conflict. We\nbelieve that the continuation of the direct dialogue between\nIsrael and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) will\nfinally lead to a comprehensive solution providing for\nrespect for the right of all States of the region to live in\npeace within internationally recognized borders. We deeply\nregret the terrorist acts that are periodically carried out in\nthe region and which considerably hamper the peace\nprocess. Such acts must be severely condemned.\nThe Balkan conflict is of special concern to us. The\npresent developments in this region are fraught with the\nrisk of large-scale military activities in Europe.\nThe unresolved conflicts within the post-Soviet\nterritories are still acute.\nFrom this lofty rostrum I should like once again to\nemphasize the unequivocal renunciation by Belarus of\nforce to solve existing problems and the need to search\nfor ways to settle conflicts peacefully by political means.\nThis leads me to the conviction for the necessity of\nfurther strengthening cooperation between the United\nNations and European regional and subregional\norganizations and agreements, especially the Organization\non Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). Belarus\nstands for the broadening of interaction between the\nUnited Nations and the Commonwealth of Independent\nStates (CIS) not only in the sphere of conflict settlement\non the territory of the former Union of Soviet Socialist\nRepublics (USSR), but also in the fields of disarmament,\nprotection of the environment and the eradication of\nterrorism and organized crime.\nAgainst a background of heightened confrontation in\nsome regions of the world, one cannot but rejoice at\nsignificant achievements in the consolidation of\ninternational security. We welcome the adoption by the\n1995 Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons of the historic\ndecision on the indefinite extension of the Treaty. Belarus\nhas been and remains a supporter of the strengthening of\nthe non-proliferation regime. That is why our country,\nhaving clearly determined its position at an early stage,\nbecame a sponsor of that draft decision.\nAt the same time, it is necessary to remember that\nthe decision on the indefinite extension of the Treaty was\nadopted as a package. It envisions the strengthening of\ncontrol over the implementation of its provisions and the\nrealization of the approved principles and aims of nuclear\nnon-proliferation and disarmament. It is a duty of the\nnuclear-weapon States to confirm in practice their\nadherence to their obligations. The most important criteria\nof such adherence, in our view, are further progress\ntowards nuclear disarmament, a comprehensive ban on\nnuclear tests and the inclusion of positive and negative\nsecurity assurances to the non-nuclear-weapon States in\nan instrument of international law of binding character.\nBelarus confirms its non-nuclear-weapon status and is\ndetermined to implement the provisions of the Agreement\non the withdrawal of nuclear weapons from its territory in\nfull and on time.\nI am pleased to inform delegations that at the\nbeginning of this year the Belarusian Parliament ratified\nthe Convention on the Prohibition of the Development,\nProduction, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons\n7\n\n\nand on their Destruction. We call upon all signatory\ncountries to the Convention to ratify it as soon as possible,\nand we again declare our support for the comprehensive\nban on chemical weapons.\nBelarus has always believed that, next to nuclear\ndisarmament, the limitation of conventional weapons is of\nenormous importance for the consolidation of international\npeace and security. In this connection, I should like to\ntouch upon the problems concerning the fulfilment of our\nobligations under the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces\nin Europe.\nHaving assumed obligations under a Treaty in whose\nelaboration it did not participate, Belarus has been guided\nby the wish to assist in the consolidation of European and\ninternational security. From the very first days of the\nimplementation of the Treaty we spent a considerable\namount of resources on its implementation and on the\ncreation of appropriate structures and industrial capacities\nfor the elimination of huge stockpiles of armaments and\nequipment produced not for Belarus, but for the then super-\nPower, the Soviet Union. But as time passed it has become\nclear that for the young Belarusian State the elimination of\nthose weapons was a burden beyond its strength. Therefore,\nwe appealed to our Western European partners for\nassistance.\nFor a long time our appeals were unanswered, which\nled us to suspend the elimination process temporarily. That\ndecision was made due to a lack of financial resources, and\nhad nothing to do with issues of global and regional policy.\nI am glad to say today that an understanding of our\nproblems has recently begun to emerge. Our reaction has\nbeen immediate and fully adequate. As is known, the\nPresident of Belarus has declared that our country is\nresuming the elimination of conventional weapons in\naccordance with its obligations under the Treaty.\nI would also like to point out that, by special\nPresidential Decree, Belarus has declared a moratorium on\nthe export of anti-personnel land-mines for the period from\nSeptember 1995 until the end of 1997.\nOur Republic attaches paramount importance to the\ndevelopment of international cooperation in the economic,\nsocial and environmental spheres in the interests of the\nsustainable development of all countries. In this context, we\nattribute special significance to the series of world forums\nheld under the auspices of the United Nations in Rio de\nJaneiro, Vienna, Cairo, Copenhagen and Beijing to consider\nproblems in such spheres as those of the environment,\nsocial issues, population and human rights, and to search\nfor ways to solve them. It is important that the decisions\nand recommendations of these forums be duly taken into\naccount and efficiently utilized in elaborating \u201cAn Agenda\nfor Development\u201d, which is to determine the avenues and\nthe programme of human development for years to come.\nWe stand for the inclusion in this document of\nsubstantive issues related to economies in transition, a\nnotion which would fully reflect present realities. Belarus\ntakes a profound interest in supporting United Nations\nsystem-wide activities to promote the integration of these\ncountries into the world economy. We are sure that, in\ntoday\u2019s world, such an integration is advantageous to all\nand in the interests of all.\nIn this connection, I should like once again to recall\nthe Belarusian proposal \u2014 supported by the Commission\non Sustainable Development at its third session and\napproved by a decision of the Economic and Social\nCouncil at its substantive session \u2014 to convene in 1997\nan international conference on the sustainable\ndevelopment of countries with economies in transition.\nThis proposal, once realized, would be an important\ncontribution to the preparation of the special session of\nthe General Assembly in 1997 to review the\nimplementation of the agenda for the twenty-first century.\nBelarus places ardent hopes in cooperation and interaction\nto implement this initiative, first of all with the European\nUnion, the European Commission, the European Bank for\nReconstruction and Development and other European\nregional and subregional organizations, as well as with\ninterested partners. We also hope that the United Nations\nDevelopment Programme and the Economic Commission\nfor Europe will provide their competent assistance in\npreparing and convening the conference.\nOne of the most important directions of the activities\nof the reformed Organization is, in our opinion, the\ndevelopment of economic dialogue within the framework\nof the United Nations aimed at the exchange of\nexperience, the strengthening of the multilateral trade\nsystem and facilitating non-discriminatory access to world\nmarkets. In this connection, we consider that the speedy\ngranting of membership in the World Trade Organization\nto our country would testify to a fair attitude towards a\nfounding Member of the United Nations with an economy\nin transition.\nOne cannot but note that, in countries with\neconomies in transition, the effectiveness of tackling\n8\n\n\nsocial problems is directly linked with the fate of\ndemocratic reforms. The new economic and political\nconditions in which these countries find themselves require\nlarge-scale economic transformations and the social\nadaptation of all population groups. Without effective\ninternational support, the achievement of this goal would be\ndelayed for an indefinite period. It is for this reason that\nBelarus is interested in continuing all programmes initiated\nby the Organization in the social sphere.\nThe promotion of universal respect for, and the\nprotection of, human rights and fundamental freedoms is\none of the goals stipulated in the United Nations Charter as\nwell as an important component of international security. At\nthis jubilee session, it is appropriate to note that significant\nsuccess has been attained in this field since the inception of\nthe Organization half a century ago. The undisputed\nachievement of the international community is the adoption\nof the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, the\nconsistent implementation of which will be conducive to\nsecuring universal respect for justice, the supremacy of law\nand human rights. Unfortunately, the path to full\nimplementation of human rights is strewn with many\nobstacles which, in our opinion, are raised by imperfect\nsocial relations rather than by a lack of will to exercise\nthese rights.\nWe are convinced that it is high time today to think\nof, and act for, the benefit of tomorrow not only by\nstrengthening in every possible way the mechanisms of\nprotection of human rights, but by taking concrete measures\nto study and expand the list of fundamental universal and\ncategorical human rights.\nFor more than nine years now, the Belarusians have\nbeen living under the conditions of an ecological disaster \u2014\nthat of the Chernobyl nuclear-power plant catastrophe. The\nRepublic spends annually more than 20 per cent of its\nnational budget to mitigate the economic, ecological and\nmedical after-effects of the Chernobyl accident. But most\nhorrible is what is happening to the health and psyche of\nthe people. The incidence of thyroid cancer in children has\nincreased manifold. The birth rate has fallen 50 per cent\nsince the period preceding the accident. Genetic diseases\nare conspicuously on the rise in the most contaminated\nareas. As time goes by, it becomes more and more evident\nthat the Chernobyl catastrophe has infringed the most\nsacred of human rights \u2014 the right to life.\nWe are glad to note the important catalysing role\nplayed by the General Assembly and its specialized\nagencies in drawing the attention of the donor countries and\nof the international organizations to the Chernobyl\nproblems. As the day of the catastrophe recedes into the\npast, the nature of the after-effects of Chernobyl also\nchanges, requiring a strengthened role on the part of the\nUnited Nations in the development of Chernobyl-related\nbilateral cooperation. On its part, Belarus is ready to sign\nbilateral memoranda on Chernobyl cooperation with the\nWorld Health Organization, the International Atomic\nEnergy Agency, the United Nations Educational,\nScientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the\nUnited Nations Industrial Development Organization and\nother agencies of the United Nations system.\nIn March 1996, an international conference will be\nconvened in Minsk, with the active participation of\nUNESCO and the European Commission, to\ncommemorate the lamentable tenth anniversary of the\nChernobyl accident. We express our hope that this\nrepresentative forum will help to step up joint efforts to\nstudy the after-effects of the radioactive fallout and make\nmore effective the efforts aimed at mitigating the fatal\nconsequences of the catastrophe, on the basis of the\nexperience accumulated by Belarus.\nFinally, the manifold and unfair increase in the\nBelarus rate of assessments to the United Nations regular\nbudget and to peace-keeping operations \u2014 caused by the\nfact that Belarus, along with the economically most\nadvanced countries, was related to group B \u2014 has\nresulted in the rapid growth of our arrears.\nWe note with deep satisfaction the special decision\nto relocate the Republic of Belarus to group C for the\napportionment of peace-keeping expenses which was\ntaken during the resumed forty-ninth session of the\nGeneral Assembly. On behalf of the Government of\nBelarus, I would like to express our sincere gratitude to\nthe delegations of all countries that displayed a spirit of\nunderstanding and cooperation during the consideration of\nthis issue. I address my special words of gratitude to the\nGovernment of Portugal, whose consent voluntarily to\nrelocate to group B opened the way for the adoption of\nthe aforementioned decision. I am confident that such\nactions are an important contribution to the governance of\nprinciples of justice in the work of the Organization,\nwhich in itself is very significant on the eve of its golden\njubilee. For its part, the Government of Belarus, in spite\nof the utmost economic difficulties, fully aware of the\ndepth of the United Nations financial crisis and sincerely\nstriving to fulfil its financial obligations to the\nOrganization, has decided to transfer about $2 million\ndollars to the United Nations budget.\n9\n\n\nIn his fifties, a person is no longer at the peak of his\nphysical capacities, but acquires considerable life\nexperience and wisdom. I would like to express a wish that\nthe United Nations, once its 50-year threshold has been\ncrossed, will remain full of strength and health and\nunsurpassed in wisdom in all its deeds.\n"

        "file_text": "\u201c[Today more then ever we should realize that\nwe are delegations of many countries] to the same\nAssembly which collectively represents the interests of\nthe world. [We must be] conscious, over and above\nthe interests of our own country, of the interests of the\nworld and of mankind.\n\u201cEach of us must first of all make an effort to\nsink our preferences, to put aside our particular\nsympathies and our particular antipathies.\n\u201cThe fact is that ... we did not succeed in\nforming a real international spirit. ... If we can create\nthat kind of spirit, and if we can practice what I\nregard as the two cardinal virtues ... that is to say,\ngood faith and good will, if we are able to apply\ncertain simple but important rules ... we shall succeed.\n\u201c[In an Assembly like that of the United Nations,\nwe must make a great effort to bridge our various\nviews.] Naturally, we must all watch over the interests\nof our respective countries, but we shall not succeed\nunless we are convinced that those interests must take\ntheir place in the wider setting of the general interest.\u201d\n(Official Records of the General Assembly, First\nSession, Part One, Plenary Meetings, 2nd meeting,\np. 48)\nWhat I have just said was not written recently. It was\nnot written when we drafted the Belgian statement for the\nfiftieth session of the General Assembly. It was an extract\nfrom the official statement delivered by the President of the\nGeneral Assembly at its first session, Mr. Paul Henri\nSpaak, then Minister of Foreign Affairs of Belgium. His\nappeal, issued at London on 11 January 1946, is as\npertinent today as it was then.\nThe United Nations was long paralysed by geopolitical\nproblems posed by the East-West rivalry, but in recent\nyears the Organization has been able increasingly to focus\non all aspects of universal society. This is a philosophy that\nmarks a change in global attitude. Human rights, sustainable\ndevelopment, the environment, social change, population\nquestions and the rights of women, to name but a few, have\nbeen on the agenda of the major international conferences\nsuccessfully organized by the United Nations. A\nprecondition for the success of this international approach\nis that we have the courage to break away from the old\ntaboos and dare for the first time to discuss issues as never\nbefore.\nIt is impossible for me here to discuss each and\nevery one of these items, and I shall limit myself to\nhighlighting two of them. I realize that in doing so I may\nbe ignoring so many other problems which are important\nfor the immediate future of our United Nations.\nI will start with the question of disarmament. In May\nthis year 180 countries agreed to the extension of the\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons\n(NPT). The five nuclear Powers pledged to reduce further\ntheir already greatly reduced arsenals, and all other\nparticipants solemnly promised indefinitely never to\nacquire these weapons, which jeopardize the very\nexistence of the Earth. Belgium urged other non-nuclear-\nweapon States to accept the indefinite extension of the\nNPT; I detected the firm will of all signatories to respect\nthe Treaty in letter and spirit.\nWe expect nevertheless that nuclear arsenals will be\nfurther reduced. In this context we pin great hopes on the\nprompt ratification of the START II treaty. Nuclear non-\nproliferation should be strengthened as soon as possible\nby the signing next year of a comprehensive test-ban\ntreaty and by a treaty prohibiting the production of fissile\nmaterial for military use. Those two treaties will provide\nan indispensable complement to the NPT on the path\ntowards the total nuclear disarmament which Belgium has\nalways desired.\nThe coming negotiations on a comprehensive test-\nban treaty will show whether or not the nuclear Powers\nare willing to accept the zero option, which to my mind\nis the most important question for the future. In this\ncontext Belgium deplores the recent nuclear tests and\nfervently hopes that the other nuclear-weapon States will\nmaintain their moratoriums. A decision not to conduct any\nfurther tests would strongly promote the creation of a\npropitious atmosphere for the resumption of the\nnegotiations and their successful completion in 1996. On\nbehalf of Belgium, I strongly urge the nuclear-weapon\nStates to desist from all further testing.\nI have just spoken about what are called weapons of\nmass destruction, and obviously the threat posed by\nnuclear and biological weapons is enormous. But we\nshould remember that in fact it is conventional weapons\nthat claim by far the most victims. In cooperation with\nthe European Union, Belgium will play an active role in\nthis field, as we have done in recent months with regard\nto anti-personnel mines. In this regard my country has\nbeen a pioneer, including through the adoption by its\nParliament of forward-looking legislation prohibiting the\n22\n\n\nproduction and use of such weapons in Belgium. In the\nUnited Nations we joined in the initiative to hold a special\nconference in Geneva, over which my country had the\nhonour to preside. Belgium is also aware of the dangers\nposed by new laser weapons and their horrendous\nconsequences. My country is prepared to adopt an activist\npolicy in this sphere.\nTo my mind, the next priority of the United Nations\nis social and economic progress. The promotion and\nprotection of human rights are an essential element of this.\nOur own history shows that respect for human rights and\nthe existence of a State based on law and of political\ninstitutions elected and functioning democratically and\nfollowing the principles of good management are absolute\nconditions for sustainable development.\nYet we cannot say that the results of international\ncooperation have been altogether positive. Countries both of\nthe South and of the North must ponder this. It makes no\nsense to speak of peace on Earth if at the same time we\ncannot pursue the planet\u2019s social and economic\ndevelopment. World-wide overall wealth has increased\nsevenfold in the past 50 years and international trade has\ngrown even more. But at the same time poverty has never\nbeen greater. Furthermore, economic recession and the debt\ncrisis have affected certain sections of the population in\ndeveloping countries more than others. The inequalities in\nthe distribution of income and wealth have therefore\nbecome even greater. To combat this we need to act\ninternationally, if only because of the globalization of the\nworld economy. Intensive multilateral cooperation,\nincluding cooperation between the international financial\ninstitutions, the International Labour Organisation (ILO)\nand the World Trade Organization will be necessary. We\nmust also consider how the population can be involved in\nthe preparation and implementation of reforms.\nOf prime concern are basic needs. Real social\ndevelopment is impossible if those are not cared for.\nBelgium is ready to participate in this effort, as it has long\ndone. The Belgian social security system too is marking its\nfiftieth anniversary. That system is now being questioned,\nfor the unemployment rate has increased dramatically,\nthreatening the financing of the whole system. However,\nthis system remains the best guarantee for preserving the\nbalance between economic development and social\ndevelopment. The State should remain responsible for the\nprovision of the basic needs for all.\nBelgium therefore calls for the development of a\nmechanism which allows economic development to go hand\nin hand with social development. Governments must\nrespect the rights of workers and improve working\nconditions and the security and health of the workers. The\nfive basic social conventions of the ILO \u2014 relating to\nminimum age for employment, the abolition of slavery,\nfreedom of trade unions, freedom of negotiation and\nnon-discrimination \u2014 should be internationally\nrecognized as fundamental conventions, which would\nprovide a concrete impetus for this.\nThe major international conferences organized by the\nUnited Nations have proven a useful means of studying\nbasic questions relating to the goal of social emancipation\nand genuine sustainable development in all countries. In\nRio de Janeiro, old concepts of development were\nreplaced by that of sustainable development, which has\nfunctioned as a common theme throughout all the other\nconferences.\nAt the World Conference on Human Rights, in\nVienna, a Declaration was adopted which underscored and\nenriched the universal consensus on the respect due under\nall circumstances to human beings. It called on all\nMember States not only to prevent human rights\nviolations, but also to promote those rights. For its part,\nBelgium was the first country in Europe to adopt a law,\nin February 1994, linking respect for human rights to\ndevelopment cooperation.\nThe International Conference on Population and\nDevelopment, held at Cairo, recognized the relationship\nbetween the individual\u2019s reproductive and sexual health\nand the development of every individual and every\ncountry.\nThe importance of the World Summit for Social\nDevelopment, held at Copenhagen, lay above all in its\nintegrated approach to linking the fight against poverty,\nthe creation of jobs, and the promotion of social\nintegration, and in the adoption on that basis of\ncoordinated national and international strategies. It is\ngratifying also to note the universal consensus on the\nconcepts and issues that will deserve our attention in the\nfuture.\nFinally, the Fourth World Conference on Women,\nrecently held at Beijing, stressed the role of women as\nfull participants in the decision-making process and in\neconomic affairs, by recognizing that genuine sustainable\ndevelopment and true democracy will be impossible\nwithout women.\n23\n\n\nThe United Nations should make economic and social\ndevelopment its highest priority. It should involve world\npublic opinion in these decisions and should ensure their\nfollow-up and resolutely implement them in the field.\nBelgium is prepared to reflect the programmes of action of\nall these conferences in its future policies in the spheres of\ndevelopment cooperation, foreign trade, international\nfinance and in its foreign policy in general.\nI have laid stress on two areas where the United\nNations will play a decisive role. It will be a challenge to\nus all; the results will not be assessed until the hundredth\nanniversary of the United Nations. To meet our goal, it is\nvital for us to strengthen the tool that is the United Nations.\nThe United Nations and its specialized agencies must\nmaintain \u2014 and strengthen and adapt \u2014 their resources and\nactivities so as to give effect to the decisions and\nachievements of these conferences. Specifically, duplication\nmust be avoided; rationalization and the possible merging\nof bodies working in the same field are inevitable.\nThe Economic and Social Council must be\nrehabilitated; its role could be reviewed. It should be the\nmost suitable body for staging international conferences\nand, through the United Nations system, should coordinate\nand supervise the implementation of conventions and\nprogrammes. It should also spur interaction among the\nmajor agencies and institutions of the United Nations\nsystem.\nThe agenda of the General Assembly must be\nreviewed so that the Assembly can regain its original role\nas the Organization\u2019s supreme decision-making, deliberative\nand policy-making body.\nSecurity Council reform is the subject of intense\ndebate. Without going into details, I would like to recall\nBelgium\u2019s view that such reform should strengthen, inter\nalia, the Council\u2019s capacity for action and its\nrepresentativity. The Charter gives the Council\nresponsibility for the maintenance of international peace and\nsecurity on behalf of all, and for the benefit of all. Belgium\nis convinced that the authority of Council decisions would\nbe enhanced if troop- and equipment-contributing countries\nwere more closely involved in the preparation of those decisions.\nThe Organization is facing numerous financial\nproblems. The development of new activities is often\nhobbled by disagreements on the allocation of costs. There\nis a growing structural rift between the capacity for\nmultilateral action and the increasingly frequent demands\nfor intervention.\nHow can we prevent the United Nations from\nbecoming a victim of its own success? One fundamental\nobligation is that every Member State must promptly pay\nthe contribution it has been assessed based on its ability\nto pay. Non-payment is a serious violation of\ncommitments, and is even more deplorable when certain\ndelinquent contributors are also demanding a special role\nin the Organization\u2019s policy- and decision-making\nprocesses.\nFinally, we must keep working towards the new\ninternational spirit to which I referred at the beginning of\nmy statement. Without such a new awareness in society\nat large, we shall never be able to make the United\nNations into the universal instrument for peace and\nsustainable development it must be. In that context, I\nwant to close with another quotation from that great\nstatesman, the first President of the General Assembly,\nBelgian Foreign Minister Paul Henri Spaak, who as early\nas 1943 said that\n\u201cThe world will never be organized if each\nState retains its full national sovereignty and the\nabsolute right to resolve its political and economic\nproblems as it sees fit\u201d.\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me to congratulate\nyou, Sir, on your election to the presidency of this historic\nfiftieth session of the General Assembly. Given your talent\nand experience, I am confident that you will guide this\nsession to the successful completion of the noble mission\nentrusted to it by the Charter of the United Nations.\nI should also like to express my appreciation and\nthanks to your predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Amara\nEssy, for his outstanding leadership in accomplishing the\ntasks of the last session.\nI should like to take this opportunity to extend my\nwarm welcome and congratulations to the Republic of Palau\non its admission to the United Nations during the past year.\nFurther, I wish to express Armenia\u2019s gratitude to the\nSecretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-\nGhali, for the vision with which he has guided the\nOrganization, and for his tireless activity in redefining the\nrole of the United Nations in this changing world.\nAfter its declaration of independence in 1991,\nArmenia began implementing radical economic and\npolitical reforms to create a healthy market economy and\na truly democratic society. In addition to severe economic\nand social problems resulting from the extraordinary\nchanges buffeting the country, the transition process in\nArmenia has been exacerbated by the collapse of\ntraditional economic and trade arrangements, instability in\nthe region, the transport and energy blockade imposed by\nneighbouring Azerbaijan, the devastation caused by the\nmassive earthquake of 1988, the conflict between\nNagorny Karabakh and Azerbaijan and the presence of\n360,000 refugees.\nDespite such serious economic and social\ncircumstances, economic reforms have been continued\nand even expanded over the last year. From the point of\nview of current economic trends, 1994 was exceptional.\nThe programme of socio-economic development was\naimed at halting economic decline, reducing inflation and\ncreating conditions for the revitalization of the economy.\nAlthough the problems specifically related to the\ntransition remain, the measures taken not only have halted\nthe recession but also have provided a measure of\neconomic growth.\nIndeed, in 1994 Armenia became the first former\nSoviet Republic to record economic growth. A tight credit\npolicy has forced down the inflation rate from 30 per cent\na month last year to 1 per cent in August. The currency,\nthe Dram, is now one of the strongest in the region. Since\nmid-1994 a macroeconomic stabilization programme has\nbeen under way.\nWe have maintained a policy of fiscal and monetary\nresponsibility to encourage the development of the private\nsector. We are also undertaking a mass privatization\nprogramme to transfer nearly all State-owned enterprises\nto private ownership. We believe that the private sector\nwill be the engine of growth in Armenia and an important\nsource of employment opportunity. We welcome the\nparticipation of foreign investors in this process without\nrestriction, and we have a completely open foreign trade\npolicy.\n20\n\n\nOf course implementation of our economic policy has\nbeen hampered by the situation in the energy sector, which\nremains critical. Therefore, the only viable, effective short-\nterm solution to Armenia\u2019s energy crisis is the restarting of\nthe Metsamor Nuclear Power plant, which is under way.\nArmenia, like other States in transition, is in the\nprocess of emerging from economic crisis and of laying the\nfoundations for economic and social development. While\nStates have the primary responsibility to achieve social and\neconomic development, they cannot do so alone. They need\nthe substantial support and encouragement of the\ninternational community. Multilateral and bilateral donors\nshould coordinate their financing and planning procedures\nto improve the impact of their activity toward the\nachievement of the objectives of social development\nprogrammes of countries with economies in transition.\nGiven its universal membership and the unique and\ncomprehensive mandate reflected in its Charter, the United\nNations has a vital role to play in the development process,\nparticularly in ensuring the implementation of development\ncommitments in an integrated fashion. Hence, its\nrelationship with the specialized agencies, funds, regional\norganizations and commissions, the Bretton Woods\ninstitutions and the World Trade Organization should be\nanalysed with a view to enhancing effective action and\ncoordination between them in the economic, social and\nrelated fields.\nThe commitment to the transformation of the centrally\nplanned economy to a market economy is seen by the\nGovernment of Armenia as an integral part of the transition\nto a democratic State. In turn, a free-market economy will\nflourish in a stable democracy which promotes and\nunderpins economic development. The success of a\ndemocracy requires informed and civil discourse and\nrespect for the rule of law and for the democratic process,\nincluding the expression of the public view through free\nand fair elections.\nLast July, Armenia held its first democratic\nparliamentary elections since its declared independence.\nSimultaneously, Armenians voted in a constitutional\nreferendum on the first democratic institution in the history\nof Armenia. The Constitution was adopted and the liberal\ndemocratic forces gained an overwhelming majority in the\nnew parliament, now renamed the National Assembly.\nInternational and local observers reported that the elections\nran smoothly and were held in a free atmosphere. I should\nlike to take this opportunity to express my Government\u2019s\ndeep appreciation for the monitoring activities of the United\nNations observers in the parliamentary elections and the\nconstitutional referendum.\nThe convincing victory of the liberal democratic\nforces has guaranteed the continuation of the political and\nsocio-economic policies pursued thus far by the\nGovernment, based on a clear programme and an\nachievable plan of development. The adoption of the\nConstitution is a decisive factor in the maintenance of the\nstability of Armenian statehood, as well as the legal\nguarantee for the development of a civic society and a\nmarket economy.\nDevelopment and human rights are interrelated and\nmutually reinforcing. There can be no genuine long-term\ndevelopment without respect for the full spectrum of the\nrights of individuals. Armenia strongly supports the\nefforts of the United Nations High Commissioner for\nHuman Rights, Mr. Ayala Lasso. Member States must\ncontinue working toward better coordination within the\nHuman Rights Centre and consolidation of human rights\nfunctions within the United Nations system. The United\nNations should give priority to monitoring and prevention.\nArmenia considers self-determination in its multitude\nof manifestations to be an inalienable human right. The\nconflict between the people of Nagorno Karabakh, who\nare striving for self-determination, and the Azerbaijani\nGovernment, which refuses to address the rights of the\npeople of Nagorno Karabakh, continues to concern the\nGovernment of Armenia. The peaceful resolution of the\nconflict remains Armenia\u2019s top foreign policy priority.\nDespite the maintenance of the cease-fire since\nMay 1994, the conflict continues to threaten peace,\nstability and security in our region. The lack of any\nserious breakthrough in negotiations during this respite,\nthe uncertainties surrounding the political process and the\nreluctance of the international community to seize the\nopportunity to act firmly and decisively make the 15-\nmonth-long cease-fire highly fragile. Indeed, the longer\nthe cease-fire exists without any major developments, the\nmore likely the resumption of military activity in the near\nfuture will become.\nSince the last session of the General Assembly,\nimportant developments have taken place in the political\nprocess. Visible progress was made at the Summit\nmeeting of the Organization for Security and Cooperation\nin Europe (OSCE) held in Budapest in December 1994,\nwhen an agreement was reached at the highest levels to\ncombine the mediation efforts of the OSCE and Russia,\n21\n\n\nand create a co-chairmanship to guide the peace process.\nThe Summit also expressed readiness to establish a\nmultinational OSCE peace-keeping operation to consolidate\nthe existing cease-fire, make the peace process irreversible\nand open the way for the Minsk Conference.\nToday, under Russian and Finn co-chairmanship, and\nwith the participation of nine Minsk Group member States,\nthe OSCE is actively pursuing the peace process through\nintensive negotiations. While these efforts have certainly\nyielded results, a demonstration of political will by the\nparties to the conflict and an added commitment by the\ninternational community are needed if a serious\nbreakthrough is to be achieved.\nAs part of the step-by-step approach to the resolution\nof the conflict, the signing of the political agreement is\ncritical for the consolidation of the cease-fire and for the\noverall settlement of the conflict. This political agreement,\nwhich is currently, during the Minsk Group negotiations,\nbeing discussed by the parties to the conflict, stipulates the\ndeployment of the OSCE peace-keeping forces, the return\nof the occupied territories, the lifting of all blockades and\nthe return of refugees.\nThe successful conclusion of this agreement depends\nmainly on a provision that provides local, regional and\ninternational security guarantees that will ensure the\nphysical existence of the people of Nagorno Karabakh, and\neliminate the possibility of the resumption of military\nactivities. Such guarantees, along with standard security\nmeasures \u2014 deployment of OSCE peace-keepers,\ndemilitarization of all evacuated territory, and so on \u2014\nmust also address Nagorno Karabakh\u2019s legitimate need, as\nan indispensable security element, of a corridor linking the\nenclave with the outside world.\nThe proliferation of weapons of mass destruction\nposes a grave threat to both global and regional security\nand stability. At the 1995 Review and Extension\nConference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons, the States parties\nundertook an in-depth and earnest review of the\nimplementation of the Treaty and reached a decision for the\nTreaty to continue in force indefinitely. My delegation\nwould like to take this opportunity to reiterate its\nsatisfaction with this historic outcome. Armenia attaches\ngreat importance to the early conclusion of a\ncomprehensive nuclear test-ban treaty \u2014 and no later than\n1996.\nIn recent years the United Nations has convened a\nseries of global conferences. The important process of\ninternational gatherings has continued this year. The\nWorld Summit for Social Development brought together\nmany strands that had previously been pursued separately.\nFor the first time in history there was a political\nacknowledgment that the eradication of poverty must be\nthe first priority of any society.\nWithin each of the United Nations global\nconferences, the advancement of women has been a major\nconcern, and we have witnessed a number of considerable\ngains on women\u2019s issues. The Fourth Conference on\nWomen, which has just concluded in Beijing, both\nreaffirms the commitments toward the advancement of\nwomen made in the previous conferences and builds upon\ntheir achievements.\nThe Platform of Action agreed upon at the Beijing\nConference will lead to the creation of new machinery\nthat will help countries integrate women\u2019s issues into\nnational policy-making.\nVirtually all Member States of the United Nations\nfavour an increase in the membership of the Security\nCouncil reflecting the radical changes in the world and\nthe increase in the Organization\u2019s overall membership.\nHowever, an increase in membership should not diminish\nthe Council\u2019s efficiency. Meanwhile, the Security Council\nmust continue working to improve its openness,\ntransparency and communication with non-members. The\nCouncil should also be able to respond to emerging\nthreats and disputes before their escalation into armed\nconflict.\nThere is a direct link between peace and security, on\nthe one hand, and economic and social development, on\nthe other. Therefore, radical reform of the Economic and\nSocial Council is imperative. As a first step, strengthening\nof the Council\u2019s policy-setting role and coordination\ncapability in operational activities for development is\nrequired. Together with improved coordination of United\nNations organizations and agencies devoted to economic\nand social progress, a strengthened Economic and Social\nCouncil could better assist the Security Council and\nadvise it of potential emergencies arising out of economic\nand social conditions.\nThe issue of financial resources is fundamental. If\nMember States wish to have an effective world\nOrganization to meet global challenges, they must pay\ntheir assessments, as they are legally committed to do.\n22\n\n\nWe are not indifferent to the financial situation of the\nUnited Nations, and I would like to assure the Assembly\nthat my country will do its best to fulfil its obligations.\nHowever, the current assessment formulas no longer fully\nreflect global economic and political realities. The High-\nlevel Open-ended Working Group on the Financial Situation\nof the United Nations was established by the Assembly in\npart in response to the necessity for revision of the\nassessment structure. The aim of a comprehensive financial\nreform must be to establish a transparent and reliable scale,\nreflective of Members\u2019 real capacity to pay, automatically\nadaptable to changed national circumstances and giving\nconsideration to the needs of countries with low per capita\nincomes.\nLet me conclude by wishing the General Assembly\nevery success in the demanding work it faces during this\nsession, and by pledging Armenia\u2019s most active and\nefficient cooperation with the delegations of other States as\nyou, Sir, preside over our deliberations.\n"

        "file_text": "I have to confess to my\nusual excitement and pleasure at addressing the General\nAssembly, exceptionally crowded and patient even at this\nlate hour.\nLet me begin by congratulating Mr. Diogo Freitas do\nAmaral on his election as President of the General\nAssembly at its fiftieth session. Mr. Freito do Amaral\nrepresents a country with a long history of global\nachievements. With his personal qualities and experience,\nhe is a very natural choice to guide the work of this\nAssembly at such a critical moment.\nLet me also pay tribute to his predecessor, Mr.\nAmara Essy, for his dedicated and distinguished\nstewardship during the last session of the General\nAssembly.\nI want also to record the gratitude of my\nGovernment to the Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros\nBoutros-Ghali, for the measure and quality of the\nleadership that he continues to provide in the direction\nand work of the Organization.\n28\n\n\nBarely three weeks ago Hurricane Luis wrought\ndevastation on several island countries in the Caribbean,\ncausing major setbacks to economic and sustainable\ndevelopment, as well as the loss of lives. As we ourselves\nrecently experienced two similar disasters, our thoughts and\nsympathy are with the people of the Caribbean nations\ndevastated by Hurricane Luis, and we pray for their speedy\nrecovery.\nThe President of the General Assembly, in his opening\nremarks, reminded us of the scope of the membership and\nthe universal character of this Organization. Samoa is proud\nto note that a sister nation of the Pacific, the Republic of\nPalau, is the newest Member of the United Nations, and I\nam delighted to extend to Palau the warmest of welcomes.\nTwo weeks ago the Republic of Palau was acclaimed to\nmembership \u2014 becoming the sixteenth member \u2014 of the\nSouth Pacific Forum. That too was a moment of great pride\nfor all of us.\nWe come together at a special moment for this\nOrganization and in the history of international cooperation.\nUndeniably, this is a session of exceptional importance. We\nneed to take stock of where we, the United Nations, are and\nto set new goals and priorities for the future.\nSamoa believes that any stocktaking must be rooted in\nthe Charter, which proclaims the purposes and principles of\nthe Organization. Regrettably, the Charter pledges that we\nhave made to succeeding generations remain largely\nunfulfilled.\nIt is right, and it is natural, therefore that at this\nfiftieth session, we, the peoples of the United Nations,\nshould seek to renew our commitment to those pledges. But\nfirst, it must be remembered that they are pledges that carry\nthe attendant duty \u2014 a most sacred duty \u2014 to make them\nrealities. It is a duty imposed upon us all and accepted upon\nmembership in our Organization. Far too often, this is\nforgotten, or seemingly ignored.\nThis session will also be the natural occasion on which\nto reaffirm our support for, and our faith in, the United\nNations. I speak positively and unhesitatingly about\nreaffirmation because, quite frankly, what else is there to\ntake the place of the United Nations?\nWhat we have is certainly not perfect. And given its\nalmost universal make-up, the range of issues before it and\nthe increasing demands being made of the United Nations,\nit would be surprising if this were the case. Indeed, in\nrecent years, all of us in this Assembly have been engaged\nin various activities aimed at making the United Nations\nmore relevant, more efficient and more cost-effective and\nat preparing the Organization for the twenty-first century.\nWe welcome in particular resolution 49/252, which was\nrecently adopted, on strengthening of the United Nations\nsystem, and we look forward to taking part in the\ndiscussions in the Open-ended High-level Working Group\nestablished. If and when we have devised changes and\nimprovements in the United Nations system, I dare say\nthat in years to come it will be necessary to persist in\nmonitoring and putting into place further needed reforms\nto ensure the sustaining vigour of the Organization. That\nbeing the case, there is clearly room for criticism and\nfault-finding, from among ourselves as well as from those\nwho look on. We do not however think the shortcomings\nof the United Nations warrant uninformed cynicism and\nunfair blame, nor the charge of irrelevance that is\nsometimes levelled at it.\nBut clearly, the standing and the very role of the\nUnited Nations is at risk if the Members continue to deny\nthe Organization the funds and resources it needs. The\nSecretary-General has spoken of this matter time and\nagain, and once more in his report on the work of the\nOrganization (A/50/1). The Organization is in a most\ncritical financial state, but it is also clear that the situation\ncan be substantially improved with the early payment of\narrears and by the full and timely payment of assessed\ncontributions. We can only urge the most immediate\naction on the part of those who know they must act.\nSamoa is a small and least-developed country. We\nare deeply committed to the United Nations, and we will\ncontinue to meet our financial and other responsibilities,\nnotwithstanding the budgetary problems we face. We\nshare the view that the strongest measures must be taken\nto achieve sound financial viability for this Organization.\nIt would be essential for this purpose that there be a fair,\nmore equitable and realistic scale of assessments, one\nwhich would take full account of the principle of capacity\nto pay.\nThis must also take into account the predicament of\nsome countries, including my own, which are assessed at\nthe floor rate of the scale, at levels far beyond their\ncapacity to pay. We believe there is a just case for\nabolishing or reducing the current floor rate. This is a\nmatter of importance to many small States and we would\nhope that the High-level Working Group on the Financial\nSituation of the United Nations would continue to give it\ndue consideration.\n29\n\n\nThere is a second aspect, which touches on the\nemphasis now being given to United Nations peace-keeping\nactivities. While Samoa recognizes the necessary and\ntraditional role of the United Nations in promoting global\npeace and security, it seems to us that ultimately no amount\nof force and no measure of peace-keeping can sustain peace\nand security without attention to the root causes. Our own\nview is that human misery brought about by poverty and\nthe denial of human and democratic rights are often the real\nand fundamental problems. Unless these are removed or\nminimized, there can never be the substratum that we need\nfor lasting world peace and security.\nPut simply, Samoa believes firmly that social and\neconomic development must remain a major preoccupation\nof the United Nations, as pledged in the Charter.\nDevelopment priorities spelt out in recent global\nconferences for the sustained economic and social\nadvancement of the developing countries should be\neffectively implemented. They should not be ignored while\nthe Organization\u2019s attention and its focus, in terms of\nhuman and financial resources, is diverted elsewhere,\nlargely on peace-keeping activities.\nFor Samoa and other small island States disadvantaged\nby their size and geographical location, the Programme of\nAction for the Sustainable Development on Small Island\nDeveloping States must remain a centrepiece of our\nattention.\nWe welcome steps taken by the various organs of the\nUnited Nations system to implement the Plan of Action.\nWe appreciate, in particular, what is being done by the\nDepartment for Policy Co-ordination and Sustainable\nDevelopment and the Unit set up to monitor the\nimplementation of the Programme of Action. These steps\nwill complement efforts undertaken by our regional\ncountries in the South Pacific region to further advance the\ncommitments made in Rio, Barbados and elsewhere.\nSamoa\u2019s commitment to the pursuit of global peace\nand security is unwavering. We will continue to do what\nwe can. Conflicts which continue to rage in many regions\nof the world today cannot be ignored. They affect us all,\nfor they impact directly or indirectly on the ability of the\nUnited Nations and the international community to respond\nto the development needs of others.\nWe welcome the latest initiatives with a view to\nbringing a peaceful end to the conflict in Bosnia. A\nsettlement acceptable to all parties must be reached.\nAnother milestone in the Middle East peace process\nwas reached in Washington yesterday. With the rest of\nthe world, we celebrate and commend the enduring efforts\nand commitments made by the Israeli and Palestinian\nleaders to lasting peace and security for all in that region.\nOur environment is of vital importance, and of\nsingular concern to my Government. Our actions in the\nregion and at the international level are dictated by a deep\ncommitment to preserving it. Together with other\ncountries in our region, we have initiated and concluded\na series of treaty regimes, including those designed to\nprotect the natural resources and environment of the\nSouth Pacific region and to establish the South Pacific\nnuclear-free zone to keep our region free of\nenvironmental pollution by radioactive wastes and other\nradioactive matter.\nWe will continue to supplement these efforts as the\nneed arises. Indeed, leaders at the recent South Pacific\nForum meeting in Papua New Guinea adopted the Treaty\non the Control and Movement of Hazardous and Toxic\nWastes in the South Pacific. Samoa did not hesitate to\nsign it.\nConsistently over the years Samoa, together with our\nregional partners, has called for a permanent end to\nnuclear testing, the dumping of chemical and toxic wastes\nand the transportation of these materials in our waters.\nFrom this account you will therefore understand our\ndeep shock and distress when it was announced in June\nthat France proposed to resume the testing of nuclear\nweapons in the Pacific. We sought, at the highest level,\nas many others did, to persuade the Government of\nFrance not to do so. We took action to register our\nconcern and to protest and we sought to intervene in the\nproceedings brought by New Zealand against France in\nthe International Court of Justice. Together with other\nForum countries we moved to make direct representation\nto the Government of France \u2014 all to no avail.\nThe explosion of a nuclear device at Mururoa atoll\nearly this month brings to close to 200 the number of\nunderground nuclear tests France has carried out in the\nPacific since 1975. Of the whole United Nations\nmembership, Samoa is the closest to the test site.\nThe resumption of nuclear testing by France has\nbeen made in the face of strong and persistent protest\nfrom countries of the region, and equally strong and\noverwhelming condemnation from all parts of the world.\n30\n\n\nThe current tests are being conducted in the absence of any\nenvironmental impact assessments that we know of or have\nbeen advised of, and in the opinion of my Government in\ndisregard of France\u2019s existing regional treaty obligations.\nLike other members of the South Pacific Forum, Samoa is\noutraged at the resumption of French nuclear testing in the\nPacific \u2014 and, as I say, in the vicinity of my country. In\nthe strongest possible terms we condemn it. We do so\nbecause of the extreme danger it poses to our environment\nand health, now and in the long term; and because the tests\nare completely contrary to the undertaking at the recent\nNon-Proliferation Treaty review Conference that nuclear\nStates exercise utmost restraint in nuclear testing pending\nthe completion of negotiations on a comprehensive test-ban\ntreaty that would ban nuclear tests for all time.\nWe do welcome France\u2019s commitment to a\ncomprehensive test-ban treaty, but that should not be used\nas an excuse for France to continue its nuclear testing in\nour region. For the sake of our environment and all who\nlive there, we call on France to stop.\nWe call also, and once more, on the three nuclear\nPowers which have not yet signed and ratified the Protocols\nto the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty to do so.\nIt is also out of deep concern for our environment that\nSamoa has taken every step possible to be engaged in the\nnegotiations and in the implementation of the international\nconventions relating to climate change, biodiversity, marine\npollution and the conservation of straddling and highly\nmigratory fish stocks. Global warming and the threat of\nsea-level rise are matters of the gravest concern to my\ncountry and our region. Recently, the Intergovernmental\nPanel on Climate Change (IPCC) reported that the warming\nof the global atmosphere is unlikely to be entirely due to\nnatural causes. In other words, human activity is a definite\ncause that cannot be discounted.\nWhile this is not entirely unexpected, the latest\nindication from the IPCC bears out the inadequacy of\ncurrent Convention commitments for Annex I parties, and\nunderlines the essential correctness, and the urgency, of the\nBerlin Mandate issued from the first Conference of the\nParties to the United Nations Framework Convention on\nClimate Change. For its part, Samoa will continue to work\ntogether with countries of the Alliance of Small Island\nStates (AOSIS) towards the early acceptance of clear\nemission-reduction targets of the type advanced in the draft\nAOSIS Protocol.\nIn respect of fish stocks, let me take the opportunity\nto pay tribute to all the countries that worked so hard to\nproduce the truly remarkable triumph in the form of the\ndraft Agreement for the Implementation of the Provisions\nof the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea\nrelating to the Conservation and Management of\nStraddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks.\nIn particular, we express our gratitude to Ambassador\nSatya Nandan of Fiji for his exceptional skill and\nchairmanship.\nThis has been a landmark year on many counts; with\nthe fiftieth anniversary commemoration we will celebrate\nnext month the crowning event.\nThe Fourth World Conference on Women, in\nBeijing, is one such landmark. Samoa warmly applauds\nthe unanimous adoption of the Platform for Action, and\nthe remarkable degree of international consultation and\ncooperation that was employed to produce it. What is\nneeded now is the highest degree of commitment and\naction, in close consultation with women at all levels.\nThere would be little point in having yet another fine\ndocument without any prospect of implementation, and\nwithout the effort and the will to make concrete changes\nand improvements. And let it be remembered that such\nchanges and improvements are not for women alone, but\nfor the full development of mankind.\nWithout doubt, the extension of the Non-\nProliferation Treaty was a major achievement for the\nworld community this year. We congratulate Ambassador\nDhanapala of Sri Lanka on his remarkable role and\nleadership in ensuring the successful outcome of the\nReview Conference.\nThe decisions we took then are essential to\ninternational peace and security, and the attainment of the\nultimate goals of the complete elimination of nuclear\nweapons and a treaty on general and complete\ndisarmament under strict and effective international\ncontrol. The successful conclusion of a comprehensive\nnuclear-test-ban treaty by 1996 is a specific goal for the\nattainment of which all Member States of this body\nshould strive with the utmost effort.\nWe pray that at the end of the presidency of\nAmbassador Freitas do Amaral of Portugal, the world\ncommunity will be able to celebrate the accomplishment\nof that objective.\n"

        "file_text": "We are very pleased that Mr.\nFreitas do Amaral is presiding over this important occasion,\nnot only because of our confidence in his sterling qualities\nand acknowledged capabilities, but also because of the long\nhistoric links between Portugal and Ghana \u2014 links going\nback 500 years. We wish him every success in conducting\nthe affairs of this fiftieth session of the General Assembly.\nTo his predecessor, my brother and colleague from\nC\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, we say \u201cthank you\u201d for a job well done. He\nled us through very complicated and difficult issues, such\nas the restructuring and reform of the United Nations,\nparticularly the enlargement of the Security Council. The\npatience, equanimity and skill which he displayed\nthroughout his presidency won the admiration of us all.\nTo Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, we say a special word\nof thanks and appreciation for his indefatigable energy, his\nremarkable commitment to the independence of the United\nNations and his steadfast resolve to help carry the\nOrganization forward on a sounder footing.\nFifty years of life, be it of a person or an institution,\nis an appropriate occasion for celebration and we are all\nlooking forward to the festivities planned for the latter part\nof this month in commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary\nof the United Nations. It must also, however, be an\noccasion for a sober assessment of success and progress\nattained, as well as an in-depth analysis of the shortcomings\nexperienced and how best to overcome them.\nIn 1945, 51 States, by signing the United Nations\nCharter and setting up the Organization, ushered in a new\nera in international affairs. I recall that only four African\ncountries were Members of the United Nations at its\ninception. Today, the United Nations comprises 185\nMember States, of which, perhaps, Africa is the continent\nwith the largest representation.\nThe very fact that the United Nations has grown in\nthe past 50 years to encompass in its membership almost\nall sovereign States of the international community\nindicates a positive development. This is important\nbecause of the growing interdependence of States and the\ncommon interest of the international community in the\nsolution of the complex and myriad issues of\ncontemporary life.\nTo those who criticize the United Nations and the\nGeneral Assembly in particular as a mere talking shop, I\nwould say that the tradition of discussion and debate, of\nlistening to and appreciating the views of others is of\ngreat value. This is precisely the rationale for setting up\nthis forum. It is only through such a process that diverse\nviews can be harmonized and compromises struck. But\neven the sceptic will admit that the United Nations has an\nappreciable record of humanitarian and social\nimprovement throughout the globe, in decolonization and\nin the settlement of disputes and conflicts.\nOur hope that the end of the cold war would bring\nin its train a new era of enduring peace and international\nharmony has been rudely dispelled. Much has indeed\nchanged but much remains the same. The perennial\nconflicts of the past are taking new and troubling\ndimensions with \u201cethnic cleansing\u201d, genocide and strident\nforms of nationalism threatening international tranquillity.\nThis fiftieth anniversary is the appropriate occasion for all\nStates to ponder carefully how these problems can be\neffectively contained. We are encouraged by recent events\nto hope that the ugly conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina\ncan and will be solved, and we must pay tribute to the\nUnited States for this development.\nWe also note with appreciation the recent Israeli-\nPalestinian accords signed in Washington as another\nmilestone in the progress towards genuine peace in the\nMiddle East. We would, however, urge all parties to show\nmore flexibility and understanding in ensuring a\ncomprehensive solution to the Middle East problem,\nwhich, inter alia, would include full self-determination for\nthe Palestinian people and the restoration of occupied\nArab lands.\nNo conflict can be resolved without the willingness\nof the parties to be reasonable and ready for compromise.\n13\n\n\nThe Afghans, the Somalis and others stand in danger of\nneglect and they must wake up to this reality. The leaders\nof the warring parties in these countries must appreciate the\nenormous responsibility on their shoulders not to condemn\ntheir compatriots to senseless slaughter in perpetuity.\nThe developing countries generally find themselves in\ndifficult economic circumstances as a result of an\nunfavourable international economic climate. The need for\nconcerted international action to restructure the international\neconomy in order to meet the challenges of absolute\npoverty, malnutrition, disease and illiteracy, among others,\nin the developing countries cannot be overemphasized. In\nthis context, we appreciate the limited success of the\nimportant global conferences of the past year, especially\nthat on population and development in Cairo, the World\nSummit for Social Development in Copenhagen and, last\nbut not least, the Fourth World Conference on Women in\nBeijing. The very fact that the international community has\nbeen able to improve and agree on a set of guidelines for\nfuture action in each of these vitally important social areas\nis in itself a remarkable achievement. We trust that the\nnecessary political will to implement what has been agreed\nupon will be exercised by all.\nAllow me to say a few words about last April\u2019s\nreview and extension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation\nof Nuclear Weapons (NPT). We note with regret that, so\nsoon after the indefinite extension of the NPT, the very\nfears which made some of us question the wisdom of an\nindefinite extension have been fulfilled by the resumption\nof nuclear testing in the Pacific. We had argued that an\nindefinite extension would leave the nuclear Powers with no\nreal incentive to make further progress on the arms control\nagenda. We must condemn in no uncertain terms the breach\nof the underlying implications of the consensus reached on\nthe indefinite extension of the NPT. Let us hope that\nlessons will be learned from the almost universal\ncondemnation of the French tests and that there will be\nmovement towards a rapid conclusion of a comprehensive\ntest-ban treaty and action on the other major issues in the\narea of disarmament.\nUnited Nations peace-keeping continues to assume\ngreat prominence in the range of United Nations activities.\nThis has been in clear response to urgent needs in various\nparts of the world, and we in Ghana continue to try to\nmake a modest contribution through participation in such\nmissions as that in Rwanda. We are pleased to note that a\nlot of thinking is going on about how to improve and\nstrengthen the United Nations peace-keeping role. We will\ncontinue to take an active part in these discussions and we\nhope it will be possible to agree on new arrangements\nthat will be to the benefit of us all.\nAllow me, on this issue, to express my delegation\u2019s\nprofound regret at the delay of the United Nations in\nreimbursing troop- contributing countries, such as mine,\nfor expenditures incurred in United Nations peace-keeping\noperations. We urge that every effort be made to resolve\nthis matter as speedily as possible. Of course, it will help\ngreatly if Member States in arrears in their contributions\nhonour their obligations and pay up. We urge them to do\nso without further delay.\nWhile on the subject of peace-keeping, may I say a\nfew words about what we in West Africa have tried to do\nin Liberia. In the spirit of the relevant provisions of the\nUnited Nations Charter and the Treaty setting up the\nEconomic Community of West African States\n(ECOWAS), ECOWAS countries took the initiative to set\nup the cease-fire Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) to stop\nthe bloodshed in Liberia. Today we are pleased to see\nthat the Abuja and earlier agreements have made possible\nthe restoration of relative peace in that country. The\nchallenge now is to see through the implementation\nprocess. That will require a considerable increase in troop\nstrength, logistics for ECOMOG and for the encampment,\ndisarmament and resettlement of rival forces engaged in\nthe civil war. International assistance is greatly needed to\nmeet these objectives. It is hoped that a ready response\nwill be forthcoming at the pledging conference envisaged\nfor later this month.\nWhat ECOMOG has done in Liberia is a good\nexample of how subregional and regional organizations\nshould support the United Nations in the maintenance of\ninternational peace and security. But the United Nations\nwill need to overcome doctrinal obstacles and to develop\nprinciples that will facilitate hybrid operations involving\nsubregional initiatives and United Nations financing in\nwhole or in part.\nOn Rwanda, Ghana has again demonstrated the\ndepth of its commitment to the maintenance of\ninternational peace and security by sending troops to the\nfront line. Our actions speak louder than words. Liberia\nand Rwanda are the latest in a long history of Ghanaian\nparticipation in peace-keeping operations. We will\ncontinue to make a contribution whenever and wherever\nwe are called upon to assist. That is why Ghana\nsponsored the preparation of the Anglo-French glossary of\npeace-keeping terms, which provides precise terminology\nfor vital words regularly used in the actual theatre of\n14\n\n\noperations. Our gratitude goes to the British, French and\nSenegalese Governments, who all helped make the exercise\na success.\nAfrica\u2019s economic problems are too well known for\nme to recount. Allow me to state that some of us are\nbeginning to wonder about the seriousness of the\ninternational community in helping Africa help itself.\nConference after conference and seminar after seminar have\nbeen held in the past few years on this issue. Study after\nstudy by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World\nBank and numerous other institutions and distinguished\npersonalities have been published, dissecting every\ndimension of the continent\u2019s problems.\nAfrican countries have committed themselves\nrepeatedly to carry out far-reaching economic and\ninstitutional reforms, on the express understanding that their\nefforts would be fully complemented by the requisite\nmaterial support of the international community, particularly\nthe advanced countries.\nWhile not down-playing the assistance Africa has\nreceived in the past few years, I must register the profound\ndisappointment of many of us on the continent that the\nexpected volume of assistance has never been forthcoming.\nMoreover, the requisite action on the debt and aid fronts,\nwhich would have completed the picture, has also not been\nadequate.\nThis is all the more regrettable because of the\nprofound political risks that many Governments in Africa\nhave run by faithfully implementing painful structural\nadjustment programmes that have had a severe impact on\ntheir peoples. It is also unfortunate because Africa has seen\na tremendous upsurge of popular empowerment which has\nfound expression in the establishment of constitutional rule\nin country after country. Let it not appear that the\ninternational community deliberately wishes to marginalize\nthe African continent. The problem of poverty of the\nAfrican continent, if not tackled seriously, could pose grave\ndangers to international peace and security. Many conflicts\nin Africa are occasioned by the strains of development and\nthey could easily take on international dimensions.\nAs we celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the United\nNations, let us seek to fight against the arrogance of power\nand the return to the habits of colonialism as exhibited in\nthe unjustified economic blockade against Cuba and the\nsanctions imposed on Libya. Such actions, particularly\nwhen sponsored by the United Nations, will serve to\nundermine the integrity of this Organization. The collapse\nof the cold war must make us more vigilant against any\nattempt to turn the United Nations into an instrument of\nthe foreign policy of any one country or group of\ncountries. When that happens, regional and subregional\norganizations will be tempted to question and/or disobey\nthe decisions of the United Nations. This will be a tragic\ndevelopment that must be avoided at all costs. That is\nwhy Ghana, like other members of the OAU, calls upon\nthe Security Council to lift the sanctions imposed\nunjustifiably on Libya and seek a peaceful solution to the\nLockerbie affair and other related matters. We must of\ncourse forever maintain an uncompromising resolve to\nfight mindless terrorism.\nLet me conclude by reaffirming Ghana\u2019s\ncommitment to the United Nations as the best hope for\npeace and international cooperation. Long live the United\nNations.\n"

        "file_text": "Allow\nme to begin my address with a personal consideration.\nBefore arriving in New York to participate in this fiftieth\nsession of the General Assembly, I thought over and over\nabout the possible tangible outcome of this debate. In\nparticular, I tried to determine the present power and\nstrength of Member States \u2014 and especially of the small\nones like my own \u2014 in terms of taking decisive actions\naimed at preventing, monitoring and managing critical and\nconflict situations, and, in general, all those circumstances\nwhich run counter to the requirements and objectives of\nthe United Nations.\nThere is no need for too many words to describe all\nthe evils besetting our international community and\nreflecting the disturbing and serious changes in its\nattitudes, and, above all, in its mentality. I believe, in fact,\nthat the present situation in the former Yugoslavia alone\nsummarizes and reflects in detail all of these factors.\nFirst of all, there is the war, which, because of its\nlong duration, seems to have been generally accepted as\nan inevitable condition \u2014 a war that is still going on\ndespite all the efforts to find a peaceful, negotiated and\npolitical solution; a war that has seen few truces \u2014 and\nthose that have existed have not been respected; a war\ninvolving many sophisticated weapons, in spite of all\nsolemn bans on them; and a war that is the consequence\nof speculation and the result of the search for profit at all\ncosts.\nThe United Nations must have the strength to take\na stand against war. It is also evident that resolutions,\ncondemnations, embargoes and the dispatching of peace-\nkeeping forces \u2014 which sometimes prove useless,\nbecoming innocent victims \u2014 are no longer sufficient.\n22\n\n\nWhy should we not admit, then, that the United Nations,\nespecially in the former Yugoslavia, has revealed its\nweakness and its inability to stop a massacre?\nThere must be another solution. Let us reflect on more\neffective approaches and adapt the tools at our disposal to\na world that seems to be increasingly pervaded by\narrogance, presumption and evil.\nAlthough the United Nations has to its credit important\nachievements and positive results that deserve general\nacknowledgment and appreciation, the fiftieth anniversary\nof its foundation is not merely a commemorative event and\ncannot be regarded as such. This anniversary must also\nprovide an opportunity to assess, review and, where\nnecessary, make adjustments.\nSome structural changes in important United Nations\nbodies have been discussed for a number of years. A debate\nis under way on the reform of the Security Council, as is\nanother \u2014 with less interest and vitality \u2014 on the\npossibilities for the smallest States fully to enjoy, without\nlimitations, the rights and opportunities granted to them by\nthe Charter.\nThese are all important issues in which my country is\ndeeply interested. Yet should we not give conflict\nmanagement and resolution the highest priority? I am\nreferring not only to international conflicts, but also to\ncertain domestic situations, because of the serious violations\nand the unanimously condemned tragic consequences they\nentail. They should be considered matters of global\nconcern.\nIn this context, I must mention one of the most serious\naspects of the present situation in the former Yugoslavia,\nnamely human-rights violations. Those rights, enshrined in\nthe documents of the United Nations, of the Council of\nEurope, of the Organization for Security and Cooperation\nin Europe and in other declarations, are all manifestly being\ninfringed. Offences against human dignity are by far the\ngravest of all violations. They are based on a non-\nrecognition of the human individual and of the freedom to\npractise a religion, to belong to a minority, to be different\nfrom the majority or even from the minority.\nI believe that the greatest challenge confronting\nhumankind, as we approach the year 2000, is the practice\nof tolerance. War, hunger, the need to find gainful\nemployment, the natural aspiration of individuals to\nimprove their living standards, and class conflicts remain.\nThe quest for supremacy by ethnic groups and minorities,\nwhich often results in practices of mass destruction, is no\ndifferent from the old, repudiated theory of racial\nsuperiority, so painfully experienced by Europe during the\nlast world war. We must remember also the total absence\nof protection for children and the lack of respect for\nwomen and their bodies, victims as they are of violence\nperpetrated on unbelievable racial grounds. These factors\nhave made migrations an almost natural component of our\ninternational society.\nThe United Nations High Commissioner for\nRefugees has warned us of the onset of a new and\nwidespread phenomenon \u2014 already seen in some African\ncountries \u2014 which will be the logical consequence of the\nwar in the former Yugoslavia. In its appeal, the Office of\nthe United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees\n(UNHCR) refers to the new category of internally\ndisplaced persons, who have been forced to leave their\nhouses, deprived of the little property they had and of\nemployment opportunities. At the same time, estimates\nshow a constantly increasing flow of refugees, who have\nleft their countries of origin in search of a place to live\nand of opportunities, however modest, that would enable\nthem to start a new life.\nThus, future generations will inevitably live in a\ndifferent society from our own. Their neighbours or\ncolleagues might be of a different colour or race, practise\na different religion, perform traditional rites unknown to\nus, have different habits and approach problems, and life\nin general, in a completely different way. To ensure a just\nand peaceful coexistence, future generations will have to\nlearn how to adapt to this new reality, to understand and\naccept the principle that people are all equal and free to\nbe different.\nSolidarity must stem from this conviction and be\ntranslated into consistent behaviour. Solidarity should not\nbe expressed merely through acts of charity or donations\nof superfluous things, with care taken not to lose one\u2019s\nprivileged economic position. There must be a\ncommitment on the part of all States to make solidarity\namong them a way of life. Hunger, natural disasters and\nman-made environmental destruction, wars, famines, the\nendemic poverty of some regions and peoples \u2014 which\nis caused, or aggravated, by bad management on the part\nof those governing them \u2014 are no longer occasional\nevents requiring an outburst of generosity. Today, these\nfactors have become ever-present in the world and call for\na concerted and lasting commitment.\n23\n\n\nRich countries should make the necessary\ncontributions to helping poor countries eradicate deeply\nrooted causes of distress by formulating a common, global,\nresponsible and transparent policy. Due precaution must be\ntaken not to overburden programmes agreed upon with\nadministrative infrastructures which could be detrimental to\nfinancial resources and delay prompt intervention because\nof bureaucratic hurdles.\nSan Marino believes that many other issues deserve\nattentive consideration and utmost priority.\nSan Marino believes that it is high time to rethink the\ntool of the embargo, its effectiveness and, above all, its\nconsequences. In the absence of armed conflicts, the\ninternational isolation of a State represents a valid political\nand moral instrument with which to exert pressure on that\nState as well as a strong incentive for it to change,\nespecially if it has an anti-democratic regime and does not\nrecognize or respect the rights of its citizens or the rights\nset forth by international law in its conduct towards other\nnations.\nHowever, when an embargo is imposed on a country\nfor long periods, it also affects its social and commercial\nsectors. In this case, the main victim is not the regime but\nthe population, which is already suffering from that system\nand probably has neither the strength nor the means to\nchange or overthrow it. This is unacceptable.\nWhen the imposition of an embargo results in the\nmisery of a population and in the deterioration of a\ncountry\u2019s basic structures, including its health-care system,\nthen that embargo must be reconsidered and adjusted to\nmeet human-rights requirements.\nCapital punishment is another issue that is extremely\nimportant to my country and that has been repeatedly\ndebated in the General Assembly. It is not difficult to\nunderstand that certain countries \u2014 principally those with\na large territory and population \u2014 require strong deterrents\nin order to maintain order and protect their citizens\u2019 lives,\nproperty and tranquillity. It is also generally recognized that\nsome crimes, atrocities and grave offences need to be\nseverely punished. Nevertheless, the death penalty is too\ngrave a reaction and too great an offence to be accepted by\nthose countries that believe in the right to life, in the\npossibility of true repentance and, above all, in the\npossibility of an error on the part of the individual\npronouncing the verdict.\nThe Republic of San Marino cannot disguise its deep\nanxiety with regard to the problem of armaments and\ntheir increase and, in particular, nuclear weapons. We\nhope for global, controlled and irreversible disarmament.\nRecourse to the rule of law, to the peaceful settlement of\ndisputes, to mediation and to international forums is the\nindispensable foundation of a really advanced and\ncivilized society. Unfortunately, the threat and use of\nforce are still considered by many as the only instruments\nto be used in the survival of a State.\nFurthermore, the production and stockpiling of\nnuclear weapons, as well as nuclear tests, have become a\npervasive feature of the contemporary world, posing a\nserious threat to the security of States, to the safeguarding\nof the environment and to the existence of many\nindividuals. The concept of nuclear power as a deterrent\nis an elegant expression concealing its real danger. It is a\nshield dissimulating the desire for supremacy on the part\nof some States. In short, this is one of the old theories on\nwhich anti-democratic and anti-liberal regimes are based.\nIt is our duty to save future generations from the threat of\nnuclear weapons. San Marino hopes that the opinion of\nthe International Court of Justice requested by the General\nAssembly may promote the attainment of that objective.\n"

        "file_text": "I should like to join the speakers who have\npreceded me at this rostrum in offering you, Sir, on behalf\nof my delegation and on my own behalf, warm and hearty\ncongratulations on your election to the presidency of the\nGeneral Assembly at its fiftieth regular session. I am\nparticularly pleased that the President of the General\nAssembly is the representative of Portugal, a friendly\ncountry with which my country, the Republic of Zaire, has\nlong enjoyed excellent relations marked by trust and mutual\nrespect. We feel that your intellectual abilities and\ndiplomatic skills, together with your long experience of\ninternational affairs, guarantee the success of our work\nhere.\nMy congratulations go also to the other elected\nmembers of the Bureau, and I wish them every success in\ntheir delicate task of providing you with assistance.\nAllow me also to pay tribute to your predecessor,\nHis Excellency Mr. Essy Amara, Minister for Foreign\nAffairs of the sister Republic of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, to whom\nI am bound by long-standing ties of personal friendship.\nI should like to express to him our joy and pride on\nseeing how masterfully he guided the work of the General\nAssembly at its forty-ninth regular session and our\nappreciation of the energy, skill and ability with which he\ndischarged his mandate.\nFinally, I should like to pay a well-deserved tribute\nto the Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for\nhis excellent preparatory work for this session, his\noutstanding efforts to strengthen the role of the United\nNations and his many commendable initiatives in support\nof international peace and security.\nMy thoughts here will turn mainly to the lessons of\n50 years of the existence of the United Nations; the\nrevitalization and restructuring of the United Nations; the\nsituation in the subregion of the Great Lakes, particularly\nRwanda and Burundi; the efforts for peace in the Middle\nEast; the support of the United Nations system for efforts\nby Governments to promote and strengthen new or\nrestored democracies; external debt, international\neconomic cooperation and development; disarmament\nefforts; and, finally, the question of the return or\nrestoration of cultural property to its country of origin.\nThis year the United Nations is commemorating its\nfiftieth anniversary. When it was founded, it set itself\ngoals that corresponded to the enthusiasm, hopes and\nneeds that emerged with the end of a devastating war\nwhose traumatic effects have not yet faded away entirely.\n\n\nThose goals were to maintain international peace and\nsecurity, guarantee justice and human rights, foster social\nprogress and establish better living conditions in greater\nfreedom.\nWhere do we stand today?\nA fiftieth anniversary is an important milestone in the\nlife of persons, institutions and nations. A person who has\nmade nothing of his life by the time he is 50 is not likely\nto set a new course for his life afterwards. An institution\nthat after 50 years has done nothing to attain the objectives\nit set when it was founded inevitably raises the question of\nits viability and the usefulness of its existence. A nation\nthat has done nothing for its people in 50 years must surely\nstep back and re-examine everything \u2014 its political leaders,\nprogrammes, social projects, management and methods.\nFortunately, this is not the case of the United Nations.\nIt has some outstanding accomplishments to its credit. It\nhas achieved real successes and made real efforts in the\nareas of economic and social development, decolonization,\nhuman rights, development and peace-keeping. Its work in\nestablishing norms indisputably represents the highest\naspirations of man, of all mankind and all peoples, for a\nworld free from war, threats, intimidation, poverty,\noppression and suffering.\nToday, therefore, the United Nations must preserve\nand consolidate its accomplishments while also adapting\nitself to face the new challenges borne in the wake of the\nastonishing transformations the world has undergone since\nthe end of the Second World War.\nFor those of us from Africa, decolonization was an\nextremely important page in this story. What would\ndecolonization have been without the United Nations,\nparticularly the adoption of resolution 1514 (XV), the\nDeclaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial\nCountries and Peoples? What would have happened in\nSouth Africa without the mobilization by the United\nNations of the entire international community against the\nscourge of apartheid, and without its support for the heroic\nand legitimate struggle of the South African people under\nthe leadership of the recognized liberation movements,\nparticularly the African National Congress (ANC)?\nIn Zaire we have not forgotten that 34 years and 10\ndays ago, striving to promote peace and restore and\nmaintain the political independence and territorial integrity\nof the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which is today\nZaire, one of the most devoted servants of the United\nNations, its late Secretary-General, Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld,\ndied at Ndola.\nWe have not forgotten that from July 1960 to June\n1964 the United Nations Operation in the Congo\nrepresented the largest assistance programme undertaken\nby the United Nations up to that time.\nAnd so it is thanks to this major contribution by the\nUnited Nations that Zaire preserved its unity and\nterritorial integrity. Let me extend to the United Nations\nthe deep appreciation of the Zairian people for this. That\npage in our history, which is also a page in the history of\nthe United Nations, reminds us that our people paid a\nheavy price for peace, and it made a pledge that the\ngenerations must hand down from one to another: no\nmore civil war; no more secessions because of tribal,\ninter-ethnic or power conflicts; a firm commitment to\npeace and dialogue for development, whatever the nature\nor the intensity of our internal differences.\nThat is why we gave the name of Dag\nHammarskj\u00f6ld to an important bridge in the city of\nKinshasa, to pay tribute to the United Nations by\nimmortalizing the memory of the Secretary-General who\ndied on the battlefield in the struggle for peace. The\nsymbol of the bridge derives from our understanding of\nthe message of the United Nations. As an opening on the\nworld and forum of nations, is not the United Nations,\nwith its message of peace and dialogue, building a bridge\nbetween nations?\nAnd yet, despite the outstanding progress\nindisputably made throughout the world, many other\nthings have also happened. The cold war has ended\nwithout this being much help to the development process\nin the countries of the South, particularly in Africa, where\npoverty has increased in a worsening economic and social\nsituation.\nIn the wake of this worsening situation, Africa, in\nparticular, is experiencing the reappearance of diseases\nwhich had been eradicated and the appearance of new\nendemic diseases, without having the necessary resources\nto cope with them.\nDecolonization is virtually over now. Apartheid has\nbeen abolished, and Africa, facing the new challenges of\ndemocratization and development, seized by the fever of\ndemocratization, is undergoing irreversible change\naccompanied by new difficulties.\n2\n\n\nAt the international level, new kinds of domination are\nemerging, and could lead to the same results as those of the\npast, if we are not careful. Will \u201cglobalization\u201d of people\u2019s\nbehaviour and standardization of reflexes and needs\nimprison freedom, stifle identities and crush the cultural\nexpression of peoples?\nThere has been no Third World War, but, as in former\nYugoslavia, Rwanda, Burundi and elsewhere, a new kind of\nwar has emerged, based on ethnic and tribal \u201ccleansing\u201d,\ntragic consequences for security, peace, the environment\nand the development of nations that are very disturbing.\nA new kind of international crime is engulfing Africa\nand the world: violence \u2014 attacks on individuals and their\nproperty, armed robbery and highway robbery; economic\nand financial crime \u2014 counterfeiting, money-laundering,\nillicit drug trafficking, large-scale fraud in commodities and\nso forth; political crime \u2014 fundamentalism and\ninternational terrorism, which take us back to the times of\nthe pirates and the corsairs. Of course the telegraph, the\ntelephone, air travel, radio, television, computers and videos\nhave done a great deal to shrink distances, but they have\nalso helped to strengthen the forces of disorder.\nMultilateral cooperation, development financing and\nthe spirit of international solidarity have all been frittered\naway. The new international economic order has not\nemerged, and bilateral cooperation has been halted for\nvarious reasons, some political in many countries, such as\nZaire, at the precise moment when those countries are faced\nwith a sharp reduction in financial resources. The\nconditions attached to development aid are more stringent\nthan ever, and assistance for democratization, strongly\nencouraged at the La Baule Summit, is also subject to\nconditionalities.\nThe phenomenon of refugees and displaced persons is\nnow unprecedented in scope.\nA century of hope, particularly the last half of the\ncentury, would thus seem to be ending on a note of despair\nwhen we look at what the causes of the new threat to world\npeace in general and peace in Africa in particular are:\narmed conflicts, serious internal struggles, poverty,\nunemployment, inequality, discrimination, intolerance,\npolicies of exclusion, the struggle against State despotism,\npolitical and social failures, and so on.\nTo those who are seeking refuge from tyranny we can\nalso add \u2014 on our continent those who are fleeing anarchy.\nThe tragic fate of persons displaced because of civil war or\nviolence is one of the major humanitarian problems of our\nage. There are many armed conflicts today which derive\nfrom the struggle between communities swept along by\nintolerance.\nIt is therefore imperative that the members of the\ninternational community shoulder their responsibilities,\nhelp each other and act together to reverse these negative\ntrends.\nAs the Secretary-General of the United Nations\nnoted on 20 October 1994, quite rightly:\n\u201cSocieties that used to think they were completely\nautonomous now know that they are very closely\nlinked to one another. The life of each individual,\nwherever he may come from, is today part of a\nplanetary whole. Today it is recognized that the\nloftiest objectives of mankind \u2014 peace, justice and\nprosperity \u2014 can be attained only if an increasingly\nbroadly agreed effort is made. And then a whole\nseries of new problems whose worldwide dimensions\nare quite clear demand solutions that no one country\nor group of countries can find in isolation.\u201d\nIn order to cope with the new challenges facing us\nall, with the problems of development, peace and security,\nthe United Nations has to rethink its methods, its\norganization, and its effectiveness.\nThe influx of nearly 3 million Rwandese refugees to\neastern Zaire, about which I shall speak later, revealed to\nus some of the shortcomings of the United Nations\nsystem faced with new challenges.\nFirst, 30,000 armed men belonging to the former\narmed forces of Rwanda came to Zaire on 14 July 1994,\nand obviously we were not expecting them. They came to\nregions of North and South Kivu following the civil war\nin Rwanda. After being disarmed, they were supposed to\nbe taken care of. But by whom? Problems arose as to\ntheir status.\nWere they prisoners of war? Zaire was not at war\nwith Rwanda, we were told. Were they war detainees?\n\u201cNo\u201d, we were told by the International Committee of the\nRed Cross (ICRC), \u201cthey are not within our competence.\u201d\nAre they, then, political refugees? \u201cNo\u201d, the Office of the\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugees\n(UNHCR) replied. \u201cMen in military uniform are not\npolitical refugees, and so they do not fall within our\ncompetence.\u201d\n3\n\n\nAnd so, the 30,000 military men of the former\nRwandan armed forces began to take care of themselves, to\nthe detriment of the villagers and local populations, while\nthe United Nations system looked on, powerless.\nSecondly, at the behest of the Secretary-General and\nthe international community, we agreed to move them far\naway from our border with Rwanda, for obvious reasons.\nSo we found sites in Shaba, Maniema and Equateur. Joint\nUnited Nations-Zaire evaluation missions were sent to these\nregions.\nAssuming that there were three people in each family,\nwe identified 90,000 individuals belonging to the former\nRwandan Army to be moved from the Rwandan border.\nHaving seen this evaluation, the United Nations\ndeclared the cost exorbitant, and the Secretary-General was\nunable to find the financial resources needed. So, the idea\nwas abandoned and the United Nations asked Zaire to take\nappropriate security measures and to keep the 30,000\nmilitary men where they were, namely on the border with\nRwanda.\nBut, leaving them there made the Kigali Government\nnervous about possible destabilization, and so it began\nspreading unfounded accusations against Zaire. Without\nchecking the facts at all, the United Nations then\nrecognized Kigali\u2019s claims and lifted the arms embargo on\nRwanda which had been established pursuant to Security\nCouncil resolution 1011 (1995) of 16 August 1995, in order\nto help that country protect itself against some hypothetical\nthreat, but the United Nations has done nothing at all about\nthe 30,000 military men left to be cared for by Zaire\nwithout any assistance.\nAnd what is more, after lifting the arms embargo on\nRwanda on 16 August 1995 so that it could arm itself and\ndeal with the threat of destabilization from Zaire, the\nSecurity Council adopted resolution 1013 (1995) two weeks\nlater setting up an international Commission of Inquiry to\nlook into allegations that the former Rwandan Government\nforces were being trained and supplied with weapons from\nZaire in order to destabilize Rwanda. This is all quite\nastonishing, not least because the highest level of the\ncollective security system of the United Nations was\ninvolved. I myself have served on the Security Council. I\nwas President during the Malvinas war and I have always\nbelieved that at that level of responsibility, matters should\nbe considered with the utmost care.\nEither the Security Council has proof and takes\naction, the setting up of an investigative commission\nbeing now irrelevant; or the Security Council has no\nproof, so it investigates and takes a decision after it has\nchecked the facts. The credibility of our Organization is\nat stake here. These are just two cases showing the\ninability of the United Nations to deal with the new\nchallenges.\nThe much-needed revitalization of the United\nNations depends on the interest and the efficacy it shows\nin dealing with conflicts and complex situations that call\nfor its intervention.\nThe same holds true for its restructuring. Fifty years\nafter its inception, the United Nations needs to adjust and\nadapt to the new challenges facing the world today,\nincluding economic and social development; political\nconflicts against a backdrop of ethnic cleansing; changes\naffecting international relations; and the changes that have\ntaken place in the world since 24 October 1945; the need\nto enlarge the circle of decision-makers in matters of\ninternational peace and security; the need to ensure more\nequitable and balanced representation of the nations of the\nworld on the Security Council and to avoid any danger of\nthe collective security system being manipulated; and the\ninadequacy of the financial resources to cover the scale of\nthe tasks facing this universal Organization.\nThis therefore seems to be the cost of ensuring a\nnew dynamism in United Nations activities, for this\nchanging world is not exactly reassuring. And many\nevents are taking place without the nations of the world\nknowing why or how. There is a danger that political\nlobbies may use the cogs of the United Nations\nmachinery to their own ends, using their influence,\nwithout any counterbalance, and that certain Governments\nmay bring pressure to bear on the United Nations. This\nslippery slope was certainly not foreseen when the\ncollective security system was established.\nThe Republic of Zaire welcomes the current peace\nprocess in the Middle East. We noted with satisfaction the\nagreements signed between the State of Israel and the\nPalestine Liberation Organization on the one hand and\nbetween Israel and Jordan on the other. To our mind,\nthese are important steps towards the establishment of an\noverall peace.\nZaire wholeheartedly supports the bilateral\nnegotiations and the progress made thus far in the peace\nprocess and urges all parties to implement the agreements.\n4\n\n\nWe trust that efforts will be made to ensure that further\nnegotiations are held soon between Israel and other Arab\nStates.\nEmphasizing the need to ensure progress in Arab-\nIsraeli negotiations in other directions of the peace process,\nthe Republic of Zaire would urge the establishment of\ndialogue between the protagonists, and encourage them to\ndo their utmost to reach agreements that reflect the\nlegitimate aspirations of each side.\nThis is the only way in which we will be able to\novercome an age-old distrust and create the conditions\nneeded for progress and development in the Middle East, in\nthe spirit of peace that has been so long in coming.\nThe situation in the Great Lakes subregion in Central\nAfrica is of great concern in the Republic of Zaire because\nit calls into question the peace, stability, security and\ndevelopment, not just of Rwanda and Burundi, but of the\nregion as a whole.\nThe Republic of Zaire, I wish to emphasize, has no\nparticular problem with Rwanda or with Burundi.\nYesterday, Zaire offered refuge to the Tutsis who were\ndriven from their home and today we are offering refuge to\nthose who have left their country. A human tragedy of an\nunprecedented scale is unfolding in this region. Everything\nborders on the extreme, including the urge to exclude other\npeople; the hatred that pits the fraternal enemies, the Tutsis\nand the Hutus, against each other; the dramatic\nperegrinations of people who are hounded because of their\nethnic origins or political opinions; the ease with which\nhuman lives are destroyed, including the lives of children,\nwomen, old people, and intellectuals; the instinct for\nviolence; the scale of the flow of people searching for\nshelter, fleeing certain death; the imbalance in the division\nof political and military power and the rejection of\ndemocratic principles in the running of the country.\nAs former Tutsi refugees from 1959 and from 1962-\n1963 are returning home, thanks to the return to power of\nthe Rwandan Patriotic Front (FPR), it is now the turn of\nmillions of Hutus, who represent 85 per cent of the\npopulation, to leave their country, abandoning their\nproperty, their land and their houses to the newcomers.\nThe Tutsis, who were forced out in the 1960s at the\nheight of the Hutus\u2019 power, and who account for 15 per\ncent of the population, took 30 years to prepare their\nforcible return to power. How long does the international\ncommunity want to wait until it is the turn of the Hutu\nmajority to return to power using force?\nEvery time there is this kind of swing, new human\ndramas will be condemned and major problems of\nreinsertion and reinstallation will emerge.\nIn this cycle of deliberate violence, it will become\nincreasingly impossible to say who is innocent of\nsomething and who is not guilty of something.\nFaced with a tragedy of such magnitude, the\ninternational community and the United Nations seem to\nus to be rather helpless. Who then will take the necessary\nmeasures to help these countries, to prevent their situation\nfrom deteriorating, to preserve peace and security in the\nregion and to prevent further genocide?\nThe resolutions and declarations adopted to date by\nthe United Nations do not take account of all the realities\non the ground. They do not cover all the aspects of the\ntragedy that I have just described that exists in Rwanda,\nBurundi and in the subregion of the Great Lakes as a\nwhole. And these resolutions and declarations have\npolitical implications that contribute to the region\u2019s\ninstability.\nNo purpose can be served at the stage where we are\ntoday by quoting lofty principles or deciding who is right\non the basis of who can best present their version of the\nsituation and the facts. Instead, we must objectively\ndefine the concrete problems facing Rwanda and Burundi\nas States and take specific measures, within the\nframework of an overall approach to the question, to\nensure the repatriation of refugees; national reconciliation;\npower-sharing; the establishment of the needed balance in\nthe armies that now constitute the political support of\nGovernments, in order to create republican armed forces;\nthe establishment or revitalization of the democratization\nprocess; assistance in reintegrating refugees into society;\nreconstruction and development assistance for the\ncountries of origin and of asylum; and, finally, the\nestablishment of viable judicial structures, so that there\ncan be some justice. There is indeed a justice problem,\nand it must be solved.\nIt is in this spirit that the Republic of Zaire supports\nthe holding of a regional conference on peace, stability\nand security in the Great Lakes subregion, following the\nsigning of bilateral agreements on the repatriation of\nrefugees. If this conference is to succeed, it must, for\nobvious reasons, be planned very carefully. The\n5\n\n\nGovernment of Zaire welcomed the appointment by the\nSecretary-General of the United Nations of Ambassador\nJesus to the post of Special Envoy. Zaire will cooperate\nfully with him in order to ensure the success of his mission.\nI should like also to draw the Assembly\u2019s attention to\nthe fact that the influx of Rwandese refugees into eastern\nZaire, an event unheard of since the end of the Second\nWorld War, appears to have been relegated to the back\npages of international news now that its sensationalist\naspect has worn thin. The refugees destroyed a priceless\nnational heritage: the national park of Virunga, a site listed\nby the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural\nOrganization (UNESCO) as a national treasure. The local\nflora and fauna \u2014 mountain gorillas, elephants and other\nprotected species \u2014 were not spared. The environment, the\necology, and basic sanitary and educational infrastructures\nwere destroyed. General Assembly resolution 49/24 of 2\nDecember 1994, on special assistance to countries \u2014\nincluding Zaire \u2014 receiving refugees to help restore the\nareas destroyed by the massive presence of refugees, has so\nfar had no impact or follow-up whatsoever.\nZaire, a victim of the tragedy in Rwanda by virtue of\ntheir common border, has been accused, with increasing\nfrequency, of attempting to destabilize Rwanda. The\naccusers are none other than those who wish to use the\nrefugee question to destabilize the Great Lakes area in\norder to live out their dream of creating a new Ima empire\nthat would challenge the principle, inherited from colonized\ntimes, of the inviolability of borders; they would attempt to\nresolve the ethnic conflicts in the region by distributing\nland here and there \u2014 all this to the detriment of Zaire.\nThis approach shows that a political issue underlies the\nwhole problem. Either we are dealing with refugees, in the\ntrue sense of the word, and then their massive presence and\nthe destruction they have wrought in our country cause our\npeople a serious safety and security problem \u2014 which\nwould entitle us to invoke the exception envisaged in the\nDeclaration on Territorial Asylum; or we are dealing with\npeople quietly expelled from their country for political and\nethnic reasons, in which case, since no constitution in the\nworld would allow a country to expel its citizens for ethnic\nor political reasons, we do not have to accept these\ncastaways of \u201cethnic cleansing\u201d. That is why, in order that\nthe pretext of Zaire\u2019s supposed attempt to destabilize\nRwanda not give certain countries the opportunity to carry\nout a plot against my country, Zaire \u2014 in the wake of the\nlifting of the arms embargo on Rwanda, which was decided\non by the Security Council, and in the face of the\njeopardizing of our national security and the serious threats\nthat face our population \u2014 resorted to one of the existing\ninternational instruments concerning refugees, namely\nGeneral Assembly resolution 2312 (XXII), of 14\nDecember 1967, the Declaration on Territorial Asylum, to\nurge the international community and the United Nations\nto shoulder their responsibilities, because Zaire does not\nhave the means to bear alone the burden of the massive\npresence of refugees in its territory, particularly since it\nis on the eve of holding elections.\nI would recall, since much has been said about this,\nthat the second preambular paragraph of the Declaration\non Territorial Asylum states that a person faced with\npersecution\n\u201chas the right to seek and to enjoy in other countries\nasylum from persecution\u201d\nand paragraph 1 of article 3 states that such a person shall\nnot be\n\u201csubjected to measures such as rejection at the\nborder or, if he has already entered the territory in\nwhich he seeks asylum, expulsion or compulsory\nreturn\u201d.\nSince 1960, Zaire has been taking in refugees from\nRwanda \u2014 sometimes Tutsi, sometimes Hutu \u2014 and we\nhave always followed that provision to the letter. But\nparagraph 2 of article 3 states:\n\u201cException may be made to the foregoing principle\nonly for overriding reasons of national security or in\norder to safeguard the population, as in the case of\na mass influx of persons\u201d.\nAnd if a State should decide that, for whatever\nreason, an exception to that provision is justified, it can\n\u201cconsider the possibility of granting to the person\nconcerned an opportunity of going to another State\u201d,\nand can then bring this matter before the international\ncommunity.\nThis is precisely the situation that Zaire found itself\nin. It decided to be an exception to the principle, and so\ninformed the Secretary-General and the Security Council\nof the United Nations. Countries wishing to take in these\nrefugees are welcome to do so, but Zaire refuses to\ncontinue to be accused of destabilizing Rwanda simply\nbecause we accepted 3 million Rwandese on our land. We\n6\n\n\nwish to cut out at the root the trumped-up charges against\nour country. In this way, the international community will\nbe able to judge better our determination to live in peace\nwith our neighbours.\nHowever, acceding to the request by the Secretary-\nGeneral of the United Nations, the Zaire Government held\ntalks with Mrs. Sadako Ogata, the head of the Office of the\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugees\n(UNHCR), and asked her to organize, on the UNHCR level,\na voluntary repatriation, on a massive and uninterrupted\nscale, of the refugees to their countries of origin, so that by\n31 December 1995 all of the refugees would have returned\nhome.\nThe international community has an obligation to help\nRwanda and Burundi to deal with the problems of\nrepatriation and reinsertion of their nationals. During our\nlast meeting in Geneva on 25 September 1995, we agreed\nwith Rwanda\u2019s Minister of Rehabilitation and with Mrs.\nOgata on the modalities for repatriating the refugees by 31\nDecember, to the tune of 8,000 to 10,000 persons per day,\nat various points of entry, which were identified \u2014\nShangugu, Kiseni or Gibumba.\nWe can think of no Government that would hesitate as\nto what course to take if it had to choose between the\nrequirements of international solidarity and those of national\nsecurity and the protection of its population.\nTo judge by the information that appears in the\ninternational press, the impression that some wish to give\nof Zaire is that it is a hell where it would not be very\npleasant to live.\nZaireans are human beings. Like human beings\nanywhere, some are good and some are bad, some not so\ngood and not so bad. We are also a people. Whatever one\nthinks of me personally, or of any other politician in my\ncountry, this cannot be allowed to discredit an entire\npeople, or affect the image of my people as a whole.\nWhen many fled the horrors and the violence of war,\nit was to the \u201chell\u201d of Zaire that they chose to come and\nlive. But one might well wonder what would become of\npeace in Central Africa if Zaire were incapable of\nmanaging conflicts between tribes \u2014 we have more than\n450, as well as our other internal political problems \u2014 and\nif it exploded like Rwanda, spilling our 47 million people\ninto neighbouring countries.\nFor countries such as ours, that have experienced the\nwhole range of turbulence that a people can know \u2014\nabove and beyond the colonial period, which more or less\npersisted into the first years of independence, and the\nprice of building a post-colonial State in conformity with\nthe aspirations of our people \u2014 there is no greater good\nin the world than peace. Without it, all illusions aside,\nprogress and development are out of the question.\nIn the name of peace, every State must be fully\nresponsible for its people and must learn to live with its\nown national contradictions and refrain from obliging\nothers to bear the burden of its incapacity to manage\nthose contradictions. Otherwise, the international\ncommunity, both at the regional and global levels, must\ncome to its aid to develop its capacity to resolve its\nproblems without inflicting further wounds, and above all\nwithout inflicting them on other countries, developing\ncountries like our own, whose resources are needed for\nother purposes.\nThe international community thus has the duty and\nshould have the courage to impose peace and\nreconciliation in the Great Lakes region and state clearly\nits refusal to countenance the drift towards exclusion and\nethnicity.\nZaire shelters many African refugees on its territory\nand, out of a sense of common humanity and an\nappreciation of our historic ties with its neighbours,\ndecided to take in our Rwandese brothers. But we can no\nlonger pay for the tragedies that are engulfing our\nneighbours, with all their economic and security\nrepercussions on our border population.\nAs I have said, we believe the international\ncommunity must do all it can to reassure our people by\nhelping the Governments of Rwanda and Burundi to make\nall the necessary provisions to guarantee the speedy return\nof the refugees and their reintegration in their homeland.\nWe reaffirm here our resolve to work for the restoration\nof a climate of peace in our subregion and to make our\ncontribution towards all the efforts at reconciliation aimed\nat strengthening mutual confidence and security there.\nBut we can no longer cope alone with those\nrefugees. We can no longer shoulder alone the\nhumanitarian burden imposed upon us by humanitarian\nprinciples and the agreements we have signed.\nOn behalf of my Government, I should like to take\nthis opportunity to thank Mrs. Sadako Ogata and the\n7\n\n\nExecutive Committee of the High Commissioner for\nRefugees for the efforts they have been making with\nlimited resources to solve the problem of refugees in the\nGreat Lakes region and for their assistance in rehabilitating\nthe Bukavu airport and the port of Uvira.\nOur thanks also go to the member States of the\nEuropean Union which have pledged contributions for the\nrepair of roads in North and South Kivu in advance of the\norganization of elections.\nIn the 1960s, few governing structures in the countries\nof the South demonstrated particular interest in or\nattachment to the close connection that exists between\ndemocracy and development; democracy and human rights;\nand human rights and development.\nWith the passage of time, the difficult experience of\nmanagement has taught us some lessons. It makes more\nsense to manage growth and wealth than degradation and\npoverty; it is not enough to consume what others produce,\nbut one should learn to produce what one consumes;\ninheriting infrastructure and ways of life conceived by\nothers is one thing, but conceiving one\u2019s own communal\napproach to life and to fix one\u2019s own limits for oneself is\nanother.\nIn all things, it is the individual that remains the focus\nand the medium. An individual whose rights and freedoms\nare flouted, who is aware that he does not count in national\naffairs, drifts away from the ruling circles and from the\nnational effort for development imposed on him from\nabove, from policies out of touch with his own daily life.\nMany of our countries have, in the course of the last 30\nyears, experienced the indifference of the individual whose\nrights and freedoms were left out of account.\nToday, in the light of the economic and social\ncollapse, that link between human rights, democracy and\ndevelopment is understood and acknowledged. It is not just\nbecause of what was said at the conference at La Baule, but\nbecause of the importance and the intensity of the message\nwe heard at La Baule, that the process of democratization\nin Africa must also be understood as an act of awareness,\nof self-awareness. That is how this process becomes truly\nirreversible.\nIn the Republic of Zaire, five years of difficult\ntransition have done considerable damage at the political,\neconomic and social levels. That is why we have not been\nable to play our full part in the arena of free nations.\nDomestically, we have not been fully able to shoulder our\nresponsibilities to deal with the socio-economic\nrequirements of our people.\nBut now we have decided to bury the past and to\nassume our duties to the full and to offer our contribution\nto the solution of problems facing the international\ncommunity, if it be only through our analysis of the\nsituation.\nWe intend to strengthen ties with all friendly\ncountries, particularly our traditional friends, in finding\ntogether appropriate solutions to the problems which have\nbeset our relations. At the same time, we mean to give\nsustained, real and useful meaning to the diversification\nof our external relations in the field of development.\nInternally, through another kind of management, of\nwhich the Prime Minister spoke in September 1994, and\nin the context of restored liberties, we intend to meet the\naspirations of our people to a better quality of life. This\nis a matter of priority.\nDemocracy does not mean licence, and the state of\nlaws implies that all citizens are subject without\ndiscrimination to the law. In our countries, educating as\nmany people as possible, changing the way people think,\nraising the general level of education and political and\ndemocratic awareness \u2014 all of these draw upon the\nlimited financial resources of the State to strengthen,\nfollowing the forthcoming elections, democracy and the\nstate of law and of progress.\nWhile the Government is seeking to create\nconditions of legal security and an economic environment\nfavourable to the creation of fruitful partnerships and\nmutually advantageous cooperation, we want to count on\nour external partners and the international financial\ninstitutions \u2014 in short, on the international community \u2014\nto take up with us the challenge of development. The\npresent institutional order in our country conforms to the\ndesires of our people as expressed through its political\nclass as a whole, and is designed to extricate us from the\ncrisis rationally and methodically. But our efforts alone\nwill not suffice. That is why we seek aid to accompany\nthe process of democratization, because, unfortunately, the\nsupport of the people for political scenarios is also\nimportant to finding a solution to their daily concerns.\nAs the Manila Declaration emphasizes, by mutual\nsupport, the internal and external forces that endanger the\nnew democracy can be overcome. The United Nations\nthus has a duty to support efforts by Governments,\n8\n\n\nincluding ours, to promote or consolidate new or\nre-established democracies.\nThe eradication of extreme poverty in all countries,\nparticularly developing countries, has become one of the\npriority development goals of the 1990s, in keeping with\nresolutions 47/196 and 47/197. The year 1996 has been\nproclaimed International Year for the Eradication of\nPoverty. This honours our Organization.\nOver the past 50 years, the United Nations has made\nserious efforts to intensify international economic\ncooperation. In particular, it has adopted the Charter of\nEconomic Rights and Duties of States and the Declaration\nand Programme of Action on the Establishment of a New\nInternational Economic Order based on justice and equity.\nNone the less, the trade relations between the developed\nand the developing countries continue to show an imbalance\nwhich, having been allowed to persist and grow, is today a\nreal threat to peace everywhere.\nIn Africa, efforts made at the national, subregional and\nregional levels to break out of the vicious cycle of poverty\nhave not been sufficiently supported by the international\ncommunity. Stricken by an unprecedented crisis, Africa has\nfor years groaned under the weight of its debt. It has\nsuffered the effects of lowered commodity prices, of the\ndeterioration in the terms of trade, of protectionism in the\ndeveloped countries, and of a drop in official development\nassistance.\nThe debt is a major hindrance to economic growth and\ndevelopment in Africa. The heavy debt burden absorbs one\nthird of our countries\u2019 export earnings and represents a\nserious drain on resources which would otherwise have\nserved to finance growth and development.\nIn order to implement economic reform, stabilization\nand structural adjustment programmes and to eradicate\npoverty, the debtor developing countries need to mobilize\nthe resources necessary to their efforts. They also need new\nsupplies of financial resources and concessional financial\nassistance from creditor countries and multilateral financial\ninstitutions.\nDebt relief is becoming increasingly unavoidable if\nnational resources are to be freed up to support activities\nnecessary to social development. The responsibilities which\ndebt and debt servicing impose on our developing countries\nare so alarming that we must apply ourselves with\nparticular inventiveness and urgency to the search for\nsolutions to the problems to which they give rise. They\nrequire a leap of imagination.\nThat is why we feel it to be necessary and urgent to\nassess the progress made in the various United Nations\nbodies in the establishment of a new international\neconomic order, so that, in response to the results of this\nassessment, we can take appropriate measures to promote\ndevelopment in developing countries and international\neconomic cooperation.\nThe Republic of Zaire hopes that, at this session, the\nGeneral Assembly, in the framework of agenda item 96\n(c), on the external debt crisis and development, will take\ninto consideration the recommendations made by the\nnon-aligned countries at their meeting in Jakarta from 13\nto 15 August 1994. It may find therein ways and means\nof resolving the problem of the debt of developing\ncountries and of promoting their harmonious development.\nEveryone knows that the external debt of the\ndeveloping countries cannot be absorbed at its current\nlevel without the cooperation of the developed countries\nand the international financial institutions, which must\nagree on the establishment of a new world economic\norder that would take the vital interests of its partners into\naccount. The countries of the North would also benefit by\nmaking an additional effort to understand that the debtor\ncountries can only honour their debt-service obligations\naccording to their financial capacities. In the current\nsituation, compelling them to meet all their financial\ncommitments could end up in a collapse of their\neconomies, despite all their good-faith efforts.\n1995 has been proclaimed World Year of Peoples\u2019\nCommemoration of the Victims of the Second World War\nand Member States have been called upon solemnly to\ncommemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the end of the\nSecond World War. This year we will also consider and\nassess mid-way the Declaration of the 1990s as the Third\nDisarmament Decade.\nHow can we commemorate the victims of the\nSecond World War today without also giving thought to\nthe victims of the wars in the former Yugoslavia, Liberia,\nSomalia, Rwanda, Burundi and elsewhere? When will we\ncommemorate the victims of those wars? There is no\ndestruction of human life that is more appropriate than\nany other. The United Nations was supposed to save\nsucceeding generations from the scourge of war \u2014 but\nwhich war, what kind of war? True, the kind of war\nfought from 1939 to 1945 has not recurred, but can we\n9\n\n\nassert today that mankind has mastered the arts of peace?\nIt is in men\u2019s minds that the instinct for war must be\nreplaced by the spirit of peace if the world is to be saved\nfrom the scourge of war. If it is not, any progress we have\nmade will remain fragile.\nThe United Nations offers us the opportunity to\nconsider from a global perspective the questions of war,\npeace and security. It remains an essential instrument for\nachieving the objectives of arms control and disarmament.\nBut situations of conflict and tension must be prevented\nmore effectively. An efficient system of collective security\nthat allows States to reduce their military capacities must be\nput in place. It is no longer enough to limit arms and\npromote disarmament by regulating weaponry and\nestablishing the balance of power at lower levels. We feel\nthat that is not the way to achieve the goal of development\nfor all, which is the new major challenge facing the United\nNations.\nWe must reinvent trust in international relations. We\nmust make a new creative effort to ensure that disarmament\ngoes hand-in-hand with the achievement of peace, security\nand development throughout the world. In this context, we\nbelieve that the Convention on the Prohibition of the\nDevelopment, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical\nWeapons and on Their Destruction \u2014 the first global and\ntruly verifiable disarmament treaty \u2014 offers a worthwhile\navenue. Indeed, it carries a security gain for all States\nthrough the total elimination of an entire category of\nweapons of mass destruction. We hope that this Convention\nwill soon have the required number of ratifications to enter\ninto force and thus become a standard shared by all States.\nSince the inclusion in the General Assembly\u2019s agenda,\nin 1973, of the item on the restitution of works of art to\ncountries victims of expropriation, we have noted with\nsatisfaction the continued and growing interest in this item\nshown by Members of the United Nations. In addition to\nbilateral negotiations for the restitution of cultural property,\nwe now have the Convention on the Means of Prohibiting\nand Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of\nOwnership of Cultural Property, to which the number of\nStates Parties continues to grow.\nHowever, the quantity and quality of the cultural\nproperty \u201creturned\u201d or restored are insignificant compared\nto the importance which the General Assembly attaches to\nthe item. Promises made to Zaire by countries which still\nhold works of art and other cultural treasures belonging to\nZaire, as well as museum pieces and archives that are\nessential to preserving and nourishing cultural values,\nhave not been fully kept.\nWe call on the Secretary-General, in cooperation\nwith the Director-General of the United Nations\nEducational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, to do\neverything possible to encourage those countries to\nhonour their obligations so that the objectives of the\nUnited Nations and the countries of origin can be met.\nI wish the General Assembly every success to the\nwork of its fiftieth session and I wish the United Nations\na long life.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, may I\ncongratulate you on your election and express my deep\nsatisfaction at seeing a representative of Portugal, an ally\nand a valued member of the international community,\noccupy the presidency of the General Assembly in our\nfiftieth anniversary year.\nAnniversaries are occasions to celebrate past\naccomplishments. The towering achievement of the United\nNations is to have survived through nearly half a century\nwhere power relationships often submerged the high-minded\nvision of the United Nations Charter. Therefore, as we\ncelebrate the half-century of our Organization, we also\ncelebrate the triumph of hope over despair and of good\nfaith over cynicism. At long last, there is an opportunity\nfor the United Nations to come into its own and for the\nideals of the Charter to take hold.\nAt the same time, we must learn from our mistakes.\nForemost, in that context, is the tragic conflict in Bosnia\nand Herzegovina. In spite of the laudable humanitarian\nand peace-keeping efforts of the United Nations, the\nOrganization has in the eyes of the world appeared\nincapable of preventing the savage dismembering of a\nsovereign Member State.\nAlthough we all realize that the United Nations can\nnever provide foolproof insurance against evil and\ninjustice, the Organization must in the future face such\nchallenges in a more resolute manner. We must demand\nmore of ourselves and learn how to use more effectively\nthe indispensable machinery the Organization has to offer.\nWe should also bear in mind that no organization,\nhowever efficient, can provide a substitute for the political\nwill of its Member States.\nRecent setbacks should, however, not be allowed to\nobscure the considerable gains, global and regional, that\nhave been made on a number of fronts over the past year.\nLet me mention only a few.\nThe march of democracy has continued through the\norganization of free elections in different parts of the\nworld, and a growing number of people now live under\npluralistic and democratic Governments. In recent years,\nthe Organization has contributed to the success of\nelections in various Member States.\nTwo major United Nations Conferences took place\nearlier this year. Each could, if followed up in earnest,\nmake a tangible difference in the lives of people\neverywhere. At the World Summit on Social\nDevelopment in Copenhagen in March, we decided to\nplace people at the centre of development and to address\nthe problem of global poverty more effectively. At the\nrecently concluded Fourth World Conference on Women\nin Beijing, we pledged to empower women and to involve\nthem as equal partners in all spheres of society. Together,\nwomen and men can and should create a powerful unity\nbased on equality, development and peace.\nIn the area of international law, the achievements of\nthe United Nations were once again brought into focus\nwith the entry into force of the United Nations\nConvention on the Law of the Sea last November and the\nadoption in August of the Agreement on the\n16\n\n\nImplementation of the Provisions of the Convention relating\nto the Conservation and Management of Straddling Fish\nStocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks.\nIn May, a historic step was taken towards ridding the\nworld of the threat of nuclear weapons. The decision by the\nParties to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty to extend\nthe Treaty indefinitely and without conditions should pave\nthe way for a comprehensive and verifiable test ban and an\nagreement to cut off the production of fissile material. It is\nregrettable that China and France have not heeded the\nworldwide demand for a moratorium on nuclear testing.\nAt the regional level there have also been welcome\ndevelopments. While the passage has not been smooth,\nthere has been further progress towards a comprehensive\npeace in the Middle East. We have witnessed the joint\nefforts of the Israelis and the Palestinians to bring their\nconflict to an end, and we extend to them our sincere\ncongratulations on their historic agreement to be signed\nlater this week.\nThese are substantial accomplishments. They confirm\nthat hard work, guided by the goals and ideals of the\nUnited Nations, can bear fruit. More of that same\ndedication is now required as the Organization prepares to\ntake on the complex challenges of the twenty-first century.\nThe foremost challenge is the need to establish and\nsafeguard peace. While the threat of nuclear holocaust has\nreceded, we still live in a world riven by wars. Annual\nmilitary expenditure still nearly equals the total income of\nthe poorer half of the world\u2019s population. The peace\ndividend we had hoped for in the aftermath of the cold war\nremains for many a sight unseen.\nThe Secretary-General has rightly observed that there\nis an inherent link between peace and development.\nWithout the one you cannot have the other. Peace is the\nnecessary precondition for the well-being of all peoples,\nand in the long run we shall be able to protect ourselves\nfrom the scourge of war only if we make the necessary\ninvestment in the infrastructure of peace. This involves,\namong other things, dealing with the legacy of deprivation\nthat still confronts mankind.\nThe challenge of development will not lend itself to a\nsimple formulation in terms of government versus the\nmarket-place. Instead, we must apply a comprehensive\nframework, linking democracy, society, the economy and\nthe environment, carefully nuanced to regional and local\ncircumstances. Here, the Secretary-General has led the way\nin his ground-breaking report. Let me dwell on a few\naspects of the issue of development that are of particular\ninterest to my own country.\nFirst a word on the role of democracy. Democracies,\nit is sometimes said, do not make wars. By promoting\ndemocracy we also foster peace. This is in part because\ntwo of the main pillars of democracy are tolerance and\nrespect for the customs, traditions and opinions of others.\nBut tolerance and respect for diversity must not be\nmisinterpreted. We live in a world of rich cultural\ndiversity, which we should relish and protect. However,\nmulticulturalism should never be used as a pretext for\ncompromising basic and universal human rights.\nIceland attaches continued importance to\ninternational efforts to create a global environment\nconducive to job-led economic growth. But economic\ngrowth must never be our sole objective, without regard\nto human values.\nEnvironmental protection is another main concern.\nImportant strides have been made in this area since the\nEarth Summit in Rio. Climate change and ozone\ndepletion, two major dangers to the global ecosystem, are\nnow being dealt with on the basis of legally binding\nconventions. But much will depend on coordinated action\nto implement the commitments we have undertaken.\nFurthermore, greater attention needs to be devoted to the\nmarine environment.\nPollution of the marine environment, if not\ncontained, can have a serious impact on human\nsettlements in certain regions of the world, not least\ncommunities of indigenous peoples. In this connection,\nchemical pollutants in the form of persistent organic\nsubstances are of particular concern for entire societies\nwhich base their livelihood on the living resources of the\nsea.\nIceland is firmly of the view that this threat can be\ncountered only through a global and legally binding\nframework similar to that governing climate change and\nozone depletion. For this reason, my Government attaches\nparticular importance to the conference on the protection\nof the marine environment from land-based sources, due\nto take place in Washington later this year, and we urge\nMember States to take active part in this conference.\nMarine living resources can make an important\ncontribution to food security in a world faced with rapid\npopulation growth. Such resources provide food and\n17\n\n\nlivelihood to millions of people and, if sustainably used,\noffer increased potential to meet nutritional and social\nneeds, particularly in the developing countries, as noted in\na recent report of the Food and Agriculture Organization.\nFor this reason, it is particularly regrettable that close\nto 70 per cent of the world\u2019s conventional species of fish\nwere, according to the same agency, fully exploited,\noverexploited or depleted, or are in the process of\nrebuilding as a result of depletion in the early 1990s.\nClearly, the ability to satisfy global demand for food from\nthe sea in the coming years will depend to no small extent\non the adoption of responsible fisheries conservation and\nmanagement policies. We should at all times view the\necosystem of the oceans as a whole and harvest all species\nof this vast but delicate resource in a sustainable manner.\nLooked at in this light, the results of the United\nNations Conference on Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly\nMigratory Fish Stocks, while by no means the final word\non this matter, acquire major significance. Let me point out\nthat the law of the sea has been the sphere in which Iceland\nhas been most engaged, beginning in 1949, when, upon a\nproposal by Iceland, the International Law Commission was\ngiven the task of studying all aspects of the law of the sea.\nIceland will continue to be active in the implementation of\nthe Convention on the Law of the Sea.\nWe live in an era of growing demand on diminishing\nnatural resources. It is therefore to be welcomed that\ninternational cooperation is now gradually extending to the\nArctic region, breaking at last through the barrier of what\nthe Icelandic- American explorer Vilhj\u00e1lmur Stef\u00e1nsson\nonce referred to as\n\u201cthe ancient inherited opinions about the terrors of the\nFrozen North\u201d, a \u201clifeless waste of eternal silence\u201d.\nThe resources of the Arctic are enormous. The nations of\nthe region should develop its potential and work together in\nthe economic, environmental and cultural fields. Therefore,\nmy Government attaches the highest importance to the\nconsultations that have taken place among the Governments\nof the eight Arctic States to establish the Arctic Council.\nWe have had intensive discussions on changes in the\nSecurity Council, including on whether to increase its\nmembership. Iceland is of the view that the fundamental\nobjective of an enlargement of the Council should be to\nstrengthen its capacity to discharge the duties assigned to it.\nWe believe that there should be an increase in the number\nof both permanent and non-permanent members. In this\ncontext, I would like to express my Government\u2019s support\nfor the permanent membership of Germany and Japan in\nthe Security Council.\nReform, however, will avail us little if we fail to\ncome to grips with the serious financial situation of the\nUnited Nations. Here, I fully share the deep concerns that\nthe Secretary-General has expressed in his comprehensive\nreport on the state of the Organization. According to their\nobligations under the Charter, the Member States should\npay their contributions to the regular budget in full, on\ntime and without condition. If all Member States do not\nlive up to their obligations, we will be forced to take the\ninevitable political decision to scale back the activities of\nthe Organization. At a time when the services of the\nUnited Nations are in greater demand and when the\nOrganization has a better chance of success than ever\nbefore, such a step would be highly unfortunate. Instead,\nlet us put the fiftieth anniversary to good use and make\nthe earnest pledge to put the Organization on a sound\nfinancial footing.\n"

        "file_text": "May I extend our\ncongratulations to you, Sir, upon your election as President\nof the General Assembly at this historic fiftieth session. The\ndelegation of Hungary stands ready to do its fair share in\nassisting you in the fulfilment of your important\nresponsibilities.\nThe 50-year-old United Nations is a living witness to\nour successes and failures. In many quarters, the question\nis raised whether the United Nations has a credibility\nproblem at this important juncture of its history. We have\nto remind ourselves that the capacity of the United Nations\nto act is nothing but the reflection of the will and\ndetermination of its Member States. With the euphoria over\nthe end of the cold war gone, we ought to take a hard look\nat the role the United Nations is called upon to play in a\ndramatically altered, often fluid international environment\nwhere shared values may not automatically yield\nconverging interests.\nThe Charter provides us with valuable guidance for\ndistinguishing sound international order and stability from\nthe expedience of appeasement. The question is whether the\ninternational community is always ready to act accordingly\nby taking a firm stand against aggression, heinous crimes\nagainst humanity and flagrant infringements on the human\nrights and fundamental freedoms of millions of individuals\naround the globe.\nWe believe that there can be no place for complacency\nwhen we witness devastating wars, lawlessness, the\nsuffering of civilian populations and widespread human\nmisery. There is no positive answer to the question\nwhether, in spite of the absence of the threat of a new\nworld catastrophe, we can keep our planet safe and secure.\nA fundamentally changed global political environment, as\nbipolarism fades away, cannot prevent the outbreak of local\nwars, internal conflicts or ethnic strife. The values and\nprinciples we hold so dear seem to be distant dreams\nagainst the backdrop of horrors occurring in places remote\nfor some, but dangerously close to others.\n\nWe have come to realize the growing importance of\neffective regional tools in addressing this new type of\nmostly internal conflicts, where the rule of law and\naccountable national administrations are often non-\nexistent, where warlords and other unscrupulous leaders\nlead campaigns of intimidation, \u201cethnic cleansing\u201d and\ngenocide in an atmosphere of nationalism and hatred.\nThroughout the years, the United Nations has achieved a\nnumber of important successes by brokering peace\nagreements, conducting peace-keeping operations,\nimproving humanitarian situations and promoting national\nreconciliation.\nThe world Organization is better equipped to deal\nwith traditional conflict situations. However, it has yet to\nprepare itself for meeting all the new and alarming\nchallenges. While the United Nations cannot realistically\nmanage all the crises occurring world wide, because of its\nunique role and responsibility in the maintenance of\ninternational peace and security, it should seek to\nstrengthen global political consensus on the principles of\nthe Charter, assist, through its preventive capacity, in the\nformulation of regional strategies and efforts and take\ndecisive action when regional or global security is\nseriously challenged.\nToday\u2019s conflicts call for a more coherent yet\ndecentralized United Nations response capability.\nStreamlining and rationalizing the Organization should be\nthe order of the day, not only to eliminate waste and\noverlap, but also to make the best use of existing political\nand financial resources. We also fully support the\nSecretary-General\u2019s efforts to improve coordination\nbetween United Nations organs and agencies with a view\nto enhancing the early-warning, stand-by and rapid-\nreaction capacities of the Organization, which should\nfocus on all the political, security, social, economic-\necological, humanitarian and human rights areas of United\nNations activity.\nAs regards the reform efforts in general, one should\nbear in mind that agreement on such diverse issues as the\nelimination of the enemy-States clause from the Charter\nor the reform of the financing of peace-keeping operations\ncannot be achieved overnight. We hope that the\n9\n\n\nestablishment of an open-ended working group of the\nGeneral Assembly, chaired by its President, will be an\nimportant milestone in this highly complex endeavour. We\nwelcome the important measures already implemented and\nare looking forward to others which are designed to\nenhance the transparency and effectiveness of the\nfunctioning of the Security Council.\nThe main mission of the United Nations is to make the\nworld a safer place for all. After a series of United Nations\nconferences on the most important global problems, such as\nenvironment, human rights, population and social\ndevelopment, and the recently concluded World Conference\non Women, we ought to focus our attention on the practical\nimplementation of their recommendations.\nEarlier this year the international community extended\nfor an indefinite period the validity of the Treaty on the\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. Hungary had\nsupported from the very beginning the idea of indefinite\nextension, for we are convinced that this major international\ninstrument promotes stability by preventing the spread of\nthe nuclear arsenal and at the same time aims at the orderly\ndevelopment of nuclear cooperation for peaceful purposes.\nWe hope that the security guarantees given to the\nnon-nuclear States by the permanent members of the\nSecurity Council, as well as the prospects of a thorough\nreview of the operation of the Treaty \u2014 including the\nobligations in the field of nuclear disarmament, especially\nthe early conclusion of a comprehensive test-ban treaty \u2014\nwill open up further possibilities for progress in this area.\nThe tragedy in the former Yugoslavia has revealed,\nnot only where brutality and the trampling of elementary\nnorms of international law and human behaviour can lead,\nbut also the devastating consequences of unwillingness to\nenforce the legitimate decisions of the international\ncommunity. What we have seen was that the Security\nCouncil, and consequently the United Nations as a whole,\nwas either unable or unwilling to follow through its own\nresolutions, thus leaving the initiative to those whose only\nargument was and is naked force and the policy of the fait\naccompli. The crisis in the Balkans is a serious and tragic\nreminder that the Security Council can preserve its\nauthority and credibility only if there is a unity of action\nwhich ensures the full and timely implementation of its\nresolutions. Another important lesson to be drawn from the\nhandling of this crisis is that adequate early-warning and\npreventive machineries should be put in place to forestall\nthe eruption of further tragedies and conflicts.\nThe Republic of Hungary, being a neighbouring\ncountry to three of the new States that emerged on the\nterritory of the former Yugoslavia, is vitally interested in\npeaceful and good-neighbourly cooperation with all of\nthem and in the early settlement of the conflict by\npolitical means, on the basis of the purposes and\nprinciples of the Charter, international law and the\nresolutions of the Security Council. In our view, a visible\nand credible international presence, backed up by\ninternational resolve to guarantee the implementation of\ndecisions taken, is essential for this purpose. We believe\nthat no comprehensive and lasting arrangements can be\nworked out for this conflict if two, so far quite neglected,\nfactors are not taken fully into account.\nFirst, any solution should incorporate the human\nrights dimension, including effective guarantees for\nminority rights in accordance with international standards.\nIn this regard, I would like to pay tribute to the former\nSpecial Rapporteur for the Commission on Human Rights,\nMr. Tadeusz Mazowiecki, for his untiring efforts\nconsistently to uphold the values of our civilization.\nNeither massive economic assistance, nor a huge\ninternational presence can make a real difference if the\nhuman rights questions are left unaddressed.\nSecondly, the security of the subregion, and, indeed,\nof Europe as a whole, is threatened by massive arms\nstockpiles, mostly left over from the previous period,\nwhen the former Yugoslavia \u2014 not being a party to the\nTreaty on Conventional Forces in Europe (CFE) \u2014\nmaintained significant armed forces, in fact, one of the\nrelatively largest in Europe. It is of vital importance,\ntherefore, to work out, in the context of the settlement,\narrangements to reduce conventional armaments on the\nterritory of former Yugoslavia.\nThe acquisition of territory by force and the\naccompanying abhorrent phenomenon of \u201cethnic\ncleansing\u201d in the former Yugoslavia led to the destruction\nof entire regions. It triggered a forced population\nmovement unseen in Europe since the Second World\nWar. Today, when we are about to enter the fifth year of\nthe war and the diplomatic efforts to find a solution are\ncontinuing, we should not lose sight of political\nresponsibilities and personal accountabilities for the\ninitiation of this drama. The sick ideas of ethnically pure,\nhomogenous, single-nation States had started a vicious\ncycle of vengeance that claimed the lives of over 100,000\npeople and forced millions of others to flee, many of\nthem seeking refuge in neighbouring and other countries.\nIn this regard, the settlement of refugees in new areas\n10\n\n\ntraditionally inhabited by other national minorities in order\nto change their century-old ethnic composition is contrary\nto international law. It is even more so if it is being\nconducted by forcible means and through intimidation, as\nhas happened to the Croat and Hungarian minorities in the\nVojvodina province of Serbia.\nThe Government of Hungary has, on several\noccasions, expressed its grave concern about the negative\nimpact of the conflict on the ethnic composition of the\npopulation concerned. From this rostrum, I should like to\ncall the attention of the international community again to\nthe need to elaborate a comprehensive settlement, in the\nframework of which the question of the refugees should be\nso resolved as to respect the interests of each and every\nethnic community. Any settlement must include the\ndevelopment and implementation of agreements that ensure\nthe survival of these communities, respect their human\nrights and fundamental freedoms, including minority rights,\nand encourage the establishment of institutions that\nguarantee those rights in the long run.\nThe issue of human rights and fundamental freedoms\nremains in the forefront of our attention. Protection and\npromotion of these rights is not only a voluntarily\nundertaken obligation of all Members of the United\nNations, but a responsibility the implementation of which\ncan be legitimately scrutinized by the international\ncommunity. In Vienna, we closed the debate on the\nuniversality of human rights by adopting the document of\nthe World Conference on Human Rights and restating\nuniversality in its own right as our guiding principle since\nthe proclamation of the Universal Declaration of Human\nRights. The legitimate role of the United Nations acting in\ndefence of human rights should therefore be supported and\nstrengthened.\nWith renewed waves of human rights violations\noccurring worldwide, mostly in internal conflicts or ethnic\nstrife, our Organization has to step up its early-warning and\npreventive capacities, develop an integrated response\nmechanism encompassing field visits and monitors, a closer\nintegration of the human rights element in peace-keeping\nactivities and ensuring effective interaction in the\nimplementation of political, peace-keeping, human rights\nand humanitarian mandates. International presence,\nparticularly preventive protection, is a most efficient\ndeterrent in curbing violations and preventing their\nescalation.\nThe establishment of the Office of the United Nations\nHigh Commissioner for Human Rights (UNHCR) was built\non the premise of giving more coherence and visibility to\nhuman rights activities within the United Nations system.\nHowever, our commitment to human rights rings hollow\nwithout constant efforts to improve the efficiency of the\nUnited Nations human rights machinery, focusing on\nprevention, on-site monitoring and developing a rapid-\nresponse capacity.\nMay I now address the General Assembly in my\ncapacity as Chairman-in-Office of the Organization for\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).\nThe cooperation between the United Nations and the\nOSCE has significantly developed on both political and\noperational levels since the December 1994 Budapest\nsummit. As the OSCE, a regional organization in the\nsense of Chapter VIII of the Charter, embarks on so-far-\nuncharted waters in conflict prevention and crisis\nmanagement, the advice and assistance of the United\nNations proves to be an important asset, for which I\nwould like to express our appreciation to the Secretary-\nGeneral.\nBased on the agreement concluded between the two\norganizations, we have indeed developed flexible forms\nof cooperation, not only in the political area, but in our\njoint efforts on humanitarian issues, human rights,\nsanctions-monitoring and operational presence.\nAt present, the OSCE has missions in Georgia,\nBosnia and Herzegovina, the Former Yugoslav Republic\nof Macedonia, Moldova, Ukraine, Tajikistan, Nagorno-\nKarabakh, Estonia, Latvia and Chechnya. We are also\nabout to establish one in Croatia. We find it indispensable\nthat the OSCE mission to Kosovo, Sandjak and Vojvodina\nin the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and\nMontenegro) resume its activities, in accordance with the\nrelevant resolution of the Security Council.\nThough the mandates of these OSCE missions vary,\nthey still point in the same direction, namely assisting the\nparties involved in finding a political solution to their\ndifferences on the basis of OSCE principles and\ncommitments. OSCE helps to monitor and verify cease-\nfire accords, supervise troop withdrawals, establish\nnegotiating structures and principles for talks on national\nreconciliation and respect for human rights and\nfundamental freedoms. It has to be added that in some\ncases the OSCE has to work hard to obtain the necessary\npolitical endorsement of the parties to engage in a\npeaceful and structured political process and offer mutual\nconcessions.\n11\n\n\nI wish to express our appreciation of the peace efforts\nin Bosnia and Herzegovina which, in this very city of New\nYork only two days ago, yielded the so-called \u201cfurther\nagreed basic principles\u201d. As its Chairman-in-Office, I can\nsee that it is extremely important that the Organization for\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe may soon find itself in\na new, important and challenging role as an active\nparticipant in the course of the implementation of the long-\nawaited Bosnian peace accords.\nIn making use of the mutually reinforcing capabilities\nof the United Nations and the OSCE, the Hungarian\nChairmanship-in-Office of the organization for 1995 is\ndetermined to strengthen both organizations. I remain\nconvinced that the further development of this cooperation\nin the vast area from Alaska to Kamchatka will, with the\nactive support of Members, bring us closer to the\nrealization of the noble ideals set forth in the Charter 50\nyears ago.\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me at the outset\nto extend to the President of the General Assembly the\nwarmest congratulations of the Greek Government on his\nelection to the presidency at this historic fiftieth session,\nwhich is a well-deserved tribute to his personal qualities\nand his distinguished international career. I would also\nlike to thank His Excellency Mr. Amara Essy for the\nhighly constructive and efficient manner in which he\nperformed his duties as President of the General\nAssembly during its forty-ninth session.\nI wish to take this opportunity to address my sincere\ncongratulations to the Secretary-General of the United\nNations, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, who is striving with\ncourage, energy, political will and vision for a new world\nin which law and ethics will prevail, and for the\nrestructuring of the Organization, so that it may meet the\nchallenges of our time. He has our full support in his\nefforts to fulfil his mission.\nLet me also welcome Palau, the new Member that\nhas been admitted to the United Nations this year. Its\npresence among us is a renewed expression of our\nOrganization\u2019s desire to welcome in its midst all those\nStates that undertake the commitment to adhere to the\n20\n\n\npurposes and principles set out in the United Nations\nCharter.\nThe Foreign Minister of Spain, in his capacity as\nPresident of the Council of the European Union, delivered\na statement earlier this week on behalf of the Union and its\nmember States. My Government fully subscribes to the\ncontent of that statement and of the memorandum of the\nUnion. I would like, however, to elaborate further on some\nissues which are of particular interest to my country.\nThis fiftieth session of the General Assembly provides\nus with an opportunity, not only for an annual exchange of\nviews between the States Members of the United Nations\non the state of international affairs, but also for the\ncelebration of a milestone in the life of the Organization.\nThis celebration should not, however, be just a token tribute\nto the great undertaking of 50 years ago. It is only natural\nthat, on this occasion, Governments should endeavour to\nanalyse the successes and failures of the United Nations\nover five decades, to ask themselves whether we have come\ncloser to fulfilling, in the practice of international relations,\nthe principles proclaimed in the Charter, and to look to the\nyears ahead in order to try to chart our new priorities in a\nrapidly changing world.\nThis Organization was brought into being by the\nvision, the hope and the determination of men and women\nwho experienced at first hand the lethal dangers of\nnationalism, economic depression, lost freedom and\ndevastating war \u2014 men and women who realized the need\nto create mechanisms that would allow States to embark\nupon a collective effort in dealing with a wide range of\ncomplex international issues.\nLooking back over the 50 years since the guns of the\nSecond World War fell silent, one notes with satisfaction\nthe valuable work performed by the United Nations as a\nforum for debate on matters of international concern, and\nas a centre for harmonizing the activities of States in the\neconomic, social, cultural and humanitarian fields.\nThe United Nations has played a vital role as a\nframework for the historical process of decolonization, by\nsecuring international recognition for the new countries and\nby helping them improve their economic and social\nconditions. It has defined human rights for the global\ncommunity. It has defeated the shameful practice of\napartheid. It has provided the basis for an intensive\ndevelopment of international law. It has monitored elections\nin countries where elections have seldom been held. It has\nassisted in the drafting of constitutions, and has trained\nindigenous police forces. It has moved forward consensus\non global problems such as disarmament, the\nenvironment, the status of women, human rights,\ndevelopment and many other fundamental issues.\nFurthermore, the specialized agencies of the United\nNations system have achieved major successes in their\ndifferent spheres of activity, and have provided invaluable\nhumanitarian and other assistance in distressed areas of\nthe world.\nDespite this creditable record, it is the shortcomings\nof the United Nations that receive the greatest attention.\nI will certainly not argue that the achievements of those\npast 50 years yield any ground whatsoever for\ncomplacency. However, while disappointment has been\nfrequently expressed at the Organization\u2019s performance,\nno credible alternative is offered by those who criticize it.\nMoreover, little regard is given to the innumerable\nconstraints under which it operates, as well as to the fact\nthat it can be only as effective as Governments allow it to\nbe. The United Nations has indeed structural deficiencies,\nwhich it urgently needs to overcome. But it is too often\na useful scapegoat for the mistakes, the failings and the\nunfulfilled promises of Member States.\nThe Secretary-General, in his highly acclaimed and\nvery timely report entitled \u201cSupplement to an Agenda\nfor Peace'\u201d, issued earlier this year, has underlined the\ngreat problems presented to the United Nations by the\nnew generation of post-cold-war conflicts, for which the\nOrganization was obviously unprepared. He has pointed\nout that, for instance, in the framework of its peace-\nkeeping activities, the Organization has had, in some\ncases, to juggle efforts to combine mandates, including\nthe use of force under Chapter VII of the Charter, with\nthe basic principle of neutrality and impartiality of the\nUnited Nations and the lack of adequate resources to\neffectively implement that mandate. In the same context,\nshortcomings in the unity of command which we have\nwitnessed in the case of some peace-keeping operations\nhave also contributed to undermining the effectiveness of\nUnited Nations action.\nThe financial crisis in general has also been\nparticularly debilitating as regards the activities of the\nOrganization in all areas. The Secretary-General has often\nquestioned the credibility of those Member States that\nsupport the ends, by actively participating in the decision-\nmaking process, but not the means, by failing to pay their\nassessed contribution. Nobody denies the fact that\nconsiderable progress can still be achieved with regard to\n21\n\n\nthe effective use of resources that are already available. But\nunless the necessary financial means are provided, it would\nbe folly to expect miracles from the Organization.\nEliminating waste and inefficiency, through better\nmanagement and accountability, essential though it may be,\nwill never be a substitute for ensuring adequate and regular\nfunding.\nThe increasing resort to, and use, of sanctions regimes\nhas brought to light another series of difficulties which have\nalso undermined the credibility of the United Nations. As\nthe Secretary-General pointed out in his report, the\nobjectives for which specific sanctions regimes were\nimposed and the criteria for their lifting have not been\nclearly defined, or have seemed to change over time, as has\nbeen the case for the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia\n(Serbia and Montenegro) and Iraq. This situation is all the\nmore worrying because experience has proved that the\nimposition of sanctions results in the infliction of\ntremendous suffering upon vulnerable groups of the\ntargeted country, rather than in the modification of the\nbehaviour of its Government.\nFurthermore, the role of those countries that shoulder\nthe main burden of the implementation of the sanctions\nregimes, despite the considerable collateral damage which\nthey suffer in terms of economic and social costs, needs, at\nlast, to be appropriately acknowledged, for their\ncontribution to the maintenance of international peace and\nsecurity is, in some cases, no less important than that of\ntroop-contributing countries. It should be clear that if, in the\nlong run, the difficulties of those Member States that have\nthe misfortune to be neighbours of the targeted countries\nare not dealt with in a satisfactory way, inter alia, through\nthe appropriate implementation of Article 50 of the Charter,\nthen general support for the use of sanctions as an effective\ninstrument will not be easily maintained.\nRegrettably, one would have to acknowledge that the\nprimary purpose of the United Nations \u2014 that of\nestablishing a pattern of world order and international\nsecurity \u2014 has been achieved to a much lesser degree than\nhad been expected, or is indeed required by the growing\nneeds of the international community. The threat and the\nuse of force are still a recurrent feature of international\nrelations, contrary to the expectations raised in 1945. The\nterritorial integrity or the sovereign rights of States are\nfrequently threatened or compromised by the practice of\npower politics, in contravention of the purposes and\nprinciples that govern our Organization.\nIn this context, allow me to observe that a charter is\nof value in so far as each member that subscribes to it\nconducts itself in accordance with the commitments it has\nundertaken of its own free will, without guile or\nreservations. It is also of paramount importance that the\nUnited Nations should not be perceived as resorting to\ndouble standards when it comes to military aggression\nand other blatant violations of international law.\nThe guiding principle of Greek foreign policy is the\nestablishment of good-neighbourly relations with all\ncountries of the region, on the basis of respect for\ninternational law, national sovereignty and human rights,\nand on non-interference in the internal affairs of other\nStates. This principle has always constituted the\ncornerstone of our foreign policy and applies fully to our\nrelations with neighbouring Turkey. It is the sincere wish\nof my Government that Greek-Turkish relations be\nnormalized, on the basis of the principles of international\nlaw and the relevant international treaties, and in\nconformity with the Charter of the United Nations, the\nHelsinki Document and the Charter of Paris for a New\nEurope. Greece has never raised any claims against\nTurkey. On the other hand, we have made it absolutely\nclear that we categorically reject any idea of\ncompromising our sovereign rights, which we are\ndetermined to protect by all legitimate means.\nUnfortunately, Turkey is following a different\napproach in its policies vis-\u00e0-vis our country. To cite just\none example, I wish to refer to the resolution adopted on\n8 June 1995 by the Turkish National Assembly,\nauthorizing the Turkish Government to use military force\nin case Greece exercised its legal right to expand its\nterritorial waters to 12 nautical miles, according to the\nUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. The\nsaid resolution was obviously endorsed by the Turkish\nGovernment, since it was forwarded to the Secretary-\nGeneral on 23 June 1995 in a letter addressed to him by\nthe Permanent Representative of Turkey to the United\nNations.\nTurkey is in fact attempting to intimidate Greece\ninto forfeiting a right acknowledged to all signatory\nparties, by article 3 of the United Nations Convention on\nthe Law of the Sea of 1982, and already exercised by a\nlarge number of States. Furthermore, it is beyond any\ndoubt that the above-mentioned resolution constitutes a\ndirect violation of Article 2, paragraph 4, of the Charter\nof the United Nations, which stipulates that\n22\n\n\n\u201cAll Members shall refrain in their international\nrelations from the threat or use of force against the\nterritorial integrity or political independence of any\nState\u201d,\nas well as of many similar provisions of international\ntreaties and conventions.\nIt is self-evident that an essential improvement of\nGreek-Turkish relations presupposes a just and lasting\nsolution of the Cyprus question and the re-establishment of\ninternational legality in Cyprus. Unfortunately, during the\nlast 21 years, the Turkish forces, defying a series of United\nNations resolutions, have occupied a large part of Cyprus,\ndespite the assiduous efforts of the Secretary-General. Their\ncontinuing presence has resulted in the division of the\nisland by force, the brutal violation of human rights and\nfreedoms, and the systematic plundering of the island\u2019s\ncultural and religious heritage.\nThe Greek Government strongly supports the efforts\nof the Secretary-General with a view to a just and viable\nsolution of the Cyprus problem, on the basis of the relevant\nSecurity Council resolutions, including the most recent one,\nresolution 939 (1994), which calls for a bi-communal and\nbi-zonal federal State of Cyprus with single sovereignty and\ninternational personality and single citizenship, with its\nindependence and territorial integrity safeguarded. The\nGreek Government believes that the prospect of the\naccession of Cyprus to the European Union, which was\nfurther promoted by concrete actions taken by the Union in\nthe course of 1995, will create conditions that would make\nit possible to tackle the current deadlock and, thus, assist\neffectively the Secretary-General\u2019s efforts for the reversal\nof the unacceptable status quo.\nOne should also bear in mind that no progress towards\na settlement is possible as long as the Turkish occupation\nforces remain on the island. The Greek Government\nconsiders the proposal for the total demilitarization of the\nisland, put forward by President Clerides, as most\nconstructive. It also feels that it is imperative that countries\nwhich are in a position to back the efforts of the Secretary-\nGeneral and wish to do so should exert the necessary\npressure so that the side which is responsible for the\nimpasse will be forced to abide by international law and\nUnited Nations resolutions.\nThe signing of the Interim Accord, on 13 September\n1995, in New York, constitutes an important step towards\nestablishing a new era in relations between Greece and the\nformer Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. It also paves the\nway for bilateral cooperation for their own benefit, as\nwell as for the sake of peace, cooperation, stability and\nprosperity throughout the Balkans, which has been so\naffected by the crisis in the former Yugoslavia.\nWe do hope that this preliminary significant step in\nthe relations between the two countries will lead to a\ndefinite settlement of the dispute over the name, which\nconstitutes the main difference existing between them and\nwhich will be dealt with in the context of further\nnegotiations, in accordance with the conventional\ncommitment of the parties concerned and the relevant\nSecurity Council resolutions.\nGreece attaches great importance to its relations with\nAlbania. For this reason, we constantly follow a policy of\ngood- neighbourliness and cooperation with that country\nand continue to support, in many ways, its efforts to\npromote political and economic reforms and thus\ncontribute to the establishment of a modern and\ndemocratic society.\nGreece has been offering substantial economic\nsupport to Albania, which has enabled it to face the many\ndifficult problems that arose after the former regime was\noverthrown. Today, Greek investments in Albania\ncontinue to contribute substantially to the country\u2019s\neconomic development and to the strengthening of its\nsocial stability.\nFurthermore, a large Greek minority lives in\nAlbania, contributing positively to the country\u2019s\ndevelopment. Under the previous regime, this minority\nwas subjected to persecution and harsh treatment. Greece\nis convinced that the Greek minority in Albania\nconstitutes a bridge of friendship between the two\ncountries and helps further their rapprochement and\ncooperation. For this reason, we believe that the human\nrights of the members of that minority should be fully\nrespected, so that they are able to stay in their homeland\nand live there in a safe environment. Moreover, they\nshould be proportionally represented in the administration,\nthe State institutions and the armed forces, and be\nallowed to exercise their religious and educational rights\nfreely and fully.\nUnfortunately, notwithstanding some improvements,\nconsiderable restrictions continue to apply to the free\nexercise of these rights, particularly in the field of\neducation. We sincerely hope that the Albanian\nGovernment, in conformity also with its international\n23\n\n\ncommitments, will secure full respect for the human rights\nof the Greek minority.\nDuring the current year, the tragedy of the former\nYugoslavia has continued to unfold relentlessly, imposing\ntremendous suffering and hardships on the civilian\npopulation. Greece, as a country neighbouring the former\nYugoslavia, has been directly subjected to the negative\nconsequences of this bloody conflict, as regards both its\neconomy and its security.\nMy country has always advocated that, as has already\nbeen pointed out by the presidency of the European Union,\na fair and viable solution to the conflict in Bosnia can be\nfound only by political means, and not on the battlefields.\nThis is why from the beginning of the crisis we have\nspared no effort to ensure that all the parties involved\nmoved in the direction of trying to promote a peaceful\nsettlement, in cooperation with our European partners and\nRussia, which has played, and is to play, a significant role\nin this issue. Furthermore, the Greek Government fully\nsupports the current diplomatic initiative and the ongoing\nnegotiating process based on the Contact Group plan.\nRecently, there have been encouraging developments\nregarding the future shape of things in the former\nYugoslavia. The parties have begun to show signs of\nrapprochement and willingness to talk. Thus, we warmly\nwelcome the Basic Principles, agreed in Geneva on 8\nSeptember 1995, and the Further Basic Principles, agreed\nthree days ago in New York, which are very important\nsteps on the long and difficult road to peace. Much remains\nto be done, but if the parties display the necessary political\nwill and with the assistance of the international community\na comprehensive and viable peaceful settlement should no\nlonger be a fictitious objective, whose attainment would\ntake a very long time.\nGreece, for its part, is ready to contribute to the\nfulfilment of this objective through the good relations that\nit has developed with all the parties involved in the conflict.\nFurthermore, my country, fully aware of the intricacies of\nthe Balkans and having actively participated in the\ninitiatives for regional economic cooperation, will do its\nutmost, both on a national basis and in the framework of\nthe European Union, to promote efforts aiming at the\nreconstruction of the former Yugoslavia.\nConcerning the situation in the Middle East, Greece\nconsiders as a matter of utmost importance the early and\nunimpeded implementation of the recent Erez and Taba\nAgreements and the speedy conclusion of the talks on\nredeployment and elections, together with the solution of\nthe two outstanding problems, namely security for all, and\nsocial and economic development.\nWe welcome the signature yesterday in Washington\nby Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)\nof the interim agreement on the second stage of\nPalestinian autonomy, which constitutes additional proof\nof determination and political courage. We congratulate\nthe Israeli Government and Chairman Arafat on their\ncommitment to peace.\nGreece believes that the international community\nmust exert consistent efforts, in which we are willing to\nactively participate, aiming at the creation of a solid basis\nfor the political and economic survival of the Palestinian\nNational Authority, thereby providing a source of hope\nfor the Palestinian people.\nGreece is of the view that the peace process could\nbe substantially promoted if the States of the region\ndirectly involved in it joined forces with those actively\nparticipating, and we welcome all recent indications to\nthis effect. The peoples of the region should be\nguaranteed a secure life, within internationally recognized\nand safe boundaries.\nWe urge the implementation of Security Council\nresolution 425 (1978) on Lebanon.\nGreece, which has actively participated in the Middle\nEast peace process since it began in Madrid, will continue\nto offer full support and assistance to the bilateral and\nmultilateral negotiations towards a comprehensive, final\nand just peace.\nGreece believes that an increase in the number of\nmembers of the Security Council has become an\nimperative necessity. Such an increase, which should be\nmoderate so as not to undermine the effectiveness of the\nCouncil\u2019s action, must reflect the current number of\nStates that are Members of the United Nations, the\nrealities of the new international situation and an\nequitable distribution among all existing regional groups.\nWhile recognizing that any formal definition of criteria\nfor new permanent members could not be easily\nformulated, we consider that new members of this\ncategory should be selected from among States that exert\na major influence in world affairs and are in a position to\nmake an essential contribution to the maintenance of\ninternational peace and security.\n24\n\n\nGreece welcomes the indefinite extension of the\nNuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and the commitment made\nby the States parties to its universalization and full\nimplementation. We emphasize the importance of\nstrengthening the review process and adopting a set of\nprinciples and objectives for non-proliferation and\ndisarmament. We also stress the need to complete without\ndelay comprehensive and verifiable treaties to ban nuclear-\nweapon tests and to cut off the production of fissile\nmaterial for nuclear weapons and other nuclear explosive\ndevices.\nWe are deeply concerned at the continued dangers\nposed by the excessive transfer of conventional arms, and\nwe support putting the United Nations Register fully into\neffect. Furthermore, the continuing injuries to civilians\ncaused by anti-personnel mines demonstrate the need to\nstrengthen multilateral controls in this regard.\nGrowing economic and social gaps breed violence.\nThe need to bridge the differences between rich and poor,\nboth between nations and within nations, is of the utmost\nimportance for our efforts and opportunities to preserve\npeace. This fundamental truth was recognized and stressed\nby the founders of the United Nations and, subsequently, by\nall members of the Organization, who pledged to \u201cemploy\ninternational machinery for the promotion of the economic\nand social advancement of all peoples\u201d.\nIn responding to the changing needs of the\nincreasingly interdependent world economy, we have to\nreinforce the coherence and effectiveness of the competent\ninternational institutions and to complete without delay our\nconsideration of the \u201cAgenda for Development\u201d, thus\nsetting out a new impetus to international cooperation in\nthis field and defining the particular contribution expected\nof the United Nations system.\nThere is an increasing realization worldwide that in\nmajor denials of human rights, which breed antagonisms\nand deep resentments, there lie the seeds of international\ndiscord as surely as in the clashes of economic rivalries and\nterritorial ambitions. In this regard, Greece strongly\ncondemns all forms of discrimination and intolerance, and\nreaffirms its full support for the United Nations High\nCommissioner for Human Rights and his coordinating role\nthroughout the United Nations system, as well as for the\nstrengthening of the Centre for Human Rights. The\nprinciples of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,\nand also those of the Vienna Declaration and Programme of\nAction, as well as of the other international acts and\ninstruments, should guide the actions of all Member\nStates in this respect on a daily basis.\nIndustrialization and the technological revolution,\nwhile bringing benefits to the human race, have also\ngiven rise to side effects, namely the problems of the\ndevastation of the natural environment. In this context, the\nimportance of meeting the commitments we made at the\n1992 Rio Earth Summit, and the need to review and\nstrengthen them, where appropriate, cannot be\noverstressed. Strengthening national institutions\nresponsible for environmental management, and\nsupporting international organizations that focus on\nenvironmental issues, will be vital in maintaining and\nincreasing the momentum for the protection and the\nimprovement of the environment.\nTroops and civilian personnel engaged in United\nNations peace-keeping and humanitarian activities have\nbeen carrying out their most important tasks under\nconditions of extraordinary personal risk, and very often\nat the expense of their own lives. I would like to\ncondemn, in the strongest possible terms, the abhorrent\nand unacceptable harassment of and attacks against\nUnited Nations peace-keepers, to whose relentless courage\nand determination we pay tribute. I should also like to\nstress the need for measures which will ensure their\nsecurity, including the early entry into force of the\nrecently adopted Convention for the Safety of United\nNations and Associated Personnel.\nThese past 50 years of United Nations existence\nhave been a time of unparalleled human advancement and\nof the fundamental enlargement of human expectations.\nAs I see it, it will be the principal task of the\nOrganization, which has done so much to give voice to\nthose expectations, to take the lead in bringing them ever\ncloser to realization.\nGreece, as a small country, has always had a strong\nvested interest in the strengthening of the common\ncapacity to deal with threats to international peace and\nsecurity and, in general, in the success of the United\nNations. The Greek people will always be supportive of\na collective approach to global and regional problems. For\nmy part, I can only reaffirm our resolve to extend our full\ncooperation to the efforts of the Organization as it strives\nfor the realization of its noble objectives, and our\ncontinued dedication to its purposes and principles.\n\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, my Foreign Minister has asked me\nto read out his statement on his behalf.\n\u201cMr. President, it gives me great pleasure to\ncongratulate you upon your election to the important\npost of President of this historic fiftieth session of the\nGeneral Assembly. I am confident that, under your\nskilful leadership, the General Assembly will write\none more significant page in the chronicles of the\nUnited Nations. I should also like to express my\ngratitude to your distinguished predecessor, Mr.\nAmara Essy, for his valuable contribution to the work\nof the General Assembly at its forty-ninth session.\n\u201cI should like to express particular words of\ngratitude to the Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros\nBoutros-Ghali, for his tireless efforts to strengthen\npeace on Earth.\n\u201cWe have gathered here on this fiftieth\nanniversary year of the existence of the United\nNations, understanding as we do the tremendous\nsignificance of the role played by our Organization\nin the world today. All progressive people welcomed\nthe end of the cold war, rightly believing that it\nwould lead to an easing of nuclear confrontation and\nan improvement of the political climate on the\nplanet. However, the dissolution of totalitarian\nsystems entailed the emergence of bloody armed\nconflicts and hot spots around the world.\n\u201cThe world has witnessed with tremendous\nalarm the continuing military confrontations and\ntension in the republics of the former Yugoslavia,\nTajikistan and the Nagorny Karabakh region of\nAzerbaijan.\n\u201cFor seven years now we have seen open\naggression from the Republic of Armenia against the\nAzerbaijan Republic. Twenty per cent of Azerbaijan\nterritory has been under occupation by the armed\nforces of the Republic of Armenia. More than one\nmillion Azerbaijanis have been forcibly driven from\ntheir homes. A serious hotbed of tension has been\ncreated in the region and threatens international\npeace and security.\n\u201cThe Security Council has adopted four\nresolutions on the Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict in\nwhich it called upon the aggressor to withdraw,\nimmediately and totally, from the occupied\nterritories. However, the Republic of Armenia has\ncompletely ignored compliance with the resolutions\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\n\nand as a Member of the United Nations is, in effect,\nrefusing to follow the decisions of one of its major\norgans.\n\u201cAlmost a year has elapsed since the adoption in\nBudapest by the Heads of State and Government,\nmembers of the Organization for Security and\nCooperation in Europe (OSCE), of a decision\nappointing the co-chairmen of the Minsk Conference\non the settlement of the Armenian-Azerbaijan conflict\ndesigned to ensure the signing of a major political\nagreement the realization of which should eliminate all\nthe consequences of the conflict. However, in this case\nthe Republic of Armenia is pursuing a policy of\nputting forward obviously unacceptable conditions and\nattempting to impose provisions which would impose\nin advance a political status on the Nagorny Karabakh\nregion of the Republic of Azerbaijan. Here we are\nfaced with attempts to intimidate us with the\npossibility of the undermining of the peace-keeping\noperation in the region. It is, to say the least, unethical\nto accuse the victim of aggression, of not being\nwilling to compromise on the problem of the\nliberation of its occupied territories.\n\u201cAzerbaijan, for its part, is continuously\ndisplaying its readiness for constructive cooperation\nwith the mediators in order to bring about a peaceful\nsettlement of the Armenian-Azerbaijan conflict.\n\u201cWe have repeatedly expressed ourselves in\nfavour of a multinational peace-keeping operation of\nthe OSCE for the maintenance of peace on the border\nbetween Azerbaijan and Armenia and in the region as\na whole.\n\u201cAt the present time discussions are taking place\non the mandate and parameters of the peace-\nkeeping operations of that Organization. In connection\nwith the fact that the peace-keeping operation in our\nregion will be the first to be carried out by the OSCE,\nAzerbaijan has agreed to the provision of technical\nexpert consultative assistance from the United Nations\nfor the success of this operation.\n\u201cAzerbaijan shares the general understanding that\npeace-keeping operations should be viewed as\ntemporary in nature and should be used to promote a\nclimate to facilitate the settlement of a particular\nproblem. At the same time, however, we must not lose\nsight of the fact that settlement is the ultimate goal. In\nimplementing any peace-keeping operation we must\nstrictly abide by the principles contained in the\nUnited Nations Charter, particularly the principles of\nrespect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of\nStates and non-intervention in internal affairs.\n\u201cPeace-keeping operations must be based on an\nappropriate mandate drawn up with the consent of\nall the parties involved, and they must be impartial,\nobjective and neutral in character. Azerbaijan agrees\nwith the current and established international\npractice under which the military contingent of any\ncountry participating in a given peace-keeping\noperation should not exceed 30 per cent of the total\nfor the force. It is also important for the\ninternational organs involved in peace-keeping\noperations to furnish all available information to\nStates and to keep world public opinion informed of\nthe progress of the operation.\n\u201cThe settlement of the conflict between\nArmenia and Azerbaijan entails strict compliance\nwith these principles. Failing the liberation of all\nAzerbaijani territory occupied by Armenia, there can\nbe no question of any comprehensive settlement of\nthis conflict. Restoration of the territorial integrity of\nthe Republic of Azerbaijan and the return of\nrefugees and displaced persons to their homes in\naccordance with international practice are the only\nbases on which a solution can be found to the\nproblem of the Armenian national minority\npopulation in Azerbaijan.\n\u201cIn the context of a settlement of the\nArmenian-Azerbaijani conflict I should also like to\ndraw attention to the principle of the right of peoples\nto self-determination, a principle that the Republic of\nArmenia is flouting. The world has not yet found a\nworkable balance between the principle of the right\nof peoples to self-determination, on the one hand,\nand the principle of the sovereignty and territorial\nintegrity of States, on the other. Nevertheless, it is\nclear that the right to self-determination, as\ncontained in the Charter, is not intended to furnish\na pretext for flouting the principle of independence\nand territorial integrity.\n\u201cThe Republic of Azerbaijan, now a full-\nfledged member of the world community, has\nundertaken to abide by all universally recognized\nnorms and principles of international law in its\nrelations with other States. The Republic of\nArmenia, however, has persistently attempted to use\n2\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\n\nthe principle of the right of peoples to self-\ndetermination as a pretext to legitimize and\nconsolidate its territorial claims and to justify its\naggression against Azerbaijan and its occupation of\nAzerbaijani territory. Indeed, the expansionist circles\nin Armenia have been implementing such a policy for\nyears. In 1988, when the Soviet Union was still in\nexistence, the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic\nexpelled its Azerbaijani population \u2014 some 200,000\npersons, a national minority. Immediately following\nthat inhuman decision, the Parliament of Armenia,\nacting counter to all the norms and principles of\ninternational law, approved Armenia\u2019s annexation of\nthe Nagorny Karabakh region of Azerbaijan \u2014 in\nother words, it decided to annex a part of the territory\nof a neighbouring State.\n\u201cSubsequently, 50,000 persons were expelled\nfrom the Nagorny Karabakh region, whose total\npopulation numbered 170,000, with the financial and\nmilitary support of the Republic of Armenia. In\naddition, Armenian armed forces were used to\nconsolidate the annexation of the Lachin and Shusha\ndistricts of Azerbaijan, through which the Republic of\nArmenia maintains direct communication with the\nNagorny Karabakh region of the Republic of\nAzerbaijan. Through this corridor, cynically referred\nto as a humanitarian corridor, a river of weapons,\nammunitions and human resources flows from the\nRepublic of Armenia. Some 20 per cent of the\nterritory of Azerbaijan is now occupied by Armenian\narmed forces. Again, this armed expansion is\naccompanied by a thorough ethnic cleansing' of the\noccupied Azerbaijani territories and a scorched-earth\npolicy.\n\u201cThe world community must condemn the\nactions of Armenia in Azerbaijan and call for the full\nand unconditional withdrawal of the Armenian armed\nforces from the occupied territories and for the return\nof refugees and displaced persons to their homes. This\nis clearly a case in which we are witnessing a total\ndisregard for the provision of the United Nations\nCharter that calls upon all Member States\nto refrain in their international relations from\nthe threat or use of force against the territorial\nintegrity or political independence of any State,\nor in any other manner inconsistent with the\nPurposes of the United Nations.'\nWorld public opinion must not be misled as to the\ntrue motives for the actions of Armenia, which is\ncloaking its aggression against Azerbaijan in the\nlofty principle of the right of peoples to self-\ndetermination.\n\u201cArmenia\u2019s aggression against Azerbaijan has\ncaused enormous suffering and grief to the whole of\nthe Azerbaijani people, who have been forced by the\nmilitary actions and occupation of the Armenian\narmed forces to leave their homes, abandon their\nproperty and flee in order to avoid falling into the\nhands of the occupiers. The Azerbaijani Government\nhas been forced to convert many schools, dwellings,\nsanatoriums and rest homes into housing for\nrefugees and displaced persons. In the territory of\nAzerbaijan, people are forced to take refuge in tent\ncities. The normal life of the country has been\nalmost totally destroyed.\n\u201cWe are grateful to the countries and\ninternational and non-governmental organizations\nthat have lent active humanitarian assistance to\nAzerbaijan. The United Nations too has played an\nimportant role in this assistance. The activities of the\n1995-1996 humanitarian programmes, as presented\nin the United Nations consolidated inter-agency\nhumanitarian assistance appeal for the Caucasus,\ninclude relief projects in the food, non-food, shelter,\neducation and health sectors. However, as the\nSecretary-General indicates in his annual report on\nthe work of the Organization, only 37 per cent, or\n$12.8 million, of the requirements pledged for\nhumanitarian activities in Azerbaijan had been\nreceived as at 31 July 1995. Other projects carried\nout under the aegis of the United Nations have\naddressed capacity-building and the transition from\nemergency assistance to development.\n\u201cAzerbaijan has always attached great\nimportance to multifaceted cooperation with the\nUnited Nations system in the spheres of social and\neconomic development. Following the dissolution of\nthe USSR our country was confronted with the task\nof radically restructuring the Azerbaijani economy\non a free-market basis. No country can be expected\nto undertake such a radical restructuring unilaterally\nwithout the active cooperation of international\norganizations, and Azerbaijan has been no exception.\nSo far, we can point with some satisfaction to the\ncontinued cooperation between the Government of\nAzerbaijan and such important international financial\n3\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\n\ninstitutions as the International Monetary Fund and the\nInternational Bank for Reconstruction and\nDevelopment. We have had considerable success in\nstabilizing the exchange rate of the manat, our national\ncurrency. The Government of Azerbaijan has received\napproval of sizeable loans to assist in a number of\nmajor infrastructure projects and for drilling and\ntransporting oil.\n\u201cAlthough the majority of the contacts between\nAzerbaijan and the United Nations system have been\nsuccessful, we must nevertheless mention some\ncurrent problems. We have not yet been able to\nresolve the question of a proper scale for Azerbaijan\u2019s\ncontribution to the regular budget of the Organization\nthat would reflect my country\u2019s real ability to pay.\n\u201cIn Azerbaijan\u2019s brief period of independence\nsome important changes have occurred. The Republic\nof Azerbaijan has begun to build its free democratic\nsociety on the basis of a market economy. We shall\ncontinue to pursue that path. It goes without saying,\nhowever, that the transition from one social and\neconomic system to another requires a certain amount\nof time and very careful and meticulous work.\n\u201cWe need fundamental changes in many aspects\nof the life of the Republic, and corresponding changes\nin the thinking of our people. After long stagnation,\nthe people have achieved civic freedom; now, they\nmust understand that freedom. This is one of our most\nimportant areas of activity. A certain amount of\nprogress has been made with respect to the political\nlife of Azerbaijan. The principles of political\npluralism, personal freedoms and freedom of\nexpression, of the press and of conscience are\nguaranteed. Human rights are effectively protected. A\nmulti-party system is at work. We consistently act on\nthe principle of the primacy of law. Irrespective of sex\nor national, religious, ethnic or linguistic affiliation,\ncitizens of Azerbaijan enjoy equal rights.\n\u201cAzerbaijan\u2019s highest legislative body, the Milli\nMajlis, has adopted a new electoral law, which is a\nmilestone in the development of a democratic society\nin our country. This law is a further example of how\nAzerbaijan is proceeding with the building of a\ndemocratic civil society. Parliamentary elections in\nAzerbaijan are scheduled for 12 November this year;\nthis confirms our unswerving policy of strengthening\nindependence and sovereignty. Many countries and\nmajor international organizations, including the United\nNations, the Organization for Security and\nCooperation in Europe and others, have already\nagreed to act as observers of the elections. I take\nthis opportunity to invite States Members of the\nUnited Nations to send observers to the elections in\nAzerbaijan.\n\u201cIn the social and economic sphere, our\npurposeful reforms in the political area and towards\na democratic society have made it possible to create\nthe preconditions for economic and social change,\nwhich is proceeding with success in our country and\nwhich is laying the foundation for an early transition\nto market relationships. The Republic has achieved\na certain stabilization of macro-economic indicators\nand is doing all it can to encourage the development\nof free enterprise. We have begun a conscientious\nprogramme of privatization. Inflation, which had in\nprevious years reached 30 to 35 per cent per month,\nhas now been reduced to near zero. We appeal to\nthe international community and to foreign\nbusinesses to increase their investment in the\neconomy of Azerbaijan. We have created all the\nproper conditions for profitable activities by foreign\ncompanies. International consortiums are stepping up\ntheir activities; in addition to the Azerbaijan State oil\ncompany, these include major transnational\ncorporations. These activities are aimed at joint\nexploration and development of oil and gas deposits\nin the Azerbaijan sector of the Caspian Sea.\n\u201cThe 50 years of the United Nations have\nshown that the peoples of the world can achieve a\ngreat deal when they combine their efforts and their\nwill to defend world peace and to achieve the\nprosperity of peoples. We know that it was concern\nwith preventing another world war that ordained the\nfoundation of the United Nations, and this remains\nthe main task before mankind today. For war annuls\nall that the efforts of peoples have achieved.\u201d\n"

        "file_text": "I should like to begin by\ncongratulating you, Sir, on your election to the presidency\nof the General Assembly at its fiftieth session. At the\nsame time, I wish to thank your predecessor,\nHis Excellency Mr. Amara Essy.\nWe are meeting this year at a crucial moment in the\nhistory of the United Nations. The fiftieth anniversary of\nthe Organization should be an occasion on which to\nreview the first half-century of the United Nations, but\nalso, first and foremost, to prepare the Organization for its\nfuture activities and to address the manifold challenges\nthat are ahead of us.\nWhile we commemorate the United Nations fiftieth\nanniversary, Liechtenstein is celebrating its fifth year of\nmembership in the Organization. When Liechtenstein was\nadmitted to the United Nations, the global situation was\nundergoing fundamental changes. People around the world\nhoped that the Organization would be able to work in a\ncomprehensive and more efficient way towards fulfilling\nthe purposes assigned to it under the Charter. Many of\nthese hopes have remained unfulfilled. The optimism that\nprevailed at the beginning of the post-cold-war era has\nturned into sometimes heavy criticism and a decreasing\nconfidence in the work of the United Nations. This\ncriticism is not always justified and is sometimes based\non a lack of understanding of the functioning of the\nUnited Nations or, more often, on a one-sided approach\nto its activities.\nThe achievements of the Organization in the areas of\ndevelopment, humanitarian assistance, the promotion and\nprotection of human rights and the strengthening and\nfurther development of international law, to name only a\nfew, are unique and undeniable. However, it remains a\nfact that events of the recent past have undermined the\ncredibility of the United Nations in the eyes of many\npeople, and we have to make every effort to restore and\nenhance the confidence of the peoples that we represent.\nWe must only look back in order to make the best use of\nthe experience we have acquired over the past 50 years\nand to enable the Organization to respond effectively to\nthe new challenges it faces today.\nThe financial situation of the Organization is beyond\nany doubt one of the issues that need to be addressed\nurgently. After many years of serious financial problems,\nwe have reached a stage where the work of the United\nNations itself is in jeopardy. Drastic measures had to be\ntaken recently to guarantee the continuation of its daily\nwork. It is of the utmost importance, however, that no\n9\nGeneral Assembly 22nd plenary meeting\nFiftieth session 13 October 1995\nmeasures be taken which affect the nature and the\nefficiency of United Nations activities, which are urgently\nneeded. The efforts to improve and to monitor the\nadministrative and management capabilities must be\ncontinued and further enhanced. All Member States have to\npay their assessed contributions fully and on time if a\ndurable solution to the current crisis is to be found. We are\nconfident that the Working Group that you, Mr. President,\nwill be chairing, will produce fruitful results.\nThe increasing financial burden that peace-keeping\noperations impose on national budgets must be alleviated.\nWe are of the opinion that a proliferation of peace-keeping\noperations has to be avoided, and I wish to emphasize that\nthe concept of preventive diplomacy deserves even more\nattention than it has received until now.\nIt is obvious that the world has changed. It is also\nobvious that the challenges for the United Nations have\nchanged. For these reasons, changes have to be made\nwithin the Organization in order to enable it to cope with\nthese challenges. We therefore support the efforts to reform,\nmodernize and restructure the United Nations and welcome\nthe process that has been initiated to that effect.\nMany people wrongly identify the United Nations only\nwith the activities of and the decisions taken by the\nSecurity Council. While we must work together in order to\npromote understanding and knowledge of other United\nNations activities, which are equally important, we also\nhave to understand that issues of international peace and\nsecurity directly or emotionally affect people all over the\nworld. We therefore have to make every effort to enhance\nthe effectiveness and the credibility of the work of the\nCouncil. A limited expansion of the permanent and non-\npermanent membership and improved working methods, as\nwell as enhanced transparency, would certainly make an\nimportant contribution in this respect. As a small country,\nwe follow the activities of the pertinent Working Group\nwith particular interest. We are of the view that the work\ndone so far has been very substantial. However, many of\nthe sensitive questions require further discussions.\nLiechtenstein, like many other countries, has to rely on\nthe universal respect for international law. The United\nNations has made remarkable contributions to the further\ndevelopment and strengthening of international law. The\nadoption of new legal instruments in important areas,\nhowever, sharply conflicts with continued and sometimes\nsystematic violations of international law, particularly in the\nfield of human rights, and of international humanitarian\nlaw. The establishment of the international ad hoc Tribunals\nfor the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda can prove to be an\nimportant element in preventing the recurrence of such\nviolations. It is essential that, for the first time since the\nTribunals of Nuremberg and of Tokyo, individuals be\nheld responsible for violations of international\nhumanitarian law. We hope that the work of these\nTribunals will be effective and will contribute to the early\nestablishment of a permanent international criminal court.\nThe Liechtenstein Government welcomes the historic\ndecision to make the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\nNuclear Weapons (NPT) permanent. We have come one\nstep closer to the overall elimination of nuclear weapons,\nand we express our most fervent hope that the NPT will\nvery soon become universal. We therefore appeal to those\nStates which have not yet ratified the Treaty to do so\nurgently. We further express our hope that the next step\nwill be the early conclusion of a comprehensive nuclear\ntest-ban treaty. Liechtenstein deplores the fact that nuclear\ntests are still going on and urges all nuclear-weapon\nStates to refrain from any further testing.\nOne of the most remarkable and uncontested merits\nof the United Nations in its first 50 years lies in the field\nof self-determination. While some people seem to think\nthat these activities of the Organization are a closed\nchapter that belongs to the past, others, including the\nGovernment of Liechtenstein, are of the view that the\npotential of the right to self-determination has not been\nexhausted and offers possibilities to cope with many\nconflict situations all over the world. We are convinced\nthat the right to self-determination deserves further\ndiscussion and development within the United Nations.\nLiechtenstein has therefore, within the framework of its\nnational activities for the commemoration of the fiftieth\nanniversary, organized two international conferences this\nyear dedicated to this subject. We hope that we can\ncontinue to count on the Organization\u2019s interest in this\nmatter, which is of crucial importance for the fulfilment\nof its purposes.\nThe Fourth World Conference on Women, which\nconcluded in Beijing three weeks ago, reaffirmed that the\nhuman rights of women and of the girl child are an\nintegral part of universal human rights. The Liechtenstein\nGovernment welcomes the fact that the Conference agreed\non a wide range of measures to remove the remaining\nobstacles to women\u2019s full and equal participation in all\nspheres of life. The Beijing Declaration and Platform for\nAction contain a comprehensive plan for the international\ncommunity to promote the status of women, to the\nultimate benefit of society as a whole. It gives me\n10\nGeneral Assembly 22nd plenary meeting\nFiftieth session 13 October 1995\npleasure to announce that the Convention on the\nElimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women\nhas recently been submitted to the Liechtenstein Parliament\nfor approval.\nThe fiftieth anniversary cannot be an occasion for self-\ncongratulation. However impressive the achievements,\nhowever disappointing the failures, one thing is certain:\nthere is no alternative to the United Nations, and all\nMember States have to work together to make the\nOrganization stronger and more efficient. The Government\nof Liechtenstein remains committed to this goal.\n"

        "file_text": "Everything that could be said has been said\nduring this annual routine, in which each Head of State or\nGovernment, or Minister, stands before the United Nations\nGeneral Assembly. If all the speeches were to be published\nin a compendium, the same universal themes would be\nrepeated a thousand times.\nThe compendium would include the great, insoluble\nproblems that, to various degrees, afflict the peoples of\nevery continent, as well as the solutions that have already\nbeen found, and the promised solutions implicit in the\nconstant efforts of this Organization, which, like any other\nhuman endeavour, has lived through 50 years of triumphs\nand frustration.\nWe must rejoice that, thanks to the Organization\u2019s\nvigilance and action, we have enjoyed \u2014 as never\nbefore \u2014 half a century of peace, although we lament the\nfact that we must now deploy efforts against violence born\nof intolerance, fanaticism and ethnic or religious strife that\nfrustrate the achievement of the harmony for which\nmankind yearns.\nAlongside the impressive achievements of the world\ncommunity, these 50 years have also seen numerous local\nconflicts that have taken 23 million lives. Eighty seven per\ncent of the weapons sold and used in the world come from\nthe five countries that are permanent members of the\nSecurity Council. And, unbelievable as it might seem, at\nthis stage of our political evolution, two atomic Powers\nare causing anxiety with inexplicable nuclear tests for\nwhich we criticized other Powers.\nBut who can deny that in the fields of health,\ntechnology, environment, human rights, communications,\nthe exploitation of the resources of the seas and many\nother fields, there is progress and hope, and at least a\nwarning that awakens the universal conscience?\nToday\u2019s statement by the Foreign Minister of\nVenezuela will be no different. Political scenarios change,\nas do ideologies, the most extraordinary crisis in history\nerupts, but life\u2019s dramas continue, with man bruised by\nchange, but for the first time wavering between hope and\nbewilderment. This situation results from the fact that we\nhave rushed from one era to another without the\ndemolition caused by war, although we have had the\nenthusiastic and confident contribution of students and\nworkers, who have devoted their free time to making it.\nWe note hardly any curiosity about the era we are\napproaching, an era as yet unnamed, though soon to be\nupon us it could be called anything: \u201cpost-capitalist\u201d,\n\u201cpost-socialist\u201d or \u201cpost-industrial\u201d; or it could simply be\ndescribed as a time of transition between two periods that\nour generations share.\nThere has been talk, of course, of the end of history,\nwith the end of ideological confrontation; that is precisely\nwhat makes history: incessant conflicts and passionate\nconfrontations, fears and hopes, freedom and deprivation\nof freedom, in any of the forms of oppression that have\nalways been applied.\nMan today has the vague feeling that he is in contact\nwith all other men through the miracle of the media, fibre\noptics, and cybernetic systems, and yet, now that there are\nmore human beings with whom solidarity may be felt,\nsolidarity is more precarious and man\u2019s loneliness is more\npoignant.\nTo create a different world based on a solid,\ncomplex and long-lasting Organization that has been\ntaking shape since the end of the First World War, we\nhave begun to talk \u2014 since we want words to describe\nwhat is going on \u2014 of globalization, of integration, of the\nabolition of the nation-State and its replacement by large\nblocs, in order to produce through strength of numbers\nand unity a new dynamic different from military might.\n8\n\n\nLet us suppose, then, that the world of the future will\nhave to be shaped according to regions, or large integrated\ngroups or communities, regional or otherwise, that have a\ncommon cultural origin and wish to be identified with the\nothers, because of the particular characteristics of their\nculture, such as tradition, language, religion and even mixed\nblood.\nThis is what strikes me, as I now appear for the first\ntime before so distinguished a forum to speak on behalf of\na country such as mine \u2014 a country with a modest\neconomy, a small population, a territory that is\nmedium-sized but which, owing to its excellent\ngeographical situation, developed more than others; a\nculture of social freedom, of mixed races and of political\nindependence, achieved by means of an epic struggle, not\nonly for itself but for all of its American neighbours. Mine\nis a country that has never been at war with anyone, a\ncountry whose desire to see its neighbours freed from\ncolonialism gave impetus to, and is inspiring, the brand-new\nCaribbean community, for instance. It is a country that, as\nwe have proved time and again, will support and promote\nany initiative aimed at pacification in the region, as we did\ntoday in the Group of Friends of Guatemala, for example,\nand when we welcomed the latest agreement between Israel\nand the Palestinians.\nVenezuela, like other countries, has been shaken \u2014 in\nour case since 1989 \u2014 by a severe crisis. Not so much\neconomic or political as ethical in nature, this crisis has\nweakened our institutions and undermined our financial\nsystem, the collapse of which cost us 16 per cent of our\ngross national product and has attracted the\nnot-always-understanding attention of international opinion.\nThis is the crisis that our Government inherited.\nAware that its characteristics are atypical in our region,\nsince its basic goal is to replace a paternalistic, oil-\ndependent model by an open culture based on work and\nself-reliance rather than on seeking the understanding of\nother countries, our Government is proceeding to solve our\nnation\u2019s problems, which, fortunately, are no match for our\ndiverse and solid economic resources.\nVenezuela is a country that has simultaneously \u2014 as\nif by magic \u2014 produced great thinkers, the most credible\nUtopians, the luckiest generals, the most visionary\neducators. My country, situated at the northern gate of\nSouth America, freed itself and other countries by following\nthe dreams of Francisco de Miranda, brought to fruition by\nSim\u00f3n Boliv\u00e1r and Antonio Jos\u00e9 de Sucre, by systematic\nthinking and by the actions of Andr\u00e9s Bello and Sim\u00f3n\nRodr\u00edguez, among other well-known figures.\nSim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar was clear-sighted. In that nebulous\nperiod of history that was the year 1815, he set out, from\nJamaica \u2014 in the most famous political document of this\npart of the world \u2014 a dazzling prophecy of what the\nideal destiny of Hispanic America was to be. To this day,\nno one can understand how he thought it up. He wrote:\n\u201cIt is a grandiose idea to try to make of the entire\nnew world a single nation, with only one link to\nbind and tie together all the parts to the whole.\u201d\nOnce independence was achieved, he foresaw that an\nimperfect and erratic unity, such as that of the South,\ncould be thrown off balance by the organization of the\nformer 13 American colonies, whose integration he\nalready anticipated. He also foresaw the power of the\nhard-working, driven race that would consolidate on the\nAmerican continent the formidable and admirable nation\nthat the United States has become, with its transcendent\nand unique feeling of liberty, since its founders left\nbehind all prejudices and fears.\nBol\u00edvar visualized uniting the American half that\nwas discovered, populated and moulded in all its aspects\nby Spain and Portugal, seeing it as one that must\nnecessarily have its own way of life and of behaving. His\nvision was never based on rivalry, but rather, in keeping\nwith his views on the destiny of this shared hemisphere,\non the basis of emulation and friendship instead of strife\nas its driving force.\nThe colonizing Powers contributed, and based this\nhalf of America on, all they had brought with them. They\nestablished a religion, a society reminiscent of the\noffspring of settlers, whose physical surroundings and\nindiscriminate crossbreeding gave rise to a feeling of\nunfettered freedom and equality. This, in turn, engendered\nirrevocably an equally free spirit of social democracy,\nwhich Latin America has never since lacked, not even\nduring the long periods when political democracy was\nnon-existent.\nIn 1826, Bol\u00edvar, the Liberator, convened the\nCongress of Panama to speak there, for the first time in\nhistory, not of sacred or profane alliances of war, but of\nalliances for peace. The thoughts he presented gave rise\nto the idea of an organized international community, first\nof all for the Americas, through the Pan-American Union,\nwhich in turn gave rise to the present Organization of\n9\n\n\nAmerican States (OAS), then to the League of Nations and\nfinally to this Organization, which has given humanity,\ntogether with peace, all the possibilities that peace offers.\nThis is an exceptional community, the largest in the\nworld, since it extends from the southern border of the\nUnited States all the way south to Patagonia, uniting the\ngreatest number of peoples and republics with similar\ncharacteristics. Here, the various languages spoken in Spain\nfortunately became one, revitalizing the Castilian tongue,\nand similarly, the Portuguese language, which in Brazil is\na language as open and soft as America itself. In the\nnorthernmost point of America, the imprint of France in\nCanada, as well as the Hispanic minority in the United\nStates, are living reminders of this community.\nIn geographical terms, we are larger than other official\ncommunities, since the United States\u2019 surface area covers\n9,372,000 square kilometres and Europe\u2019s covers\n10,404,000 square kilometres. But we cover 20,000,000\nsquare kilometres, and in these, the future of humanity is\npulsing.\nIn political and spiritual terms, we are history\u2019s largest\nlaboratory, at once a mystery and a promise \u2014 an absolute\nwonder that the future is revealing day by day. The seed of\na new world, different from our expectations, is growing\namong us.\nWe are not the only five hundred million human\nbeings to be allergic to the discrimination that will confront\nus in the year 2000. But we are the only human group to\nhave been born and moulded without privileges, hesitations\nor complexes, on an equal footing. Though this sense of\nequality was repressed for three centuries by pragmatic\nmeasures that were respected but not implemented, and by\nthe extreme zeal of monks who consulted no one in\nimposing a single faith on this immense geographical area,\nit was imbued with the spaciousness of the land, the rivers,\nthe forests, the gentle climate, the mountains and prairies,\nwhose influence produced a different type of human\ncharacter. And I would repeat that this deep feeling and\nsense of fundamental freedom was something that had\nnever happened to any other group of people.\nGerm\u00e1n Arciniegas rightly said that\n\u201cAmerica was colonized by a man who was destined\nto a life of servitude in Europe. He became\nemancipated when he crossed from one shore to the\nother ... These wretches worked the continent with\ntheir bare hands, they were the poor, the landless, the\nilliterate of the popular Renaissance. Uneducated,\nunenlightened, their common destiny was to join\ntogether to become nations and so achieve justice.\u201d\nAnd justice was the most absolute independence,\ninfluenced by American determinism.\nIn his sociologist\u2019s discourse, Bol\u00edvar said that we\nAmericans represent a small human race. We have now\nbecome an important branch of the broader human race:\nthe branch of possibilities and hope.\nOur region would not enter into conflict with any\nother; not even with the one with which it shares the\nhemisphere, and which speaks a different language and\nhas different customs. It will not be another international\nagency, or form another bureaucracy, or take up more\nroom than the enormous space of its present physical and\nhuman geography.\nIn other words, we aspire to a beautiful Utopia, with\nno other pragmatism than the pride of being a Utopia\nwith ever more solidarity; part of the universe with shared\nvalues, in search of the same destiny.\nIf other continents fashion communities around\nreligious, racial or geopolitical banners, it is natural that\nwe, Latin Americans, put forth ours with our own\nimmense, protean sense of unity.\nThere was a time, as we followed a different cultural\npattern, when we had a more orderly society and enjoyed\npolitical systems that brought us fame throughout the\nworld. Practically all Latin American countries\nexperienced a sort of golden age of culture and politics,\nmarked by originality. We created literature. We forged\nour own laws with our own institutions. We pioneered the\nLaw of the Sea; we produced the first system against\nnuclear weapons, with the Treaty of Tlatelolco.\nA concerted Latin American community of nations\nwould tend to recuperate and exchange training and\neducational systems capable of affirming our collective\npride and personality, as Europe has already done, despite\nthe diversity of its components, out of fear of the return\nof thousands of years of violence. Morally, the Latin\nAmerican community would be equal to the commercial\nand economic commitments made through ALADI, the\nLatin American Integration Association, as well as the\nAndean Pact, the Central American Common Market and\nMERCOSUR, all designed to form a front of solidarity\n10\n\n\nand a crucial link in the economic integration of the\nuniverse.\nA conscious Latin American community of nations\nwould guarantee the sustainable development of the world\u2019s\nmost varied and richest ecological systems, and would\nconceive not only of the larger spaces, but also of the\nimportance of drinking water, of mining resources, and of\nthe most varied and richest flora and fauna on the face of\nthe earth.\nOf course, we bring before the United Nations the\nmany concerns that we have expressed about the fate of our\nOrganization which, in its 50 years of arbitrating peace, has\ncharted a new path for the peoples it represents. These\nconcerns have prompted talk of reforming the Charter, in\norder for the Security Council, for instance, to take up and\nrepresent new geopolitical realities, and not only military\nmight. This is the spirit in which my country, through the\nvoice of its President, Rafael Caldera, has realistically and\nfrankly proposed that Brazil be the permanent\nrepresentative of Latin America in an enlarged Security\nCouncil. We have also spoken of the justification of\nagencies and powers, to make the cost of peace less\nburdensome; of the urgent need to adapt the Economic and\nSocial Council to the necessities of our time, as well as the\nCouncil for Culture, Science and Technology, that is still\nthe monopoly of industrialized centres. If a common market\nfor technology were to be established, we would be truly\nkeeping pace with history.\nIn America, although less than in Africa and Asia, we\ntoo are disturbed by the growing marginalization, the social\ninjustice, the poverty bordering on famine, the insecurity\nexacerbated by the trade in illicit drugs and its\nconsequences, which we witness. We produce terrible drugs\nin ever greater quantities to satisfy the voracity of the\nconsumer markets. But, at the same time, we fight this\nscourge with the greatest tenacity and determination.\nOur community has had the virtue of becoming\npractically a breeding ground for democracy, thanks to the\nsteadfastness of its leaders and thinkers, as well as of the\noldest but least championed regional organization. We must\nnow see to it that democracy is purged of its dishonesty,\nand is cleansed. To this end, at the Hemispheric Summit in\nMiami, my Government proposed, with unanimous support,\nto put a stop to the impunity of corruption.\nWe consider that drug trafficking and political\ncorruption are linked together by money laundering, under\nthe cover of electoral contributions.\nIf democracy is to acquire a new respectability, it\nwill be thanks to the common, concerted effort of\nAmerica; an effort which this world Organization will\nalso be called upon to make in the near future. That is\nbecause political corruption, a manifestation of the\nuniversal mafia, is not exclusive to our region and must\nbe fought at the global level, just like illicit drug\ntrafficking.\nVery shortly, a world congress against corruption\nwill be held in China, doubtless inspired by our example.\nWe hold out great expectations for that congress. Indeed,\nwe are keenly interested in anything that is sponsored and\nadvanced by this Organization.\nBut I wanted to put before the Assembly the\nsomewhat romantic idea of a Latin American Utopia, that\nit might inspire confidence in our neighbours in this\nhemisphere and hope in all other regions, whether on an\norganized basis or not. This is the spirit in which the Rio\nGroup has endorsed the oft-repeated proposal for a Latin\nAmerican Parliament.\nSince the first Great War there has been a\ndislocation in Europe, which conveyed itself through\nSpain and Portugal; its aesthetic sense of life and\nexistence through Italy; its modes of thought and\nphilosophy through France; its political models through\nGreat Britain and its lasting technologies through\nGermany. A regrettable dislocation occurred between\nEurope and Latin America, which is truly its most\nkindred continent, where we live as distant cousins, and\nstill the most vibrant and promising offshoot of this\nlineage.\nIf we underscore the need to encourage this idea of\nour community, it is because it exists, in fact, although it\nis now beset with social problems that require combined\ntreatment. It also has a legalist existence, since States\nsuch as Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Uruguay and\nVenezuela have incorporated it into their political\nconstitutions.\nThe greatest tragedy of Latin America is its social\ncondition, because of the imbalances characteristic of any\nlarge society \u2014 irregularities in family patterns,\ndeficiencies in education, the destruction of homes due to\na lack of ethics \u2014 even housing, which was never one of\nour biggest problems, has become one, because it is\nlinked to a sense of ethics at the family level. They are\ninseparably linked.\n11\n\n\nWe could say, along with Arturo Uslar Pietri that,\ncaught as we are between the millstones that grind the\npolitical universe, we have given more thought to building\nrepublics than to perfecting the nation that we are.\nIn spite of all its faults, the United Nations \u2014 the\nOrganization we aspired to and wish to maintain \u2014 has\ncreated a civilization. It is responsible for over 300\ninternational treaties: for the consolidation of democracy;\nfor the dedicated protection of refugees; for self-\ndetermination, freedom, independence, the dignity of life,\nthe arts, traditions; for coexistence \u2014 even if the phantoms\nof intolerance reappear; for trade free of protectionism; for\nchildren, women and our indigenous populations. And this,\nbeyond civilization, we can call the new culture of the\nhuman family.\nThe Organization has grown and expanded since 1945,\nand the world with it. Its many offspring, scattered among\nthe five continents and virtually all of them free, have led\nto a membership quadruple the number of the founding\nMembers, among them Venezuela, which was represented\nthen by its great Minister Caracciolo Parra P\u00e9rez. At that\ntime he voiced an idea that has even greater validity today:\n\u201cThe peoples of the world must know each other\nmorally and spiritually before they can manage to\ndispel the distrust and ignorance which keep them\napart. We must build up a kind of intellectual\nnetwork, above the network of the physical\ncommunications system which exists between nations,\nor parallel to it.\u201d (Official Records of the United\nNations Conference on International Organization, 7th\nplenary meeting, p. 23)\nThis Organization\u2019s greatest achievement has been to\noffer the world a span of half a century during which,\ndespite remaining fears, it could think of a new course for\nharmonizing all aspects of the life of societies with the\nnature that shelters those societies.\nI congratulate the Organization and the President of\nthe General Assembly, Mr. Diego Freitas do Amaral, in the\nhope that under his leadership the Organization will achieve\nall the success it deserves and needs. All races, all\nreligions, all the most varied shades of humankind bring\ntheir aspirations and their claims here. This is an spacious\nhome that has always endeavoured to live in the peace that\nis and must be the normal condition of life. It has been said\nthat if health is the peace of the body, peace is the health\nof peoples. In that connection, the pre-Socratic philosopher\nwrote that in times of peace people awake to the crowing\nof roosters, while in times of war they waken to the\nclamour of arms; in peace the young bury the old, while\nin war the old bury the young.\n"

        "file_text": "We were deeply shocked\nwhen we heard about the earthquake that took place last\nnight in the Republic of Indonesia. On behalf of the\nGovernment and people of Suriname I offer our deepest\nsympathy to the victims and their families on this sad\noccasion.\nOn behalf of the Government and people of the\nRepublic of Suriname, may I first warmly congratulate\nyou, Sir, on your unanimous and well-deserved election\nto the presidency of the fiftieth session of the General\nAssembly of the United Nations. We have no doubt that\n\n\nunder your distinguished leadership and with your\nexperience this session will achieve its aims. As you\npreside over our deliberations at this crucial juncture in\nhistory, you can be assured of our wholehearted cooperation\nas you fulfil your task.\nPermit me also to express our gratitude to your\npredecessor, His Excellency Mr. Amara Essy, for the very\nable and competent manner in which he presided over the\nforty-ninth session.\nMay I also take this opportunity to express our deep\nappreciation to the Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-\nGhali, for the exemplary manner in which he is fulfilling\nhis tasks during these challenging times. He deserves our\nadmiration and gratitude for the important role he plays in\nguiding this unique world Organization.\nI am especially pleased and honoured to greet Palau as\na new Member of the United Nations family. Suriname is\nlooking forward to close cooperation with this friendly\nnation in our common efforts to attain the noble goals of\nthe United Nations Charter.\nBefore I continue, I should like to express the feelings\nof sincere sympathy of the Government and people of the\nRepublic of Suriname for the Governments and peoples of\nAntigua and Barbuda, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Dominica,\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines, and other territories in\nthe Caribbean for the great destruction sadly caused by\nHurricanes Luis and Marilyn.\nWe are living in an era in which the ending of the\ncold war has removed the risk of a nuclear nightmare and\nhas given us hope that a new atmosphere of cooperation\nbetween States will emerge. If we could show the necessary\npolitical will, this new atmosphere should provide us, now\nand in the coming decades, with a unique opportunity to\nfocus our attention on the solution of many problems,\nproblems which pose serious threats to international peace\nand security and which hamper efforts to achieve sustained\neconomic growth and sustainable development.\nIn some instances the international community has\nmade good use of these changing circumstances and has\nfound common approaches to problems affecting us all.\nExperience during the last few years, however, has revealed\nthat our world is still characterized by unfairness and\ninjustice, and that the gap between the developed countries\nand the majority of developing countries is widening. As a\nresult the number of countries in crisis or in near crisis is\nincreasing. Consequently, political instability, an increase in\nextreme poverty, social exclusion and social disintegration\nare on the rise in many developing countries, causing\ndespair and endangering peace and security both\nnationally and internationally.\nThe developing world has on many occasions\nunderlined the need to pay particular attention to the\nelimination of the ever-widening gap between the\ncountries of the North and those of the South and to the\nestablishment of a new equitable and just international\neconomic order.\nDuring several specifically focused international\nconferences organized by the United Nations, an appeal\nhas been made to the developed countries to fulfil their\nobligations to meet official development assistance targets\nand to help to create an international economic and\npolitical climate conducive to sustained economic growth\nin developing countries.\nUnfortunately, the response to our appeal has not\nfully met our expectations. It will therefore remain our\npriority to continue with concerted efforts to convince our\ndeveloped partners that honouring their commitments and\ncreating favourable economic conditions are also in their\nown interest, because there will be no durable peace and\nstability in the world as long as the majority of the\nworld\u2019s population cannot fulfil its basic needs.\nAnother disturbing event on the present international\nscene is the eruption and spread of many serious violent\nconflicts and the increasing danger to international peace\nand security which these conflicts harbour. Such is the\ncase as we witness the prolonged violent action in former\nYugoslavia. These conflicts are the cause of terrible\ntragedy, as is evidenced by the extermination of tens of\nthousands of people, the casualties suffered by the civilian\npopulation, the destruction of the economic and social\ninfrastructure, the displacement of people from their\nhomes, and the lack of shelter, food and medical\nfacilities. Finding a solution to these conflicts which will\nserve the common interests of all parties involved will\nremain a major challenge for the United Nations.\nA few days ago the warring parties in the former\nYugoslavia signed an agreement which we hope will\nsignal the beginning of the end of the tragic war being\nwaged in that area. We appeal in the strongest terms to\nall parties involved to take advantage of this momentum\nand engage in meaningful negotiations in order to reach\na peaceful settlement which will silence the guns now and\nfor all time.\n2\n\n\nIn Mozambique, Angola and, recently, Palestine we\nhave found proof that seemingly sworn enemies can resolve\ntheir differences through peaceful means. The Government\nof Suriname is therefore very pleased with the recently\nconcluded accord between Israel and the Palestine\nLiberation Organization (PLO) and commends both for\ntheir efforts to restore peace in the Middle East. We know\nthat the healing process will be slow and that there are\nmany obstacles to overcome, but we are sure that peace\nwill finally prevail over violence, chaos and misery.\nThe accelerated globalization of the world economy,\ndynamized by a technological revolution during the course\nof the last decade, has led to important changes in\nproduction structures and world trade. These changes affect\nthe terms of trade of many developing countries.\nOther developments, such as the successful conclusion\nof the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations and\nthe emergence of mega-trading blocs and free trade zones,\nhave led to changes in the political and economic thinking\nin our region in the search for new ways of adapting to\nthese shifting circumstances. The recent formation of the\nAssociation of Caribbean States and the decision by the\ncountries of the Western hemisphere to create a continental\nfree-trade zone by the year 2005 can be seen as proof of a\nvery strong commitment to regional cooperation by our\nrespective Governments.\nTo further our commitment to regional cooperation,\nthe Government of Suriname took two steps of historic\nsignificance: Suriname became the fourteenth member State\nof the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) in July and was\na co-founder of the Association of Caribbean States.\nSuriname is ready to make its contribution in these regional\nbodies in order to attain economic prosperity for its people\nand to preserve and strengthen its democratic traditions and\nvalues.\nJust a few years ago, at the Rio Conference, we, the\nMember countries of the United Nations, established as a\nprimary concern the need to ensure a rational balance\nbetween realizing legitimate national goals and safeguarding\nthe well-being of future generations through the protection\nof the world\u2019s natural resources. Furthermore, we promoted\nthe awareness that development must be sustainable and\nthat sustainability requires due attention to both\nenvironmental and economic and social factors. The need\nto achieve economic development on terms compatible with\nthe conservation of the environment is a priority objective\nfor my country.\nSuriname is blessed with an impressive, rich tropical\nrain forest covering approximately 80 per cent of its total\nterritory. This makes our forest one of the main natural\nresources for fostering development and guaranteeing\nwelfare and prosperity for our people. Hence, the\nexploitation and alternative uses of the forest have always\nbeen among our primary economic activities.\nMy Government promotes sustainable management\nof the forest, which allows for its economic utilization,\nbut at the same time our primary concern is to ensure a\nrational balance between our legitimate socio-economic\ngoals and the protection of the health and well-being of\nfuture generations. Within our limited technological\ncapabilities, we are trying to fulfil our obligations to\npreserve the biological wealth of the forest.\nOur responsibility and commitment in this area are\nreflected in my Government\u2019s policy of stringent\nprotection for approximately 1 million hectares of forest.\nThis is accomplished through the creation of 13 nature\nreserves and one national park and through additional\nplans to add half a million hectares of forest to the nature\nreserves in the short term. Hence, in the near future, 10\nper cent of all Surinamese territory will be protected.\nAnother important step taken by the Government in\nthe sphere of sustainable use of the forest, guaranteeing\nthe preservation of biodiversity, is evidenced by the\nNational Assembly\u2019s ratification in July 1995, of the\nUnited Nations Convention on Biological Diversity.\nFurthermore, the results of the recently concluded\nnegotiations with potential investors will be submitted to\nour National Assembly for approval. In accordance with\nthe agreements reached, our forest will be exploited only\naccording to the so-called Celos management system, as\ndeveloped in Suriname and accepted internationally as the\nbest form of forest management.\nI should not fail to share with the Assembly our\nconcerns over the problem of illicit traffic in drugs,\nespecially since we, unfortunately, as a transit country,\nhave attracted much of this unlawful and damaging trade\nas a consequence of our service economy, the present\nfinancial and economic crisis and our geographical\nsituation.\nIllicit traffic in drugs poses special security problems\nfor countries like ours, with hundreds of miles of\nunguarded shorelines and inadequate resources to match\nthe super-modern equipment to which drug traffickers\nhave access. Because of its operational methods, which\n3\n\n\nhave no regard for frontiers, this form of modern\naggression has become one of the most serious types of\ninternational crime. It must be combated in all its various\nphases and manifestations.\nRecent drug enforcement operations in our region have\nshown that firm action in the struggle against drug\ntrafficking at the national level can be successful and that\nwith concerted action it is possible to break up the main\nnetworks of drug traffickers. Indeed, this success stands out\nas a ray of optimism and hope, overcoming the temptation\nto yield to discouragement and pessimism in this area.\nUnfortunately, it is not enough for one country or a\nfew countries to be victorious because drug trafficking is an\ninternational crime which threatens mankind in every corner\nof the world. It is capable of offsetting the efforts of\nGovernments to eradicate this scourge. Moreover, it is\nlinked to activities such as arms trafficking and terrorism,\nwhile its repercussions are no longer merely social and\neconomic but pose serious threats to political and social\nstability. However, to eradicate this multifaceted scourge\nonce and for all, we need \u2014 now more than ever \u2014\nenhanced regional and international cooperation that is\neffective and constructive and that complements the efforts\nof individual countries.\nMy country will persist in the struggle against illicit\ndrug trafficking because this struggle represents a moral\ncommitment, not only to the Surinamese people but to all\npeople, especially to the children and young people,\naffected by this scourge.\nThe experience gained by the Government of\nSuriname in the field of development cooperation reveals\nthe supportive role of the United Nations Development\nProgramme (UNDP), the United Nations Population Fund,\nthe United Nations Children\u2019s Fund, the United Nations\nDevelopment Fund for Women and other agencies in the\ndevelopment efforts of Suriname.\nRecently, our per capita income and the adjustment of\nthe indicative planning figure for 1995 and 1996 were\nrevised by UNDP. That revision offered us substantive\nadditional support for the implementation of activities\nplanned within the framework of the national development\nstrategy, in particular effective activities related to the\nstructural adjustment programme, the public sector reform\nprogramme and the regional integration programme.\nOn behalf of the Government and people of Suriname,\nwe would like to express our gratitude to the\nSecretary-General and his staff for their efforts to\npromote greater involvement of the United Nations in\nfostering development in Suriname. We are looking\nforward to the continuation and enhancement of closer\ncooperation with the operational arms of the United\nNations system.\nSuriname is aware of the need to make the United\nNations an effective instrument for the international\ncommunity in the quest for sustainable development and\ndurable international peace and security.To this end, the\nfinances of this world body should be streamlined but,\nabove all, the restructuring efforts should reflect today\u2019s\ninternational economic and political realities. In this\nregard, Suriname favours the enlargement of the Security\nCouncil as regards both permanent and non-permanent\nmembers. The increase in the number of permanent\nmembers should not however involve developed countries\nonly. Hence we support expansion through the inclusion\nof permanent members selected also from developing\ncountries which are able to contribute to the maintenance\nof international peace and security and which have\nalready expressed their desire to become permanent\nmembers of the Security Council.\nSuriname became the 144th Member of the United\nNations family in November 1975. This year we will\ncelebrate the twentieth anniversary of our independence\nand also the twentieth anniversary of our membership of\nthis world body. Twenty years of experience as an\nindependent nation and as a Member of the United\nNations have revealed to us that the principles enshrined\nin the Charter still remain the cornerstone in relations\nbetween States.\nMy country has therefore on various occasions\npledged its commitment to the observance of these\nprinciples. In the past, even before we gained\nindependence, citizens from Suriname were called upon\nto defend these principles \u2014 in some cases, regrettably,\nwith their lives. Today, on behalf of the Government and\npeople of Suriname, on the eve of the fiftieth anniversary\nof the United Nations, I would like to acknowledge the\nvaluable contribution that these brave men and women\nhave made to the maintenance of international peace and\nsecurity.\nAt present, Suriname is part of the efforts by the\ninternational community, through the United Nations, to\nrestore order and democracy and to foster prosperity in\nHaiti.\n4\n\n\nWhen called upon to do so, Suriname will always\ncontribute, through the United Nations, to the endeavours\nof the international community to make our world a better\nplace in which to live.\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me at the outset, Sir, to express my\nsatisfaction and that of my delegation at the President\u2019s\nelection to guide our deliberations. We have strong ties\nwith Portugal, based on the many cultural values that we\nhave historically shared on the fertile soil of the Ibero-\nAmerican community. For this reason, it is a great pleasure\nfor me to offer Don Diogo Freitas do Amaral our sincerest\ncooperation and to congratulate him in advance, by virtue\nof his well-known qualities, on his successful leadership of\nthis memorable fiftieth session of the General Assembly.\nThe delegation of Panama wishes to take this\nopportunity to express to the Secretary-General, Mr.\nBoutros Boutros-Ghali, our recognition of the skill,\nintelligence and dedication with which he is fulfilling his\nresponsibilities at the head of our Organization.\nThis fiftieth anniversary has been a year rich in\nevents. Under the leadership of the United Nations, there\nhave been two major world gatherings \u2014 the World\nSummit for Social Development at Copenhagen and the\nFourth World Conference on Women in Beijing \u2014 which\nhave focused the attention of the world on matters that\nare highly complex and difficult because of their cultural,\nsocial and political implications.\nIt is gratifying to see that these meetings have\nfundamentally mobilized women, who are increasingly\noccupying their rightful role, and that the Conferences\nhave contributed enormously to convert the quest for a\nsolution to the problems of the family and of children into\nthe responsibility of us all, and into a moral imperative\nthat transcends the healthy differences between us.\nPanama values as a substantive result the hopeful\nconsensus and the important guidelines agreed upon.\nWe reiterate the responsibility of Panama in the\nNon-Aligned Movement, as well as our readiness to\nattend the Summit at Cartagena de Indias, Colombia, to\ncontribute to the necessary review, just as we greatly\nvalue our participation in the Group of 77. In this context,\nwe reiterate our deepest solidarity with the least\ndeveloped countries, with which we are cooperating\nwithin our means.\nMy delegation is convinced of the need to bring this\nOrganization up to the level of its new and growing\nresponsibilities, and to adapt its functioning, its\nprocedures and its structures to the new conditions that characterize contemporary international society. We are\nconvinced that this is a feeling shared by all Member\nStates, and we believe that existing differences will in due\ncourse be resolved.\nPanama is following with great attention the\ndiscussions taking place in the Working Groups on the\nSecurity Council, on the financial situation, on the\nsupplement to \u201cAn Agenda for Peace\u201d and on the \u201cAgenda\nfor Development\u201d. In particular, and in accordance with\ndecisions taken in the Rio Group, Panama believes that the\nincrease in the membership of the Security Council should\naim at correcting existing imbalances in the regional\ndistribution of membership, as well as changing its\nprocedures and working methods, so that the Council can\nfunction in a transparent way, in keeping with the letter and\nspirit of the Charter. In this context, we support the\nadmission of Germany and Japan as permanent members of\nthe expanded Security Council.\nWe are convinced that the expectations of the\ninternational community for renewed action by the United\nNations can be satisfied only if the financial crisis\nconfronting the Organization is overcome in such a way as\nto allow it to respond to the mandates of Member States.\nWe are particularly concerned at the consistent trend\ntowards a reduction in funds for development and\ncooperation programmes, as well as proposals to reorient\nfood programmes towards emergency assistance\nprogrammes.\nWe consider the review and indefinite extension of the\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT)\nto be of extreme importance, together with the approval of\nprovisions for its periodic review. As a State party to the\nTreaty of Tlatelolco, which establishes the first nuclear-\nweapon-free zone, and as a coastal State of the Pacific,\nPanama wishes to reiterate the Declaration of the Rio\nGroup regarding the resumption of nuclear testing, because\nthat practice has a negative impact on the delicate\ncompromises that this subject involves, as well as the\nGroup\u2019s readiness to continue to negotiate treaties for the\ntotal prohibition of such testing, as well as the production\nand use of chemical and biological weapons.\nLikewise, we vehemently reject all forms of terrorism,\nwherever they exist, as well as expressions of racism and\nintolerance, which are incompatible with our status as\nmembers of the human race. Respect for human rights is\nand must be a fundamental part of the new universal ethics,\nwhich my country has accepted as an integral part of our\nvalue system and which my Government is completely\nfulfilling.\nWe are profoundly concerned at the overall situation\nof the African continent, whose peoples deserve the best\nof destinies. Nonetheless, we are extremely pleased to\nunderscore the admirable example offered to us by the\nSouth Africans who, moving beyond racial or cultural\nmotivations, in a long and heroic effort that has caused so\nmuch suffering, have put an end to the most odious form\nof discrimination \u2014 apartheid. The difficulties involved\nin meeting, living together and working as equals in an\natmosphere of tolerance and cooperation cannot conceal\nthe important contribution being made today by the\nleaders of that Republic under the inspiring leadership of\nPresident Mandela, to whom we wish to accord a special\nrecognition for having constructed the democratic\nfoundations of a multiracial and multicultural nation, fully\nincorporated into the international community.\nIn the Middle East, particularly in Palestine and in\nIsrael, we are delighted to see the efforts of two\nGovernments and their respective leaders and peoples\nwho are struggling tirelessly to consolidate the peace\nagreements and to move forward in building lasting\npeaceful coexistence. Our country wishes to add its voice\nof encouragement to all the forces involved in this\nexemplary commitment, which contributes so much to the\nstrength of the United Nations system and to international\nethics. Panama, a defender of the rights of the Palestinian\npeople and a sincere and constant friend of the Jewish\npeople, as well as of the Arab peoples, believes it is\nappropriate for the international community to begin to\nadjust the direction of its own decisions in order to\nstrengthen what is new, to lend greater force to that\nwhich unites us, in order to encourage those who desire\npeace.\nInspired by these events, the Member States of the\nUnited Nations should recognize the recent achievements\nthat have been made and further encourage the parties to\nthe conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina to find the\npolitical will to arrive at firm, lasting agreements that will\nspare their own peoples the suffering and pain of being\ninnocent victims of war, of racism and of intolerance. The\nUnited Nations peace-keeping forces must be respected\nand protected, because this is what their noble mission\ndemands and because this has been the decision of the\ncommunity of nations. The same message applies to other\nareas of the world that are threatened by violence, or that\nare subject to breaches of the peace.\n\nI believe it is appropriate to refer to the request made\nby a large number of States, including Panama, to include\nthe item of the special situation of the Republic of China in\nTaiwan on the agenda of the fiftieth session of the General\nAssembly. Panama supports this request because it is\ninterested in the unification of China. But since that\neventuality is as yet unforeseeable as regards the \u201cwhen\u201d\nand \u201chow\u201d, we are convinced that both parties should\ncoexist and participate jointly in the international\ncommunity with equality and mutual respect. Panama, as a\ncoastal country of the Pacific, and completely sovereign in\nthe inter-oceanic Canal whose neutrality opens it to\npeaceful use by all nations of the world, desires friendship\nwith all States and wishes to normalize its relations with all\nusers of this inter-oceanic passage.\nThe Torrijos-Carter Treaties provide for the\nculmination on 31 December 1999 of the process of the\nreturn to Panama of the inter-oceanic canal and adjacent\nfacilities and the agreed withdrawal of the troops and\nmilitary facilities of the United States. This exceptional\ndiplomatic and political event constitutes an example of the\npeaceful and just settlement of disputes between a world\nPower and a small country, which today have excellent\nrelations of friendship and cooperation based on trust and\nmutual respect, as is appropriate for two States committed\nto efforts to consolidate prosperity, peace, security and\ndemocracy on the continent.\nThe regime of neutrality of the Panama Canal, in\nestablishing freedom of transit for ships, without\ndiscrimination, promotes the strengthening of an\ninterdependent world with an increasing trend towards\ninternational cooperation. It also provides in our hemisphere\na concrete example of a system of collective security which\nensures the peaceful uses of that inter-oceanic canal,\nopenly, on equal conditions, both in times of peace and in\ntimes of war, for ships of all flags and nations of the world.\nFrom this rostrum we reiterate the invitation to States\nMembers of the United Nations to adhere to the Treaty\nconcerning the Permanent Neutrality and Operation of the\nPanama Canal.\nWe are and shall remain the Western hemisphere\u2019s\nkey to the immense Pacific. President Ernesto P\u00e9rez\nBalladares\u2019s recent successful tour of Asia, following his\nattendance at the Quito Summit of the Rio Group, and his\nacceptance of the invitation of the President of the United\nStates to go to Washington reflect the desire to reaffirm\nclearly our decision to establish the closest political,\ndiplomatic and commercial relations with all nations in the\ngeographic arc from Japan to Australia, through the\nPhilippines, and including all the other coastal States of\nthe Asian continent. In keeping with this, we are\ninterested in being admitted to the Asia-Pacific Economic\nCooperation Council, as is appropriate for a country that\nis essentially maritime and commercial.\nWe therefore wish to continue to be the point of\nconvergence, the meeting-point, of races, cultures and\ncivilizations. We wish to continue to express our natural\nhistorical and geographical calling, which inspired the\nAmphictyonic Congress of Panama of 1826, initiated by\nSim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar, the Liberator, and which later made\npossible the emergence of the Organization of American\nStates, the United Nations, the Contadora Final Act and\nthe Rio Group \u2014 cornerstones of agreement, dialogue,\npeace and regional and universal democracy.\nThis explains that our openness to the Caribbean\nbasin, in entering the Association of Caribbean States, our\nincorporation into the Central American Integration\nSystem and our admission to the Andean Group as a\npermanent observer are basic to our foreign policy, which\ninvolves intense activity to create bonds of integration and\ncooperation in the framework of fruitful, open\nregionalism. In this context, we believe it extremely\nimportant to express our encouragement for the efforts\nbeing made by the Secretary-General and his Group of\nFriends in the negotiations aimed at bringing peace at last\nto the noble people of Guatemala. We welcome the fact\nthat Contadora is once again becoming a point of\nreference in the painstaking negotiation of national\nconciliation for that fraternal people. Panama is honoured\nto have hosted very recently the parties that reached the\ninitial agreements to bring lasting peace to Guatemala.\nWe welcome the achievements of the European\nUnion and its members, and recognize the value of its\nimportant contribution to international cooperation. We\nencourage it to complement this contribution by\nintensifying trade with our own country and our region\nthrough renewed readiness to facilitate access for our\nproducts to its markets. We are conscious that Panama is\na bridge not only to the Pacific, but also to the Atlantic,\nwhich opens up new opportunities with the States of the\nEuropean Union. We are following with optimism and\nattention developments in the countries in transition, with\nwhich we wish to have close relations and increased\nexchanges.\nPanama, which is today a stable and secure\ndemocracy respectful of human rights, with a Government\nthat represents with full legitimacy a people determined\n3\n\n\nto shape for itself a great future of peace and well-being,\nwishes to remain the cross-roads of international trade, open\nto all parts of the world, where, in an era of globalization\nand market integration, the goods and services that are the\nprincipal wealth produced by nations can circulate.\nBecause of everything we are and everything we wish\nto remain, we are here today to share the opportunities that\narise from a new situation, which, because it is not imposed\nby the manifest destiny of others, promises to open up\npaths towards a great future of cooperation and integration\nwith the region and the world.\nPanama is particularly proud to invite the members of\nthe international community that use our inter-oceanic\nwaterway to join us in September 1997 in our capital for\nthe Universal Congress on the Panama Canal, where all the\ndirect and indirect beneficiaries of this marvel of the\nmodern world can see the progress in the smooth transfer\nof the administration and control of the Panama waterway\nat the end of this century, and consider its modernization\nand enlargement so that in the twenty-first century it can\ncontinue to be the most efficient, most competitive and\nsafest means of maritime transport for the exchange of\nmerchandise and products vital to the economies of many\ncountries of the world. Recognizing the importance of this\nmatter, the General Assembly, at its third plenary meeting,\nheld on 22 September 1995, made it agenda item 162 for\nthe fiftieth session, under the title \u201cUniversal Congress on\nthe Panama Canal\u201d.\nWe invite representatives to participate with us in the\ndevelopment of the infrastructure of transport and trans-\nisthmus communications to serve the continent and the\nworld, with the creation \u2014 already under way \u2014 in our\ncountry, on the banks of the inter-oceanic Canal between\nthe Pacific and the Caribbean, of a large port for the\nstorage and handling of goods, which will complement the\noperation of the modernized Panama Canal. We also invite\nrepresentatives to participate in the City of Learning\nproject, a great international centre for the exchange of\ncultures and knowledge, being promoted by our country on\nthe banks of the Canal.\nWe also wish to say that we have offered the\nAmerican hemisphere our territory and all the infrastructure\nand installations necessary to establish a multilateral centre\nto combat drug-trafficking and related crimes. Panama\nraised this matter at the recent Summit of Heads of State\nand Government of the Rio Group, which endorsed the idea\nand has put it to the President of the United States, Bill\nClinton, because we believe that we can succeed in this\nenormous struggle only if all countries coordinate their\nplans and actions. At the same time, we strongly support\nthe holding of a second international conference against\nthe use of and illicit trafficking in drugs in order to deal\nwith a problem that has become universal in scope.\nPanama, as a founding Member of this Organization\nand a signatory of the San Francisco Charter, has been\nwith the United Nations for its 50 years, carrying on with\nit step by step, day by day, observing its magnificent\nachievements and its great difficulties, which for some are\noverwhelming. But this is not a time for fear or regrets;\nit is a time for new endeavours, a time to promote new\nforms, ways and means of international cooperation, with\na view to generating, by cultivating the complementary\ndevelopment of our national individualities, the cultural,\neconomic and human resources that can enable us to be\nfree of poverty and backwardness and to open an ever-\nbroadening road to understanding, tolerance, peace and\nprosperity as we enter the third millennium."

        "file_text": "In this changed world that came out of the\nSecond World War \u2014 more global and interdependent \u2014\nUruguay wishes to reaffirm its confidence in the vital role\nplayed by the United Nations in the preservation of peace\nand in solving the main problems affecting the world, and\nit wishes to confirm the validity of the enlightened\nprinciples of the Charter, as sound today as they were 50\nyears ago.\nDuring this period of time, Uruguay has brought the\nmessage of its people and its Government to this\nAssembly and to the peoples and the Governments of\nbrotherly countries throughout the world. The content of\nthat message has never varied: our conviction that\ninternational peace can be achieved only through strict\nobservance of international law and resort to peaceful\nmeans of resolving conflicts; our certainty that only a\ndemocratic system and scrupulous respect for human\nrights can ensure the full spiritual and material fulfilment\nof the individual; and our unfailing trust in this\nOrganization, to whose creation Uruguay contributed half\n5\n\n\na century ago and to which we have given, and will\ncontinue to give, its broadest support.\nThrough all these years Uruguay has consistently held\nto those principles, contributing with its initiatives and its\nvotes to consolidating peace and ensuring that law and\njustice take precedence over all else. We were the first to\naccept without any conditions whatsoever the mandatory\njurisdiction of the International Court of Justice. We are a\nparty to most instruments for the protection of human\nrights. We have contributed to peace-keeping operations\nsince they first began, and Uruguay is the United Nations\nMember contributing the greatest number of contingents\nrelative to its population and the size of its armed forces.\nNew realities and new international circumstances\nmark the post-cold-war world, and the United Nations has\nhad to adapt its functions to the new demands, responding\nto external circumstances through an imaginative\napplication of the Charter, which has kept the Organization\nalive and valid throughout its history and has saved it from\nobsolescence.\nThe international community today faces\nunprecedented situations. Ethnic and religious\nfundamentalism, international terrorism and drug trafficking\nmay not be new phenomena, but they have taken on fearful\ndimensions by virtue of their access to powerful sources of\nfinancing and the use of weapons of mass destruction. This\nmakes it necessary for the international community to\norganize itself efficiently to combat them, even on the\nbattlefield of modern technology. In addition, these factors\nare combined with new political phenomena, such as the\ndismembering of multinational States, which has unleashed\nage-old ethnic and religious rivalries. These facts, together\nwith the increase in the number of members of the\nOrganization, most of them developing countries, and the\nlead roles played by certain States and regions, justify a\nreform of certain institutional aspects of the Organization.\nAll Charter reform or constitutional development\nresulting from established practice should tend to increase\nthe effectiveness of the Organization, avoiding at all costs\nresorting to formulas which limit its response capacity or\nwhich enshrine new inequalities among its Members.\nOn previous occasions, Uruguay has spoken in favour\nof an expansion of the Security Council, seeking greater\ndemocratization in that organ, which is vital for the\nmaintenance of balance and world peace. But the changes\nmade must ensure that while achieving greater transparency\nand representativeness in that body, that do not have a\nnegative impact on its functioning and efficiency.\nIn any event, the need to carry out institutional\nreforms should not lead us to blame the frustrations and\nfailures of the Organization on the fact that the\ninstruments for carrying out its tasks are not appropriate.\nWhenever the political will of States was used to resolve\nproblems, the Organization was able to achieve its\nobjectives without there being any need to change its\nstructure or operation. Our efforts at reform,\nconsequently, should not lead us away from our\nimmediate duty, which is to face with our current means,\nimperfect though they may be, the serious conflicts which\nare affecting international peace.\nWe cannot but refer in the first instance to that\nwhich affects the countries that emerged from the former\nYugoslavia. It has been hard for some of the parties to\nunderstand that while a negotiated solution is difficult, a\nmilitary solution is impossible.\nIn the meantime, the civilian population continues to\nsuffer through the years \u2014 a population which has\nbecome a permanent target of military action and the\nvictim of brutal manifestations of racial intolerance.\nBehind this tragedy, and to a certain extent explaining it,\nlies the sad realization that United Nations resolutions are\nnot being complied with by some of the parties. We\nbelieve that the Organization should step up its action,\nmaking maximum use of the political and legal\nmechanisms available to it under the Charter, to prevail\nupon Governments and authorities, directly or indirectly\ninvolved in the conflict, to respect and abide by decisions\nadopted.\nThere is no doubt that the road to peace may present\nextraordinary difficulties but it is never blocked entirely,\nas may be seen from the negotiations to put an end to the\nlong and exhausting crisis in the Middle East. We must\nwarmly congratulate those who have decided to replace\nweapons with constructive dialogue, and express our\nadmiration for the intelligence with which these\nnegotiations are being conducted, especially the\npersistence and inspiration with which the parties attempt\nto overcome, not only the extreme complexity of the\nproblem, but also, above all, the violent opposition which\nhas tried to sabotage the peace process, resorting to the\nmost cowardly and inhumane of means. The results are\nstill far from satisfactory but they are also far from being\nnegligible. The international community is also duty-\nbound to encourage these efforts. This General Assembly\n6\n\n\ncan contribute to this by avoiding including in its\nresolutions on this item language which may have been\nappropriate in the past, but which may be irritating at a\ntime when a genuine spirit of peace prevails among all the\nauthorities concerned.\nThe instruments for the second phase of the interim\nagreement on Palestinian self-rule has been another\nlandmark in the peace process, which the parties in question\nhave been promoting with great resolve. With the signing\nof this historic agreement in Washington, we can say that\nwe are closer to lasting peace in that tormented region.\nThere is a common thread which runs throughout these\nconflict situations. It is an element which makes those\nsituations possible and which worsens them, and that is the\navailability and sophistication of weapons. The international\ncommunity will not be able to prevent breaches of the\npeace or avoid their far-reaching implications in terms of\nthe loss of human lives and destruction, unless concrete\nmeasures are adopted with regard to regulation of the\nmanufacture and traffic in weapons. It is our duty to\nrevitalize the mechanisms which have been established to\nthis end, and to create new negotiating bodies, were that to\nbe necessary, to achieve concrete results.\nMany developing countries, including Uruguay, a few\nmonths ago decided on the indefinite extension of the\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons as a\nway of consolidating the process of progressive\ndisarmament in this field. We did so in the conviction of\nthe good faith of the nuclear Powers, which argued in\nfavour of the extension. Unfortunately, after that,\nunderground nuclear tests have continued by some Powers,\nwhich has led our countries to lose confidence in the\ninstruments we signed, and has left us with a feeling of\nfrustration and perplexity.\nA few days ago in New York, concerned over the\nseriousness of the situation with regard to those tests, the\ncountries signatories of the Treaty of Tlateloco in Latin\nAmerica and the Caribbean and the countries signatories of\nthe Treaty of Rarotonga in the South Pacific, which\nestablished nuclear-weapon-free zones, condemned this\nsituation and reiterated the need to put an end to all types\nof nuclear tests so as to create a favourable climate for the\nconclusion of the comprehensive nuclear-test ban treaty,\nwhich is being negotiated at the Conference on\nDisarmament in Geneva.\nWhile the end of the cold war has reduced political\ntension and the risk of global confrontation, there are other\ndevelopments today that are more insidious but no less\nthreatening to the peace and well-being of nations, such\nas drug-trafficking and terrorism, and a lethal combination\nof the two. Uruguay, where fortunately we have not seen\nthe worst manifestations of this problem, has taken part\nand intends to continue to participate intensively in the\ncooperative efforts to prevent and punish such acts and\nrelated crimes, in order to remedy their adverse effects\nand to attack their social consequences. We support the\nconvening of an international conference on narcotic\ndrugs to focus on a comprehensive approach to the\nproblem, including the consumption, the production and\nthe trafficking of drugs, related crimes and the social and\neconomic aspects of the problem.\nWe are also undertaking maximum efforts to\npromote concrete national actions to counteract and fight\nagainst this problem, which could threaten our peaceful\nexistence and the stability of our institutions.\nOn another subject, for some time now the factors\nwhich adversely affect the economic growth of\ndeveloping countries have been identified and decried.\nTheir nature and causes and effect have been examined,\nand formulas have been discussed and proposed to solve\nthose problems, or at least to reduce the intolerable gaps\nwhich exist in today\u2019s economic world. After so many\nyears of discussion, the overall picture remains\nunchanged, although mention could be made of some\nisolated cases where dynamic centres of development\nhave emerged. The situation of the less advanced sectors\nof mankind, where poverty and resulting hunger prevail,\nwhere there is illness and illiteracy, this continues to be\nan unacceptable idea.\nThe process of globalization of the world economy\nand the economic opening that has been developing at the\nglobal level in recent years have helped us to modernize\nsome of our production structures. Nevertheless, the\ninstability of the world\u2019s financial markets poses a\npermanent threat to our economies. The transfer of major\nfinancial resources to and from our markets causes great\ninstability in capital flows in the world, leading to\nconcern and uncertainty, and threatens the accumulated\nefforts of our peoples to establish a more just, more\norderly and more stable economic system.\nGiven this situation, we need to find new\nmechanisms to create a more stable international financial\nsystem and a way to predict potential financial crises that\ndo not impose regulations that hinder the capital flows\nneeded for growth and investment.\n7\n\n\nThe Group of Seven has pointed to the need to update\nthe way in which the Bretton Woods Institutions operate in\nthe financial sphere. Our countries are willing and entitled\nto participate in alternative strategies to reform these\ninstitutions that are vital to a world economy as globalized\nas it is today.\nThe establishment of the World Trade Organization\nmarked the end of the longest and most complex\nnegotiations of recent years and a new stage of international\ntrade. If this new stage is going to lead to a more equitable\ndistribution of international trade, all States, particularly\nthose with the largest share in trade, must abide by the new\nrules of the game. Uruguay hopes that these rules will be\nrespected, that protectionist policies and subsidies will\ndisappear and that barriers impeding international trade\nliberalization and growth, especially trade in agricultural\nproducts, will be broken down, as agreed in Marrakesh at\nthe conclusion of the Uruguay Round of the General\nAgreement on Tariffs and Trade.\nWe recognize that as the international situation stands\nour development will largely depend on our own efforts.\nWe attach great importance to international cooperation for\ndevelopment, but are aware that our problems will not\ndisappear merely through external assistance. Today, the\nmajor challenge before us is the need to increase know-how\nand to apply it to development. Today, the only\ncomparative advantages are those derived from scientific\nand technological progress, and a country\u2019s relative\ncompetitiveness will be directly linked to its ability to\ngenerate, adapt and apply its know-how and to provide\npermanent training for the population.\nIn this context, the countries of the Common Market\nof the South, known as MERCOSUR, are aware that\naccording to the new world scheme integration processes\nare a fundamental aspect of an ability to compete efficiently\nwith other economic blocs. We are promoting integration in\nthe context of a philosophy of open regionalism. We are\nnot trying to turn MERCOSUR into an ivory tower \u2014 quite\nthe contrary, because as we strengthen and expand it we are\ntrying to promote links with other countries of the region\nand looking for common ground while respecting the\nparticular nature and modalities of each country.\nWe are also trying to strengthen ties with other areas\nof the developing world, in particular with our fellow\ncountries of the South Atlantic region. In this context,\nUruguay reaffirms the importance of the Zone of Peace and\nCooperation of the South Atlantic that was solemnly\ndeclared pursuant to resolution 41/11 of 27 October 1986.\nIn this framework, we fully share the aims of this\ndeclaration and see the zone as an important instrument\nfor promoting cooperation in scientific, political, technical\nand cultural areas.\nWe are convinced that security and development are\ninseparable and interrelated, and that any progress in\nterms of meeting the objectives of the zone will\nstrengthen cooperation between the States of Africa and\nof the Southern Cone of America. This commitment is all\nthe more evident in the support given by the States of the\nzone for the peace processes in Angola and Liberia and\nthe Bicesse and Abuja agreements respectively.\nUnsolved global problems continue to weigh heavily\non our agendas. There is general solidarity with regard to\nenvironmental protection, because we have clearly seen\nwhat is at stake, namely our common destiny, and have\nrecognized that this is a task we must work at together.\nUnfortunately, this solidarity has still not been translated\ninto concrete and effective action with a real ecological\nimpact. The physical deterioration of the planet continues\nunabated.\nShowing its concern for environmental matters and\nits willingness to cooperate effectively and tangibly with\nthe joint efforts of the international community, the\nGovernment of Uruguay has offered to host the second\nmeeting of the contracting parties of the United Nations\nFramework Convention on Climate Change, to be held\nduring the second half of 1996.\nAs a coastal country in the southern part of the\nplanet, Uruguay is particularly sensitive to certain forms\nof environmental degradation such as the depletion of the\nozone layer, climate change and the contamination and\nimproper exploitation of the resources of the South\nAtlantic.\nUruguay views the results of the Conference on\nStraddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks\nas highly auspicious. We hope that the draft convention\nadopted will be approved in the near future and obtain the\nratifications needed to secure its entry into force, in\nparticular by the countries most heavily involved in\ncatching the fish covered by the convention. In this\ncontext, Uruguay expresses the hope that the 1982 United\nNations Convention on the Law of the Sea, to which our\ncountry is a party, will be ratified as soon as possible by\nthe countries that have not yet done so. The general\napplication of the new law of the sea embodied in the\nConvention can only be of benefit to all States. The\n8\n\n\nsystem of protection and preservation of the marine\nenvironment and conservation and exploitation of its\nresources are just two of the many benefits to be expected\nfrom its universal application.\nIn conclusion, Uruguay reiterates its opposition to the\nunilateral application by one State of economic or trading\nmeasures against another State and therefore urges that an\nend be put to the economic, trade and financial blockade of\nCuba.\nI wish to end by conveying the Government of\nUruguay\u2019s pleasure to the President at his election to\npreside over the work of the General Assembly in the\nfiftieth anniversary year. We congratulate him on his\neloquent address on the assumption of his post and share\nthe views expressed therein. We are aware of the\nOrganization\u2019s financial situation, but let us not make the\nmistake of thinking that savings should be made by cutting\nassistance and cooperation in the sphere of development,\ntaking development in the broadest sense of the word. For\nevery dollar we take away from this field, we shall have to\nspend two on peace-keeping operations.\nIf we wish to speak in economic terms, it is cheaper\nto prevent conflict than to have to resolve it later. Clearly,\nthe primary responsibility of the United Nations is to\nresolve conflicts, but it is much more important to prevent\nand avoid them. Can a price be put on human life?\nI wish to reiterate that Uruguay, faithful to its peace-\nloving and democratic tradition, will continue to participate\nin the task of building a world free from violence, poverty\nand intolerance \u2014 the world envisioned 50 years ago by\nthe founders of this Organization.\n"

        "file_text": "On the eve of the\nfiftieth anniversary of the United Nations, the\nrepresentatives of the world\u2019s nations are gathered here\nwith hearts full of hope for a better future, as well as for\nthe cause of the peace and prosperity of mankind, in an\natmosphere of great enthusiasm and animation.\nThe Afghan nation, in spite of the immense\ndifficulties it has encountered, shares that optimism with\nmany of the nations represented here, as well as\nconfidence in its ability to overcome those challenges.\nWar and conflict always bring with them miseries\nand devastation. The last 17 years have taught our\nchildren only to differentiate the various sounds of guns,\nrockets, tanks and mortars, rather than teaching them\nliteracy or providing them with basic nutrition, security\nand peace of mind.\nWe turn to this world family, as an institution\ndedicated to the cause of humanity, the self-determination\nof nations, human rights and democracy, to pronounce\n6\n\n\nitself opposed to the forces aiming to create a bloodbath in\nan already devastated Afghanistan.\nWhen I return to my homeland \u2014 the home of 1.7\nmillion martyr graves, tens of millions of unexploded land-\nmines, 2 million disabled people, hundreds of thousands of\norphans and widows \u2014 I am expected to be carrying\nanswers as to why this world, which claims to be\ncommitted to human rights and justice, has remained a\nspectator of the sufferings of Afghans, brought about by\nforeign interference. Why, in spite of the complete peace,\nsecurity and tranquillity prevailing in the capital for many\nmonths past, have the United Nations offices unjustifiably\nabandoned us by remaining outside?\nOur people find it astonishing that in an era of such\ndeveloped mass communication, which leaves no distance\nbetween different corners of the globe, the apparently\ninsurmountable difficulties \u2014 in particular, the actual\ncauses of the continuing imposed war \u2014 are not\nunderstood. I am confident that there are people who\nclearly see the factors contributing to the continuation of\nthe conflict. There are forces that insist on seeing our\npolitical system subordinated to their political and economic\ndesigns and policies. This is the actual source of the\nconflict.\nThe crisis in Afghanistan is often perceived as a\nsubject of academic studies. Some call this a civil war in a\nsociety that they consider \u201cfragmented\u201d. Others look at it as\nthe scene of a contest, a struggle for power. Yet others try\nto find the roots of the conflict in the ethnic and tribal\ncomposition of the country. The truth is far more clear:\nwhatever it is, it is not a civil war; nor is it a tribal or\nethnic conflict; it is an imposed war.\nWe have learned from history that our existence\ndepends on our unity. We, like many other nations, want to\nlive in peace and security, as well as benefit from economic\ndevelopment, welfare and democracy, which will be\navailable only in peaceful circumstances. We want to live\nin peace with our neighbours and to engage in good-\nneighbourly relations. We leave it up to the astute observers\nof the United Nations and the impartial analysts of the\nworld community to judge the efficacy of the United\nNations in alleviating the sufferings in Afghanistan.\nThe year 1995 opened with good omens for\nAfghanistan. The country witnessed positive changes\ntowards peace and political stability. Following the removal\nof the sources of danger from the southern part of the\ncapital, the people of Kabul found a moment of peace after\nyears of being rocketed indiscriminately. Every day since\nmid-March an average of about 3,500 refugees\nreturned home \u2014 mostly to the capital \u2014 according to\nthe Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for\nRefugees (UNHCR). Prices fell sharply. Goods and\nservices became plentiful in the markets. The Government\nreopened 156 schools for girls and boys, and the\nuniversities reopened in an atmosphere of security and\npeace.\nOfficial delegations from the United States,\nSwitzerland, Germany, France, the United Kingdom, the\nRepublic of Korea, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Pakistan,\nSaudi Arabia, Turkey, Tajikistan, the Russian Federation,\nUzbekistan, the People\u2019s Republic of China and the\nSudan, as well as many international organizations and\nothers, came to Kabul. High-ranking Afghan delegations\nalso travelled abroad.\nThe Islamic State of Afghanistan even won an\nopportunity to take steps towards peace and regional\nsecurity. Among the Tajikistan peace mediators, Professor\nBurhan-ud-din Rabbani, the President of the Islamic State\nof Afghanistan, accomplished the most. We remember\nthat his peace initiative conduced to unprecedented and\npositive changes regarding the civil strife in Tajikistan.\nKabul city, for the first time, hosted direct talks between\nHis Excellency Imam Ali Rakhmanov, the President of\nTajikistan, and Sayed Abdullah Nouri, the leader of the\nIslamic Revival Movement, representing all the Tajik\nopposition. In a historic press conference the two leaders\nembraced each other and agreed on a longer-term cease-\nfire.\nConfidence-building measures were taken on the\nbasis of domestic endeavours between Afghanistan and\nthe opposition. The Islamic State of Afghanistan, with the\naim of putting an end to all problems in the country,\npresented to the United Nations a peace plan, on most of\nwhose items there emerged, for the first time, a sense of\nagreement among all sides. The plan pledged to the nation\nthe convening of a Grand National Assembly \u2014 Loya\nJirga, as we call it \u2014 within a year. The Islamic State of\nAfghanistan, while leaving to the United Nations Special\nMission the question of the creation of an appropriate\nmechanism for the convening of the Grand National\nAssembly, promised to agree to the participation of the\nopposition groups in the current Supreme State Council\nand in the present one-year-term transitional Government\nuntil the convening of the Grand National Assembly.\n7\n\n\nAs a result of these proposals the people of our\ncountry and of the region felt more optimistic about the\nreturn of peace to Afghanistan. However, those needlessly\nafraid of an independent, stable and self-reliant Afghanistan\nsought to change the course of events to coincide with their\nown interests. They once again used the made-up Taliban\ngroup \u2014 whose actual identity and character and the\nsources of whose funding and arming are yet to be made\nknown to most of the members in this Hall \u2014 equipped\nwith arms, light and heavy, from across the border of our\ncountry and with air power. Ironically enough, they recently\nchose to target the west of Afghanistan, which, according\nto earlier statements of Ambassador Mahmoud Mestiri,\nhead of the United Nation Special Mission to Afghanistan,\nwas the best model of healthy administration, order,\nstability and people\u2019s welfare.\nIntent on exposing the Islamic State to instability,\nmilitary intelligence services across the border tried hard to\nunite the opponents of the State under a single command.\nThey boosted the Taliban mercenaries with their own\nfrontier militia. Thousands of those being trained across\nAfghan borders launched attacks against the Shindand air\nbase and a number of other western provinces of the\ncountry, including Herat, as a result of which the peaceful\ncity of Herat was on 5 September turned into a place of\noccupation, chaos and insecurity. A great number of\ncivilians lost their lives. Tens of thousands were forced to\nleave their houses. The bands of the so-called Taliban, or\nreligious students, began their rule by closing schools for\ngirls and the universities, as well as banning women from\nworking in offices or teaching in schools. They have even\nforbidden the use of televisions and videos, and all movie\ntheatres are closed down in the areas under their\noccupation.\nAs the so-called Taliban are said to have the capability\nof jeopardizing any viable peace process in the country, I\ndeem it necessary to register some basic facts about this\nmysterious movement.\nIn Islamic countries there are many religious schools\nor \u201cMadrasas\u201d where several subjects related to Islam are\ntaught. The purpose of these schools is to prepare Muslim\nyouth for religious service to their countrymen. In no\n\u201cMadrasa\u201d in the world is the subject of modern warfare,\nsuch as the use of artillery and rockets, or the flying of\nwarplanes, taught. That is the work of military academies.\nThe only modern items the Taliban mercenaries are\naware of are advanced armaments. As for their links with\nthe outside, the most pertinent and very important question\nis: if their numbers are about 30,000, as they claim, and\neach of them would require $100 for daily and military\nexpenses, who is paying the more than $88 million a\nmonth for their expenses?\nAs for logistical support, for instance, it is calculated\nthat in order for the Taliban to keep their transport\nvehicles, tanks and other armoured vehicles running they\nneed more than 15,000 gallons of fuel each day. That is\nseparate from almost the same amount of fuel that they\nrequire as reserve. Again, who is providing them with\nsuch huge logistical support?\nThe Taliban have no single leader. They claim to\nhave a Central Council in Kandahar. However, no\nplatform or political agenda has been made known yet.\nThe declarations of their many leaders are not consistent.\nOn 20 September one of their leaders, Mullah Mishr, told\nPeter Greste, a correspondent of the Reuters news agency,\nthat the problem of Afghanistan could only be solved\nthrough war.\nThe Islamic State of Afghanistan expressed the\nintense indignation of its people and Government in its\nletters of 5 September 1995 (S/1995/767) and 14\nSeptember 1995 (S/1995/795) addressed to the Secretary-\nGeneral, calling for immediate measures to end the state\nof occupation in western Afghanistan. We specifically\nrequested the United Nations to send a fact-finding\nmission to the western part of the country to investigate\nand assess the reality of the state of occupation. That is\nthe responsibility of the Security Council.\nThe resistance of our people together with the forces\nof the Islamic State of Afghanistan, against the\nmercenaries and foreign militia, has been further\nstrengthened. As a result, the Province of Ghowr, east of\nHerat, once occupied, has been liberated. The foreign\narmed intervention, however, reached a new dimension.\nThe bands of mercenaries were reinforced west of Kabul\nto attack the capital, the plan of attack being engineered\nand guided from abroad.\nWe strongly demand that the United Nations Special\nMission break its silence regarding those mercenaries and\nanswer the relevant questions, including whether this band\nis a threat to peace. This is particularly pertinent because\nthe Special Mission once considered the Taliban to be a\npositive factor for peace. Is it not time for the Special\nMission to find out the intentions of the Taliban in\nrelation to General Assembly resolutions on Afghanistan?\n\nEvents have proved that the United Nations Special\nMission encountered many difficulties and challenges,\nowing to the lack of an adequate capability to carry out the\nmandate entrusted to it by General Assembly resolutions\n48/208 and 49/140. To enhance the capabilities of the\nSpecial Mission, the Islamic State of Afghanistan submits\nthe following five-point proposal.\nFirst, the necessity to reinforce the Mission requires\nthe formation of a contact group on Afghanistan to speed\nup the peace process. The contact group on Afghanistan\nshould be composed of one representative of the United\nNations Special Mission; one representative of the\nSecretary-General of the Organization of the Islamic\nConference, which is already active in the peace process in\nAfghanistan; one representative from among the member\nStates of the Organization of the Islamic Conference, but\nnot a country directly involved; one representative from\namong the members of the European Union; and one\nrepresentative from among the members of the Non-\nAligned Movement.\nSecondly, the contact group would promote the peace\nprocess in Afghanistan by focusing its endeavours in the\nlight of information, evidence and documents provided to\nthe Special Mission pertaining to the violation of the\nsovereignty and territorial integrity of Afghanistan.\nThirdly, the contact group on Afghanistan would\nsearch for ways and means to end foreign intervention and\ninterference in the internal affairs of Afghanistan, and make\neffective and appropriate recommendations to the Secretary-\nGeneral of the United Nations and to the Security Council.\nFourthly, the various proposed programmes to bring\npeace to Afghanistan should be studied by the contact\ngroup in consultation with the involved Afghan parties.\nThese endeavours would have the following objectives:\nCreation of a commission for the convening of the\nGrand National Assembly, or \u201cLoya Jirga\u201d; this\ncommission would also have the mandate to draft the\nConstitution, to include a firm disposition guaranteeing\ndemocracy and human rights for the future\nAfghanistan.\nConvening of the Grand National Assembly, or \u201cLoya\nJirga\u201d, within one year.\nElection of the future leader of Afghanistan for a\nsubsequent fixed term of office.\nAdoption of the Constitution.\nFormation of the first parliament from among the\nmembers of the Grand National Assembly, which\ncould represent the administrative units of the\ncountry on the basis of their proportion of\npopulation.\nFifthly, the contact group on Afghanistan would\nimmediately approach all Afghan groups and invite them\nto participate in the Supreme State Council and\nGovernment, until the formation of the Grand National\nAssembly, or \u201cLoya Jirga\u201d.\nThe contact group on Afghanistan would also play\na crucial role in the reconstruction of the country, as\nrequired by General Assembly resolution 49/140, adopted\non 20 December 1994.\nWe consider that proposal, which has already been\nsubmitted to the Secretary-General of the United Nations,\nto be a secure and short path towards peace, national\nrapprochement and stability, through the cessation of\nhostilities.\nTo those who refuse to accept the one-year lapse of\ntime for that peace process, insisting on an unconditional\nand immediate transfer of power, we say that a period of\none year is not long in the life of a nation. Had there\nbeen an agreement a year ago for the transfer of power\nand for the consolidation of the political process, we\nwould by now have been in the process of transferring\npower.\nWe solemnly ask the General Assembly to take this\nproposal into consideration when discussing the agenda\nitem on Afghanistan during this historic fiftieth session.\nHaving said this, we would like to state \u2014 for those\nwho insist on the need for a military solution to the\nproblem \u2014 that the Islamic State of Afghanistan, while\nwilling to transfer power to a legitimate and lawful\nauthority, has the capacity and capability to respond to the\nterrorist acts of mercenaries linked to foreign quarters.\nAfghanistan would not allow any circles to\nundermine the process of the peaceful transfer of power\nand the normal political process that is to be implemented\nunder the supervision of the United Nations and the\n9\n\n\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference. Those cliques of\noutsiders who are recruiting, training, arming, and providing\nfinancial assistance to the mercenaries \u2014 as well as\nreinforcing them with their own militia \u2014 and using such\nreactionary groups to destabilize a moderate Islamic system\nwhich believes in democracy and human rights, are wrong\nin their assessments and calculations. Such foreign circles\nmay think that after the usurpation of power by the Taliban\nall will go well for them. In fact, they will add a further\nproblem, especially by bringing onto the scene a faction\nwhich has no factual presence on Afghanistan\u2019s political\nscene. These circles should be aware that the peace and\nsecurity in the capital, the actual relative peace and stability\nin the country and in the region, would be jeopardized by\nsuch an erroneous miscalculation. The same error was made\nby the former Soviet Union in 1979.\nFor the record, we would like to emphasize that those\nwho ignite a fire in our country will burn themselves. It\nwould then be too late to return to the peaceful political\nprocess on which we are now trying to embark.\nThe statement made by His Excellency the Foreign\nMinister of Pakistan on 27 September 1995 before this\nAssembly pertaining to the relation between Afghanistan\nand Pakistan was itself a clear illustration of his\nGovernment\u2019s unfriendly intentions towards my country.\nThe assertions of His Excellency the Foreign Minister of\nPakistan, as contained in his statement, need to be\nresponded to for the sake of the record.\nFirst, the Pakistani Foreign Minister was trying to\nconfuse our friends and to divert the attention of world\npublic opinion from his country\u2019s own acts of blatant\ninterference in Afghanistan and from the invasion by its\nmilitia in assisting the so-called Taliban in Western\nAfghanistan to the tragic incident in the Pakistani Embassy\nat Kabul.\nIn this regard the following explanations are necessary.\nI express, on behalf of His Excellency the President and the\nGovernment and the people of Afghanistan, profound regret\nabout the very sad and grievous incident that occurred in\nthe Embassy of Pakistan at Kabul on 6 September 1995.\nThis message has also been forwarded by an official note\nof the Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Afghanistan to the\nForeign Ministry of Pakistan. Furthermore, I have conveyed\ntwo messages by telephone from Kabul to His Excellency\nMr. Najmuddin Sheikh, Foreign Secretary of Pakistan.\nThe tragic incident contradicts the traditional\nhospitality of the Afghan people. While we express our\ngrief at the incident, which we consider unjustifiable, at\nthe same time we say that some aspects of the events\nhave been overlooked by the Foreign Minister of\nPakistan, whose Government tried to use different forums\nfor political gains through a distortion of the facts.\nAllow me, for the sake of the record, to point out\nthe sequence of incidents as they occurred. On 6\nSeptember 1995, on the morrow of the occupation of\nHerat City by the so-called Taliban mercenaries, with the\nhelp of foreign militias, the people of Kabul held a\npeaceful demonstration. Tens of thousands of peaceful\ndemonstrators gathered outside the compound of the\nEmbassy of Pakistan at Kabul chanting anti-Pakistani\nslogans. The staff of the Embassy, contrary to all\nrecognized principles of international law, used a firearm\nfrom inside the Embassy premises against the peaceful\ndemonstrators. This caused the death of one of the\nstudents, a student by the name of Badruddin Muslim, an\neleventh grader in the Naderia High School of Kabul.\nThis highly unjustifiable and provocative act of the\nEmbassy staff incited the fury of the demonstrators, who\nin the beginning were non-violent and peaceful, gathered\nonly to express their deep resentment at the occupation of\npart of their country.\nIt is noteworthy that the security forces of the\nGovernment were already active in the early morning,\nhaving observed the spontaneous gathering of people in\ndifferent parts of Kabul city. The security forces formed\ntwo security belts around the Embassy premises.\nHowever, the death of the young demonstrator caused a\nsudden reaction and, unfortunately, the crowd got out of\ncontrol. The security forces tried their utmost to prevent\nthe upsurge of violence and to protect the Embassy and\nits staff. Regrettably, despite the losses suffered by the\nsecurity forces, five of whose personnel were killed while\nprotecting the Embassy, they did not succeed in\npreventing this tragic event. Mr. Ejaz Ali, the Third\nSecretary of the Pakistani Embassy at Kabul, a witness to\nthe event, acknowledged in an interview at Islamabad\nairport on 7 September 1995 that the security forces of\nthe Afghan Government exerted efforts to avert the tragic\nhappening.\nWe declare from this rostrum that the Afghan nation\nnever had recourse to terrorism, even during the long\nyears of resistance against the invasion of their country by\nthe former Soviet Union. That fact clearly shows that,\ndespite heavy sacrifices by the Afghan nation, it never\nhad recourse to terrorist acts against any consulate or\nembassy of the former Soviet Union.\n10\n\n\nSecondly, in his statement the Foreign Minister of\nPakistan referred nine times to the Islamic State of\nAfghanistan as the \u201cKabul regime\u201d or the \u201cRabbani\nregime\u201d. We do not intend to reciprocate with similar unfair\nlanguage because of our sincerity and commitment to\nfriendship towards Pakistan.\nThirdly, it is ironic to witness His Excellency the\nForeign Minister of Pakistan prescribing the type, nature\nand characteristics of a government that he would like to\nsee in Afghanistan. My delegation, however, reciprocates\nthe sense of good will and brotherhood he expressed\nregarding our two nations. Moreover, we recall with\nappreciation the strong sense of brotherhood and Islamic\nsolidarity by which the fraternal nation of Pakistan extended\nits support to the just struggle, the Jihad of the Afghan\nnation, against the invading forces of the former Soviet\nUnion. We trust that our Pakistani brothers are also fully\naware of the sacrifices we made when Afghanistan served\nas a shield for the protection of Pakistan territories against\nthe most important mobilization of an army since the war\nin Viet Nam.\nHowever, our complaint is addressed, not to the nation\nof Pakistan, but against the manifest interferences of\nPakistani authorities, especially the Inter-Service\nIntelligence (ISI), which is the Pakistani military\nintelligence. Sometimes the explanations of the Pakistani\nGovernment, which claims to remain impartial, seem to be\njustified owing to the fact that the Pakistani civilian\nadministration is not capable of containing the operations of\nthe ISI, a powerful military-intelligence body which has\nemerged as a State within the State.\nSecondly, we wonder which of the internationally\naccepted norms and principles governing relations between\nnations justify the Pakistani desire to prescribe the type and\ncharacteristics of government for a sovereign and\nindependent neighbour. Could there be any clearer example\nof Pakistani interference in our internal affairs?\nThe Foreign Minister of Pakistan has repeatedly\nclaimed that Pakistan is not interfering in the internal\naffairs of Afghanistan. Let us leave aside all evidence\npertaining to the aggression of the Pakistani frontier militia\non Afghan territory, as set out in the documents of the\nSecurity Council that we have submitted, as well as the\ncomments and statements of independent international\nreporters and scholarly analysts on Afghanistan identifying\nand highlighting the interference of Pakistani military\nintelligence in the internal affairs of Afghanistan as the only\nsource of the present-day conflict in Afghanistan. We need\nonly refer to internationally recognized newspapers: The\nWashington Times, in its issue of 24 September 1995, The\nTimes of London, 26 September 1995, and The Canberra\nTimes, 11 September 1995.\nBoth The Washington Times and The Times of\nLondon quote Ambassador Mestiri\u2019s comments regarding\nthe so-called Taliban and Pakistan\u2019s involvement in\nsupporting them.\nThe Times of London of Tuesday, 26 September\n1995, under the headline \u201cStudent army gives notice of\nattack on Kabul\u201d, states,\n\u201cMahmoud Mestiri, who heads the United Nations\npeace efforts in Afghanistan, said he was convinced\nPakistan was behind the Taliban group\u201d.\nThe Washington Times of 24 September 1995, in an\narticle entitled \u201cPakistan aid to rebels has Kabul talking\nwar\u201d, states,\n\u201cEven the United Nations special envoy to\nAfghanistan is suspicious ... The power of Taliban\nis mysterious', envoy Mahmoud Mestiri said. I\nthink they are getting money and help, maybe from\nPakistan'.\u201d\nThe same article, written by Ian Stewart of the Associated\nPress, contains a description of a Taliban fighter:\n\u201cOne of a new breed of noble fighter in\nAfghanistan, the dust-caked 19-year-old is armed\nwith a Kalashnikov and the writings of the Muslim\nProphet Mohammed and trained, he says, in\nPakistan\u201d.\nIn his statement, the Foreign Minister of Pakistan\ncannot conceal the true intention of his Government with\nrespect to Afghanistan. He inadvertently uncovers the\nintention:\n\u201cprovocation will not deter us from our steadfast\npath of neutrality towards the Afghan people and the\nunity of Afghanistan or from non-interference in\nAfghanistan\u2019s internal affairs, nor will it affect our\nabiding friendship and brotherhood with the Afghan\nnation\u201d. (Official Records of the General Assembly,\nFiftieth Session, Plenary Meetings, 8th meeting,\np. 22)\n11\n\n\nHowever, subsequently the Foreign Minister of Pakistan\nnegates the spirit of the above by saying,\n\u201cIn the meantime, we would like to assure the people\nof Afghanistan that we shall stand by them in their\nhour of trial. We shall not abandon them.\u201d (ibid.)\nI am certain that the words \u201cwe shall stand by them in their\nhour of trial\u201d will raise a question in the minds of the\nMembers of the Assembly: what could Pakistan\u2019s intention\nbe in making such a statement?\nThe former Soviet Union\u2019s aggression in Afghanistan\nis long over. Our nation would like our neighbours and the\nworld to assist us in our endeavours towards national\nreconciliation and peace.\nMoreover, His Excellency the Foreign Minister of\nPakistan promises that they will not abandon the Afghans.\nThe Assembly should realize that this amounts to assuring\nthe opposition of the Afghan Government that Pakistan will\ncontinue interfering in Afghanistan\u2019s affairs in their favour\nuntil the Islamic State is destabilized and a proxy\nGovernment obedient to the will of Pakistan\u2019s Government\nis brought to power.\nThe Minister for Foreign Affairs of Pakistan has cast\ninto doubt the legitimacy and legality of the Afghan\nGovernment and the territory governed by it. We call on\nHis Excellency the Foreign Minister of Pakistan to allow\nany impartial observer to visit the north-western agencies\nand find out if the central Government of Pakistan has any\nadministrative authority over them. Is it not a fact that the\nproduction of firearms has continued, as an ongoing\ntraditional trade, ever since the establishment of Pakistan?\nWhere is heroin, the most dangerous enemy of humanity,\nproduced and refined? John F. Burns of The New York\nTimes wrote,\n\u201cTop army officers have been accused in the past of\nconniving with drug lords, to the extent of running\nheroin shipments to Karachi aboard army-owned\ntrucks\u201d. (\u201cHeroin scourges million Pakistanis\u201d, The\nNew York Times, 5 April 1995, Section A, p. 12)\nThe Islamic State of Afghanistan and Pakistan will\nboth be losers if they try to confront each other. The only\nway leading towards securing both countries\u2019 highest\ninterests is to re-establish, broaden and consolidate their\nmutual brotherly relations on the basis of equality of States,\nrespect for each other\u2019s territorial integrity and sovereignty\nand the right of each to determine its own future.\nPresident Rabbani is a strong believer in the\nperpetual necessity for both countries to establish ties of\nfraternity and cooperation. Both countries, and the entire\nregion of Asia where they live side by side, will gain\nthrough Afghan-Pakistani friendship.\nWhile the international community is deploying\nefforts to prevent conflicts and wars, the peace and\nsecurity of individuals and of human communities are\nunder the threat of an undeclared and inhumane war\nwaged by the world\u2019s terrorists. This year the world has\nwitnessed terrible terrorist acts, such as the tragedies in\nOklahoma City, Paris and Tokyo, in which many innocent\ncivilians lost their lives.\nProsperity and the welfare of the human being\ncannot be secured without tranquillity and peace of mind.\nIf the international community does not take drastic\nmeasures to eradicate terrorism, people in different\nregions of the world will continue to live in fear and\nunder the menace of terrorist acts. Islam teaches the\nprinciple of the rights of innocents to live in safety and\ndignity. The Islamic State of Afghanistan considers that\nthere is a great need for the signing of an international\ntreaty ensuring meaningful cooperation between States, in\nthe form of a convention to combat terrorism.\nAfghanistan, as one of the early Members of the\nUnited Nations, contributed to the drafting, discussion and\nadoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights\nand participated in the drafting of both Covenants of\nHuman Rights. We once again reaffirm our deep\ncommitment to these international instruments.\nThe Islamic State of Afghanistan considers respect\nfor human rights one of its fundamental objectives.\nDuring the year under consideration, however, the human\nrights of a number of Afghan citizens in the country, as\nwell as international humanitarian law, have,\nunfortunately, been violated as a result of the continued\nterror perpetrated by the so-called Taliban. The Taliban\nmercenaries\u2019 closing of schools for girls and depriving\nwomen of their right to work has been a major violation\nof human rights. The Islamic State of Afghanistan has the\nconviction that taking appropriate and effective\ninternational measures towards putting an end to foreign\ninterference in the internal affairs of Afghanistan would\nserve as a major step towards the realization of human\nrights in the country.\nAs far as the issue of women\u2019s rights in Afghanistan\nis concerned, as brought to the attention of Mr. Paik, the\n12\n\n\nnew United Nations Special Rapporteur on Human Rights\nin Afghanistan, during his recent trip to Kabul, such\nconcerns do not seem to be appropriate in the case of a\ncountry where 383 women army officers, ranking from the\nposition of Lieutenant-General to lower positions, defend\ntheir people and country; where women are serving as\npilots in the Army, as well as parachutists; and where\nwomen are representing their country at Afghanistan\ndiplomatic missions and are serving in various branches of\nthe Administration. Women\u2019s rights are guaranteed in the\npresently enforced laws and regulations governing the life\nof our nation.\nI turn now to the question of land-mines. For the first\ntime, an international meeting was held in Geneva on mine\nclearance. This meeting further enhanced international\nawareness of different dimensions of the land-mine crisis\nand contributed to strengthening international cooperation.\nIt is an alarming fact that every year, while 100,000 land-\nmines are removed, more than 2 million land-mines are\nlaid. An estimated 30 people are killed by land-mines, and\nas many as 60 are maimed, every single day. The slow\npace of demining operations is another major concern to be\nnoted. According to the International Committee of the Red\nCross (ICRC), at the current pace of the mine-removal\nprocess, it will take 1,100 years to get rid of existing mines\n- and the laying of mines continues in different regions of\nthe world.\nAs we already stated in the Geneva meeting on mine\nclearance, only the adoption of a convention which would\nban the production, sale and stockpiling of all varieties of\nland-mines, and especially a sincere commitment on the\npart of mine-producing countries to such an instrument,\nwould serve effectively to put an end to this problem.\nAfghanistan, a war-stricken country, where the largest\nnumber of land-mines have been laid, needs further\nassistance from the international community. This assistance\nwould further help the cause of the repatriation of refugees\nand the revitalization of agricultural activities all over the\ncountry.\nThe Islamic State of Afghanistan expresses its serious\nconcern at the acts of aggression and genocide that continue\nto be committed against the people of the Republic of\nBosnia and Herzegovina. Effective measures should be\ntaken to put an end, once and for all, to this tragic crisis.\nSrebrenica and Zepa must be restored as safe areas and the\nsiege of Sarajevo must be ended. The International Tribunal\non war crimes in the former Yugoslavia should bring to\njustice those Serbian civil and military individuals who\nperpetrated crimes of war and genocide, and crimes against\nhumanity. Afghanistan has repeatedly maintained the view\nthat the arms embargo against the Republic of Bosnia and\nHerzegovina is not applicable de jure. The right of the\nvictim to self-defence has to be respected and restored.\nI would like to draw the Assembly\u2019s attention to one\nof the great threats to the life, health and well-being of\npresent and future generations. This man-made plague is\nnarcotic drugs, and its production, sale and smuggling.\nThe expansion of the poppy fields in my country,\nAfghanistan, as one of the legacies of war, is unfortunate.\nStatistics show that the cultivation of poppy increased\nduring 1994, as compared to 1993. This is in spite of the\nallocation of about $25 million, which the international\ncommunity spent in Afghanistan through non-\ngovernmental organizations. The Islamic State of\nAfghanistan cannot agree to the procedure through which\nthe assistance was channeled. Perhaps an evaluation is\nneeded to correct the procedure. The Islamic State of\nAfghanistan declares its sincere readiness to cooperate\neffectively with regional and international organizations.\nWe are working for the preparation of a master plan to\neffectively combat narcotic drugs on the regional and\ninternational levels. We have invited Mr. Giacomelli, the\nExecutive Director of the United Nations International\nDrug Control Programme, to visit Afghanistan and speed\nup the drawing up of such a master plan.\nWe have had critical episodes in our life, but we\nhave a vision of a peaceful and stable Afghanistan; an\nAfghanistan which it is hoped this Assembly will render\nfree of foreign interference in its internal affairs; an\nAfghanistan where our people come to be blessed with\nbrotherhood and understanding, national conciliation and\nunity; a country to which its 3 million refugees will have\nreturned with confidence and assurance, and where our\nintellectuals, as a source of hope, will dedicate their vast\nenergy and experience and their scientific and physical\npotential to the cause of rebuilding their country; a\ncountry that will once again serve as a major factor in the\nstrengthening of regional peace and stability; a country\nthat will be actively involved in the common efforts of\nthis world family in combating extremism, adhering to a\npositive and dynamic impartial and non-aligned policy,\nand firmly participating in combating terrorism and drug\nabuse. Such a vision takes its source from the heart of our\nnation.\nOur expectation of the world community is that it\nassist us in achieving these goals. The objectives of the\nreconstruction and economic development of Afghanistan\ncannot be achieved without economic assistance from\n13\n\n\nindustrialized nations and other countries that are able to\nfurnish such assistance. Afghanistan has enormous\neconomic capabilities. During the time the former Soviet\nUnion thought of our country as its strategic backyard, the\nworld\u2019s major corporations were prevented from becoming\ninvolved in the exploration of Afghanistan\u2019s natural\nresources and wealth. At the threshold of Afghanistan\u2019s\nreconstruction and rehabilitation, possibilities exist for the\nexploration of our natural wealth, such as natural gas, oil,\ncopper, iron, precious stones and even uranium.\nAfghanistan can become a major producer and exporter of\nfruit. Once the crisis is over, Afghanistan will emerge as\none of the most attractive sites for private investment.\nAfghanistan, a land-locked country, is now vitally important\nat the heart of Asia, connecting Central Asia to the south\nand the Middle East as a historical transit route.\nFrom this rostrum, we invite the industrialized\ncountries, as well as private sectors, to benefit from the\nenormous investment opportunities in our country. In this\ncontext, the Islamic State of Afghanistan warmly welcomes\ndelegations determined to conduct relevant studies, as it is\nexpecting a number of potential investors in the coming\nmonth. This move would itself contribute towards the\nfurther strengthening of stability and an early return of\npeace to Afghanistan.\n"

        "file_text": "First of all, I would like to extend my sincere\ncongratulations and best wishes for success to Mr. Freitas\ndo Amaral upon his election to the presidency of the\nGeneral Assembly at its fiftieth session. We are\nconvinced that, with his profound knowledge of current\nglobal problems and his open attitude to the realities of\ninternational life, he will make a very important\ncontribution towards the achievement of the objectives of\nthis session.\nAt the same time, I should like to address my\nsincere thanks to Mr. Amara Essy for his productive work\nduring his presidency of the General Assembly at its\nforty-ninth session.\nI should also like to convey to Mr. Boutros Boutros-\nGhali, the Secretary-General of our appreciation for his\nefforts to improve the functioning of the United Nations\nand to assure him of the full support of the Republic of\nMoldova.\nIn this anniversary year, Moldova celebrates the\npassage of four years since the proclamation of its\nindependence and three years since its admission to the\nUnited Nations.\nOver these years of complex structural changes, we\nhave preserved our aspiration of becoming a democratic\nState with a market economy, despite the difficulties of\ntransition. Our country has already taken the first steps in\nthis direction by embarking irreversibly upon the path of\ndemocracy.\nIt is worth mentioning that the process of democratic\ntransformation in Moldova has been supported and is\nbeing supported by the international community and,\nprimarily, by the United Nations and its specialized\nagencies. Therefore, I wish to express our gratitude to the\nUnited Nations and its Member States for their substantial\nsupport in the promotion of the ongoing reforms in our\ncountry.\nIn this context, I should like to describe the main\ndevelopments which have taken place in our society this\nyear, as well as our most important present concerns.\n15\n\n\nIn its foreign policy, the Republic of Moldova, a\nneutral State not involved in political-military alliances, is\ndeveloping mutually beneficial relations of friendship and\ncooperation with all States. It also intends to extend its\nbilateral links with neighbouring States, as well as with its\ntraditional partners.\nIn our domestic policy we have had two main\npriorities: to develop and consolidate the legal and\ninstitutional framework of a State of law and the smooth\nfunctioning of institutions appropriate to a modern\ndemocratic society on the one hand, and, on the other, to\nensure economic restructuring and the transition to a market\neconomy.\nSo far, our country has succeeded in setting up a\nnumber of basic institutions for the rule of law. A modern\nconstitution that guarantees political pluralism, private\nownership and respect for fundamental human rights,\nincluding rights for persons belonging to ethnic minorities,\nhas recently been adopted. Likewise, it assures the exercise\nof political liberty, a fact that is proved by the existence of\nnumerous political parties and by the possibility of the free\nexpression of political opinions. The Parliament has drafted\nand adopted a number of laws of major importance.\nThe progress achieved by our country in the process\nof transition has been facilitated, to a certain extent, by\nbilateral cooperation with other States and in the framework\nof various international bodies. Among the positive effects\nof this cooperation have been a quickening in the pace of\ninternal reforms and the process of integration into\nEuropean political and economic structures. In this respect,\na major event in the external relationships of the Republic\nof Moldova has been its admission to the European\nCouncil. This is both a recognition of the progress achieved\nby our country on the way towards democratization and an\nencouragement to further build up the rule of law and a\ndemocratic society.\nAs for economic restructuring and the transition to a\nmarket economy, I can state that a number of difficulties\nare in the process of being overcome. This year new\nmeasures have taken aim at halting the decline in industrial\noutput, which constitutes an important prerequisite for the\nrelaunching of economic growth. Through a new monetary\nand fiscal policy, we have managed to reduce inflation and\nstabilize the national currency. Moreover, it is worth\nrestating our willingness to continue our fruitful cooperation\nin this field with the international financial institutions,\nprimarily the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the\nWorld Bank.\nAt present we are engaged in a crucial stage of the\nreform, particularly that dealing with wide-scale\nprivatization. My government is mostly concerned to\nspeed up privatization in the hope that this will spur\neconomic reform and encourage not only internal\ninvestment, but also foreign capital and credits. In this\ncontext, I should emphasize that the difficulties\nencountered in carrying out economic reforms are linked,\nto a great extent, to the shortage of financial, energy and\nraw materials resources. The assistance we have received\nso far from the international financial institutions and\nfrom some developed countries has had a visible positive\nimpact. Nevertheless, substantial and sustained external\nfinancial support is still needed for the creation of a\nmodern restructured economy.\nThat is why we are counting, in particular, on the\nsupport of the European Union for securing the success of\nour transition. Our efforts aiming at building a market\neconomy and integrating our country into the European\npolitical and economic structures would be strongly\nhelped by its supportive signals and actions. The signing\nof the agreement of partnership and cooperation with the\nEuropean Union towards the end of last year and the\nrecent signing of the Interim Commercial Agreement have\nbeen major steps in this direction.\nThe difficult process of transition is being adversely\naffected by the anti-constitutional actions undertaken by\na separatist regime which exerts temporary control over\neastern districts of the Republic of Moldova.\nThe Assembly may remember the armed conflict\nwhich was unleashed in 1992 by the separatist movement,\nwith external support, in the east of Moldova. Although\nthis conflict ended, its consequences still persist. We\ncannot but note the gross violations of the fundamental\nhuman rights of the Moldovan population in this area.\nMention should also be made of the group of political\ndetainees, known as the \u201cIlascu group\u201d, which was\nillegally convicted and jailed by the anti-constitutional\nauthorities of the Transdniester three years ago, and is\nstill in prison.\nNor can we omit mention of the obstinate refusal of\nthe separatist leaders to allow the Moldovan parents and\nchildren to use the Latin alphabet in the study of their\nmother tongue. That is why the representatives of the\ncompetent international organizations in the field of\nhuman rights have noted a series of abuses and violations\nof the rights of the Moldovan population living in the\neastern districts of the Republic.\n16\n\n\nAlthough the situation of the Transdniester is no\nlonger in the forefront of international public opinion, it\nshould be noted that no acceptable solution has been\nidentified so far. Despite the reasonable compromises\nproposed by the constitutional authorities, separatist\ntendencies still persist. I should like to stress that the\npolitical leaders of my country have repeatedly\ndemonstrated their willingness to solve this conflict\nexclusively by peaceful means by negotiation, in conformity\nwith international law and in cooperation with international\norganizations, primarily with the Organization for Security\nand Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), as well as with Russia\nand Ukraine in their capacity of mediators. In a spirit of\ncompromise, my Government also firmly believes in the\nprinciple that any proposal or initiative to settle the conflict\nmust provide for the maintenance of the territorial integrity\nof the Republic of Moldova and for its sovereignty over the\nwhole country. It was this spirit that led this year to the\nsolution of the conflict situation in the southern region of\nMoldova, which is populated by over 100,000 Gagauz who\nobtained, under the Constitution, the status of administrative\nterritorial autonomy.\nAs for the latest developments in the negotiations with\nTiraspol, I should mention that a certain amount of progress\nhas already been made, particularly in the matter of the re-\nestablishment of economic links between Transdniester and\nthe rest of the country.\nAt the same time, we believe that a political settlement\nof the conflict in this area could be achieved through the\norderly and unconditional withdrawal of military troops of\nthe Russian Federation from the territory of our country, in\nconformity with the Moldovan-Russian agreement and the\nresolutions of the Organization for Security and\nCooperation in Europe (OSCE).\nIn this regard, we are still concerned that, although the\nMoldovan-Russian agreement was signed last year by the\nHeads of Government of the Republic of Moldova and the\nRussian Federation, in the presence of Presidents Mircea\nSnegur and Boris Yeltsin, it has not yet been brought into\nforce by the Russian side. I take this opportunity to voice\nour sincere hope that the competent authorities of the\nRussian Federation will speed up the procedure for the\nratification of this document, in accordance with their\nobligations. I must emphasize that any possible failure to\nimplement this important agreement might incur the risk of\ndestabilizing the situation in the eastern districts of\nMoldova, as well as the real danger that a part of the\narmaments of the Fourteenth Army will be seized by the\nseparatist forces of the Transdniester.\nWe hope that the competent authorities of the\nRussian Federation will as soon as possible set up\neffective machinery for the withdrawal of Russian troops\nand armaments from Moldova, in accordance with the\nbilateral agreement I have mentioned and the decisions\nadopted by the OSCE Budapest Summit.\nThe jubilee year of the United Nations is not only an\nanniversary but also an occasion for a lucid assessment of\nthe achievements and failures of the first 50 years of the\nOrganization\u2019s existence. In this respect, I want to\nemphasize that the United Nations has made an important\ncontribution in the search for and identification of\nsolutions to the numerous urgent problems at the global,\nregional and national levels. Even if it has not managed\nto prevent or eliminate regional or local conflicts, the\nOrganization has played an essential role in preventing\nthe outbreak of a world conflagration.\nThe evolution of international relations over the past\nyears has provided favourable conditions for redefining\nthe role of the United Nations and for adapting it better\nto the new realities of international life in the context of\nthe next millennium. If this is to be achieved, there will\nhave to be a new vision, as well as a redefinition of\nconcrete machinery for achieving the fundamental\nobjectives of the Organization, as inscribed in the Charter.\nAlong the same lines, I should say that recent years\nhave been marked by the appearance of new concepts,\nwhich could serve as a basis for the diversification of\nmachinery for action in various fields of United Nations\nactivity.\nWith regard to the maintenance of international\npeace and security, there have been unprecedented\nqualitative and quantitative changes. As is well known,\nthe peace-keeping operations currently being undertaken\non four continents, and their mandates, continue to\ndiversify \u2014 electoral and humanitarian activities, support\nfor institutional reconstruction, monitoring of the\nobservance of human rights, and so on. At the same time,\nnew methods of dealing with crises have been\nproposed \u2014 for example, stand-by arrangements and\nrapid-reaction forces. In this context, we expect that there\nwill be a considerable increase in the operational capacity\nof the United Nations in the field of the maintenance of\npeace, provided that Member States support the adoption\nof these new proposals.\n17\n\n\nWe support unreservedly the importance the Secretary-\nGeneral, in his report \u201cAn Agenda for Peace\u201d, attaches to\nconflict-prevention machinery.\nAll these initiatives confirm the preoccupation of the\nUnited Nations with regard to the adoption of a coherent\napproach to problems of peace and security. At the same\ntime, noticeable attention is being paid to the study of\ndevelopment topics. The particular interest of Member\nStates in the Agenda for Development confirms the\ntopicality of these problems and the need to revitalize the\nworld Organization in this area.\nIn this context, I should like to make the point that, in\nview of the interdependence between peace and security, on\nthe one hand, and social and economic development, on the\nother, it would be worthwhile for the United Nations to\ncreate an integrated system for implementation of the\nstrategies and polices agreed upon by States. All United\nNations activities, including peace-keeping and social and\neconomic development programmes, should be\ncomplementary. At the same time, the decisions of high-\nlevel international conferences should find concrete\nexpression in the actions of States and of United Nations\nagencies.\nIn our opinion, in the attainment of these aims it is\nnecessary to avoid excessive politization of certain specific\naspects of each field and, at the same time, find the areas\nthat are of interest to all Member States. The United\nNations system must, through its expertise and global\nvision, ensure a climate of cooperation and mutual\nconfidence, without which there will be no solutions to the\nproblems of peace and development.\nThe Republic of Moldova, which is deeply committed\nto the purposes and principles of the United Nations\nCharter, is prepared to make its contribution and to support\nthe Organization\u2019s efforts to adapt better to the fast and\nprofound changes in the modern world. We are fully aware\nof the major role of the United Nations in consolidating the\npositive trends of recent years in the international arena and\nof the need to increase the effectiveness of its activities. We\ntherefore welcome the proposals aimed at enhancing that effectiveness.\nNaturally, we ourselves are well aware that the\nOrganization cannot attain these objectives unless the\nMember States put the necessary resources at its disposal.\nThat is why we pay special attention to this question and\ntry to do our utmost to fulfil our obligations. We consider\nit necessary that the responsible United Nations structures\nadopt adequate measures to avoid waste, to ensure better\nuse of the resources entrusted to it.\nIn this context, I want to refer to the problem of\ncontributions. I am obliged to point out that for four years\nour country has carried the burden of a quota inequitably\ncalculated and set at too high a level in relation to its real\ncapacity to pay. The artificiality of this calculation is also\nproved by the paradox that certain countries at a similar\nlevel of development and with populations and territories\ntwice or three times larger than ours make contributions\nsmaller than or equal to that of the Republic of Moldova.\nI imagine that some other recently independent States are\nexperiencing the same situation. This, together with the\ncosts of transition, could explain our current arrears. We\nbelieve that this matter needs to be taken into account at\nmeetings of working groups of the General Assembly\nwhen they examine the possibility of introducing penalties\nagainst the countries that are in arrears.\nIn our view, the process of diversifying the relations\nand the collaboration between States has enhanced the\ndevelopment of regional and subregional cooperation. As\na matter of fact, the Charter itself puts particular emphasis\non the regional organizations. Documents laying the bases\nfor collaboration between the United Nations and regional\norganizations in various fields have been drawn up and\nadopted in recent years.\nSeveral General Assembly resolutions relating to\ncooperation between the United Nations, on the one hand,\nand the OSCE, the League of Arab States and the\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference, on the other, are\nrelevant in this regard. At present such cooperation is\nbecoming increasingly diversified, covering new areas.\nSome regional organizations have acquired new\ncompetencies, including in the field of peace and security,\nand have thereby become partners of the United Nations\nin the settlement of some local conflicts. We hope that in\nthe near future recently created regional organizations and\ngroupings will be able to set up a cooperation framework\nwith the United Nations, similar to the one already\nexisting with other regional organizations. The Republic\nof Moldova thinks this trend should be encouraged.\nAt the same time, we consider that any decision of\nthe United Nations to transfer various activities within its\nsphere of competence to other international organizations,\nespecially in the maintenance of international peace and\nsecurity, implies major consequences for the security,\nintegrity and independence of States in the respective\nregions. That is why the United Nations should continue\n18\n\n\nto exercise its competence under Articles 34 and 35 of the\nCharter, according to which the Security Council and the\nGeneral Assembly are the main organs for dealing with and\nsettling conflicts having regional implications.\nIn conclusion, I should like to express the hope that\nthe proceedings of the fiftieth anniversary session of the\nGeneral Assembly of the United Nations will be carried\nout in an atmosphere of solidarity, of a realistic and\nconstructive approach to the complex issues confronting\nthe world at the end of this century. The delegation of the\nRepublic of Moldova is prepared to contribute, alongside\nother Member States, to the fulfilment of the lofty goals\nof the United Nations.\nThe meeting rose at 12.25 p.m.\n19\n"

        "file_text": "Like previous speakers, I should like to convey to the\nPresident of the fiftieth session of the General Assembly\nour warmest congratulations on his election to the\npresidency of the Assembly. As a representative of a\ncountry close to us, Portugal, he will, I am certain,\ndischarge skilfully and effectively his difficult\nresponsibilities in leading our deliberations.\nThe President of our Council, Mr. Javier Solana, has\nrecently explained the position of the European Union on\nthe work of the United Nations and on the major challenges\nit is called upon to face. Those are also the views of my\ndelegation. I welcome the promising prospects opening up\nin the Balkans and the Middle East. As for Chechnya, I\nmust, on the other hand, regret that the parties have been\nlagging behind in restoring peace to that sorely tried region\nin the past year.\nIn the former Yugoslavia, dramatic developments in\nrecent months have changed substantially the nature of the\nconflict there. After years of civil war, atrocities and\n\u201cethnic cleansing\u201d, we now see a glimmer of hope\nemerging. I welcome the recent agreements in Geneva\nbetween the warring parties, as well as that on the opening\nup of Sarajevo, which was arrived at thanks to the\nmediation efforts and the commitment of the American\nspecial envoy, Mr. Richard Holbrooke. I am, however, not\nunaware of the fact that negotiations on a comprehensive\nsettlement will be lengthy and that its implementation will\nbe a difficult task.\nThe Government of Luxembourg is prepared to take\npart in the reconstruction effort as long as certain\nconditions are met: the effective implementation of a\ncomprehensive settlement, the implementation of a\ndisarmament plan and respect for human rights and for\nminorities, including the right of return.\nIn the Middle East, negotiations for the conclusion\nof a second agreement on the autonomy of the occupied\nterritories have just been concluded. Mr. Rabin and Mr.\nPeres, as well as Mr. Arafat, have shown exemplary\ntenacity and political will, and they deserve our warmest\ncongratulations.\nWe are all called upon to help in the success of this\nvast endeavour for peace now under way. My\nGovernment has launched an important action for\ncooperation in development in the occupied territories. It\nwill also send observers to the forthcoming elections,\nwhich will be the decisive test for the creation of a civil\nand democratic society.\nMy country notes with satisfaction the indefinite\nextension last May of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation\nof Nuclear Weapons (NPT). It appeals urgently to the\nnuclear-weapon Powers to renounce any new testing and\nto comply with the current moratorium. Such a decision\nwould help to create a climate favourable to the\nconclusion in 1996 of a global treaty on the banning of\nnuclear testing, one which is suitably verifiable.\nThe Fourth World Conference on Women has just\nconcluded in Beijing. My Government commends the\nprogress achieved at that Conference. It hails the fact that,\nfor the first time, the rights of women are recognized as\nan integral and indivisible part of all human rights and\nfundamental freedoms. In particular, we have in mind the\nrecognition of the right of all women to control their\nsexual health and their access, on an equal footing, to\neconomic resources. The \u201cright to be different\u201d claimed\nby religious fundamentalists should not hamper the\nimplementation of these new principles.\nThe events of some time ago led us to believe that\nthe old bipolar world was a thing of the past and that a\nnew world order was automatically about to succeed it.\nUnfortunately, reality has not confirmed that hope. The\nmultipolar world in which we live has not at all become\nmore unified, nor more supportive, nor safer. Ethnic\nconflicts have broken out in many parts of the world.\nNarrow-minded nationalism has gained adherents, and\npolitical and religious intolerance is spreading.\nWe thought that with increased international\ncooperation, the role of multinational organizations would\nincrease. This has not always been the case. Often, the\nrole of our Organization has been ill perceived or badly\npresented to the public.\n15\n\n\nIn many cases, the image given of the United Nations\nseems unfair. It does not take into account the many\nconstraints under which the United Nations functions. Very\noften, the critics are aiming at the wrong target, forgetting\nthat it is Member States that prevent the United Nations\neither from taking decisions or by acting, by denying it the\nnecessary resources.\nThe political commitment of Member States is often\nnot commensurate with the ever-growing responsibilities of\nthe United Nations.\nOur Organization must then today come to grips with\na new situation arising from the fact that most current\nconflicts take place within the borders of a single State, and\nno longer pit States against each other. Intervention\nconstitutes an interference that only the United Nations can\nlegitimize.\nThese ethnic or religious conflicts, whose origins\nderive from economic and social issues, are the result not\nonly of regular armies, but of militias and clans. The\ncivilian population is often the first victim, if not the main\ntarget.\nThe missions demanded of the United Nations are also\nbecoming more and more complex, difficult and dangerous.\nThe United Nations is called upon to maintain peace, but\noften there is no peace to keep.\nThe United Nations has none the less had a number of\nsuccesses which have been important but which the media\nhave tended to minimize, be they in Namibia, Cambodia,\nEl Salvador, Mozambique or Haiti. In those countries, the\nUnited Nations has helped peoples to overcome years of\ncivil war and to channel their energies into building\ndemocratic nations.\nThese positive and courageous actions contrast with\nother, rather timid reactions to conflicts that threaten the\nlives of thousands of civilians and expose them to terrible\nviolations of their basic rights. This was the case in\nRwanda and was long also the case in the former\nYugoslavia, even if the international community has\nprovided substantial humanitarian assistance and helped to\nease the suffering of the victims. But as long as the United\nNations does not adopt a more defined and resolute\napproach that would allow it to prevent such catastrophes,\nthe effectiveness and credibility of our Organization run the\nrisk of being called into question.\nAs I have just emphasized with regard to the\nconflicts in the former Yugoslavia, we must learn from\nour failures and near-successes. My country encourages\nefforts to provide the United Nations with its own rapid-\nreaction capacity. But the Organization should also\ndetermine whether increased cooperation with specialized\nregional organizations, such as the North Atlantic Treaty\nOrganization or the European Union, might not in certain\ncases be both more effective and more economical. At\nany rate, any new United Nations operation should be\nestablished only on the basis of a military appraisal as\nwell. Furthermore, the United Nations should see to it that\nthe commanders of an operation are given sufficient\nmilitary resources and clear, consistent political\nguidelines.\nOur era has witnessed spectacular developments at\nthe national level. The concept of the State has been\ncalled into question as both a mechanism for solving\nnational problems and a basic element of the international\nsystem. States find themselves increasingly threatened\nwith disintegration, their citizens seeking to escape the\noppression of rigid structures and demanding to become\npart of ever more narrowly defined ethnic groups.\nIn such a context, democracy would seem to be the\nbest means of ensuring the viability of the State as\nmanager of public affairs and guarantor of progress. At\nthe national level, democracy provides the stability\nnecessary for peace by ensuring respect for human rights\nand allowing the population to express its will. At the\nregional level, as in Europe, it involves States, large and\nsmall, in joint decision-making and contributes to\ndevelopment by encouraging cooperation and fostering\npeace. Democratic States do not war with each other.\nIt is thus an important duty of the international\ncommunity to promote democracy among and within\nStates by helping them to build a democratic system; by\nproviding them with logistical and technical support for\nthe organization of free elections; by promoting the\ncreation of a public sector to guarantee the proper\nmanagement of State affairs; and by providing the various\nsectors of civil society with the resources to consolidate\nthe bases of democracy. The Government of Luxembourg\nprovides tangible support to the activities of our\nOrganization in this sphere.\nIn our view, the promotion of human rights is\nanother priority area. In particular, the adoption of the\nConvention on the Rights of the Child represents a large\nstep forward. This Convention is a valuable instrument\n16\n\n\nthat helps to protect children from physical and mental\nabuse. It is therefore essential for Governments that have\nratified the Convention to adopt and implement the\nnecessary national legislation. The General Assembly has\ninitiated international activity on behalf of millions of street\nchildren. My Government proposes that a similar effort be\nundertaken to assist millions of children who work by\nnecessity or even compulsion.\nIt is unacceptable, indeed intolerable, that at the end\nof the twentieth century more than a billion people live in\nabject poverty and almost 1.5 billion men, women and\nchildren lack sufficient food and drinking water and have\nno access to education or the most elementary health care.\nTo be sure, certain parts of the South today are enjoying\nremarkable development. But others, on the African\ncontinent in particular, seem to have been left behind by the\nprogress from which the world economy as a whole has\nbenefited.\nIt is also alarming that inequalities both within\ncountries and between the countries of the South and the\nNorth are growing rather than shrinking, and that the richest\nfifth of mankind owns more than four-fifths of the world\u2019s\nsocial product while the poorest fifth must content itself\nwith 1.4 per cent.\nAs concerns the developing countries, we have a duty\nto be supportive. This support should supplement and\nstrengthen the efforts which these countries must undertake\nat the national level. Luxembourg has doubled its\ndevelopment assistance in just a few years. It has\ncommitted itself to the goal of achieving 0.7 per cent in\nofficial development assistance before the end of the\ncentury. It would also like to see new progress achieved in\nreducing the debt that continues to paralyse the\ndevelopment of many developing countries.\nOur Organization must play a central role as the major\ninstitution for international cooperation at the global level.\nThis was in fact envisaged by our Charter. The Preamble\nstresses the need to promote \u201cthe economic and social\nadvancement of all peoples\u201d and thereby makes\ndevelopment one of the principal goals of our Organization.\nFifty years after the creation of the United Nations, we\nbelieve that the time has come to begin an in-depth review\nof the activities and structures of the Organization in the\neconomic and social spheres, taking into account the far-\nreaching changes that have occurred and the growing\nglobalization of problems. This review should take\ncognizance of the fact that countries are being faced with\nnew phenomena that are often diverse but are alike in\nreaching beyond national borders.\nI am thinking, inter alia, of such health problems as\nAIDS or of such environmental problems as the depletion\nof the ozone layer and global warming. There are also\nsuch social phenomena as population growth, the pressure\nof migration, the problem of refugees, and violations of\nhuman rights. Other trans-border issues that are of\nincreasing concern are drug trafficking, and new forms of\nviolence and crime and even international terrorism.\nWe need an effective system built on these realities\nand better able to take into account the interests of all\nmankind, the poorest in particular. Such a system should\nbe able to define integrated policies and lay down clear,\ncoherent guidelines. Cooperation between international\nfinancial institutions and the United Nations system\nshould be organized with this in view.\nOnly the United Nations has the necessary\nlegitimacy and authority for such reform. The work of\nrenewal and clarification that has begun with the Agenda\nfor Development is a natural component of this global\nperspective. My country, together with its partners in the\nEuropean Union, intends to make an active contribution\nto the discussion to be held on this subject.\nOn the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations,\nseveral focus groups have considered the challenges\nfacing humanity and the ability of the United Nations to\nmeet them. In particular, I would refer to the Carlsson-\nRamphal Commission, which submitted the report entitled\n\u201cOn Global Governance\u201d, and an independent working\ngroup on the future of the United Nations which the\nSecretary-General himself established and which delivered\nthe results of its study last June. These two reports set\nforth a number of potential reforms and make concrete\nproposals, including one to create an economic security\ncouncil.\nI believe that these proposals are a valuable source\nof inspiration and make an important contribution to the\nreform work that should be pursued and intensified. I\nattach great importance to the consideration of these\nreports, which our Assembly has entrusted to the high-\nlevel Working Group recently set up in the framework of\nthe strengthening of the United Nations system.\nBefore concluding I should like to deal with two\nissues concerning the reform process begun by the\nOrganization \u2014 expanding the Security Council, and\n17\n\n\nputting the finances of the United Nations on a sound\nfooting.\nThe Security Council today is invested with enormous\nresponsibilities. Its decisions commit all Member States and\nhave a decisive impact on the fate of millions of human\nbeings. The Security Council must therefore reflect as\nfaithfully as possible the determination of the international\ncommunity as a whole. A Security Council more\nrepresentative of today\u2019s world would strengthen the\nlegitimacy of its actions and facilitate the implementation\nof its decisions.\nMy Government is in favour of a balanced increase\nthat would involve the admission to the Council of new\npermanent and non-permanent members from both the\nNorth and the South. In particular we would like\npermanent-member status to be acknowledged for economic\nPowers whose positive role in international affairs has long\nbeen recognized.\nThe improved representativeness of the Security\nCouncil cannot be achieved only by remaking its\nmembership: it also requires greater transparency in its\ndecision-making processes. Dialogue with other Members\nof the Organization, especially those countries that\ncontribute troops for peace-keeping operations, must be\nenhanced.\nFinally, the time has come to delete from the Charter\nreferences to \u201cenemy States\u201d which have not existed for a\nlong time now.\nEach and every one of us is aware of the seriousness\nof the financial crisis that the Organization faces. It results\nnot only from sums disbursed, which are relatively speaking\nvery modest if we compare them to sums invested\nelsewhere. It results essentially from the failure of Member\nStates which fulfil inadequately, if at all, their obligation to\npay their contributions to the budget of the Organization.\nEach and every State is bound under the Charter to pay its\ncontributions on time and in full.\nThe Luxembourg Government is in favour of a\nmonitoring mechanism that would ensure the proper\nmanagement of the United Nations system.\nOn the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the\nUnited Nations, Member States should endeavour to define\nan approach that could confer on the Organization new\nlegitimacy and credibility for the next century. This will\nsucceed only if they involve in this effort representatives of\ncivil society and, in particular, those of non-governmental\norganizations.\nBut in the final analysis the proper functioning and\nefficiency of the United Nations depend first and foremost\non the political support that Member States, especially the\nmost powerful, give to multilateralism, as well as the\npolitical, military and financial resources they are\nprepared to make available to international organizations.\n\n"

We are confident that his\nbroad experience and ability will afford us sure guidance\nat this historic session of the General Assembly, which\nmarks half a century of the United Nations.\nI would also like to pay tribute to the outgoing\nPresident of the General Assembly at its forty-ninth\nsession, His Excellency Mr. Amara Essy of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire,\nwho so successfully presided over the session with great\nskill and expertise. He leaves the presidency with a record\nof successes that has enhanced the Assembly\u2019s\ndeliberative role.\nMy delegation would also like to put on record its\nappreciation for the Secretary-General, His Excellency\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, who has continued to lead the\nOrganization with skill and tenacity under trying\ncircumstances.\nAs we observe and celebrate the fiftieth anniversary\nof the founding of the United Nations, we should also\ntake this opportunity to take stock of the Organization\u2019s\npast performance, evaluating its achievements and\nfailures, and then proceed to map out our future direction.\nIt cannot be disputed that the United Nations has\nmade outstanding contributions to world peace and\nsecurity and the promotion of development throughout the\nworld.\nThe United Nations has conducted successful peace-\nkeeping operations in various parts of the world, including\nCambodia, Mozambique, Haiti and, very recently, Angola.\nIt is also as a result of United Nations engagement\nthat the world is now entering an era in which the ideals\nof human rights and democracy are gaining support in\nmany countries. The United Nations is on record as\nhaving provided electoral assistance to over 40 countries.\n5\n\n\nThis has gone a long way in ensuring free and fair\nelections.\nThe United Nations has been a strong source of relief\nfrom human suffering. Through the Office of the United\nNations High Commissioner for Refugees, the United\nNations has provided food, shelter, medicine and education\nfor millions of refugees the world over.\nVery recently, in 1990, through the efforts of our\nSecretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, and the\npersonal dedication to children of the late James Grant, the\nWorld Summit for Children was convened here in New\nYork, where the Convention on the Rights of the Child was\nadopted. This Convention has become the first to receive\nuniversal acceptance. This is a remarkable achievement in\nitself.\nAgainst this background of achievements, the\nOrganization has had to deal with many formidable\nproblems, such as the super-Power rivalry of the cold-war\nera, which resulted in a long period of paralysis in terms of\nthe Organization\u2019s ability to take quick and effective\ndecisions and in the increasing number of ethnic conflicts\nand tensions around the world, as evidenced by conflicts in\nBosnia and Herzegovina, Rwanda, Burundi, Somalia and\nGeorgia, among others.\nThe continued unfavourable international economic\nsituation and environmental degradation are serious\nchallenges that the United Nations has had to deal with.\nZambia is convinced that the United Nations remains\nthe only world body with the capacity to galvanize political\nwill to face these challenges as we approach the twenty-\nfirst century. As a country and Member State, we take this\nopportunity to reaffirm and renew our commitment to the\nUnited Nations.\nIt is quite clear that the United Nations will require a\nrenewed vision for the next 50 years. The agenda to disarm\nthroughout the world is not complete. My delegation\nstrongly feels that as long as there is continued proliferation\nof weapons, there can never be any hope for lasting peace\nand security in any corner of the world.\nMy delegation, therefore, welcomes the successful\nconclusion, early this year, of the Review and Extension\nConference of the Parties to the Treaty on the\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT); the Treaty\nwas extended indefinitely. My delegation wishes to express\nour grave concern that, soon after the extension, some of\nthe signatories to the NPT have resumed nuclear tests.\nThis is not in the spirit of nuclear disarmament. We also\ncongratulate those that have continued to observe their\nmoratoriums and hope that they will not be swayed by\nthose that are embarking on nuclear testing.\nZambia takes note of the ongoing negotiations in\nGeneva on a comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty\n(CTBT), and urges a speedy and successful completion of\nthat treaty. We also welcome the efforts to strengthen the\nBiological and Toxic Weapons Convention.\nHowever, in spite of all these positive developments\nin the area of disarmament, there are, of course, other\ncritical areas, such as complete and general disarmament,\nnuclear technology, nuclear-weapon-free zones, mine\nclearance as well as peaceful uses of nuclear energy, that\nremain unresolved. We therefore urge all concerned to\ngive special attention to such issues, in the hope that this\nwill enhance security guarantees.\nThe issue of specific concern to southern Africa,\nwhich has emerged from a long period of conflict, is land\nmine clearance. Many of our people continue to die from\nuncleared land mines. Accordingly, we call upon the\ninternational community to increase its support for the\nregional efforts being carried out through the Southern\nAfrican Development Community to de-mine the affected\nareas in the southern Africa region. In this regard, we\nwish to express our appreciation to the European Union,\nwhich continues to support our efforts in mine clearance.\nIn the area of peace-keeping, Zambia realizes that\npursuing peace has not been an easy task for the United\nNations and is not likely to be so in the foreseeable\nfuture. The Organization needs a clear vision of what\nmust be done in each particular case. The Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s Agenda for Peace, we believe, provides that\nvision. It is an important agenda, which has already\nassisted in many areas of our peace-keeping operations.\nWe are aware that a quick and effective response in\ntime of conflicts depends on a number of important\nfactors, especially the political will by the Member States\nto meet resource requirements. In this respect, Zambia\nsupports the establishment of a rapid- reaction-capability\nforce, which we believe will enhance peace-keeping\noperations and save lives.\nThe protection, promotion and enjoyment of human\nrights is an obligation Governments and peoples the world\nover must uphold. The dignity of life cannot be enhanced\n6\n\n\nwithout full observance of human rights. Zambia therefore\nbelieves that the United Nations must continue to give high\npriority to human rights issues.\nIn this regard, Zambia is gratified that the Fourth\nWorld Conference on Women, recently held in Beijing,\nChina, recognized that women\u2019s rights are human rights,\nand that Governments committed themselves to the\nimplementation of that human rights agenda.\nThe Beijing conference and the other recent United\nNations conferences \u2014 the World Conference on Human\nRights, the International Conference on Population and\nDevelopment and the World Social Summit \u2014 will all need\nactive and integrated follow-up throughout the United\nNations system. In this follow-up, the roles of the General\nAssembly and the Economic and Social Council are crucial\nnot only for the efficient implementation of the programmes\nof action, but also for strengthening the Organization in the\nsocial and economic fields. Zambia recognizes the urgent\nneed to revitalize the Council\u2019s functions, including\nimproved and enhanced utilization of its various functional\ncommittees. Harmonization of institutional arrangements in\nthe entire United Nations system will need to be undertaken\nas a matter of priority.\nIn terms of the reform of the Security Council, Zambia\nbelieves it is necessary to expand the Security Council to\nenable it to become more representative. It is also our view\nthat the Security Council needs to become democratic and\ntransparent.\nZambia would like to see the United Nations give\npriority to addressing developmental issues in the new\nmillennium. In this regard, I wish to state that Zambia\nattaches great importance to the realization of the Agenda\nfor Development. Development is a critical area of concern\nfor my own continent, Africa, where poverty,\nunemployment and social exclusion affect virtually every\ncountry. As we approach the twenty-first century, the\ninternational community should give added emphasis to the\nfight against poverty. By fighting poverty, we can assure\nthe progress of individuals, which is essential to the\nsustained progress of all nations.\nZambia is therefore gratified that the World Summit\nfor Social Development committed itself to accelerating the\neconomic, social and human resources development of\nAfrica and the least developed countries. The World\nSummit for Social Development, held in Copenhagen,\nDenmark, in March this year, has, through its Declaration\nand Programme of Action, challenged Governments the\nworld over to create opportunities through employment\ngeneration and social integration that should eradicate\npoverty. My delegation hopes that Governments will\nimplement its Programme of Action.\nThe poverty obtaining in many developing countries\nis being exacerbated by the onerous debt burdens most of\nthese countries have continued to carry since the early\n1980s. The Naples terms, with the potential to achieve a\n67 per cent debt reduction on either export credits or debt\nservice, is only the beginning in offering durable debt\nrelief to developing countries, especially with regard to\nthose with very high debt service ratios. The creditor\ncountries should move beyond modesty and offer terms\nthat can in the shortest possible time frame reduce debt\nservice ratios of the poorest developing countries to 21\nper cent of their export earnings. This is the level\nrecognized by the United Nations as the basic minimum\nrequirement to ensure that the poorest developing\ncountries overcome their debt problems and re-establish\ncredit-worthiness. Coupled with the sustained\nunderfunding of many structural adjustment programmes,\na modest approach on promoting debt reduction can only\nhave the ultimate result of undermining opportunities for\ngrowth, development and prosperity in developing\ncountries.\nAs the World Trade Organization begins its\nformative years, a new challenge from this institution is\nemerging in developing countries that will add to the\nchallenges of external debt burdens and poverty. This is\nthe challenge of registering early net losses from the new\nsystem of multilateral trade as preferences are removed,\nfood prices rise, subsidies decrease and commodity\nexports continue to face marginalization. This is\nespecially pronounced for Africa, which, as we all know,\nhas already recorded more than a decade of austerity.\nWhile we recognize the long-term opportunities\ndeveloping countries will gain from the World Trade\nOrganization, it still remains the duty of developed\ncountries to make good their pledges reaffirmed at\nMarrakesh to compensate net losers in the new system of\nmultilateral trade, by quickly specifying the terms of\ncompensation.\nZambia realizes that establishing the foundations of\ninternational competitiveness is the key to getting a\nfoothold in the world economy. Our reform measures,\nwhich started in 1991, are gaining momentum. The\nchallenge now is to move away from concerns over\nstabilization and liberalization to the stimulation of\nproduction, employment and labour productivity as the\n7\n\n\nbasic foundations for poverty reduction. This is being done\nat the same time as we are building on complementarities\nalready established in the regional integration mechanisms\nof the Southern African Development Community and the\nCommon Market for Eastern and Southern Africa, of which\nZambia is a member. However, our domestic reform efforts\ncan only be sustained by generous debt reduction that\nimproves our cash-flow position to levels which regenerate\nbusiness confidence in Zambia. The debt overhang remains\nthe single biggest barrier to recovery and development in\nZambia.\nIn conclusion, I would like to state that Zambia will\nremain actively committed to achieving these priorities in\nthe framework of the United Nations. We believe in the\nUnited Nations and have every confidence that our\nOrganization will lead us into a new era of full of hope and\nprosperity.\n\n"

        "file_text": "Please allow me to offer sincere\ncongratulations to Mr. Freitas do Amaral of Portugal on his\nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly.\nI would like to emphasize that this session of the\nGeneral Assembly, in the year of the fiftieth anniversary of\nthe United Nations, will occupy a special place in the\nhistory of the Organization. In that context, on behalf of\nTurkmenistan and President Niyazov, I wish to express our\nsincere appreciation to the Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros\nBoutros-Ghali, for his tireless efforts to build a new kind of\ninternational relations for the Organization.\nThe opportunity for our State to participate in the\naffairs of the world community as an independent entity\nflowed, of course, from those events that the Secretary-\nGeneral, in his report on the work of the Organization,\ndescribes as\n\u201cthe momentum in world affairs that appeared so\ndramatically at the outset of this decade.\u201d (A/50/1,\npara. 4)\nSerenely, and immensely grateful for its good fortune,\nTurkmenistan embarked on its independent course and,\nwithout any political romanticism, began to carry out its\nprogramme of building a nation-State and a system of\nforeign ties and seeking optimal ways for participating in\ninternational relations. This was a quest for Turkmenistan\u2019s\nplace in the United Nations system and a model of\nstatehood reflecting its national mentality and the traditions\nof the Turkmen people.\nSince that time, in our four years of independent\nexistence, we have travelled a great distance, and each step\nwe have taken along the way has been both in the national\ninterest of Turkmenistan and in the interest of stabilizing\nthe region and strengthening international security, in the\nconstant conviction that these two are inseparable.\nAfter engaging in broad contacts within the system of\nAsian States, we have once again become convinced of the\ncorrectness of the conclusion drawn at the beginning of\nthis century that Asia, with its enormous human, natural\nand intellectual resources, had every possibility of\nbecoming the most prosperous region in the world.\nHowever, throughout the entire history of the Asian\ncontinent, instability and protracted regional conflicts have\noften, unfortunately, constituted the political background,\nand this has significantly complicated the solution of\nproblems of internal development.\nTurkmenistan has set as its main priority the\npreservation of internal stability and social peace in\ncarrying out radical reforms in building its State and its\neconomy. This is vitally necessary in order for us to take\nadvantage of our enormous resource potential. But that\nimportant condition is not the only one: the other is\nstability around us so that we can freely and naturally\ndevelop our trade and economic relations with other\nStates. This question is of special interest, in view of the\nworld\u2019s share of hydrocarbon deposits and other mineral\nand biological resources that Turkmenistan possesses.\nTurkmenistan is at one of the world\u2019s important\ncrossroads of political and economic interests, in a\nregional dimension and beyond. Aware of this geopolitical\nreality, Turkmenistan is prepared to participate in the\nmost constructive way in establishing new relations in the\nregion and to promote efforts to establish there overall\nstability, security and effective and mutually advantageous\ncooperation on the basis of the principles of the United\nNations.\nWe believe that with the breakup of the Soviet\nUnion and the Iron Curtain\u2019s disappearance from its\nborders with its southern neighbours, a new region has\nemerged, a new community of States of Central Asia, the\nMiddle East, South-West Asia, the Caucasus and part of\nthe Near East. This region is united by common\ndevelopment interests, the restoration of historical trade\nand economic relations and cultural and humanitarian\ntraditions.\nThis was the logic that led to the idea of active\nparticipation in the Economic Cooperation Organization\n(ECO). I would like to emphasize that the ECO\u2019s\nconfiguration fully corresponds to our concept of a new\nregion\u2019s emergence following the disintegration of the\nUnion of Soviet Socialist Republics: the restoration of a\nnatural gravitational attraction between these States that\nfor decades were artificially divided by an ideological\nbarrier, which conditions for them the priority of\ntransportation, telecommunications and energy\n34\n\n\nprogrammes. Underlying these processes lies the principle\nof absolute economic feasibility, based on the mutual\ninterests of the member States of the ECO and the absence\nof any political, territorial or other disputes between them.\nAs for the internal tensions that persist in some\ncountries, we should stress that economic cooperation,\nparticipation and joint projects will create fertile soil for\nconstructive solutions to these problems. Turkmenistan\nbelieves that this 10-country organization, emerging at such\nan important time, will open up additional possibilities for\nthe newly independent States to the south of the former\nUnion of Soviet Socialist Republics.\nFurthermore, the basis of our political and economic\nstrategy is the principle of reasonable pragmatism and the\npreservation of positive experiences and ties from the past.\nWe have a politically new type of State. Its independent\nstatus cannot be achieved by denying the realities of the\npast and old ties that can still serve our higher interests\ntoday. In this respect, our relations with Russia and other\npartners in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS)\nhave remained a key component of Turkmenistan\u2019s foreign\npolicy.\nI would like to lay special emphasis on the fact that\nthe obligations that neutral Turkmenistan has assumed have\nbeen set out in our Constitution and have been supported by\nthe people. These obligations not only take account of\nnational interests but also objectively promote the\ndevelopment of cooperation in the region, and they have\nenormous potential for stimulating the peacemaking\nprocesses in the area and for promoting the efforts of the\nworld community, primarily here at the United Nations, to\nrid it of obsolete measures and adopt preventive measures\nto defuse disputes and conflicts.\nI would like to set out some parameters of\nTurkmenistan\u2019s neutrality initiative in order to make sure\nthat it is correctly understood by our partners in the United\nNations and supported by them as well.\nThe rapid pace of recent events determined the\nchanges in Asia\u2019s geopolitical and geo-economic situation.\nThe nature and direction of inter-State and regional\nprocesses, an important component of some of these\nchanges, has resulted in the formation of new, independent\nStates, each having chosen its own independent path of\ndevelopment and having its own interests. One of the ways\nin which the uniqueness of each country has been\nmanifested is in its political path, as is natural. For each\ncountry that path is based on the people\u2019s historical roots,\nmentality and psychological make-up. Turkmenistan is no\nexception to this. Merging the prospects for its own\ndevelopment with the direction and nature of regional and\ncontinental processes and linking national interests with\nthe objective requirements of the day \u2014 from this\ntheoretical and practical basis we have arrived at the need\nto proclaim neutrality as a principle and instrument of\nTurkmenistan\u2019s foreign policy. We are pleased that our\nneutrality initiative is finding more and more support,\nattracting civil and political interest and receiving broad\ninternational recognition. We are grateful to the Secretary-\nGeneral, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for providing\nTurkmenistan with assistance in this regard.\nIn the context of asserting itself as a neutral State,\nTurkmenistan requested admission to the Non-Aligned\nMovement as a full-fledged member. We hope that during\nthe non-aligned summit in Cartagena, Colombia,\nTurkmenistan\u2019s membership will be confirmed. In this\ncontext, I would like to state Turkmenistan\u2019s conviction\nthat the idea of non-alignment is both a vital and a viable\none. We do not share the view that it is archaic. We\nbelieve that we must not participate in the two conflicting\nglobal systems and that we need to turn to an idea of\nnon-participation in the various rigid regional blocs,\nmulti-State formations capable of generating considerable\ndestructive force. Turkmenistan advocates non-alignment,\nas well as non-participation in improper acts of\nintervention in the internal affairs of States, non-\nparticipation in efforts for global or regional dominance\nand non-participation in schemes to limit the role of the\nUnited Nations or weaken the universal and proven\nmachinery for implementing global policy. Such practices\nserve selfish purposes.\nWe are convinced that the use of military force to\nsolve existing conflicts has no future, but that negotiations\nare effective. Although seeking peaceful means is\ncomplex, alternatives do not exist. At the same time, we\nunderstand that without active efforts, without good will,\nit will hardly be possible to attain the desired result.\nTherefore, inter alia, while not intervening in the Tajik\nconflict, we are prepared to play a role in holding the\nnext round of inter-Tajik negotiations. We welcome and\ncommend the peacemaking efforts of the United Nations\nand Russia, Iran, Pakistan and other countries in this\nprocess.\nNaturally, we must be concerned at the situation\nunfolding in neighbouring Afghanistan. Supporting\ncontacts with the central Government in Kabul, as well as\nwith regional leaders, we believe that the Afghans must\n35\n\n\nbe helped to demonstrate their ability to achieve peace and\nconsensus in their country, and that attempts to intervene in\nAfghanistan\u2019s internal affairs not only are counter-\nproductive, but may lead to highly undesirable\nconsequences. In that context, I would like to emphasize\nthat Turkmenistan gives priority to the United Nations, to\nthe Secretary-General\u2019s efforts to find an acceptable\nmachinery for an Afghan settlement. Turkmenistan agrees\nwith the concern expressed from this rostrum at the\ncontinuing internal Afghan conflict. Turkmenistan has a\nlong border with this long-suffering State and is truly\ninterested in finding a prompt settlement to the Afghan\nproblem. We are also interested in the success of the\nspecial representative of the United Nations, who in our\nview requires serious support from the United Nations. We\ncannot allow a situation whereby efforts to focus on solving\none conflict cause less attention to be paid to another,\nresulting in negative consequences.\nJust as mankind has become aware that the nuclear\nthreat has a global dimension, we are also aware that today\nwe need an adequate response to all regional and local\ndisputes and conflicts. I would like to emphasize that\nAshkhabad is prepared to engage in constructive\ncooperation with the United Nations on these issues, and to\ndemonstrate its commitment to the principles of\nconstructive neutrality.\nAll countries and peoples are now adapting in their\nown ways to new conditions in the world, which dictate the\nneed to adopt a common philosophy of security, based on\nthe principle of security for one and security for all. I\nwould like to emphasize that at this stage we are talking\nabout a philosophy, of perceptions of the world, reflecting\nrealities in Asian countries, in particular. This philosophy\nexcludes the use of force, diktat, as a means of solving\npolitical disputes, and its main principles should include\nequality, humanism, social and economic progress, and\nhealthy pragmatism.\nHere I should like to support what was said by my\ncolleague from Germany, Mr. Klaus Kinkel, who\nemphasized that we must not allow hostile stereotypes to\nbecome instilled in people\u2019s minds and that we cannot\nassociate in one sweep Islam with terrorism and\nfundamentalism. We welcome this assertion and express our\nconviction that this attitude will become universal.\nAs for Turkmenistan, we are fundamental advocates of\na secular State model, in which religion would play its\nproper role. We believe that, as has been emphasized by\nPresident Niyasov, a poly-ethnic, multi-faith State model\nand structure is more effective, more fruitful, than a\nmono-ethnic and mono-religious State.\nI take this opportunity to emphasize the support that\nTurkmenistan has received, through its participation in the\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe\n(OSCE), in European matters, as one of the legal\nsuccessors of the former federated State. This has created\nfor us, in a difficult transitional time of colossal\ntransformations, the possibility of benefiting from Asian-\nEuropean development. In that context, the words of the\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of France, Mr. Herv\u00e9 de\nCharette, were very important for us, when he spoke\nabout the States of Asia and Africa and about focusing on\nthe first meeting of Heads of State of Asia and Africa, set\nfor March 1996. We hope, within the context of\nactivating work on the Euro-Asian bridge, that there will\nbe other major projects, with the participation of\nTurkmenistan, on a direct window to Europe. Primarily,\nwe are talking about a north-south transit corridor to link\nEurope and Asia, through the territory of Russia and\nTurkmenistan, facilitating the supply of Turkmen energy\nto European markets and so on.\nI should like to emphasize that we have witnessed a\nsignificant, if not radical, increase in international interest\nin Caspian Sea matters, and the utilization of its abundant\nnatural resources. Our conceptual approach to this is\nbased on the idea that the Caspian Sea is a unique water\nbasin and the common property of the five coastal States.\nIn the making of plans for the development of its\nresources account should be taken of those States\u2019\ninterests; their consent should be required and no\nunilateral decisions should be taken. Turkmenistan firmly\nadvocates the prevention of any naval activities in the\nCaspian Sea, and favours freedom of navigation, on the\nbasis of a legal status to be developed by the littoral\nStates. We must create legal and economic conditions that\nwill guarantee a normal regime for foreign investment and\nexclude any risks for investors, such as the emergence of\na situation of distrust between the States of the basin.\nAt the coming anniversary session of the General\nAssembly next month, President Niyasov will set forth\nthe principles of the domestic and foreign policies of\nTurkmenistan, focusing on problems being taken up by\nthe United Nations, an Organization reflecting the face of\nmankind, which today faces a new millennium with its\nunique challenges and times and circumstances. We\nsincerely congratulate each other, and first and foremost\ncongratulate the Secretary-General, as we are absolutely\nconvinced that the United Nations, in this year of its\n36\n\n\nfiftieth anniversary, will prove that it is essential to the\nworld as the highest international assembly, developing an\nagenda for global partnership in the twenty-first century.\n"

        "file_text": "I wish,\non behalf of my country, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines,\nto congratulate Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral on his election\nas President of the General Assembly. He assumes the\npresidency on the historic occasion of the fiftieth\nanniversary of the United Nations.\nCommendation is in order too for His Excellency\nMr. Amara Essy of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, for the competence and\nsensitivity he displayed as he presided over the last\nsession.\nLet us also take this opportunity to express to the\nSecretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-\nGhali, our profound gratitude for the efforts which he has\nmade so far to achieve greater flexibility, and for the\nenhancement of the capability of this world body to meet\nthe new challenges posed by the seismic upheavals taking\nplace in the international arena.\nMy delegation is supportive of United Nations\nreform initiatives. We must redouble our efforts to ensure\na more efficient United Nations system that will respond\neffectively to security and humanitarian needs, promote\nhuman rights, and build the capacity for sustainable\ndevelopment. Central to our concerns is the importance of\nensuring democracy in the United Nations. If this\nOrganization\u2019s moral authority is to be preserved in an\nincreasingly democratized world, it is inescapable that its\nown processes must be made more democratic. It is\ntherefore imperative, as we consider the enlargement of\nthe Security Council, that the existing geographic\nimbalance be noted, and that the five regions of the world\nbe adequately represented.\nMy delegation calls for a more effective and\nefficient United Nations. We are cognizant of the urgent\nneed to address the deteriorating finances of this great\nOrganization. Since the end of the cold war, funds for\ndevelopment in poorer countries have been drastically\nreduced, and peace-keeping demands now compete for the\nlimited funds available. In his recent report on the work\nof the Organization, the Secretary-General revealed that\nMember States owed the Organization approximately\n$3.6 billion. Let us all work together to address this issue\nof arrears, which seriously impairs the effectiveness of the\nUnited Nations.\nThe role of peace-keeping forces will have to be\nredefined. My delegation is concerned when lightly armed\npeace-keepers or unarmed aid workers on a humanitarian\nmission are threatened, taken hostage, harmed, or even\nkilled. To preserve the credibility of all United Nations\npeace operations, personnel must be protected as they\n13\n\n\ncarry out the duties that the international community has\nsent them to accomplish.\nThe recently concluded Fourth World Conference on\nWomen, held in Beijing, has certainly served to raise the\nlevel of consciousness worldwide on the many problems\nthat women still encounter in many countries of the United\nNations. It is now evident that, even in those countries\nwhere legislation has opened the road to equality and\nequity, traditional attitudes continue to impede this process.\nI am happy to report that in Saint Vincent and the\nGrenadines, women have been given the opportunity to\nlead. Over 40 per cent of the top administrative posts in our\ncivil service are held by women. Women also have equal\naccess to the political process and enjoy equal pay for equal\nwork. Moreover, my Government amended the constitution\nto give women citizenship rights equal to those previously\naccorded only to men.\nAdherence to the principles of the United Nations\nCharter and the right to self-determination of the world\u2019s\npeoples remain among the fundamental principles of the\nCharter. This is reflected in the growing membership of the\nOrganization.\nThe Republic of China on Taiwan, which was once a\nMember of this body, still finds itself on the outside,\nknocking persistently at the doors of our chambers. It is the\nview of the delegation of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines,\nwhich we also expressed at the last session, that the time\nhas come for serious consideration to be given to the\neligibility of the Republic of China on Taiwan to become\na Member of the United Nations. Our position is based on\nthe principle of universality and in accordance with the\nestablished model of parallel representation of divided\ncountries. We have recognized the several parts of the\nformer Yugoslavia, and this model should continue to guide\nour policy.\nMy delegation believes that the Republic of China on\nTaiwan is fully equipped to play an expanded role in the\nworld economic arena. Its successful development\nexperience can indeed serve as a reference for developing\ncountries. Not only has the Republic of China on Taiwan\nachieved economic success but, in a few years, its political\nsystem has evolved from one characterized by authoritarian\nrule into one based on democratic principles. We cannot\npreach about the universality of the United Nations while\nat the same time ignoring the aspirations of over 21 million\npeople. It is more than time for the Republic of China on\nTaiwan to be given the opportunity to make a tangible\ncontribution to the work of the United Nations.\nMy delegation reiterates its strong commitment to\nthe peaceful settlement of disputes among States. The\nGulf War is now behind us, but the international\ncommunity must continue to recognize the potential for\nconflict that still exists in that part of the world.\nIn January 1995, the Secretary-General issued a\nSupplement to his \u201cAgenda for Peace\u201d of 1992, which\nhighlighted new kinds of United Nations operations to\ndeal with the outbreak of ethnic and religious wars within\nnewly independent States. It is the fervent hope of my\ndelegation that a lasting peace will come to the troubled\nregions of the world, particularly to Bosnia and\nHerzegovina. One can recall when the despicable system\nof apartheid was demolished in South Africa, just over a\nyear ago. It therefore behoves us to eradicate such evil\nthoughts as \u201cethnic cleansing\u201d from the minds of men in\nother parts of the world.\nLet me take this opportunity to applaud the efforts\nof the Israeli Government and the leadership of the\nPalestine Liberation Organization (PLO) to pursue peace\ntalks despite the efforts of terrorists to derail the process.\nMy delegation fully supports a peaceful resolution of the\nconflict that has plagued that region of the world for so\nmany years.\nThe Global Conference on the Sustainable\nDevelopment of Small Island Developing States was of\ngreat importance to Saint Vincent and the Grenadines.\nThe vulnerability of small island States such as ours is of\ngrave concern and we eagerly look forward to the\nimplementation of the Programme of Action agreed to in\nBarbados in 1994.\nLess than one month ago, the Caribbean region felt\nthe impact of several storms and hurricanes which\nseverely ravaged our sister islands of Antigua and\nBarbuda, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Dominica, Saint Maarten,\nPuerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. In the spirit of\nCaribbean brotherhood, the entire rest of the region came\nto the support of those affected. The Prime Minister, Sir\nJames Mitchell, in his capacity as current Chairman of the\nOrganization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS), along\nwith Prime Minister Compton of Saint Lucia and Prime\nMinister Arthur of Barbados, immediately embarked on\na tour of the islands which were severely hit.\n14\n\n\nA national effort was mobilized in my own country for\nrelief supplies. My delegation takes this opportunity to call\nfor further external assistance, which remains crucial. On\nbehalf of the Government and people of Saint Vincent and\nthe Grenadines, I wish to convey our profound sympathy to\nthe Governments and the peoples of the islands affected,\nparticularly to the families of those who lost their lives as\na result of Hurricanes Luis and Marilyn.\nWe also wish to express our sympathy to the\nGovernment and the people of the United States of\nAmerica, and more specifically the families of those who\nlost their lives in the senseless bombing of the Federal\nBuilding in Oklahoma earlier this year.\nOur small and fragile States are now being threatened\nby another type of disaster \u2014 an economic disaster, with\nmounting pressures being exerted by very powerful forces\nwhich appear not to understand the importance of the\nbanana industry to our very survival. Saint Vincent and the\nGrenadines and the other banana producing countries of the\nWindward Islands are limited to a mere three per cent of\nthe world market trade in the commodity. The powerful\nmultinational companies which are seeking to reverse the\nspecial arrangements under the Lom\u00e9 Convention already\ncontrol over 80 per cent of the world market.\nMore profits for multinational companies must not be\nto the detriment of the small islands striving to maintain\ndemocracy. The destruction of the Caribbean banana\nindustry will create economic and social havoc nationally\nand regionally, and will undoubtedly have severe\nrepercussions at the international level. We recognize the\nmomentum for free trade, but see no reason why, as obtains\nwith issues related to other agricultural regions, of various\ncountries, we cannot be given the time to adjust and\nrestructure our economies.\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines has already seen its\nactive involvement and participation at the regional level in\nthe Caribbean as an indispensable dimension of its role as\na member of the international community. We have\nconsistently defined our objective to become members of\nour various institutional bodies as a logical and natural\nculmination of our international vocation. This definition is\nrooted in our country\u2019s political, social and economic\nrealities, as they have been shaped by our historical and\ncultural heritage.\nAs a member of the recently established Association\nof Caribbean States (ACS), we are indeed delighted to be\ngiven a greater opportunity to strengthen relations with our\nLatin American neighbours. Comprising some 200 million\nethnically and culturally diverse peoples, the ACS will\nserve as a vehicle to promote the implementation of\npolicies and programmes designed to harness, utilize and\ndevelop the potential of the Caribbean Sea, promote and\nenhance economic space for trade and investment\nopportunities, and establish and augment, as appropriate,\ninstitutional structures and cooperative arrangements\nresponsive to the various cultural identities within the\nregion.\nMy Government totally condemns the illicit\nproduction, trafficking and consumption of drugs. These\nharbingers of violent crimes and corruption create a\nserious menace to the health and well-being of our\neconomies and our people, threaten our democratic\ninstitutions, and endanger national and regional security.\nWe are firmly convinced that only integrated\nregional and international efforts can effectively address\nthe drug problem, and accordingly stress the need for\nincreased local, regional and international cooperation.\nGreater emphasis should be placed on programmes that\ngenerate employment and income for persons attracted to\ndrug production and trafficking as a means of livelihood.\nWith the end of the cold war, the international\ncommunity, freed of the ideological and other constraints\nof the East-West struggle, saw new opportunities to\nrespond more effectively to longstanding problems that\nhad defied resolution because of super-Power rivalries.\nThere was optimistic talk of the \u201cpeace-dividend\u201d, and the\nSecurity Council acted with unprecedented consensus and\nmomentum on many issues.\nAt the same time, the thawing of the cold war\ntriggered long-suppressed tensions and conflicts in many\nparts of the world. Serious global economic and social\nproblems, ranging from poverty, over-population, refugees\nand migration, to unemployment, drug-trafficking and\nenvironmental decline, have affected many societies on an\nunprecedented scale.\nDespite the dramatically diminished threat of a\nnuclear war, the world of the 1990s turns out to be a far\nmore unstable place than many had hoped. The reality of\nglobal interdependence, while promising new\nopportunities for cooperation and exchange, reminds us all\ntoo often of our shared and persistent problems. We face\nmore tensions in more places: increasing degradation of\nthe quality of human life and even more complex issues\n15\n\n\nof international laws and ethics, management and practical\ncooperation.\nIt is therefore clear that the United Nations system is\nin greater demand than ever before. As we commemorate\nthe fiftieth anniversary of the founding of this great\nOrganization, let us work in harmony and ensure that the\nUnited Nations is adequately prepared to face the\nchallenges of an even more complex world. We must never\nforget that the United Nations is a reflection of the real\nworld. If an ugly image appears, one should not blame the\nmirror.\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me first to say how pleased we are to see\nAmbassador Freitas do Amaral of Portugal presiding over\nthis session of the General Assembly, a session that\ncoincides with the fiftieth anniversary of the United\nNations. His election to the presidency is a tribute that\nexpresses recognition of his personal qualities. We\nwelcome this unanimous election of a high-ranking\nrepresentative of the friendly country, Portugal, whose\nskills and experience we value. I should like to assure\nhim of the support and cooperation of Algeria.\nI should also like to express Algeria\u2019s gratitude to\nhis predecessor, Mr. Amara Essy, Minister for Foreign\nAffairs of the C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire for his outstanding efforts and\nachievements throughout his mandate.We are very\ngrateful to him for the manner in which he has honoured\nAfrica and wish him every success in his work in the\nservice of his country.\n15\n\n\nI should also like to say how grateful we are to the\nSecretary-General of the Organization, Mr. Boutros\nBoutros-Ghali, and how much we appreciate his sagacity\nand resolve at a time when the role of the Organization\nvis-\u00e0-vis the call for peace, security and development, is\nbecoming more urgent. I wish to renew to him assurances\nof our full confidence and continuing support.\nThis session of the General Assembly is truly\nexceptional in that it takes place at a time when the\ninternational community is at a historic turning-point. Never\nbefore has there been such a need for stability and security,\nnor has there been a more pressing quest for a fairer, more\nequitable and balanced world. Herein lies the symbiotic\nsignificance of this fiftieth session of the General\nAssembly. It comes as a timely reminder of the importance\nof world peace and security and of the need for our nations\nto organize their common future on new foundations.\nThus, when we take stock of the Organization\u2019s\nactivities over the past 50 years in all areas of international\nlife, the transformations and shortcomings such stocktaking\nreveals make it incumbent upon us to make a special effort\nto identify the stakes and the challenges we must face up to\nas the century draws towards its end.\nHow our world shapes up will depend on our doing\nso. Therefore, the ambition of the world Organization\nshould be to give true content to collective security and to\npromote the creation of a new paradigm for development.\nThe United Nations must adapt to a changing and\nsingularly complex world reality by going back to the\nsource, to the principles upon which it was founded if it is\nto forge a new future for all.\nAt a time when the international order has lost its\nregulatory capability and the international community lacks\nthe frames of reference that could help guide its action, it\nis up to the United Nations to regulate inter-State relations,\nto promote a stable and equitable order and to foster a\nmodel that would be acceptable to all.\nAt a time when it is becoming clear that trade\nglobalization and market integration respond only partially\nto the growing need for justice, equity, stability and\nsecurity, the United Nations must take its position at the\nforefront of the drive towards harmonization which is a\nmust for conflict prevention, crisis management,\nrapprochement between peoples and the promotion of\ncooperation between States.\nHowever, if the Organization is to perform its role,\nit must be given the means that would enable it to better\norganize international society and equip it to face up to\nthe upsurge of intolerance, the escalation of terrorism, the\nexacerbation of tensions and conflicts, the aggravation of\nthe economic situation of the most deprived countries, the\nsocial malaise in the industrialized countries and an\noverall decline. In short, the United Nations must be\nequipped with the means that would enable it to defend\nfreedom, law, justice and equity.\nThis means that nothing could be done in the\nabsence of the political will of States that bear the\nresponsibility of dispelling doubts and remedying the\ndisaffection that is noticeable today vis-\u00e0-vis the United\nNations by giving true meaning to the Organization\u2019s\ninvaluable and multifarious contributions towards the\npromotion of an international society that is more just,\nbetter organized and better structured.\nWhether it is a matter of democratizing international\nrelations, completing the process of decolonization,\nupholding human rights, strengthening the disarmament\nenterprise or ensuring the continuity of international\nefforts to promote development, the contributions of\nStates and their awareness of their responsibilities remain\nindispensable if the United Nations is to be able to\nperform the ever-developing role it has to play in this\ncontext.\nProceeding from this, it is only by improving the\ncollective capabilities of the international community to\nface up to the urgent and most intolerable injustices that\na true meaning could be given to preventive efforts of\ndiplomacy, to peace-keeping operations and to the\nelaboration of a genuine structure of international\ncooperation.\nIt is only with a new vision, a new thinking and new\nmodalities of action that the international community\nwould be able to surmount obstacles and ensure future\nsuccess.\nAs we approach the end of the century, it is\nimportant to rethink our practices with a view to\nelaborating long-term complementarities that would rise\nup to future challenges, spare the world new crises and\nestablish the regulatory rules our world needs.\nIt is this vision that inspires Algeria in its thinking\nof the need for international action that should be made\nmore palpable in order to ensure greater consultation\n16\n\n\namong nations, and greater understanding among peoples as\nwell as greater courage in striving to achieve peace and\ndevelopment.\nIt is this vision that guides Algeria\u2019s national renewal\nendeavour which aims at establishing on firm foundations\nthe rule of law, promoting economic reform and\nstrengthening the democratic process.\nThe democratic presidential elections, the first round\nof which will take place on 16 November 1995, will\ntranslate into actual political reality, the will and desire to\npromote the sense of responsibility of all Algerians and to\nhasten the laying of firm foundations for an open, free and\ndemocratic society.\nThis democratic process, an ever-renewed experiment,\nis bound to contribute to the achievement of stability, the\nconcretization of democratic freedoms and development in\nour region, and, as it truly expresses the aspirations of our\npeoples, it will be the appropriate retort to all attempts at\nsubversion, of which terrorism is the most abhorrent\nmanifestation. To us, combating terrorism is a battle in\ndefence of democracy. As any complacency vis-\u00e0-vis\nterrorism would be an absolute negation of democracy, it\nfollows that we cannot remain indifferent to this scourge\nwhich poses a really serious threat to international peace\nand security. Thus, the struggle against terrorism does not\nallow of any laxity but must be pursued most vigorously in\nthe context of decisive international action whose aim\nshould be the total eradication of this scourge from all our\nsocieties.\nIf we are to rise up to this challenge, there is a need\nto accord a high priority to economic and social\ndevelopment. This is a need that is more urgent than ever\nbefore. Its relevance has been recognized today by all the\nGovernments of one region. Awareness of the threat of the\nscourge of terrorism and the interest shown in the Algerian\nproposal regarding the need for a response in solidarity\nwithin the framework of the Euro-Mediterranean region\ndemonstrate fully the strength of this conviction.\nIn the context of the newly emerging political,\neconomic and social realities, Algeria has accorded special\npriority in the context of its immediate environment, to the\nproblems of security and development and to the sort of\ncontributions required in resolving such problems.\nProceeding from this, Algeria is convinced that the\nunitary Maghreb project is necessary, not only for the\nsecurity and stability of the Maghreb region, but also for\nthe prosperity of the Euro-Mediterranean region, as well\nas the Arab and African regions.\nIt is precisely within the context of the need to\nestablish a unified, strong and stable Maghreb region that\nAlgeria makes its contribution towards the achievement of\na just and lasting settlement to the question of Western\nSahara. Part and parcel of this policy is Algeria\u2019s support\nof the efforts of the United Nations Secretary-General\naimed at a transparent and credible implementation of the\nsettlement plan through a genuine referendum, which\nwould ensure the free exercise by the people of the\nWestern Sahara of its right to self-determination and\nindependence.\nAny violation of the settlement plan, especially\nthrough the moving foreign populations to the Western\nSahara, would have very serious consequences for the\npeace process. All obstacles that impede the\nimplementation of the settlement plan should be dealt\nwith through direct dialogue between the two parties to\nthe conflict, the Kingdom of Morocco and the Polisario\nFront, with the aim of creating the proper conditions for\na peaceful settlement to the conflict that would realize the\naspirations of the peoples of the region. A just and lasting\nsettlement to the question of the Western Sahara would\ncontribute to the strengthening of the Maghreb unitary\nedifice, thus making it a fundamental element of success\nfor medium- and long-term cooperative strategies in both\nthe Sahelian-Saharan and Mediterranean regions.\nIn this connection, to lift the sanctions which\ncontinue to severely afflict the brotherly Libyan people\nand to search for urgent solutions to the relevant\ndifferences, is an urgent need that acquires particular\nsignificance and should make part of any forward-looking\nstrategy. Here, as elsewhere, political will underscores the\nneed for an intelligent understanding of the situation and\nfor a positive dialectic that would contribute to the\nbuilding of a community of stability and progress. It is in\nthis spirit that we continue to deploy efforts that aim at\nconsolidating cooperation in the sahelian-Saharan region,\nan enterprise which we shall endeavour to pursue to\nsuccess at the forthcoming Euro-Mediterranean conference\nin Barcelona.\nIn the Middle East, where the building of peace\nrequires from all parties sincerity, determination and\nrespect for the commitments undertaken, Algeria\ncontinues to make its contribution towards the\nestablishment of a lasting peace based on a just and\noverall settlement consistent with the rights of all the\n17\n\n\nregion\u2019s peoples. That is why, while supporting the peace\nprocess, Algeria has continuously underscored the need for\nwithdrawal by Israel from all Arab territories occupied\nsince 1967, including Al-Quds Al-Sharif and respect for the\nnational inspirations of the Palestinian people. In this\ncontext, Algeria welcomes the conclusion of the agreement\non the extension of Palestinian national autonomy in the\nwest bank of the Jordan as a new positive step and calls for\nits translation into concrete reality.\nThe search for a just, comprehensive and lasting peace\nin the Middle East calls for full awareness of the fact that\nthe challenges which face the peoples of the region require\nmore wide-ranging and more efficacious solutions. From\nthis standpoint, since Iraq is fulfilling its commitments\nwhich arise from the Security Council resolutions, the\nsanctions which severely afflict the people of this country\nshould be lifted.\nBy the same token, Kuwait\u2019s internationally\nrecognized borders must be fully respected. Finally, the\nrestoration of the sovereignty of the United Arab Emirates\nover the islands of Abou-Moussa, greater Tumb, and lesser\nTumb must be reaffirmed. By meeting these conditions,\nnew prospects for stability and security in the region can\nemerge.\nThe alarming situation in Africa, where instability and\nuncertainty are symptomatic of a protracted crisis and\nwhere the fundamental elements of a new solution are\nbeing sought against a backdrop of disorder, the hotbeds of\ntension that persist in Angola, Liberia, Burundi, Rwanda\nand Somalia must now be quenched. However, any return\nto stability will only take place through economic recovery\nand escape from the economy of indebtedness that has\nseverely damaged social cohesion, to a new type of\neconomic organization that would foster growth and\nguarantee the modalities of international integration.\nAs of necessity, this calls for dealing, as a matter of\nurgency, with the social costs of structural adjustment and\nimplementing the new United Nations programme for\nAfrica in order to avoid the tragedies and sufferings that\nbeset the peoples of Africa and to put an end to the\nmarginalization of the African continent. This is the price-\ntag on stability and peace in Africa and security in the\nworld.\nWe are equally concerned at the latest developments\nin Bosnia and Herzegovina where an entire people, whose\nvery survival is threatened, face hatred, exclusion and the\ninsanity of ethnic cleansing. It is no longer possible to\ntolerate this savage onslaught on the conscience of\nhumanity. It is the international community\u2019s duty and\nresponsibility to put an end to this situation which is\npolitically unacceptable and morally intolerable. From this\nrostrum, I would like to reiterate Algeria\u2019s solidarity with\nand support for Bosnia and Herzegovina in exercising its\nright to defend its unity and territorial integrity and to\nprotect the dignity and values of its citizens. In this spirit,\nAlgeria has supported the current peace initiatives aimed\nat a just and lasting solution that would ensure respect for\nthe constitutional principles that the people of Bosnia and\nHerzegovina wish freely to choose.\nIn addition to these concerns, Algeria has\ncommitments relating to peace throughout the world, as\nentered into in the framework of United Nations peace-\nkeeping operations in Angola, Cambodia and Haiti, and\nparticipation in the election monitoring process that led to\nthe birth of the new South Africa.\nAll this reflects Algeria\u2019s posture and its\ncommitment to the maintenance of international peace and\nsecurity. This is reflected in the comprehensive and\ncoherent policy Algeria has always pursued with regard\nto disarmament issues, a policy that has led to its\naccession to the major disarmament instruments. Its recent\naccession to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\nNuclear Weapons (NPT), its effective contribution to the\npromotion of consensus solutions in the negotiations on\nthe Treaty\u2019s extension, and ratification, several weeks ago\nof the Chemical Weapons Convention, are significant\nmoves that reflect Algeria\u2019s desire to play an active role\nin achieving general and complete disarmament.\nThe need for a viable international order based on\nsolidarity has never been as urgent as it is now at a time\nwhen the world is in the throes of a phase of systematic\ntransition.\nIf it acknowledges how far we are interdependent,\nthe international community will be able to usher in an\norderly world society of solidarity that respects the\ndiversity it enjoys.\nThat is the reason why we must reduce the widening\ngap between North and South that, in the long term, are\nanathema to both international peace and security, and put\nour minds to the establishment of new balances based on\nrenewed international relations. Such relations, if they are\nbased on consultation and openness to the solidarity\ninterests of the international community, will promote\ncredible solutions to development problems. They must\n18\n\n\nvalidate the efforts of developing countries to regulate\ndomestic adjustment processes, restore social balances and\nensure all the conditions for meaningful integration into the\nnew international order.\nIn the face of rapid changes that threaten social fabric\nacross the board, it is essential to promote a stable,\npredictable international economic environment that would\nbe conducive to development efforts. In this context, more\nequitable financial, monetary, trading and technological\nrelations must provide the basis for re-establishing trade as\nan effective instrument for mutual development, for\nreconciling peoples and strengthening the international\ncommunity.\nIn the face of these challenges, the United Nations,\nwith its experience and credibility in terms of global issues,\ncan provide inspiration, encouragement and help to\nelaborate and follow up future strategies. It is therefore our\nduty and responsibility to ensure that the United Nations\nOrganization reasserts its authority, makes its structures\nmore democratic and rationalizes its working methods.\nSuch an endeavour should be founded on the\nreaffirmation of Member States\u2019 commitments to the kind\nof renewal that is based on and inspired by the principles\nof the Charter of the United Nations.\nThis means that any restructuring of the United\nNations system must meet the requirements of true\ndemocracy in international relations and should focus on the\nrevitalization of its bodies, improving coordination between\nthem, rehabilitating the General Assembly and ensuring\ntransparency in reforming the Security Council. Whether it\nis a matter of establishing order among the essential\nelements of action or global decision-making, the\nprerequisite of democracy is now at the very heart of the\nproblems of peace and development. In this context, \u201cAn\nAgenda for Peace\u201d and \u201cAn Agenda for Development\u201d are\nof the utmost importance.\nThus, if we look clearly at the international situation\nand what is really at stake, this adaptation process will lead\nto new hope for humanity and ensure a lasting foothold in\nhistory for international peace and security.\n"

        "file_text": "It is with special fervour\nthat I congratulate Mr. Freitas do Amaral, on behalf of the\nPhilippine delegation, on his election as President of the\nUnited Nations General Assembly in this landmark session.\nLet me also express the gratitude of my delegation to Mr.\nAmara Essy, the Foreign Minister of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, for the\nexcellent leadership which he provided us at our forty-ninth\nsession. Our tribute goes also to the Secretary-General, Mr.\nBoutros Boutros-Ghali and to the men and women of the\nSecretariat, who, in the course of the past year, carried out\ntheir indispensable tasks under circumstances of great\ndifficulty for them and for the Organization.\nIn three weeks, most of the world\u2019s Heads of State or\nGovernment will gather in this Hall to commemorate the\nfiftieth anniversary of the birth of the United Nations. They\nwill no doubt recall how the founding fathers of our\nOrganization convened in San Francisco, animated by their\nresolve to transform the world. It was a world devastated\nby a global war. Like most wars, it was ignited by the\npropensity and ability of nations to use force to acquire\nterritory and resources, to avenge past wrongs, or to\npromote, at the expense of others, the security and\nwelfare of their people.\nThis was the world which the United Nations was\ncreated to transform. Our founding fathers were idealistic\nenough to insist that questions of war and peace had\nultimately to be resolved in the hearts and minds of men\nand nations; but they were realistic enough to recognize\nthat practical measures and considerations were necessary\nto deter the use of force and mitigate its effects. They\nwere realistic enough to concede that States that held a\npreponderance of military force had to be allowed a large\nmeasure of authority and responsibility; but they were\nidealistic enough to hope that those States would use their\npower for the good of all.\nWith the hindsight of 50 years, we can see that the\nUnited Nations has not fulfilled the vision that the\nfounders had for it, but it succeeded well beyond what it\nwas reasonable to expect of it at that time. The world was\nspared yet another global cataclysm. The quiet work of\nthe United Nations, particularly through its specialized\nagencies, advanced the well-being and raised the standard\nof living of countless millions around the world.\nSadly, however, these considerable achievements\nwere offset, in a fundamental way, by the continued and\nrepeated defiance of the United Nations proclaimed\npurposes by so many men and nations, in so many\ninstances. Almost from the beginning of the existence of\nthe United Nations, and despite the United Nations, man\npersisted in his ability, propensity and willingness to use\nforce in order to achieve his national or ideological ends.\nIf peace was kept on a global scale, it was only because\nthe mutual threat of nuclear annihilation deterred the\nlaunching of full-scale war. In the international economy,\ncountries sought to beggar their neighbours through the\nunabashed use of a full range of protectionist and\nmercantilist tools.\nToday, however, in the fiftieth year of the United\nNations, we can say with a measure of plausibility, that\nthe world has indeed been transformed; and we can hope,\nwith a degree of realism, that the idealistic vision of the\nUnited Nations can be substantially attained.\nOne of the central aims of the United Nations \u2014 the\nliberation of colonized nations \u2014 has been largely\nachieved. The world\u2019s most mightily armed Powers have\npulled back from the brink of nuclear annihilation. No\nlonger do nuclear-armed ideological camps face each\nother in deadly confrontation, and mankind\u2019s survival no\n16\n\n\nlonger hangs in the perilous balance of mutual nuclear\nthreat. The Philippines is gratified by the decision earlier\nthis year to extend indefinitely the Treaty on the\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and calls for the\nconclusion early next year of a comprehensive test-ban\ntreaty that would put an absolute end to all nuclear testing.\nThe international community has reached agreement\non the elimination of other devices of mass destruction and\nof inhumane weapons. In particular, the Philippines urges\nthe ratification and the strengthening of the 1980\nConvention on the Prohibition of Restrictions on the Use of\nCertain Conventional Weapons Which May Be Deemed to\nbe Excessively Injurious or to have Indiscriminate Effects.\nWe call for the early entry into force of the Convention on\nthe Prohibition of the Development, Production and\nStockpiling of Chemical Weapons and on Their\nDestruction, and the full implementation of the Convention\non the Prohibition of the Development, Production and\nStockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) Weapons and\nToxin Weapons and on Their Destruction.\nIn place of the use and threat of force, more and more\nnations have resorted to dialogue and reconciliation in\ndealing with disputes among themselves or with their\nneighbours, even in the case of conflicts which the\n\u201crealistic\u201d had considered to be insoluble. Almost\nthroughout its entire existence, the United Nations has been\nseized with the conflicts in the Middle East. But only four\ndays ago, Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization,\nwith the approbation of other States in the area, took\nanother significant step on the difficult road to peace. In\nSouth Africa, where a minority regime long oppressed the\nmajority with systematic cruelty, a multiracial Government\nnow administers the country with success that has surpassed\neven the world\u2019s most fervent expectations. In Latin\nAmerica, old territorial disputes are now the subject of\ndialogue and consultation.\nIn our own region, the political settlement of the\nconflict in Cambodia and the emergence of an elected\ngovernment in that long-suffering country stand as\ncrowning achievements of the United Nations, as well as of\nthe countries of the region \u2014 a triumph of negotiation over\nthe force of arms. We welcome the accord that was so\npainstakingly crafted a year ago to avert the development\nof nuclear arms in the Korean peninsula. We urge the\nresumption of serious talks between North and South Korea\nas a further contribution to peace and reconciliation in our\nregion. The Government of Myanmar has agreed on a\ncease-fire and has undertaken negotiations with all but one\nof the minority nationalities in Myanmar, a remarkable\ndevelopment in a country riven by inter-ethnic conflict for\nso long.\nMatching the spread of the spirit of dialogue and\nreconciliation, faith in the efficacy of market forces and\neconomic liberalization as a condition and stimulant of\ndevelopment has been sweeping the world. Policies\narising from this faith have unleashed the productive\nenergies of many of the world\u2019s people, a development\nlargely responsible for the remarkable economic growth\nof countries in many parts of the world. Liberalization of\ninternational economic transactions and the resulting\ninterdependence of the global economy have raised the\nstake of nations in one another\u2019s prosperity and have thus\nconsiderably brightened the prospects of enduring stability\nand peace. Thus, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation\nCouncil, of which the Philippines is an active founding\nparticipant, is devoted solely to economic collaboration.\nBut one of its salutary by-products is the\nstrengthening of peace and security in the Asia-Pacific\nregion, for now APEC participants have a growing stake\nin one another\u2019s economic progress and political stability.\nWe find in my country, the Philippines, a microcosm\nof the global trend of political reconciliation, economic\nliberalization, and regionalism. The peace talks that we\nare undertaking with rebel groups in the spirit of national\nreconciliation have brought a new stability to the country,\nproviding the atmosphere of tranquillity so necessary for\nthe resurgence of the economy.\nThe military rebels have availed themselves of a\nprogramme of amnesty. Many of them now pursue their\nambitions for the country through the legal political\nsystem, with one of them recently elected as a Senator of\nthe Republic. The Government has been negotiating in\nEurope with the self-exiled leaders of the Communist\nParty, which is now legal in the Philippines and whose\nmembers are free to contest Philippine elections.\nWith the assistance of the Committee of Six of the\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference, under the\nchairmanship of Indonesia, negotiations are taking place\nwith the Moro National Liberation Front. These\nnegotiations have resulted in a cease-fire and agreement\non more than 80 per cent of the points at issue. Peace in\nthe southern Philippines has made possible an\nextraordinary surge in the economic growth of that\nregion. We have opened wide the doors to the Philippine\neconomy, welcoming foreign investment, letting in the\nbracing wind of foreign competition. We have lowered\n17\n\n\nour barriers to trade in fulfilment of international\ncommitments or through unilateral measures.\nOne of the results of these structural reforms is a\ngrowth rate that is respectable even by the standards of our\nfast-growing region. There are bright prospects for the\ncontinuation of this growth rate because it proceeds from\nsolid policy foundations and is taking place within a system\nof pluralistic democracy, respect for human rights, and the\nrule of law.\nWe have strengthened our bonds with our neighbours,\nthrough the Association of South-East Asian Nations above\nall. We have dealt with border questions and territorial\ndisputes, including the conflicting claims in the South\nChina Sea, through peaceful dialogue and consultation.\nThe general improvement in global security, the rising\ntide of global prosperity, and the intensification of regional\ncooperation should give rise to hope, but it should not\ninduce complacency, as new threats have arisen to confront\nus and old ones have swollen in magnitude and virulence.\nThe dissolution of power blocs has unleashed latent\ntribalism that had been under authoritarian constraint. One\nof the most savage manifestations of this has been taking\nplace in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\nInternational terrorism has become a global menace.\nThe illicit trade in drugs undermines the fabric of society.\nTrafficking in women and children is a crime that cries out\nfor international cooperative countermeasures.\nThe recent resumption of nuclear testing by two of the\nnuclear-weapon States poses an immediate threat to\npeople\u2019s health, the natural environment, and the\nnon-proliferation regime. We repeat our condemnation of\nthese tests and ask that they stop \u2014 now and forever.\nEven as the notion of economic liberalization has been\nalmost universally embraced as a condition and catalyst for\ndevelopment, many countries have resorted to inventive\nmeasures of disguised protectionism. Numerous developing\ncountries continue to labour, like Sisyphus, under the\ncrushing burden of foreign debt.\nShortages of labour in resource-rich or rapidly\nindustrializing economies have induced the large-scale\nmigration of workers across national boundaries. Their\npresence in foreign lands has placed them in positions of\nvulnerability that require international cooperation for the\nprotection of their rights and dignity as human beings.\nThe Philippines calls upon all States to ratify the\nInternational Convention on the Protection of the Rights\nof All Migrant Workers and Members of their Families.\nThe Philippines is at one with the Group of 77 in calling\nfor a United Nations-sponsored global conference on\ninternational migration.\nMy delegation intends to pursue with great vigour\nGeneral Assembly resolutions on violence against women\nmigrant workers and on trafficking in women and girls.\nThese are some of the more outstanding challenges\nthat confront the United Nations as it enters its second\nhalf-century and approaches the next millennium. The\nUnited Nations, however, cannot respond to the\nchallenges of today and the next century with the\norganization and procedures of 50 years ago. The nature\nof the new threats to international peace and security\nrequires a review of United Nations peace-keeping\noperations in order to streamline them and make them\nmore effective.\nAt this stage, I must stress that, whatever measures\nare agreed upon, they must be financed adequately, in\nproportion to the capacity and degree of responsibility of\nMember States and not by sacrificing any development\nprogrammes.\nThe United Nations is in a desperate financial\nsituation. We cannot demand that it fulfil tasks that we\nare unwilling to finance. We cannot simply use the United\nNations and then withhold from it the resources needed\nfor its effective functioning. Year after year, we call for\nbetter management of the United Nations. The Philippines\nsupports this call, and strongly articulated its position in\nthis Hall last year.\nAt the same time, we must point out that the United\nNations cannot be managed efficiently if it is constantly\nuncertain of the resources available to it. We therefore\nappeal to all Member States, particularly the larger\ncontributors, to make up their arrears, to pay their dues,\nand to pay on time.\nWe have of late heard the proposition that in trying\nto achieve economy and efficiency in the United Nations\nwe should look to the economic and social area, to those\nbodies whose mandate is to advance the interests of the\ndeveloping countries \u2014 abolishing agencies here, gutting\nprogrammes there. We support the streamlining of\nmultilateral development institutions and programmes. But\nwe cannot accept moves to abolish the development\n18\n\n\nagencies in the name of the \\\"division of labour\\\" or\n\u201ccomparative advantage\u201d. What the international community\nneeds to do with respect to these agencies \u2014 and the\nBretton Woods institutions and the regional development\nbanks \u2014 is to augment their resources, not to reduce them.\nWe deplore the position of some Powers that refuse to raise\ntheir contributions to the international and regional financial\ninstitutions, but in their desire to maintain a dominant role\nin those bodies prevent others from increasing their own\nshare.\nWe have all come to this session ready to address the\nquestion of reform of the structure of the Security Council.\nThe Council\u2019s structure is no longer adequate to meet the\nnew and enlarged demands upon its mandate and no longer\nreflects the size and composition of the United Nations. The\nPhilippines fully supports the enlargement of the Council\u2019s\nmembership in order to ensure the equitable representation\nof all regions and of the developing countries.\nAny reform, however, must go beyond the question of\nmembership. The question of the veto must be reviewed, as\nmust the Council\u2019s working methods and procedures, in\norder to ensure the greatest transparency possible and the\nparticipation of as broad a range of countries as possible.\nThe vital nature of its decisions requires no less.\nAt the same time, the growing importance of the role\nof the United Nations requires that its membership, as well\nas its functions, reflect the realities of today. Accordingly,\nwe need to consider the proposition that, in the high\ninterests of universality, no significant group of people\nshould be left without representation in the United Nations.\nIn this fiftieth year, as we recall the founding\nprinciples and fundamental goals of our Organization, as we\nreview its mandate and as we assess its strengths and\nweaknesses, its achievements and shortcomings, we must\nnever lose sight of the fact that all our labours in the\nUnited Nations have as their centre and object the human\nperson \u2014 his or her security, dignity and well-being \u2014\nabove ideology, above religion, above even the State itself.\nWith the shrinking of this planet Earth, a process\nhelped in no small measure by the United Nations itself,\nhundreds of millions more people are crying out for their\nown empowerment and for the universal respect of their\nrights and dignity.\nIn this fiftieth year of our Organization, we in the\nUnited Nations must heed their cry if we are to keep faith\nwith its mandate and mission.\n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of the delegation of the\nDemocratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, I should like first\nto congratulate you, Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral, on\nyour election to the presidency of the current session of\nthe General Assembly, demonstrating the deep trust and\nexpectation of Member States of the United Nations. It is\nour hope that through your efforts this session will be\ncrowned with good results.\nI should also like to express appreciation to the\nSecretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for his\nactivities and efforts in strengthening the United Nations\nand enhancing its responsibility and role.\nFifty years have passed since the end of the Second\nWorld War and the foundation of the United Nations. All\nthe people on our planet recall those historic days with\nunusual feelings.\nOver the last five decades, the world\u2019s people have\nfollowed the path of independence and sovereignty, peace\nand development, and this process has helped them\nfurther confirm their determination and commitment to\ncreate a new, free and peaceful world.\nFor the Korean people, the last five decades have\nbeen a period of hard struggle against all forms of\nchallenge and difficulty, and also a period of proud\nsuccesses and victories in realizing independence under\nthe banner of Juche.\nThe entire population of the Democratic People\u2019s\nRepublic of Korea celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of\nthe founding of the Workers\u2019 Party of Korea as a grand\nand victorious festival, with great national pride and\nconfidence, in the wake of the fiftieth anniversary of\nKorea\u2019s liberation.\nThe strengthening and development of our Party and\nthe progress and prosperity of our Republic are the\nbrilliant fruit of the outstanding idea and wise leadership\n5\n\n\nof the great leader Comrade Kim Il Sung and the respected\nsupreme leader Comrade Kim Jong Il.\nThe respected and beloved leader Comrade Kim Il\nSung devoted his whole life to the prosperity of the\nfatherland and the happiness of his people, to world peace\nand the common cause of humankind, and performed\nimmortal exploits which will be recorded in the annals of\nhistory. Our great leader is the saviour of our Korean\nnation, the Tangun nation, and the founding father of\nsocialist Korea. His great revolutionary exploits will remain\nimmortal, along with his august name. The great leader\nComrade Kim Il Sung is always with us.\nMore than one year has passed since the death of our\nrespected and beloved leader Comrade Kim Il Sung, during\nwhich there has been neither a political vacuum nor\ninstability in our society, and everything has gone well in\nall fields \u2014 political, economic, military and cultural.\nSocialism of our own style, based on the Juche idea,\nhas made steady progress, since respected General Kim\nJong Il has energetically guided all the affairs of our Party\nand State, including military and foreign affairs, for more\nthan three decades, always working together with the great\nleader Comrade Kim Il Sung for the well-being of the\npeople.\nThe respected General Kim Jong Il is the supreme\nleader of our Party and State and the Supreme Commander\nof our revolutionary armed forces. He practices the\nbenevolent politics of love for and trust in the people,\nbasing himself on boundless loyalty and filial piety as well\nas noble moral obligations towards the fatherly leader.\nIt is the greatest fortune and a unique blessing of\nleadership for our people to have Comrade Kim Jong Il, the\ngreat leader of our Party and people, as the supreme leader.\nToday our people absolutely respect and trust the respected\nGeneral Kim Jong Il, who successfully carries forward the\nrevolutionary cause of Juche pioneered by the fatherly\nleader, and they entrust their destiny to him and march\nforward vigorously under his leadership.\nRallying closely around the respected supreme leader\nComrade Kim Jong Il in single-hearted unity, our people\nwill make our country, our fatherland, more prosperous and\ndefend and glorify our own style of socialism, centred on\nthe popular masses, which is independent and unique, in\nline with the life-long teachings of the fatherly leader.\nIt is with feelings of great pride mixed with\nheartbreaking bitterness that we recall the last 50 years.\nAs the Assembly is aware, the division of the\ncountry and nation imposed the catastrophe of war on the\nnorth and south of Korea. Consequently, both sides still\nsuffer from the tragedy of mistrust and confrontation\ntoday, when the world is moving towards d\u00e9tente and\npeace. It is indeed aberrant that the legacy of the cold\nwar, dating from the 1940s, continues into the 1990s, and\nthere is therefore no justification whatsoever for its\ncontinuation. The failure of Korea\u2019s reunification will\nleave the situation on the Korean peninsula indefinitely\nunstable, and this will not be helpful to peace in either\nNorth-East Asia or the rest of the world.\nSince the early days of the national division, the\nrespected and beloved leader Comrade Kim Il Sung put\nforward a number of reasonable proposals for the peace\nand peaceful reunification of the country and devoted all\nhis efforts to their realization until the last moment of his\nlife. In particular, 15 years ago the fatherly leader\nadvanced a proposal for national reunification through\nconfederation, based on the concept of one nation and one\nState, two systems and two Governments. This proposal\nfully reflects the reality in the north and south of Korea,\ncharacterized by the differences in political ideas and\nsystems, as well as the Korean people\u2019s desire for\nnational reconciliation and reunification on the principle\nof neither side conquering or being conquered by the\nother.\nUpholding the Ten-Point Programme for the Great\nUnity of the Whole Nation for the Reunification of the\nCountry, proposed by the respected and beloved leader\nComrade Kim Il Sung, and in accordance with the three\nprinciples of independence, peaceful reunification and\ngreat national unity and the proposal for a confederal\nreunification, we will make our best efforts towards the\nunity of the whole nation, on the basis of patriotism and\nthe spirit of national independence, and towards the\nestablishment of an independent, peaceful and neutral\nreunified State of Korea.\nThere is no change in our position with respect to\nthe North-South dialogue. We are prepared to resume it\nwhen the atmosphere is created in favour of such\ndialogue. However, the North-South dialogue, which\nbegan after painstaking efforts, has been wrecked by the\nSouth Korean authorities, and the atmosphere is not yet\nready for the resumption of the dialogue.\n6\n\n\nWhen our fatherly leader passed away, Heads of State\nand Governments of the world, even those whose countries\nhave no diplomatic relations with ours, expressed\ncondolences for his death. However, the South Korean\nauthorities, far from expressing condolences for the\nmisfortune of their fellow countrymen, ordered the whole\nterritory of South Korea put on an emergency alert,\npointing their guns at our Republic. Worse still, they\ncracked down on the South Korean people who were\nmourning the death of the father of the nation.\nNevertheless, the South Korean authority still refuses to\napologize for this grave, unethical crime, because of which\nhe is denied a seat at any dialogue by the Korean people in\nboth the north and the south, as well as abroad. If the South\nKorean authorities are sincere in their desire to have\ndialogue with us, all they have to do first is apologize for\nthe crime they have committed against their fellow\ncountrymen.\nAnother main stumbling-block to the resumption of\ninter-Korean dialogue and reunification is South Korea\u2019s\nNational Security Law, which defines the fellow\ncountrymen in the north as the enemy and criminalizes any\nSouth Korean contacts or dialogue with the people in the\nNorth. The National Security Law allows no room at all for\nelementary rights of democracy and freedom in South\nKorea today. This medieval law is invoked to suppress and\npersecute a large number of people, including youths and\nstudents calling for the democratization of South Korean\nsociety and pro-reunification patriots who have visited the\nnorth. This has resulted in a total freeze on and blockade of\nmulti-channel dialogues, contacts and exchanges between\nthe north and south. All these facts demonstrate that as long\nas the National Security Law remains in place, violating\nhuman rights ruthlessly and antagonizing the dialogue\npartners, freedom and democracy are inconceivable in\nSouth Korea, and the North-South dialogue and peaceful\nnational reunification will be simply unfeasible.\nVoices calling for the abolition of the National\nSecurity Law can be heard not only in South Korea but\nalso in various other parts of the world. Last year the\nUnited States Department of State urged on two occasions\nthat South Korean authorities abolish their National Security\nLaw, and many delegates called for its abolition at meetings\nof the United Nations Commission on Human Rights. There\nis no justification whatsoever for the maintenance of the\nNational Security Law, which is anachronistic and evil. For\ndialogue and contacts, free travel and exchanges between\nthe north and the south of Korea, all legal and physical\nbarriers, such as the National Security Law and the concrete\nwall dividing the Korean peninsula, should be removed at\nan early date.\nThe top priority on any agenda for ensuring peace\nand security and hastening national reunification on the\nKorean peninsula is the establishment of a new peace\narrangement. In this regard, as we have made clear more\nthan once, the outdated system of the Korean armistice\nshould be replaced with a new peace arrangement\nbetween the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea and\nthe United States, which is primarily responsible for\npeace on the Korean peninsula. The north and south of\nKorea adopted the Agreement on Reconciliation, Non-\nAggression, Cooperation and Exchanges between the\nSouth and the North in December 1991, which is a de\nfacto, written, inter-Korean peace arrangement. All that\nthe north and south have to do is put into operation such\na peace arrangement that commits both sides to non-\naggression.\nWhat remains to be done now is for the Democratic\nPeople\u2019s Republic of Korea to establish a new peace\narrangement with the United States, which holds the real\nmilitary commanding power in South Korea. This process\ncannot be delayed any longer, both in view of the\ncontemporary trend shifting towards peace and d\u00e9tente\nand away from confrontation and in the current context of\nthe implementation of the Agreed Framework between the\nDemocratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea and the United\nStates.\nThe United States must fulfil its responsibility and\nrole in working out a new peace arrangement that will\nreplace the system of armistice, a typical cold-war-era\nlegacy still existing on the Korean peninsula. Once legal\nand institutional mechanisms for such a peace\narrangement are in place between the Democratic\nPeople\u2019s Republic of Korea and the United States, the\ntension on the Korean peninsula will be defused\ndrastically. This in turn will facilitate the smooth\nimplementation of the inter-Korean agreement and prove\nhelpful in stabilizing the situation in North-East Asia and\nthe Pacific as well.\nWhen both the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of\nKorea and the United States work together with mutual\ntrust, they can resolve those issues that still remain\noutstanding on the Korean peninsula. This has been\nproved by the process of resolving the so-called nuclear\nissue on the Korean peninsula, about which the world\ncommunity had once been deeply concerned.\n7\n\n\nThe Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea and the\nUnited States signed the Agreed Framework in Geneva in\nOctober of 1994, and since then they have both been taking\npractical steps to implement it. We have honored our\ncommitment by freezing our graphite-moderated reactors\nand their related facilities, and in return the United States\nhas been working towards progress with respect to the\nlight-water reactor project to be provided to the Democratic\nPeople\u2019s Republic of Korea and a number of other agreed\nareas.\nThe Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea has, in\nfact, fully implemented its obligations under the Agreed\nFramework between the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of\nKorea and the United States, and this, indeed, goes far\nbeyond the obligations to be fulfilled by a State signatory\nto the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons\nunder the Safeguards Agreement with the International\nAtomic Energy Agency.\nThere will be no complicated problems that cannot be\nresolved smoothly if international commitments are\nimplemented as sincerely as the Democratic People\u2019s\nRepublic of Korea has done. The point at issue is how the\nUnited States will go about proceeding down the road, and\nwe are closely following the course of its actions.\nIf the United States remains as sincere in its approach\nas it was during its discussions with the Democratic\nPeople\u2019s Republic of Korea on the nuclear issue, the issues\nrelating to the establishment of a new peace arrangement on\nthe Korean peninsula will certainly be resolved smoothly.\nThe continuation of the armistice status in Korea still\nties down the relationship between the Democratic People\u2019s\nRepublic of Korea and the United Nations to continuing\nbelligerency. The establishment of a new peace arrangement\non the Korean peninsula is a matter that deserves the due\nattention of the United Nations, which has to work hard to\ndo its part in promoting the arrangement\u2019s realization.\nThis is the only logical course both in terms of wiping\nclean the slate of the past unsavory relationship of the\nUnited Nations with the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of\nKorea, a dignified United Nations Member State, and in the\nlight of implementing resolution 3390 B (XXX), calling for\nthe dissolution of the United Nations Command and\nreplacement of the Armistice Agreement with a peace\nagreement.\nThe United Nations should do all it can to boldly\neliminate the old legacy of the cold-war era and to help\nestablish a new peace arrangement on the Korean\npeninsula.\nI would like to take this opportunity to express our\nprofound thanks to the Heads of State and Government\nand the peoples of various countries for their support,\nencouragement and firm solidarity with the Korean people\nin their just cause of peace on the Korean peninsula and\nKorea\u2019s peaceful reunification.\nToday, on its fiftieth anniversary, the United Nations\nis faced with heavy tasks if it is to work more actively\nand effectively for the consolidation of world peace and\nsecurity, the advancement of social and economic\ndevelopment, and the common prosperity of humankind.\nIn conformity with the purposes and principles enshrined\nin its Charter, the United Nations should make a\nsubstantial contribution to the efforts of all countries and\nnations to safeguard national independence and\nsovereignty and to build a new, free and peaceful world\nwithout any forms of domination or subjugation.\nAn important priority in the fulfilment by the United\nNations of its own mission and role is to make sure that\nthe application of the principle of international justice and\nfairness is in place. International justice and fairness are\nvital to the United Nations activities. However, a minority\nof big Powers are exercising their privileged rights and\nbehaving themselves in a high-handed manner, in\nopposition to the United Nations Charter, while a majority\nof small and weak nations are denied their well-deserved\npositions. Still worse, intolerable events have occurred\nwhich ignore the desire of the developing countries and\nviolate their interests.\nThe United Nations should refrain from any acts\nrunning counter to the principle of international justice\nand fairness in its activities and, moreover, should not\nunjustly apply double standards that enable certain\ncountries to abuse the United Nations in pursuing their\nown political purposes.\nThe United Nations should respect the sovereignty\nand interests of the small countries and treat all countries\non an equal footing, and should prove itself worthy of its\nprestige as a world body that substantially contributes to\nworld peace and security, to the economic development\nof each country and to the greater welfare of peoples.\nMany countries in the world today are fully justified in\ntheir call for the restructuring and democratization of the\nUnited Nations. The United Nations will not be able to\nfulfil its own mission and role unless it adapts to the\n8\n\n\nchanges of the times, lives up to the aspirations of\nhumankind and overhauls some impractical structures and\nauthority.\nThe restructuring of the Security Council is most\nessential for the democratization of the United Nations.\nOne of the key points in the expansion of Security\nCouncil membership is to accord priority to the developing\ncountries that form an absolute majority of the United\nNations membership, and apply the principle of equal\nregional distribution with due consideration given to the\nnumber of countries in each region. A country like Japan\nwhich has not apologized enough for, and wiped the slate\nclean of, its past wrongdoings is not entitled to become a\npermanent member of the Security Council. Another point\nis that the veto rights of the permanent members of the\nSecurity Council should be abrogated. The removal of the\nveto system will mean removing the major stumbling-block\nto the democratization of the United Nations and the\nelimination of the legacies of the cold-war era that have\nencouraged hegemonistic and high-handed actions by a\nminority of big Powers. At the same time, the power and\nauthority of the Security Council should be curtailed, while\nthe General Assembly should be given more power, and\nopen access to all the work of the Security Council should\nbe available, including to its informal consultations. For a\nresolution of the Security Council adopted on behalf of the\nUnited Nations and calling for sanctions or the use of force\nagainst its Member States to come into force, the resolution\nwill have to be approved by more than two thirds of the\nMember States at the General Assembly.\nDisarmament, especially nuclear disarmament, is still\none of the most important problems placed before the\nUnited Nations.\nA number of signs of progress in the field of\ndisarmament have emerged since the end of the cold war.\nHowever, the process of nuclear-weapons reduction is still\nmoving at a snail\u2019s pace, and the concept of what approach\nshould be taken to the existence of nuclear weaponry\nremains elusive. The continuing pursuit by the nuclear-\nweapon States of their respective monopolies of nuclear-\nweapons capability only keeps alive the danger to us of\nnuclear wars and nuclear proliferation.\nThe nuclear-weapon States must turn around and\nmeasure up to the desire and aspiration of humankind to\nlive in peace on this planet by carrying through the\nuniversal and complete abolition of nuclear weapons in line\nwith the present-day trends in favour of the establishment\nof nuclear-weapon-free and peace zones.\nToday, the question of development has assumed a\nvery serious dimension for the absolute majority of the\ndeveloping countries. It is, indeed, encouraging to note\nthat the preparation of the Agenda for Development that\nbegan at the initiative of the developing countries, with a\nview to the enhancement of the functions and role of the\nUnited Nations in the field of development, is now in the\nhome stretch. If the Agenda for Development is to\ncontribute substantially to the development efforts of the\ndeveloping countries, it should be directed primarily\ntowards the establishment of equitable international\neconomic relations and the removal of gaps between the\nrich and the poor \u2014 between the North and the South. At\nthe same time, we should not allow any attempts to use\nthis development issue as a means to interfere in the\ninternal affairs of other countries by relating it to the so-\ncalled protection of human rights.\nToday, the non-aligned and other developing\ncountries are working hard to achieve South-South\ncooperation and establish the South-South economic\norder. The United Nations should accord priority to the\nresolution of development issues and take concrete steps\nto help establish fair and equitable international economic\nrelations that will assist the developing countries in their\ndevelopment efforts and encourage South-South\ncooperation.\nAt present, the national independence and\nsovereignty of several countries are ruthlessly trampled\nunderfoot in different parts of the globe, and disputes and\nconflicts, both religious and ethnic as well as region-wide,\nwhich in some cases escalate into catastrophic wars,\ncontinue unabated. It is, indeed, painful to see that peace\nand security are tattered and people are falling victim to\ndisasters.\nWe consider that disputes among countries and\nnations should be resolved peacefully through dialogue\nand negotiations in conformity with the interests of the\npeoples of the countries concerned.\nToday, all the justice- and peace-loving countries\nand nations in the world are dynamically struggling to\ncreate a new independent world, overcoming all\nchallenges and difficulties, looking ahead to the twenty-\nfirst century from the heights of the present vibrant era.\n9\n\n\nWe actively support the just cause of the peoples of\nthe members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations\n(ASEAN) in favour of peace, stability and common\nprosperity in their region, and the just cause of all other\nAsian peoples in favour of building a new, independent and\nprosperous Asia.\nWe support the Arab peoples in their struggle for a\nfair and comprehensive resolution of the Middle East\nquestion, including the Palestinian issue, and the African\npeoples in their efforts for independent development of\ntheir countries, overcoming all social and economic\ndifficulties.\nWe extend our active support and encouragement to\nthe Cuban people in their just cause in favour of firmly\nsafeguarding the country\u2019s sovereignty and the gains of\nsocialism, and express our solidarity with the peoples of\nLatin America in their endeavours towards peace and\nprosperity in their region.\nWe support the people of the non-aligned and other\ndeveloping countries in their efforts to achieve social and\neconomic development and establish an equitable\ninternational political and economic order.\nThe Government of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic\nof Korea and the Korean people extends, and will continue\nto extend in the future, active support and solidarity to the\npeoples of all the countries in the world in their efforts to\nbuild a new society and independent world against all forms\nof domination and subjugation.\nI would like to take this opportunity to express our\ndeep thanks to the United Nations organs, specialized\nagencies and non-governmental organizations, including the\nUnited Nations Department of Humanitarian Affairs, and to\nvarious Governments for the humanitarian steps they have\nall taken in connection with the recent flood damage in our\ncountry.\nThe foreign policy of the Government of the\nDemocratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea remains unchanged.\nThe independence, peace and friendship advanced by the\ngreat leader Comrade Kim Il Sung in his lifetime and now\nbeing implemented by the respected supreme leader\nComrade Kim Jong Il are the cornerstone and principle of\nthe Government\u2019s foreign policy, and its correctness and\nvitality have already been powerfully demonstrated in actual\npractice.\nIndependence is vital to the life of our Republic and\nthe key factor in its domestic and foreign policies. The\nindependent policy of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic\nof Korea not only guarantees the unique character and\nstability of our own-style Socialist system, but also makes\na substantial contribution to peace and security in north-\neast Asia and the rest of the world.\nTrue to the lifetime teachings of the fatherly leader\nComrade Kim Il Sung, and under the wise leadership of\nthe respected supreme leader Comrade Kim Jong Il, the\nGovernment of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of\nKorea will continue as before its steadfast commitment to\nindependence, to uniting with the peoples of all the\ncountries of the world advocating independence, to\nstrengthening further ties of friendship and cooperation\nwith them, and to carrying through faithfully its duties in\nthe accomplishment of the common cause of humankind\nfor world peace and security.\nThe delegation of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic\nof Korea wishes to assure the Assembly that, together\nwith various other delegations, it will exert its sincere\nefforts towards successful debates on the agenda items\nplaced before this session of the General Assembly.\n"

        "file_text": "At the outset, I\nshould like to express warm congratulations to the\nPresident of the General Assembly, His Excellency\nMr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral, a distinguished statesman\nand eminent jurist from friendly Portugal.\nWe also follow with particular appreciation the\nactions of the Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-\nGhali, whose dedication to the cause of peace and\neconomic and social development meets with universal\napproval.\nThree months ago, the celebrations of the fiftieth\nanniversary of our Organization were inaugurated at a\nmeeting of Nobel Prize winners in San Francisco. Fifty\nyears have passed since the end of the Second World\nWar, which began with the aggression of the forces of the\nThird Reich against Poland in the early hours of 1\nSeptember 1939. As a historian and also an eyewitness to\nthose days, I have a moral right to recall from this\nrostrum that it was Poland that put a stop to appeasement,\na policy that was futile then and is futile today, a policy\nwhich, in the long run at any rate, never pays, anywhere.\nFor Poland, the first victim of the Second World\nWar, that war lasted the longest: five years, eight months\nand eight days. It ended in victory, but a victory which\ndid not bring the Polish people complete freedom. It was\nonly 45 years later that we achieved the goal for which\nPolish patriots had fought with dedication: a free and\nsovereign State in a new, democratic Europe.\n5\n\n\nAlready during that most terrible of wars to date,\nthought was being given to peace and ways of making it\nendure. Mindful of their tragic wartime experiences,\npeoples and States sought to rid the world once and for\never of wars and the sufferings they inflict. That is how the\nUnited Nations was born. From the very start, Poland, a\nfounding Member, has played an active part in the activities\nof the Organization, whose principal purposes were to\npreserve and consolidate international peace and security,\nensure peaceful social and economic development and the\nright to a decent existence and promote respect for human\nrights.\nThe cold war and East-West bipolarity swiftly dashed\nthe newborn hopes for the relaxation of tensions and peace\nuntroubled by political or ideological disputes. Although,\nhappily, a global nuclear cataclysm has not come to pass,\nfor which much of the credit is undeniably due to the\nUnited Nations, post-war history abounds with tensions, and\nhumanity has, more than once, found itself on the brink of\ntotal war. Instead of providing for recovery from the\nravages of war and for human well-being, increasing\nresources were spent on maintaining a singular balance \u2014\nthe balance of terror through the arms race. The world was\ndivided at Yalta into two hostile camps. Many States, in\nCentral Europe for instance, ended up in the Eastern bloc\nagainst the will of their people. If I refer to Yalta, it is not\nmeant as a reproach for a pact that was so heinous for\nPoland: it is as a warning against future Yaltas, wherever\nthey might be concluded or whomever they might threaten.\nWe want a Europe without political or other divisions, for\ntheir consequences would be the same.\nFollowing the geopolitical transformations that\noriginated in Poland in the 1980s and proved unstoppable\nin the face of the aspirations to freedom of the peoples of\nthat part of Europe and of Asia, the world has become\ninfinitely safer. East-West confrontation has disappeared,\nfor ever, it is hoped, and the terms \u201cEast\u201d and \u201cWest\u201d have\nregained their old, purely geographical connotations. Yet\nthe world, though no longer bipolar, has not been freed\nfrom conflicts. Hitherto dormant or suppressed, tides of\nnationalism have surfaced with renewed vigour, often\nfuelled by intolerance, ethnic and religious strife or outright\nracism.\nSix years after the commencement in 1989 of great\nchanges in the world political map, the anticipated new\ninternational order has failed to materialize. The United\nNations and all its Members are still actively looking for\neffective and equitable answers to the new problems that\nhave emerged since the end of the cold war. These political\nchanges present a unique opportunity to build a new\nsystem of peaceful cooperation, not of mere coexistence.\nOur desire is to seek a new world order, one that will\nensure full security to all States and provide conditions\nfor their swift social and economic development, while at\nthe same time giving all individuals the opportunity to\nexercise fully their human rights, to which they are\nentitled. Of course, there would not be room for any kind\nof intolerance, manifestations of ethnic, religious or racial\nhatred, including shameful anti-Semitism.\nPoland is aware of, and acknowledges, the\nmomentous role which the United Nations plays in the\nrealization of these goals. An Organization founded by 51\nStates has grown to become a universal structure\nembracing almost all the countries of the globe. It is,\nhowever, not only the number of Members that has\nchanged: its tasks have also kept growing steadily. While\noriginally the political military question and\ndecolonization predominated, in time the scope of United\nNations interests widened, and today it would be hard to\nidentify a single domain where the United Nations system\nis not involved. Expectations of the United Nations have\ngrown likewise, often excessively, since they were not\nbacked by sufficient political will to provide the\nOrganization with appropriate instruments, which are\nindispensable if it is to live up to these expectations. I\nhave in mind one of the basic fields of United Nations\nactivities \u2014 conflict prevention and settlement. Here the\nUnited Nations lends itself relatively easily to attack. One\noverlooks, however, how much the character of conflicts\nnow confronting the international community has\nchanged. Conventional conflicts between States are now\nincreasingly giving way to internal conflicts, as in\nRwanda, in Somalia and, up to a point, in the former\nYugoslavia. The traditional mediation role of the United\nNations peace-keeping forces, discharged with the consent\nof the parties to a conflict, has frequently become\nimpossible in present-day conditions. In many cases,\nUnited Nations peace-keeping missions come up against\nthe dilemma of having to depart from the principle of\nnon-interference in the internal affairs of a State torn\napart by civil war. Should one remain indifferent and\nignore human suffering in such a situation? It is we, the\nStates Members of the United Nations, which are often\ncalled upon to answer this question unequivocally, and we\nare not always able to do so. Inevitably, this adversely\naffects the success of the mission, the blame for which is\nall too often and all too easily placed on the United\nNations. One tends to forget that we are the United\nNations.\n6\n\n\nPoland takes the view that when a direct threat is\nposed to international peace and security, the United\nNations \u2014 if it is to be an efficient instrument of collective\nsecurity in accordance with the Charter \u2014 must be\nequipped to do its job. We can draw up a long list of\nconflicts and wars which were brought to an end thanks to\nUnited Nations efforts. Millions of human lives have been\nsaved, owing to humanitarian relief action organized by the\nUnited Nations \u2014 but an equally long list can be produced\nof undertakings which ended in failure. The fiftieth\nanniversary should, no doubt, prompt critical reflection on\nthe subject. Defeats and mistakes must not lead to the\nabdication of efforts. They should encourage the taking of\nsteps to reform and remodel what must be changed, and\nthus make the United Nations a truly modern Organization,\nadapted to new circumstances and measuring up to the\nrequirements of the period and its challenges.\nIn today\u2019s interconnected and interdependent world,\neven the most powerful nations cannot cope alone with\nsuch global issues as, for example, the proliferation of\nweapons of mass destruction, the spread of drugs, hunger\nand poverty, the pollution of the environment, acquired\nimmunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), and increasingly\nrampant terrorism \u2014 in short, all the ills that are appearing\nas we approach the end of the century. Consequently, we\nneed to bolster the trend towards enhancement of\nmultilateral institutions, including the United Nations and its\nsystem. It was in this spirit that the President of Poland,\nLech Walesa, spoke at San Francisco last June when he\nreferred to the Organization\u2019s shortcomings in critical\nterms.\nPoland is not only playing its full role in this process:\nthe creation of a new international order is the focal point\nof its foreign policy at the subregional, regional and global\nlevels. Fully sovereign and independent, today\u2019s Poland is\none of the largest and most populous countries in Central\nand Eastern Europe. It strives actively to contribute to\nensuring the stability of a region of importance to\nEurope \u2014 a region that forms a natural geographical,\ncultural and economic bridge between Europe\u2019s historically\nevolved parts. Hence, the basic task of the foreign policy of\nthe Republic of Poland is active participation in, and a\ncreative contribution to, the building of a new Europe \u2014\none without divisions and conflicts, ensuring well-being and\nsecurity to all its inhabitants.\nIn practice, this policy is manifested in unremitting\nefforts to integrate Poland into European and Atlantic\nstructures, in acknowledgement of their role as guarantors\nof the security, stability, democracy and economic\ndevelopment of our continent.\nThe priority of our foreign policy agenda is entry\ninto the European Union. The Union had its origins in the\ndays of the Marshall Plan, to which Poland declared its\naccessibility; this was subsequently withdrawn under\npressure from outside. Because of the systemic\ndifferences and the delay in economic and social\ndevelopment that ensued in the intervening years, the\nprocess of adaptation is bound to be difficult, costly and\nprotracted. We are, however, convinced that this is not\ntoo high a price to pay for joining a regional organization\nwhich, more than any other in history, has been able to\nensure its members \u2014 apart from political integration \u2014\nprosperity, a high level of social security and the highest\nstandards of protection of individual rights and freedoms.\nExpansion eastwards by the North Atlantic Treaty\nOrganization (NATO) and the European Union is\nsynonymous with the consolidation of the zone of\nstability in this once conflict-prone region.\nIn a foreign policy statement in the Polish\nParliament four months ago, I said that Poland was not\npursuing, and would not pursue, two different foreign\npolicies: one Western and the other Eastern. In other\nwords, while seeking to join Western European structures,\nwe attach great importance to cultivating friendly relations\nand all-round cooperation both with our immediate and\nwith our more distant neighbours. We are pursuing\ncooperation with these States within the framework of the\nexisting subregional organizations and are working for its\nexpansion. We are bound to our neighbours by treaties of\ngood-neighbourly relations, friendship and cooperation.\nWe will spare no effort to eradicate as soon as possible\nall vestiges of mutual prejudice and any grievances still\nharboured by our societies.\nPoland attaches major importance to the\nconsolidation and expansion of such all-European\norganizations as the Organization for Security and\nCooperation in Europe (OSCE), the Council of Europe,\nand the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe\n(ECE). We support the OSCE role in resolving armed\nconflicts in our part of the world, in cooperation with the\nUnited Nations. We therefore welcome with satisfaction\nthe Conciliation and Arbitration Tribunal established by\nthe OSCE last May. Our active participation in the work\nof the Council of Europe results from our strong belief\nthat it is of enormous importance in the process of\ndissemination, reinforcement and development of\n7\n\n\ndemocratic institutions and mechanisms for the protection\nof human rights on our continent.\nFinally, reference must be made to Poland\u2019s\ncontribution to the work of the United Nations Economic\nCommission for Europe. Thanks to its long experience in\nefforts to overcome the economic divisions that Europe\ninherited from the recent past, the ECE has a role to play\nin the process of the economic integration of Europe.\nAt the same time, I wish to declare Poland\u2019s strong\nsupport for the useful activities of the regional commissions\nin general. They should be responsible for coordinating, in\neach region, the local projects of the United Nations\nsystem, especially its specialized agencies, and become\nregional focal points for the promotion of sustainable\ngrowth and human development. The same applies to such\nsubregional initiatives as the Central European Initiative,\nthe Council of the Baltic Sea States, and the Central\nEuropean Free Trade Association.\nWhile concentrating, understandably enough, on\nproblems connected with the transformation of our political\nand economic systems, Poland is paying due attention to\ndevelopment processes and trends in the world at large. We\nare systematically expanding our economic and political\ncontacts with nations on other continents. We are\nincreasingly concerned at the scale of the economic\nproblems looming in North-South relations. The\ndevelopment disparities and contrasts in this area call for an\nurgent intensification of the efforts of the whole world, and\nthe more advanced countries in particular. We are not\nalways in a position to provide developing countries with\naid matching their expectations, but we shall provide it to\nthe extent we can.\nWe note with satisfaction the vitality of the Non-\nAligned Movement, which has been cooperating with the\nUnited Nations for many years and which, despite so many\nchanges, remains unfailingly active on the international\nstage. This Movement played a paramount role in bringing\nthe era of colonialism to an end, has successfully assisted\nyoung nations to secure their rightful place in the world and\nis now laying the foundations for a new era of post-cold-\nwar relations between States, free of global confrontation.\nOver the last three years, under the presidency of Indonesia,\nthe Non-Aligned Movement has ably redirected its priorities\nin order to focus its attention on economic development. It\nembarked on this task on the basis of fruitful dialogue with\nthe developed countries and has greatly contributed to\nnarrowing the gap between the latter and the nations it\nrepresents. We take note in particular of the spectacular\nprogress made by the Association of South-East Asian\nNations (ASEAN) in terms of development, and we\nacknowledge its efforts to extinguish old conflicts and\nprevent new ones, to build confidence and to search for\nnew security formulas. Poland is interested in political\ndialogue and economic cooperation with this group of\nStates, both bilaterally and within a broader Europe-Asia\nformula. Central Europe also has many characteristics and\ninterests in common with the States of Latin America and\ntheir groupings. At the last session of the Economic and\nSocial Council we gave forceful expression to our\nsolidarity with Africa. We believe that cooperation with,\nand the provision of assistance to, the African continent\nis in the best interests of the international community.\nFor its part, Poland is fully conscious of its\nobligations to the world community, as manifested by its\nactive participation in the work of the United Nations \u2014\nan organization where States, large, small and medium-\nsized, like Poland, participate democratically, as far as\nthey can, in a mutual effort to transform the world. We\nare prepared to assume additional obligations in regard to\ninternational peace and security. That is why we have put\nforward our candidacy for non-permanent membership of\nthe Security Council in the elections to be held during the\ncurrent session of the General Assembly.\nConsistent with the obligations embodied in the\nCharter of the United Nations, the maintenance of\ninternational peace and security is central to Poland\u2019s\nforeign policy. Proof of our commitment to this goal has\nbeen the participation, since the 1950s, of soldiers and\nofficers of the Polish army in United Nations peace-\nkeeping operations, and more recently in those launched\nunder the auspices of the OSCE.\nFor many years now, Poland has traditionally been\namong the 10 States fielding the largest contingents in\nUnited Nations peace-keeping operations, despite its\nmounting financial problems due to the growing delays in\nthe reimbursement of the expenses incurred. Poland is\ngravely concerned at the increasingly frequent instances\nof disregard for the status of peace-keeping personnel,\nsuch as Blue Helmets being attacked or taken hostage for\nuse as human shields, a practice of which United Nations\nmilitary observers from Poland have also been the\nvictims. It is for this reason that the entry into force of\nthe relevant Convention and its rigorous observance are\nextremely urgent.\nIt is also essential to streamline the functioning of\npeace-keeping operations. We note with satisfaction the\n8\n\n\nprogress already made in this field. However, recent events\nin the former Yugoslavia demonstrate the need for further\nsteps to be taken to ensure the effectiveness of action,\nespecially in emergency situations. This issue is particularly\ntopical in view of the multiplication of extremely bloody\nand dangerous internal armed conflicts. The evident\nimpotence of the international community in such situations\nis due to the fact that, as numerous examples in the last few\nyears bear out, international organizations, by their very\nnature, are not prepared for active intervention in internal\nconflicts. These examples also demonstrate that the only\npossible basis for the resolution of an internal conflict is an\naccord between the warring parties. We therefore believe\nthat the primary task of the United Nations is to strive\nunflaggingly, as it has often done so effectively in the past,\nto bring the parties to a conflict to the negotiating table, to\nbroker an agreement between them and to supervise its\nimplementation. The relevance of preventive diplomacy to\nboth intra-State and international conflicts, and the United\nNations role in that respect, were rightly recalled by my\nAustralian colleague, Senator Gareth Evans.\nAnother key facet of international security is the issue\nof disarmament. In this area we welcomed, with joy and\nrelief, the indefinite extension of the Treaty on the\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, arrived at last May\nby consensus. We pay tribute to the wisdom and\nfarsightedness displayed by all participants, without\nexception, at the Review and Extension Conference in New\nYork.\nThe road that has brought the world to an unbelievable\nbuild-up of nuclear arsenals was long and costly. Today we\nrealize that embarking on this same road in the opposite\ndirection, towards disarmament, will be equally long, costly\nand complicated. The indefinite extension of the NPT was\nan act of enormous significance. The next task \u2014 no less\ndifficult and just as momentous \u2014 will be the conclusion\nof a comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty, which should\ntake place no later than in 1996. Special importance, in our\nview, should also be attached to the entry into force and\npractical implementation of the Convention on the\nprohibition of chemical weapons, an instrument which\nPoland ratified last July. In all these matters, Polish\ndiplomacy has played, and will continue to play, an active\nrole.\nPoland believes that progress in disarmament in the\nfield of weapons of mass destruction should be paralleled\nby a simultaneous and equally tangible effort in the field of\nconventional weapons, a category of arms that over the last\nhalf-century has inflicted tens of millions of casualties in\ncountless regional and internal conflicts. The inescapable\nconclusion is that the United Nations needs to go beyond\nthe limited aims of the United Nations Register of\nConventional Arms and that the problems of conventional\narms control and disarmament have to be put on the\nagenda of the Conference on Disarmament. This is\nimportant not only because of the specific nature of the\ncontemporary conflicts the United Nations has to deal\nwith, but also because of the need to put an end to the\nmounting wave of internal and international terrorism in\nan increasing number of countries. There can be no doubt\nthat terrorism and organized crime in general, as well as\nillegal traffic in radioactive materials and drugs, represent\ntoday a serious threat to security. Determined action is\ntherefore needed. Its success will depend on broad\ninternational cooperation within the United Nations\nsystem \u2014 I refer to the Vienna institutions \u2014 as well as\noutside the United Nations system.\nEconomic development is an extremely important\nand, in recent years, increasingly significant sphere of\nactivity of the organs of the United Nations system.\nEconomic development problems, together with social\nissues, have been the subject of a number of major\ninternational conferences. The agendas of conferences\nalready held and those of the ones to be convened in the\nnext two years address virtually all development-related\nproblems. What is now indispensable is to concentrate\nefforts on the conscientious and coordinated\nimplementation of their decisions, a matter of which\naccount should also be taken in the planned reform of the\nUnited Nations system.\nWe appreciate the incipient changes that are\nappearing in the attitude of the Bretton Woods institutions\nwith regard to the question of the social dimension of\ndevelopment processes, especially the elimination of\npoverty and unemployment. These issues clearly stood out\nat the Copenhagen social summit and at the session of the\nEconomic and Social Council held in Geneva earlier this\nyear. This bolsters the hope that the efforts of the poorer\ncountries to cope with the contingencies of socio-\neconomic development will obtain external financial\nsupport. We do not share the view that developing\ncountries or, for that matter, nations that, like Poland, are\nin the throes of transformation, are contributing to\nunemployment in the more developed parts of the world.\nWe do not accept the argument that trade with low-wage\ncountries might threaten the economic stability of such\ndeveloped countries. According to the findings of the\nlatest studies by the Organisation for Economic\nCooperation and Development, the less-developed\n9\n\n\ncountries represent, first and foremost, new markets that are\nof interest to multinational corporations. Let me note in this\nconnection that Poland has been recently classified as one\nof the world\u2019s 10 biggest emerging markets.\nSpecific opportunities have also been created by the\nconclusion of the Uruguay Round and the establishment of\nthe World Trade Organization. In the short term, however,\nthe liberalization of world trade could be too great a\nchallenge to the weakest partners, especially in Africa. We\nare in favour of safety-net arrangements for countries in\nthis category.\nWe also perceive a development paradox of our times:\ncut-backs in agricultural production in some parts of the\nworld because of excessive stocks of food and for purposes\nof checking falling prices are paralleled by the existence of\nendemic famine areas in other parts of the world. In an\ninterdependent world such as ours, there is something\nbaffling in this situation. The United Nations should be the\nforum in which to address this difficult and conscience-\ntroubling problem. The solution is not simply one of\nredistribution. The crux of the matter lies in helping these\ncountries to help themselves by stimulating their capacity\nfor self-reliance instead of perpetuating their dependence.\nLastly, the third area crucial to the well-being of\nfuture generations, to which Poland attaches particular\nimportance, is the question of human rights. Today, six\nyears into the process of democratic change, Poland can\npride itself on having a legal system which meets the most\nrigorous international standards in the field of respect for\nand comprehensive protection of human rights.\nPoland has not confined itself to taking care of internal\nproblems in that regard. In the past few years it has been\npursuing wide-ranging activities in the United Nations\norgans concerned with human rights and the development\nof international mechanisms for their protection.\nUndoubtedly, in this field the Vienna Human Rights\nConference of 1993 was a landmark event. Polish\ndiplomacy was extremely active both at the preparatory\nstage and in the course of the Conference. From the outset\nwe strongly endorsed the establishment of the Office of\nHigh Commissioner for Human Rights, which was one of\nthe principal achievements of the Vienna Conference. Since\nthe appointment of Ambassador Ayala Lasso to this\nimportant post we have given him our full cooperation and\nsupport.\nOf its very nature, the United Nations does not have\nthe means to force either States or armed groupings to\nrespect the rights of citizens and to comply with\ninternational obligations in this field. Violations of\nhumanitarian law and the laws of war are rife. The timid\nresponse to the systematic reports by the Human Rights\nCommission\u2019s Special Rapporteur, the former Polish\nPrime Minister, Tadeusz Mazowiecki, of drastic violations\nof human rights in the former Yugoslavia resulted in his\nresignation from his mission. We note with satisfaction\nstatements from this rostrum recognizing the significance\nof his endeavours.\nThe upgrading of the status of human rights within\nthe structure of United Nations organs, the General\nAssembly included, is essential. The basic tasks of our\nOrganization in this field should be the promotion of\npermanent international dialogue on the protection of\nhuman rights, the development of mechanisms for\noverseeing compliance with international obligations and\nthe increase of technical assistance by rich and\nexperienced nations to countries which lack the necessary\nresources. Appropriate funds for this purpose should be\nmade available to the High Commissioner and the Centre\nfor Human Rights in Geneva.\nEver since the foundation of the United Nations 50\nyears ago the tasks facing the Organization have grown in\nnumber and complexity. The political and economic\nenvironment in which these tasks have to be coped with\nalso keeps changing, as demonstrated by the decisions of\nthe latest major Conferences \u2014 in Cairo, Copenhagen and\nBeijing. That calls for the continuous adaptation of the\norganizational structures and procedures to new tasks and\nchanging circumstances. It is imperative to enhance the\nmethods of cooperation between the United Nations and\nregional organizations like the Organization for Security\nand Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), the Organization of\nAfrican Unity (OAU), the Organization of American\nStates (OAS) and the Organization of the Islamic\nConference (OIC). Equally important is the effort further\nto develop the system of international law so that it can\nregulate more adequately and with greater precision the\nrights and obligations of its subjects in the ever growing\nnumber of areas of their mutual relations. The importance\nof these problems, United Nations reform included, has\nnot escaped the attention of our distinguished Secretary-\nGeneral, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali.\nThe reform of the United Nations is therefore a\npressing task. It is necessary in respect of the principal\norgans, the Security Council and the Economic and Social\nCouncil in the first place, and the countless subsidiary\nbodies. Poland appreciates the results of efforts made so\n10\n\n\nfar to enhance the work of the Security Council. As a\nresult, we have a Council which is both more efficient and\nmore than ever responsive to the need for greater\ntransparency in its proceedings. Poland wishes to express its\nsupport for the acceleration of steps aimed at an appropriate\nexpansion of the Council\u2019s composition, to render it more\nrepresentative without detriment to its effectiveness. The\nreform of the Organization must aim at upgrading its\nefficiency and remedying its financial situation, while\nkeeping intact the basic principle of the sovereign equality\nof all its Members. However, the most important issue is\nefficiency, without forgetting that, as an intergovernmental\nOrganization, the basic task of the United Nations is to\ncement partner-like cooperation between its Members, and\nrecalling that it can act only on their authority. The ultimate\nsuccess of the reform will be the best contribution we can\nmake to the observance of the fiftieth anniversary of the\nOrganization.\nLet me add the voice of Poland to all those statements\nwhich, on the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations,\nconveyed from this rostrum unequivocal assurances of\nconfidence in the future of our Organization and in its\nability to cope with the challenges that face us on the\nthreshold of the twenty-first century. For its part, Poland is\nready to participate in these efforts for the sake of future\ngenerations so that, in contrast to my own, they will never\nexperience war, be it hot or cold, and so that they can live\nin a world founded on principles of cooperation, good-\nneighbourly relations and mutual trust.\n"

        "file_text": "Let me at the outset\nextend to Mr. Freitas do Amaral of Portugal the sincere\ngood wishes of the Government and people of Sri Lanka on\nhis election to the presidency of the General Assembly at\nthis its historic fiftieth session. We are privileged to have\nhim guide its deliberations. My delegation offers him the\nsame full cooperation that we extended to all his\npredecessors in that high office.\nOur gratitude is due Mr. Amara Essy of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire,\nwho presided over the forty-ninth session with great skill\nand wisdom.\nWhen I addressed the Assembly last year, I reported\nthat the people of Sri Lanka had secured an electoral\nvictory for\n\u201cmoderation, tolerance and unity\u201d (Official Records of\nthe General Assembly, Forty-ninth Session, Plenary\nMeetings, 5th meeting, p. 23)\nin a society that had passed through harrowing times. I\ndetailed the initiatives taken by the Government of\nPresident Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga,\nsupported by a number of political parties, including those\nof the two principal minority communities, to resolve\noutstanding ethnic and other disputes through a bold\nprocess of political negotiation. That process was\nlaunched, but later encountered set-backs, primarily\nbecause one of the groups with which the Government\nhad commenced talks abruptly returned to violence and\nterrorism, rejecting the peaceful option to which the rest\nof the country is committed. The Government has been\nconstrained to take unavoidable reactive military measures\nto safeguard the lives, the security and the welfare of\nthose who are threatened by the terrorist group. So long\nas they aim at our leaders the threat of assassination, we\ncannot believe that their professions of peace are sincere.\nWe continue to fulfil our obligations to all our\ncitizens, including those trapped in the north of the\ncountry. Supplies of food and other essential requirements\nare being made available by the Government and\ndelivered through the International Committee of the Red\nCross to our citizens in affected areas. This is an\nexceptional exercise which the late James Grant of the\nUnited Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) described as\nuniquely humanitarian in a conflict situation.\nWe are deeply troubled and concerned about the\nsituation in which the children of the north and east of\nour country are placed. That mankind owes to the child\nthe best it has to give is universally accepted. Yet we are\nappalled that in their desperation the militants, spurning\nthe entreaties of distraught parents, have descended to\nconscripting children as young in age as 10 years to wage\nwar and have even assigned them to suicide missions. A\nrecent military encounter in north-eastern Sri Lanka\nrevealed grim evidence confirming our worst fears. Most\nof the lives sacrificed by the leadership of the militants\nwere teenagers barely able to carry arms, let alone\nunderstand the twisted mono-ethnic separatist ideology\nthey have been indoctrinated to defend. In truth, it is the\nmilitants who must bear the ultimate responsibility for\ncivilian casualties in this conflict. One of the challenges\nof peace that Sri Lanka will soon have to face is the need\nto overcome the terrible legacy of the subverted and\ndistorted young minds, of the broken, bereft families and\ninterrupted lives that the conflict will leave behind.\nAll this has only increased my Government\u2019s\ndetermination to fulfil an imperative mandate from the\npeople, to rebuild a free society in our Republic which is\n23\n\n\nbased on tolerance and understanding and in which all\ncommunities throughout the nation could live in harmony\nand dignity in accordance with the principles of democratic\ngovernance. The Government has accordingly presented\ncomprehensive proposals, daring in their scope and reach,\nfor the devolution of power to regional units. True to our\nlong-established democratic tradition, a free-ranging\nnational debate among Sri Lankans is proceeding on these\nproposals. The eventual implementation of agreed proposals\nwill require compliance with the procedures appropriate for\nthe amendment of our Constitution, including a two-thirds\nmajority in Parliament and a national referendum.\nTo help further enhance conditions of confidence for\nthe observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms,\nmy Government has presented legislation in Parliament to\nestablish a Human Rights Commission in Sri Lanka. The\nCommission will consist of members chosen from among\npersons with knowledge and experience in the field of\nhuman rights. They will be appointed on the\nrecommendation of a Constitutional Council \u2014 an\nindependent and widely representative body reflecting all\nshades of political opinion. The proposed Commission will\nhave monitoring functions in respect of executive and\nadministrative practices as well as investigative functions to\ninquire into any infringement of fundamental rights. It will\nalso have advisory and other functions, inter alia, to ensure\nthat laws and administrative practices accord with\ninternational human-rights norms and standards and to\nfacilitate inexpensive access to remedial relief. Sri Lanka\nhas consistently supported United Nations initiatives for\nnational institution-building in the field of human rights.\nIt has been a source of major encouragement to us that\nthe international community has supported the efforts of the\nGovernment of Sri Lanka in the pursuit of peace. While the\neventual solution of our problems lies essentially in our\nown hands and through mechanisms of our own devising,\nwe sincerely appreciate the interest and support of the\ninternational community. It is in this context that I have\nvolunteered today to brief the Assembly on the situation in\nSri Lanka.\nThe significance of this session of the United Nations\nGeneral Assembly extends well beyond the fact that it\ncommemorates 50 years in the life of the Organization.\nInternational life is in constant flux. No era is wholly static.\nYet the last decade or so has seen radical changes affecting\nvirtually every aspect of life on this planet. Not all of such\nchanges have been welcome. Not all of the changes have\nreached their logical, or indeed illogical, conclusion.\nThe acclaimed transformation in South Africa has\nbeen a blessed exception. Institutionalized racism in its\ngrosser forms has at last been vanquished. The South\nAfrican experience has demonstrated the power of\ntolerance, understanding and inspired leadership to wear\ndown the brutal, evil legacies of the past. It has also\nshown that there is a capacity for change in human\nattitudes once considered unthinkable. Racism, however,\nhas continued in subtler forms elsewhere in the world.\nThe international community must continue to be vigilant.\nThat ugly phenomenon must never be tolerated, wherever\nit occurs and whatever its manifestations.\nSri Lanka feels deeply that the African continent\nneeds the wholehearted and vigorous support of the\ninternational community to overcome the obstacles to\ndevelopment and growth in this vital region of the world.\nThe strengthening and utilization of the capacities and\nresources of Africa, identified by the African countries\nthemselves and the Economic Commission for Africa, and\nconcerted action to implement the Programme of Action\nfor the Least-Developed Countries are urgently called for.\nThe Middle East is the cradle of three of the world\u2019s\ngreat religions. Yet historical prejudices have weighed\ndown the quest for peace. Resort to violence and\nterrorism, the expropriation of land and the development\nof illegal settlements have conspired to impede the\nmomentum for peace. Sri Lanka supports the continuation\nof the peace process in the Middle East, the realization of\nthe inalienable national rights of the Palestinian people\nand the establishment of conditions of peace and stability\nfor all States in the region which would enable them to\ndevelop within secure boundaries. Commitments made on\ninterim agreements towards this objective, as Chairman\nArafat of Palestine stated last Thursday, must be precise,\nhonest and mutual.\nIn Bosnia, Sri Lanka welcomes the fact that the\nparties concerned have found it possible to commence\npeace negotiations although the guns have yet to be\nfinally silenced. We feel deeply for, and share the sorrow\nof, those who mourn for lives lost, lives disrupted in the\naffected communities. We hope that a viable settlement\nacceptable to all will soon be concluded. I had occasion\nrecently, speaking in the Parliament of Sri Lanka, to\ncondemn unreservedly the inhumane and cruel treatment\nthat has been inflicted upon the Muslims in Bosnia. These\nand other atrocities committed in Bosnia have been fully\ndocumented by the United Nations rapporteurs and\nhumanitarian agencies and need to be condemned by the\ninternational community.\n24\n\n\nThe role of the United Nations in that conflict has\nreceived special focus as the Organization, in this its fiftieth\nyear, undergoes a period of introspection. The situation in\nBosnia has been an unusually complex one in which the\nUnited Nations has had to deal with developments without\nprecedent in the Organization\u2019s peace-keeping history. In\nterms of Article 17 of the United Nations Charter, peace-\nkeeping is the collective financial responsibility of all\nStates. A healthy, albeit controversial, debate has proceeded\nin the United Nations on peace-keeping and other related\nissues. The debate has made abundantly clear that United\nNations intervention or involvement in any situation can\nexpect to be successful only if certain basic considerations\nare heeded. First, any intervention must enjoy the general\nsupport and confidence of the international community and\nnot be promoted merely to satisfy the political exigencies\nand partisan objectives of members of the Security Council\nor other powerful States. Secondly, in any intervention the\nconsent of the countries in conflict must be clearly\nobtained. Finally, such politico-military operations must\nneither dominate United Nations activity nor be its principal\nfinancial liability. They must certainly not be carried out to\nthe detriment of the pressing development priorities of the\nUnited Nations.\nIn \u201cAn Agenda for Peace\u201d the Secretary-General has\nsought to evaluate manifold aspects of contemporary peace\nand security, not merely the question of peace-keeping\noperations. This evaluation has had a continuous focus in\nthe General Assembly, in the Security Council, in other\nforums such as the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries as\nwell as in national debate since the Secretary-General\u2019s\ninitial report was presented in 1992. The cardinal aspect of\n\u201cAn Agenda for Peace\u201d is the conviction that it is clearly\nbetter to prevent conflicts through heeding early warnings\nand encouraging quiet diplomacy rather than through\nlaunching major politico-military ventures to settle conflicts\nafter they have erupted.\nWhile economic factors have not always been the\ncause of conflict, we very much agree with the Secretary-\nGeneral that the foundations for peace lie primarily in the\nrealm of economic and social development.\nThe 1990s have often been described as a period of\neconomic globalization, considering the increasing\ninterdependence among States, greater international\nintegration and flow of goods, services, capital and markets,\nas well as a more widespread and rapid dissemination of\ninformation and ideas through technological advancements\nin communications. Globalization is sometimes over-\nsimplified as a phenomenon favourable to the emancipation\nof international economic activity. It is true that most\neconomies which had been constricted or centrally\ncontrolled have now been liberalized and have, as it were,\nplugged in to the global economy. Yet, in the process,\nmany developing countries have had to make painful\nstructural adjustments in their economies at heavy cost to\nvulnerable sections of their populations. If there is greater\noverall international economic activity, it is also true that\nfor many developing countries, despite their best efforts,\nthe economic outlook has not been encouraging. The\nrecent Conference of non-aligned countries held at Jakarta\nissued a renewed call for a new orientation between\ndeveloped and developing countries whereby constructive\ndialogue and partnership were emphasized, based on a\nmutuality of interest and benefit, genuine interdependence\nand shared responsibility.\nA major thrust of this approach has been to work out\nnew practical aspects of international development\ncooperation which would embrace developed as well as\ndeveloping countries, the more secure economies as well\nas those that are more vulnerable. The final communiqu\u00e9\nissued earlier this year in Halifax, at the Summit of the\nseven major industrialized countries, proclaimed their\nwillingness to cooperate with others to develop a new\napproach to international cooperation and to define the\nparticular contribution expected of the United Nations\nsystem to develop such an approach. A vital aspect of this\nexercise should be the enhancement of cooperation\nbetween the United Nations system and the Bretton\nWoods institutions.\nCalls made earlier for a restructuring of international\neconomic relations and a North-South dialogue have\nfloundered in a sea of slogans. But we must realize that\nglobal interdependence has made international cooperation\nan imperative, not a slogan. The United Nations must\nassert its part in a more effective new multilateralism.\nAlmost two decades ago Sri Lanka adopted a liberal\nfree-market economy in order to accelerate economic\ngrowth. My Government is taking steps to privatize State-\ncontrolled enterprises, in particular utilities and services\nprovided by the Government, and to encourage foreign\ninvestment. We intend to benefit from the opportunities\narising from the globalization of economic activity.\nA number of world conferences have recently been\nheld, covering a series of generic issues which have a\ndirect bearing on the lives of people the world over.\nThese have demonstrated both the promise and the\npaucity of international cooperation. Agenda 21, produced\n25\n\n\nby the Rio Conference on Environment and Development,\nis yet to be fully operationalized due to the lack of\nnecessary resources. Last year the International Conference\non Population and Development affirmed the central role of\nthe human being in all development and population\nactivities. The World Summit for Social Development, held\nin March this year in Copenhagen, sought to promote\nconcerted international action to deal with a crucial trio of\ncontemporary concerns: poverty, unemployment and the\ndisintegration of society. The World Conference on\nWomen, in Beijing last month, dealt with a range of\nissues \u2014 political, social, religious and economic \u2014\naffecting women and adopted a Platform for Action to\nempower women.\nAll these conferences have emphasized that\nresponsibility for major global problems needs to be shared\nand that action to deal with them needs to be taken in\nconcert. Regrettably, if expectations have been great,\nresources for their realization have been meagre. The\npolitical determination necessary to transform commitments\ninto action still appears far less than adequate.\nDespite the absence of optimal international\ncooperation in certain areas, some regional activities have\nmade good progress. In our own region, the South Asian\nAssociation for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) celebrates\nits tenth anniversary this year. The SAARC Preferential\nTrade Arrangement has made much headway and is\nexpected to enter into force this year. We look to the future\nconfident of consolidating our gains in a South Asian free-\ntrade arrangement. Sri Lanka, together with our South\nAsian partners, will explore all avenues to seek and build\non common ground and optimize regional cooperation in\nareas of mutual interest. Indeed, cooperation within, as well\nas between, regions offers much scope for economic\nprogress and equitable sharing of global wealth. We look\nforward to greater interregional cooperation to advance this\nprocess.\nSri Lanka was privileged to have served the Review\nand Extension Conference on the Treaty on the Non-\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and to facilitate\nthe adoption of a package of decisions without resort to a\nvote. While the outcome of the Conference has been widely\nhailed, it is vital also to emphasize the need for the\nestablishment of a comprehensive disarmament regime to\nmeet the security concerns of all countries, including the\nnon-nuclear-weapon States, through the realization of\ncommitments undertaken under the Treaty and the decisions\ntaken at the 1995 Conference by the nuclear-weapon States.\nThese commitments include the conclusion of a\ncomprehensive test-ban Treaty, legally binding assurances\nto non-nuclear-weapon States against the use or threat of\nuse of nuclear weapons, the unimpeded,\nnon-discriminatory transfer of nuclear technology for\npeaceful purposes and the eventual elimination of all\nnuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction\nthroughout the world.\nWe have expressed our deep disappointment and\nconcern over the resumption of nuclear testing by some\nnuclear Powers, which is contrary to the undertakings of\nutmost restraint entered into at the NPT Conference. We\ntherefore urge that expeditious negotiations be conducted\non a comprehensive test-ban treaty, with a view to\nconcluding it in 1996. In this regard, we are happy to\nsupport President Clinton\u2019s initiative to place the Geneva\nnegotiations on a comprehensive test-ban treaty on a\nfaster track in order to achieve a zero-yield test-ban treaty\nby 1996. We also note the recent assurance in this respect\ngiven by President Chirac of France.\nThe establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones and\nzones of peace is an essential part of regional security.\nThe non-aligned countries, including Sri Lanka, have\nsought to establish conditions of peace, security and\nstability in the Indian Ocean region. The United Nations\nAd Hoc Committee on the Indian Ocean, taking into\naccount current realities, has been considering new,\nalternative approaches to ensuring peace and security in\nthis vital but volatile region of the world. Sri Lanka, as\nChairman of the Ad Hoc Committee, has been in\nconsultation with those permanent members of the\nSecurity Council that have not been participating in the\nCommittee\u2019s work in order to re-enlist their active\nparticipation and give fresh impetus to the process of\nstrengthening cooperation in the Indian Ocean region,\nincluding in respect of non-military aspects of security.\nSri Lanka\u2019s initiative for Indian Ocean Marine\nAffairs Cooperation (IOMAC) has focused on the\ndevelopment of international cooperation in marine affairs\nin the economic, scientific and technical fields. The recent\nMauritius and Perth initiatives on the Indian Ocean have\nrecognized IOMAC\u2019s pioneering effort in helping to\nwiden cooperation in the marine sector. The process for\nthe formalization of IOMAC through the ratification of\nthe 1990 Arusha Agreement on the Organization for\nIndian Ocean Marine Affairs Cooperation is being further\naccelerated in order to provide an effective mechanism for\nintensifying cooperation, in keeping with the growing\naspirations of the countries of the region.\n26\n\n\nThe fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations has\nspawned a variety of studies on the future of the\nOrganization, initiated within as well as outside the United\nNations. Working groups of the General Assembly have\nbeen busy during recent sessions, studying the financial\nsituation of the Organization, development issues, the\nSecurity Council, the Agenda for Peace and other aspects\nof the United Nations.\nThe issues are complex. Progress is slow. Decisions\nare few. A resolution on the strengthening of the United\nNations system, patiently negotiated on the initiative of the\nPresident of the forty-ninth session of the General\nAssembly, was adopted by consensus. There is much to\nsupport a coordinated, rational and informed examination of\nrecommendations which seek to strengthen the United\nNations and render it a more effective and efficient\nOrganization. A piecemeal approach may not be an\neffective one, given the complexity of the individual issues\ninvolved as well as their interrelationship. We look forward\nto further work on this initiative next year.\nThe Security Council has perhaps been the single most\ncontentious United Nations organ under scrutiny. Sri\nLanka\u2019s own position is that in many respects the Council\nstill reflects power realities that prevailed 50 years ago.\nThere can be no warrant for the perpetuation of exclusive\nrights without accommodation of other relevant\nconsiderations. A substantial increase in the membership of\nthe United Nations, particularly from among developing\ncounties, needs to be more equitably reflected in the\ncomposition of the Council as well. Furthermore, there are\nreasons, at least as compelling as those proclaimed 50 years\nago to justify the status conferred at that time on the\nCouncil\u2019s five permanent members, to now advance the\nclaims of other States that aspire to join the five. These\nnew aspirants to permanent-member status include,\nreasonably and justifiably in our view, non-aligned\ncountries as well. Regrettably, eligibility claims for\nmembership in the Council continue to be made on\nassumptions of power, military or economic, and its global\nor regional projection. But this vitiates basic principles\nunderlying democratic representation and considerations of\njustice and equity. If regional criteria are considered, then,\nAsia, Africa and Latin America are either unrepresented or\nseverely under-represented in the present Council. Finally,\nthe veto power, given its untrammelled character and its\nassociation with the possession of nuclear weapons, needs,\nin our opinion, careful, sober review.\nThe Security Council\u2019s methods of work have in the\nrecent past been subject to welcome improvement,\nparticularly in permitting a better exchange of views\nbetween Council members and others. There is, however,\nmuch more that needs to be done to make the Security\nCouncil truly accessible, democratic and responsive to\nMember States of the United Nations, on whose behalf\nthe Council is meant to act in accordance with Charter\nprinciples. A single example relating to the imposition\nand implementation of sanctions would suffice to indicate\nthe gap between principle and practice. Situations in\nwhich sanctions are imposed vary greatly and no uniform\nrules are applicable. Sanctions cannot be applied with\nsurgical precision to impact exclusively on those at whom\nthey are aimed. Sanctions can thus hurt innocent civilians,\naffect entire economies and, as the Council itself\nacknowledges, impact adversely on third countries that are\nin no way involved in the transgressions of the regime\nagainst which sanctions are imposed. Yet decisions by the\nCouncil on the imposition of sanctions are not based on\nprior consultations with the countries concerned, to assess\ncarefully the true impact, extent and reach of such\nextreme measures. As sanctions are mandatory, all\ncountries are bound to implement them even when they\nhave had no part in the decisions leading to them. In his\n\u201cSupplement to An Agenda for Peace'\u201d, the Secretary-\nGeneral has made a number of useful recommendations\nrelating to the serious problems encountered in the\nimplementation of sanctions. The non-aligned countries\nhave studied these proposals and we await further developments.\nLater this month, the United Nations will mark its\nfiftieth anniversary with a special commemorative\nmeeting. Although the occasion will, by its very nature,\nembody the highest possible political commitment made\nby the international community to the United Nations, it\nmust not be seen purely as an opportunity for the\nOrganization to garner a harvest of tributes. Much ails the\nOrganization. Nevertheless, it is Sri Lanka\u2019s firm\nconviction that the membership of the United Nations has\nwithin it the means to reinvest in the Organization all it\nrequires to fulfil the principles of the Charter. This would\nrequire much more than a symbolic declaration of\ncommitment by each Member State. We owe it to the\npeople we represent to strive diligently in the years to\ncome to make this Organization truly a place where the\nhighest aspirations of humanity can be fulfilled.\nTentative programme of work\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me first of all to\ncongratulate you, Sir, on your election to the presidency of\nthe fiftieth session of the United Nations General Assembly.\nYour election is a clear recognition of the high esteem your\ncountry justly enjoys as an important link between different\ncultures and continents. This in turn has enabled Portugal\nto become an active partner of those countries, like\nBulgaria, that are progressing towards democracy and a\nmarket economy within a united Europe.\nIn today\u2019s world of profound change the fiftieth\nanniversary of the United Nations is of significance above\nall as a vantage point from which to try to develop a\nvision for the future.\nSituated at the historical crossroads of nations and\ncivilizations, Bulgaria today is seeking both to contribute\nto the successful redefinition of the United Nations role\nin the world of tomorrow and to ensure its own national\nsecurity and wellbeing. The role of the United Nations\nshould be above all to build upon the enhanced capacity\nof the Organization in three crucial spheres of its\nactivities, namely, conflict settlement and peace-keeping,\npost-conflict peace-building, and the laying of durable\nfoundations for lasting peace.\nToday we all recognize the emergence of a great\nnumber of new challenges to peace and security marked\nby extraordinary diversity and complexity. The conflict\nstill raging in the former Yugoslavia has been a traumatic\ntest of the key United Nations responsibility for conflict\nsettlement and peace-keeping. The disappointments in this\nregard have been many and profound; yet we should all\nface up to the simple truth that our Organization can be\nonly as effective as a guarantor of peace as we Member\ncountries wish and permit it to be.\nBulgaria has from the outset strictly adhered to\npolicies supporting a peaceful settlement under United\nNations auspices. Unilaterally, it has adopted and\nconsistently abided by the principle of non-interference in\nthe conflict. It has chosen not to become involved, either\n\n\ndirectly or indirectly, in any type of military activities on\nthe territory of the former Yugoslavia, including\nparticipation in United Nations peace-keeping. We have\ncalled upon the other countries in the region to exercise the\nsame restraint. On the other hand, throughout the conflict\nBulgaria has supported every international initiative aimed\nat achieving a peaceful, balanced, just and comprehensive\nsolution.\nIn keeping with its obligations under the United\nNations Charter and as a means of restarting negotiations,\nBulgaria has consistently implemented the international\nsanctions regime. This step was taken on the basis of a\nnational consensus that, despite the heavy burden such\nsanctions created for Bulgaria, it was our duty to implement\nthem as a dependable member of the international\ncommunity.\nYet Bulgaria has sustained debilitating losses as a\nresult of the sanctions. Over the past few years, we have\nrepeatedly drawn attention to this problem, both as it\nconcerns Bulgaria and as it concerns cooperation with other\naffected States. The sanction-induced losses so far amount\nto well over 25 per cent of Bulgaria\u2019s estimated gross\ndomestic product for 1995. This has made Bulgaria by far\nthe country most seriously affected.\nBulgaria\u2019s policies favouring a peaceful outcome have\nhelped to establish it as a stabilizing factor in a most deeply\ntroubled region of Europe. At the same time, we feel that\nsuch recognition also contributes to enhancing the peace-\nmaking potential of the United Nations itself. Positive\ninteraction between the policies of individual Member\nStates and the decisions and measures of the world\nOrganization is the decisive factor in enhancing the latter\u2019s\nkey mission, that of helping to settle conflicts and keep the\npeace.\nHowever, Bulgaria\u2019s experience also shows that in\norder to discharge this mission successfully in the future the\nUnited Nations needs carefully to rethink its main peace-\nkeeping instruments, such as economic sanctions and peace-\nkeeping missions.\nIn areas outside its immediate vicinity Bulgaria has in\nrecent years contributed ground forces and civilian and\npolice observers. In the operation in Cambodia, generally\nconsidered a success, several young Bulgarians lost their\nlives. We sympathize with other countries that have\nsustained human losses in subsequent missions, including\nthe latest in the former Yugoslavia. We therefore strongly\nsupport the view that there is a need to reform and improve\nthe ways in which such missions are planned and\nexecuted, with priority given to enhancing the safety of\nUnited Nations personnel.\nRecently, mediation between parties to a given\nconflict has been successfully utilized in the discharge of\nUnited Nations conflict-settlement missions. In this\ncontext, we welcome the agreement reached between\nneighbouring Greece and the Republic of Macedonia as\na most important step towards lessening tensions in the\nwhole of southeastern Europe.\nA further major contribution in this regard should be\nactive United Nations support for and collaboration in\nbringing to a successful conclusion the present intensive\nefforts to attain peace in Bosnia. Bulgaria welcomes the\nUnited States peace initiative and the efforts to implement\nit in close cooperation with the United Nations and the\ncountries in the Contact Group. This has opened up real\npossibilities for a negotiated settlement of the conflict.\nExperience derived from the Yugoslav crisis\nhighlights the importance of another crucial United\nNations function, namely, post-conflict peace-building.\nToday, it is obvious that although negotiations have not\nyet achieved a final settlement there is a need to begin to\naddress the problems of post-conflict peace-building\nwithout delay.\nOne set of such problems concerns the reduction of\nthe levels of armaments and armed forces. It is clear that\nconflict settlement would be pointless were it not\naccompanied by a set of actions designed to remove the\nsources of real or potential security threats in the area.\nThus, in the arms-control field Bulgaria shares the\nview that the establishment of a future harmonized arms-\ncontrol regime in Europe should combine measures of\nboth a pan-European and a regional character. Such\nmeasures should be based on the understanding that\nsecurity must be indivisible and that any disproportionate\nconcentration of armaments, in particular when coupled\nwith a lack of control mechanisms, undermines security\nand stability. Therefore, the establishment of a credible\nsystem of arms control and confidence- and security-\nbuilding measures for the territory of the former\nYugoslavia, as part of and in line with the pan-European\nregimes, must be an essential part of a comprehensive\npost-war settlement. Relevant international bodies such as\nthe United Nations and the Organization for Security and\nCooperation in Europe (OSCE) should play a very\nimportant role in this respect. The main objective should\n2\n\n\nbe to attain levels of armaments that will preclude once and\nfor all any temptation to use force.\nThe second set of peace-building measures concerns\npost-conflict economic reconstruction and stabilization.\nImportant work has been done at the United Nations\nin the past several years for developing an integrated\napproach to successfully implementing reconstruction\nprogrammes. Such an approach should encompass four\ninterrelated aspects: strategic issues of reconstruction, needs\nand capabilities, post-conflict reconstruction framework and\nmobilization of resources.\nToday plans for reconstruction are being laid for parts\nof the conflict area in the former Yugoslavia. Bulgaria is\nparticularly well placed to contribute to such plans. This is\nso for a number of reasons: first, its long-standing\nrelationship with the countries in and around the conflict\narea and its consistent policies in favour of a balanced and\ndurable political settlement; secondly, because of the\nexperience and know-how of Bulgarian companies with a\nlong record of practical work in the area; thirdly, acquired\nknowledge and expertise in working with international\nfinancial institutions in implementing programmes for\nreconstruction and development. For all these reasons,\nBulgaria could be an important factor contributing to the\nsuccess of any reconstruction effort in the area.\nThe emerging pattern of structured coordination\nbetween various organizations within and outside the United\nNations system provides guidelines and a very useful\nexample to follow. It encourages our own thinking as we\nstart exploring practical and institutional possibilities for\ncontributing to the concerted international efforts in this\nrespect.\nAt the same time, Bulgaria has every reason to expect\nalso to receive a part of the international post-conflict\nassistance for the region. Effectively building the peace in\nthe region requires that neighbouring countries that bore the\nbrunt of sanctions and have sustained inordinate losses be\nincluded on a priority basis in the list of recipients of\ninternational assistance.\nBulgaria\u2019s concerns over the subject of sanctions have\nalready become well known. We have formulated them in\nextenso on several occasions. In fact, the international\ncommunity and, in particular, the General Assembly have\nrecognized the right and the need to include non-target third\ncountries in programmes for reconstruction and\ndevelopment. At its two previous sessions, on Bulgarian\ninitiatives, the General Assembly adopted by consensus\ntwo resolutions on this set of issues. This year again, my\ndelegation intends to submit a corresponding draft\nresolution which I hope will receive universal support.\nAt this point, I cannot but underline the findings and\nrecommendations contained in the report (A/50/60) of the\nSecretary-General entitled \u201cSupplement to An Agenda for\nPeace\u201d and, in particular, his conclusion that the price of\nsanctions implementation should be borne equally by all\nMember States and not only by those who have had the\nmisfortune of being neighbours or important economic\npartners of a sanctions target country. I would like to take\nthis opportunity to commend especially the efforts of His\nExcellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali in this particularly\nimportant field of United Nations activities.\nIt is our view that, as a result of work already done,\ntoday there exists a significant scope of agreement on the\nways and means for overcoming the specific economic\nproblems confronting the affected States, as reflected in\npart IV of resolution 47/120 and resolutions 48/210 and\n49/21 A of the General Assembly. Bulgaria is\nparticipating, and will continue to do so, in an effort to\nhelp towards the successful completion of the discussion\non these issues in the United Nations.\nTogether with conflict settlement and post-conflict\npeace-building, a third, parallel line of action should be\nundertaken without delay. It should focus on laying\ndurable foundations for lasting peace through economic\nand social development. The task of achieving durable\nstability and security regarding peace and economic\ndevelopment has always been of particular relevance in\nSouth-Eastern Europe. It has become all the more so in\nthe light of evolving European integration.\nIn order to boost such development and lasting\nstability, there is an urgent need for concerted efforts by\nthe international organizations and specialized agencies\nwithin the United Nations system, coupled with broader\nand more intensive cooperation at a regional level. It is\ndoubtless necessary to avoid overlapping and duplication.\nYet a mechanism must be put in place for effectively\ncoordinating programmes for early implementation of\nachievable objectives.\nThe Ministerial Conference on environment for\nEurope, which is going to be held in Sofia the last week\nof this October, is a particularly apt example of this\napproach. Another initiative along these lines is the\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe\n3\n\n\n(OSCE) seminar on the role of trans-European\ninfrastructure for stability and cooperation in the Black Sea\nregion, which will also take place in Sofia, a month later.\nIt will be dealing with priority projects for developing\nregional transport, telecommunications and energy\ninfrastructure as factors both for economic growth and for\nlasting stability and peace in the area.\nThe above forums could provide valuable inputs for\nthe work undertaken within the European Union with the\naim of elaborating a comprehensive regional strategy for\nSouth-Eastern Europe. Such a strategy could be based on\nthe approach embodied in the measures accompanying the\nPact on Stability in Europe, put forward at the time by the\nUnion. Cooperation at the subregional level may also prove\nto be a factor of significant practical importance in this\ncontext.\nFor its part, Bulgaria, in the course of the past several\nmonths, has attempted to develop thinking and proposals\nfor regional stability, security and cooperation which could\ninteract with initiatives and programmes developed by\nEuropean and international institutions and major world\npartners. It is our belief that developing the economic\ndimensions of regional security will greatly favour the\novercoming of local tensions rooted in the past, as well as\nthe full-fledged implementation of the basic principles of\nrelations between States under the Helsinki Act and the\nParis Charter.\nWith a view to promoting such regional cooperation,\nI would like to state from this lofty rostrum that Bulgaria\nis ready to host a gathering of interested Central and South-\nEastern European States at the governmental level in the\ncourse of 1996. Given careful preparation and the support\nof the international community, such a high-level meeting\ncould become a major step towards lasting security and\nstability in a historically much-troubled part of Europe.\nThe parameters of the new international system are\nstill taking shape today. What is positive is that in the days\nof the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations the\ninternational community is looking for pragmatic and\nresponsible approaches to lend new meaning to the\nOrganization\u2019s mission. The discussion of the possibilities\nof and prospects for United Nations restructuring can draw\non the accumulated wealth of experience and take\nadvantage of the prevailing spirit of cooperation. Let us\nmake the best possible use of them and together venture\ninto the new century stronger, wiser and more united.\n"

        "file_text": "May I first\ncongratulate you, Sir, on your assumption of the presidency\nin this most important year for the United Nations.\nIt is nearly half a century since the General Assembly\nof the United Nations first met, in London. King George VI\ntold the visiting representatives of 50 countries that no more\nimportant meeting had ever taken place there. The founders\nof the United Nations had taken on themselves a heavy\nresponsibility and a noble work.\nToday we must pay tribute to those founders and\ntheir efforts. Earlier models of collective security had\nsoon crumbled. The League of Nations collapsed after\nless than two decades. The United Nations has proved\nmore durable. Over 50 years it has helped spread peace\nin place of war. It has worked to push back hunger and\ndisease and to advance democracy and human rights.\nWithout the United Nations we would have a bleaker\nworld.\nI am delighted to add Britain\u2019s voice to these\ncelebrations at the fiftieth session of the General\nAssembly. After five decades it is timely to recall what\nthe United Nations has achieved. At the start of a new\nhalf-century it is right to weigh the lessons of past\nexperience.\nThe United Nations is a means to an end. Its value\nlies not simply in the shared principles and ambitions\nenshrined in the Charter, but in practical results. Its\nsuccesses are real.\nThe United Nations has been a force for peace.\nFrom Korea in the 1950s to Kuwait in the 1990s, it has\nhelped check and reverse the tides of aggression. In the\nNear East and Cyprus, United Nations troops have\nworked for decades to sustain a measure of stability. In\nCambodia the United Nations mounted its most complex\noperation ever to rebuild a country shattered by 13 years\nof war. In Mozambique United Nations peace-keepers\nhave helped demobilize 100,000 combatants, allowing\ndemocratic elections and the creation of a unified army.\nThe United Nations has been a source of relief from\nsuffering. Since 1951 the Office of the United Nations\nHigh Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has provided\nfood, shelter, medicine and education for over 30 million\nrefugees. United Nations programmes have immunized 80\nper cent of the world\u2019s children against disease. United\nNations sanitation and nutrition projects have halved child\nmortality in developing countries.\nThe United Nations has been a motor for democracy\nand sustainable development. It has given electoral help\nto over 40 countries. Its charters and covenants set\ninternational standards of human rights. It has brokered\nagreements to conserve world forests and fish stocks.\n9\n\n\nThe United Nations has done good work for five\ndecades. My country, the United Kingdom, has been at its\nheart from the start. From the drafting of the Charter, as the\nfirst host, in London, of the General Assembly and of the\nSecurity Council, we have been a staunch supporter of the\nUnited Nations. From the first stirrings of environmental\nconcern in the 1960s, to the fight against AIDS since the\n1980s, through to management innovation and financial\nreform in the 1990s, Britain has been a driving force for the\nchanging agenda of the United Nations. In 1947 we were\na party to the first case to come before the International\nCourt of Justice. This year a British judge became the\nCourt\u2019s first ever woman member.\nEven before the end of the cold war, British forces\nhad served the United Nations cause for decades. For 30\nyears the United Nations operation in Cyprus has depended\non British troops and logistics. In the last five years British\nforces have served in Kuwait, Cambodia, Rwanda, Angola,\nGeorgia and, of course, Bosnia. Today Britain commits\nmore troops to United Nations peace-keeping than any other\nMember State \u2014 with 10,250 out of a total of 69,000.\nNear the end of its first half-century, the end of the\ncold war opened a new chapter for the United Nations.\nAfter years of super-Power stalemate, it again became\npossible to take effective action in the Security Council,\nincluding by authorizing the use of force to reverse\naggression. Almost immediately a rash of ethnically based\nregional disputes began to break out, from the former\nYugoslavia in the West to Central Asia in the East.\nEarly experience brought a sense of exhilaration.\nWhen Saddam Hussein made his foolish miscalculation and\nsought to wipe Kuwait off the map, the United Nations was\nthe means chosen to stop him, and it worked. Talk of a\nnew world order did not seem empty.\nFive years on, the record looks more diffuse. The\ninternational community could do little to halt disintegration\nin Somalia or to avert bloody collapse in Rwanda. The wars\nof secession in the former Yugoslavia have dragged on for\nfour years.\nBut those who speak of United Nations failure are\nwrong. The pendulum that swung too far towards euphoria\nafter the Gulf War has swung too far towards despair. Look\nat the facts.\nAlongside the torment of Bosnia and Rwanda are the\ndemocratic revolutions that have swept South Africa, South\nAmerica and Central and Eastern Europe. We live in a\npost-apartheid world, with a Europe of free nations and\nthe Middle East peace process a reality rather than a\nslogan. The United Nations has helped bring about peace\nin Namibia, Cambodia, El Salvador, Mozambique and at\nlast, perhaps, in Angola. Even in Bosnia, the real good\nthe United Nations has done has been obscured by unreal\nexpectations. The reality of the past five years is not one\nof spreading world disorder, but of painstaking, steady\nefforts to build peace.\nCompare this record to the grim setting for the first\nGeneral Assembly meeting in 1946, when whole regions\nlay in ruins after five years of world war. The truth is that\nthe history of serious attempts at international cooperation\nis still quite young. The United Nations is by far its most\nsuccessful expression. There is today no one country or\ngroup of countries ready and able to cope with new world\ndisorder all alone, and since regional instability and\neconomic dislocation affect all our interests, we need a\nstrong and effective United Nations.\nThis is not to deny the need for change. But it is no\ngood simply blaming the Organization. We, the United\nNations Members, must meet our obligations to help\nimprove the system. We have done much in recent years.\nThe United Nations is better able now to plan, mount and\nconduct missions. Britain and others have seconded\nmilitary officers to New York to develop the planning and\noperational capability and funded secondments by other\nnations. Last year Britain helped launch a new initiative\non African peace-keeping. That is bearing fruit now, in\nUnited Nations regional training, in closer cooperation\nbetween African countries and the Organization of\nAfrican Unity (OAU) Conflict Resolution Mechanism and\nin products like the Anglo-French Peace-keeping\nGlossary, developed by the Ghanaian Staff College.\nThe process of reform must continue. The more\nseriously the United Nations addresses issues like pre-\nplanning, logistic support and command and control, the\nmore confidence troop contributors will have, the more\nforces will be put at the disposal of the United Nations\nand the more effective the operations will be.\nChanging procedures is not enough. We must learn\nto be more realistic in what we ask of the United Nations.\nThat means not setting aspirations we cannot provide the\nmeans to meet. Sometimes a declaratory statement is\nuseful to put the international community\u2019s views on\nrecord, to underpin a consensus. At other times it may be\nbetter for the Security Council to remain silent than to\nissue unrealistic pronouncements.\n10\n\n\nBosnia and Somalia have shown the limits of peace-\nkeeping. They offer a clear lesson. The United Nations is\nnot yet suited to fight wars. Peace enforcement is better\nleft, perhaps, to a coalition of the willing acting under\nUnited Nations authority. We must not send in the United\nNations to keep a peace which does not exist and then\nblame the United Nations for failure, nor send it in\nmandated and equipped to keep the peace and then blame\nit because it does not enforce the peace.\nWhatever the blemishes of recent years, there is\ngreater scope today for effective international action than\never before. The United Nations should be the centre-point\nof such work. I suggest we should focus greater effort in\nfuture on two areas.\nFirst, preventive action is better than cure. Far better\nthan containing or extinguishing a fire is stopping it from\nigniting. Bosnia is the most tragic example. Today the\nprospects for peace look a little stronger. I commend the\nefforts of Dick Holbrooke, supported by the Contact Group,\nto mediate between the parties, and the agreement reached\nin Geneva on 8 September. Many hard choices lie ahead for\nall sides before a final settlement is achieved. But we have\nmade a start. It is vital that all parties seize this chance for\npeace. Only political negotiations, not military force, can\nsecure that.\nBut the war has dragged on for three and a half years\nnow. Tens of thousands of people have been killed;\nmillions more have been made homeless. It will take years\nfor the wounds inflicted on that country to heal. Certainly\nthe suffering would have been many times worse without\na United Nations presence. When I was in Sarajevo last\nweek, the Bosnian Government told me how much it values\nthe work done by British and other forces to help the\npeople of Bosnia. But how much better for all these people\nif war had been avoided from the start. Perhaps much of\nthe damage and destruction might have been prevented by\ncloser international attention to the problems and tensions\narising from the breakup of Yugoslavia in the early 1990s.\nWe have started to learn that lesson. The early\ndeployment of a small United Nations force in The Former\nYugoslav Republic of Macedonia has helped to stop\nconflict from spreading there. Elsewhere the quiet\ndiplomacy of the Organization for Security and Cooperation\nin Europe has helped defuse tension in Ukraine and\nAlbania; has nudged adversaries toward peace talks in\nGeorgia, Moldova and Chechnya. There are few headlines\nfor successes that avert fighting and save lives. But the\nheadlines of war carry a heavy price. Preventive action is\na wiser investment.\nMany routes exist. Britain and France have sketched\nout one model: to use the skills of diplomats, of soldiers,\nof academics and others to defuse tension and promote\ndialogue. The presence of aid workers, human rights\nmonitors, or United Nations envoys can help contain a\nbrewing crisis; and all credit to the United Nations\nrepresentative doing that in Burundi. We strongly support\nthe efforts of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) to\nwork with the United Nations in preventive diplomacy\nand conflict resolution. The initiative on African peace-\nkeeping will help.\nSo many different actors can play a part. The crucial\npoint is not who acts but when. Early warning of a crisis\nand prompt action by the international community are the\nreal key to avoiding further tragedy of the kind we have\nseen in Bosnia.\nMy second proposal is for a new approach to peace-\nbuilding. To provide lasting security requires more than\ndiplomacy and military force. To build real peace we\nmust bridge the gap between our humanitarian work and\nour long-term development work.\nAid workers have grown used to coping with the\ndebris of war. In the past five years the Office of the\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugees\n(UNHCR) has given help to millions fleeing conflict:\nRwandans in Tanzania and Zaire, Afghans in Iran and\nPakistan, Liberians in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire and in Guinea. But\ntoo often we treat short-term humanitarian needs in\nisolation. Huge sums have been spent in humanitarian\nefforts in Rwanda, for example. But Rwanda\u2019s long-term\nstability depends on rebuilding the structures of society\nand on civil rights; helping local communities to help\nthemselves, in areas from health and housing through to\nan effective judiciary.\nI suggest that two elements are key to a new\napproach.\nFirst of all, we must adopt a longer-term perspective\nin tackling immediate crises. Even when a cease-fire is\nholding, or elections have taken place, if the framework\nof society is shaky, a continued international presence can\noffer it stability until a government can cope. An abrupt\nend to a mission, by contrast, can be very destabilizing.\nIn El Salvador, for example, a small human rights team\nstayed on after the United Nations troops had left, to\n11\n\n\nprovide further advice and monitoring. Peace-keepers\nthemselves can help begin the work of reconstruction. The\nUnited Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) and the aid\nagencies have been doing that for over a year in central\nBosnia, underpinning reconciliation between Muslim and\nCroat communities by rebuilding roads and hospitals and\nschools.\nI strongly support the thesis of the Secretary-General\u2019s\nrecent report: that we must go beyond electoral assistance,\nto preparing the social and institutional ground in which\ndemocracy and civil society can put down firm roots. The\ntask of rebuilding Bosnia could be a model for the future.\nSecondly, we need far better coordination in what we\ndo. If funds are to be gathered and used quickly and\neffectively, donors themselves must make a greater effort\nto meet their promises of help. Before operations begin, as\nplanning gets under way, the international financial\ninstitutions must be involved from the start, as they were in\nCambodia. All the actors in the United Nations system must\nbe working together, military and political, humanitarian\nand development, crossing the traditional boundaries\nbetween rival baronies. Such a coalition of interests could\nplug the gap we see too often now, until the major\nreconstruction programmes can begin.\n\nMy proposal is to build on these principles in United\nNations programmes for stabilization and transition. There\nare many areas where international expertise can help\nrestore a society; creating judicial systems; training an\narmy; developing a finance ministry or a diplomatic service.\nTo fulfil these needs, we should be prepared to loan our\nexperts to countries emerging from conflict, as Britain\u2019s\nKnow-How Fund does for countries in Central and Eastern\nEurope emerging from communism. United Nations\nprogrammes for stabilization and transition could be the\ngreatest contribution we could make to international\nsecurity.\nThe demands on the United Nations have grown\nenormously. To meet them the United Nations needs\nchange at the centre too. I welcome work under way to cut\ncosts and reduce waste in New York. The whole United\nNations system must learn from that example. We need\nbetter planning and budgeting, an end to fraud and\nmismanagement. More subcontracting can help, using non-\ngovernmental organizations, even private companies, for\ntasks like mine clearance and logistics in Angola. And there\nis still too much duplication between the United Nations\nagencies. Rhetoric is not enough. Reform has to be real,\nand it has to be soon.\nThis is not a side issue. It is not a narrow interest.\nIf we are to do the United Nations work effectively \u2014\npeace-keeping, aid or humanitarian \u2014 we must use its\nresources better. No one, G-7 or G-77, benefits from\nwaste. Recent experience has shown the United Nations\nis in some ways ill-fitted for its tasks; under-powered in\nsome areas, like peace-keeping and preventive diplomacy;\nbut, however, still bloated in other parts of the system.\nUnited Nations Members must pay their dues. But the\nUnited Nations must justify those funds, and get the most\nfrom them, by hard decisions on duplication and over-\nstaffing, and diverting resources to the top priorities.\nBritain supports enlargement of the Security Council\nto broaden its base without reducing its effectiveness.\nPermanent membership is the key issue. Permanent\nmembers of the Security Council must be both willing\nand able to make a significant contribution through the\nUnited Nations to international security. That is what the\nSecurity Council is about. That is what it must remain if\nit is to be effective. Germany and Japan are playing an\nincreasing part across the range of United Nations\nbusiness, and are among the top three financial\ncontributors. It is right that they should benefit from an\nexpansion of the permanent membership, with the wider\nrights that entails, but also with the wider responsibilities\nto contribute to security and peace-keeping. Broad\ngeographical balance in an enlarged Council also needs to\nbe maintained.\nBut the United Nations system will never work if we\ndo not fund it properly. The United Nations is on the\nverge of financial collapse. It is owed over $3.7 billion in\nunpaid contributions. Troop contributors are owed nearly\n$1 billion. Last year 39 countries failed to pay at all. The\nUnited Kingdom favours tightening of penalties for non-\npayment, including the charging of interest on late\npayments. We find unacceptable cross-funding of regular\nbudget deficits from the peace-keeping budget. Perhaps an\nappropriate policy could best be entitled: No\nRepresentation without Taxation!\nThe financing arrangements must change. Some\nmembers pay too much. Others, like the new economic\ngiants of the developing world, now pay less than they\nshould. We need a scale that is simpler and reflects a\ncountry\u2019s real capacity to pay, and without the additional\nanomalies and distortions of the present system. Britain\n12\n\n\nand Sweden have put forward ideas. We need progress\nsoon.\nBut the problem is not solved by turning the tap off.\nThis year we have all reaffirmed our support for goals and\nwork of the United Nations. But empty words will not pay\nbills.\nThe final lesson from the last 50 years may be the\nmost important: the case for a strong, effective United\nNations.\nIn conclusion, may I say that the United Nations today\nfaces a crisis of confidence. United States Congressmen\nmay be the most vocal sceptics. They are not alone. The air\nof optimism, of a fresh start after the cold war, is overtaken\nin some quarters by gloom at the instability and\nfragmentation around us, and pessimism at our ability to\ncope. This despair is dangerous.\nMultilateral action is not an add-on to national policy.\nIt gives wider legitimacy to principles we value, such as\nhuman rights and democracy. It spreads the cost of aims we\nshare, such as freeing Kuwait from invasion or restoring\ndemocracy in Haiti. It lets us work with others to fight\ncommon threats, such as greenhouse-gas emissions or the\ninternational drug trade.\nThe price is not high. The bill for all United Nations\npeace-keeping, all aid and development work last year, was\nslightly over 3.5 per cent of the United States\u2019 defence\nbudget, or less than the United Kingdom spends on police\nand public administration. One day of Operation Desert\nStorm cost as much as all that year\u2019s United Nations peace-\nkeeping. The price of disengagement and disorder would be\ngreater. Public support is there. Even in the United States,\npolls are clear: people support the United Nations, and they\nsupport international peace-keeping. We have a duty to our\nelectorates to continue the United Nations work.\nIt is easy to forget the United Nations successes over\n50 years. It is easy to turn away from disorder and chaos.\nBut the world is too small. Crises in distant countries affect\nus too; our commerce, our citizens overseas, our\nneighbour\u2019s security \u2014 ultimately it is our own. It is in our\ninterest to play what part we can to build a more decent\nworld. If the United Nations were not here to help do that,\nwe would have to invent something else.\nThe experience of five decades offers lessons for the\nfuture. I know the Secretary-General is committed to\nchange. Getting the United Nations we need for the twenty-\nfirst century requires the support and participation of all\nMember States. The United Kingdom has played a full\npart in the United Nations for 50 years, and we will\ncontinue to do so.\n"

Your assumption of the presidency of this\nsession is a crowning event in a long and brilliant\npolitical and diplomatic career, and will undoubtedly\nensure the success of our deliberations. It is all the more\ngratifying for us to emphasize this fact, since we share\nwith your country, Portugal, a historic past of deeply\nrooted links of culture and cooperation, which today unite\nour peoples and our countries.\nWe also extend our congratulations to your\npredecessor, His Excellency Mr. Amara Essy, the\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, a country\nwith which we have excellent relations of friendship and\ncooperation, on the brilliant way in which he guided the\nproceedings of the forty-ninth session.\nWe also want to take this opportunity to express to\nthe Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Boutros\nBoutros-Ghali, our appreciation for the dynamic way in\nwhich he is leading our Organization.\nAs we commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of our\nOrganization, and one year after the holding of the first\nmultiparty elections in Guinea-Bissau, I feel particularly\nhonoured to have the privilege of representing my country\nat this historic session of the General Assembly. This\nevent offers the international community a special\noccasion and an appropriate framework for reaffirming\nour full adherence to the principles of the United Nations\nCharter. A half century after its creation, the United\nNations must, more than ever before, be able to confront\nnew challenges.\nGuinea-Bissau is of the opinion that in order to best\nrespond to the needs of the day, our Organization must\nundertake urgent and appropriate reforms. I am convinced\nthat the political and socio-economic changes taking place\non the international scene have repercussions for the\nfunctioning of our Organization. It is our profound\nconviction that the end of the bipolarization of\ninternational relations and the cold war promises better\nconditions for the future of our Organization.\nThe broad prospects opening up for the process of\nthe peaceful settlement of conflicts in many parts of the\nworld are not just a matter of circumstance, but are rather\nthe expression of the international community\u2019s\nunequivocal will to establish lasting peace.\n24\n\n\nIt is in this context that we note with satisfaction that\nafter so many efforts made by the international community,\nthe Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the Economic\nCommunity of West African States (ECOWAS) in\nparticular, significant progress has been made in Liberia.\nAs far as Angola is concerned, we welcome the way\nin which the negotiation process and the implementation of\nthe agreements signed in Lusaka have developed. We\ncongratulate the people and leaders of the fraternal country\nof Mozambique for the exemplary way in which the first\nmultiparty elections took place there.\nThe situation in Somalia continues to be of serious\nconcern to Guinea-Bissau. We urge the parties concerned\nto put an end to hostilities, and to continue negotiations\nwith a view to achieving national reconciliation.\nIn the Middle East, the peace process deserves the\nsupport of the international community. We thus welcome\nwith satisfaction the progress achieved.\nAs regards Jammu and Kashmir, my country urges the\nparties to the conflict to find a just and lasting solution.\nMy country continues to support the initiatives\nregarding negotiations in East Timor, under the auspices of\nthe Secretary-General of the United Nations, with a view to\na just solution.\nIn connection with the question of the embargo\naffecting Cuba, which has an impact on the population of\nthat country, Guinea-Bissau encourages dialogue between\nthe parties concerned with a view to a definitive and\nsatisfactory solution.\nIn the former Yugoslavia, where the international\ncommunity has been witness to acts of inhumanity, we can\nat last welcome with optimism the progress achieved in the\ncourse of negotiations.\nAs the international community celebrates the fiftieth\nanniversary of the establishment of our universal\nOrganization, may I, on behalf of my Government, reiterate\nour firm conviction that the Republic of China on Taiwan\nshould form part of the United Nations on the basis of the\napplication of the principle of the parallel representation of\ndivided countries. In this context, it would be desirable for\nthe two countries to participate simultaneously in\ninternational activities, with a view to promoting\nconstructive contacts and negotiations. Respect for and the\nexercise of human rights and pluralist democracy are\nfactors in producing national unity and peace, and in\npreserving international stability. Guinea-Bissau continues\nto endeavour to defend and safeguard this concept, whose\nconstant application is vital to development.\nGuinea-Bissau continues to work to improve the\nmanagement of its economy. The proper implementation\nof a structural adjustment programme reflects the constant\nconcerns of my Government. I am convinced that in spite\nof our own efforts of macroeconomic management to\nimprove the well-being of our populations, my country\nneeds the support of the international community, with a\nview to confronting the many development challenges we\nface. The poverty and social injustice suffered by most of\nmankind constitute root causes of the conflict, threatening\nthe peace and stability of the world; the ideological\ntensions of the cold war could, indeed, be replaced by\nother crises, especially crises of an economic and\nfinancial origin, if urgent measures are not immediately\ntaken.\nThe threat to the environment is a reality which must\nbe urgently combated. The protection of the ecosystem\nrequires continued support for the development process of\nthe poorest countries. It is for this reason that we believe\nthat underdevelopment poses a serious threat to the\nenvironment of the African continent. The countries\nmembers of the Permanent Inter-State Committee on\nDrought Control in the Sahel (CILSS) are facing grave\nproblems of draught and other natural disasters that could\nseriously compromise their social and economic\ndevelopment.\nMore than ever before, international cooperation is\nbecoming imperative for world peace and for the\nprotection and strengthening of human dignity in order to\nensure full enjoyment of the rights and aspirations of\npresent and future generations. The social development\nactivities of the United Nations should focus in particular\non the most vulnerable groups, such as women, children,\nyoung people, the aged and the disabled.\nGuinea-Bissau, which is loyal to the principles of the\nCharter, reaffirms its determination to contribute to the\nmaintenance of international peace and security and\nsolemnly reiterates its firm resolve to persevere in that\ndirection. In this context, we welcome with pleasure the\nresults of the World Summit for Social Development and\nof the Fourth World Conference on Women.\nGuinea-Bissau\u2019s contribution to the attainment of the\npurposes and principles of our Organization is well\n25\n\n\nknown. Our participation in different peace-keeping\noperations around the world is the clearest illustration of\nthis. We are convinced that the maintenance of international\npeace and security is the collective responsibility of all\nMember\nStates, large and small, in accordance with the principle\nof the sovereign equality of States. In this context, my\ncountry, Guinea-Bissau, submitted its candidature for a\nnon-permanent seat on the Security Council, which has\nbeen endorsed by the African Group. In this regard, I\nrequest the support of all Member States.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, please allow me, first of all, to\nwarmly congratulate you on your election to the\npresidency of the current session of the General\nAssembly. I am convinced that with your remarkable\nability and rich experience, you will admirably fulfil this\nmission. I would also like to express my appreciation and\nthanks to Mr. Amara Essy for the important contribution\nhe has made during his presidency.\nI wish to avail myself of this opportunity to extend\nmy welcome and congratulations to the Republic of Palau,\nwhich was admitted into the United Nations after the last\nsession.\nThis year marks the fiftieth anniversary of the end of\nthe Second World War and the founding of the United\nNations. Over the past 50 years, the United Nations has\nstood the test of the vicissitudes in the international\nsituation, grown steadily, scored remarkable achievements\nand made major contributions to the peace and prosperity\nof mankind. Its membership has increased from 51 at its\nfounding to today\u2019s 185. The status and role of the United\nNations, the most universal and authoritative\nintergovernmental organization of sovereign States today,\nis irreplaceable by any other international organization.\nThe United Nations has traversed a tortuous and\nuneven path over the past fifty years, just like the\ndevelopment of anything else. On the occasion of the\nfiftieth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations,\nit is time to review the purposes and principles of the\nUnited Nations Charter, earnestly summarize the positive\nand negative experience, and introduce appropriate and\nnecessary reforms so as to revitalize the United Nations\nand usher it into the new century with a new look to meet\nthe challenge of the times. This is the call of all peoples\nand a lofty mission of the times.\nThe United Nations, which was founded in the\ntriumph of the world war against fascism, reflects the\nardent desire and determination of the world\u2019s people to\navert the scourge of war forever, safeguard world peace\nand security, carry out friendly international cooperation\n9\n\n\nand achieve common development. History has repeatedly\nproved that adherence to the purposes and principles of the\nUnited Nations Charter will enable the United Nations to\nplay a positive role in safeguarding peace and promoting\ndevelopment, while violation of and departure from the\npurposes and principles of the Charter will impair the\ndignity and image of the United Nations and weaken its\nrole. Therefore, to continue to uphold and carry forward the\npurposes and principles of the Charter is an unshirkable\nresponsibility of all United Nations Members and a basic\nprinciple guiding the reform of the United Nations.\nThe core of the United Nations Charter is the principle\nof equality between sovereign States and non-interference\nin each other\u2019s internal affairs. All sovereign States,\nwhether they are big or small, rich or poor, strong or weak,\nare equal members of the international community. The\ninternal affairs of a country should be managed by its own\npeople. Major world affairs should be addressed by\ncountries through consultations on the basis of equality and\nmutual respect. In international relations, to bully the small,\noppress the poor, override the weak, impose one\u2019s own\nsocial system, ideology and values on others or interfere in\nother countries\u2019 internal affairs all run counter to the spirit\nof the United Nations Charter. Some people are publicly\nclamouring for \u201ccontainment\u201d of other countries, which\nshows that the cold war mentality still refuses to quit the\nstage of history. But it will ultimately be discarded by\nhistory. The post-war period of half a century proves that\nin handling State-to-State relations, \u201chot war\u201d, \u201ccold war\u201d\nor \u201cbloc politics\u201d do not work. Strict observance of the\nprinciples of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial\nintegrity, mutual non-aggression, non-interference in each\nother\u2019s internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit and\npeaceful coexistence are the only way for States to live in\namity with each other and achieve common development.\nSince the last session of the General Assembly, thanks\nto the joint efforts of various quarters, the tendency towards\nthe peaceful settlement of disputes through negotiations has\ngrown and international economic cooperation has gained\nmomentum. However, there still remain many destabilizing\nand uncertain factors in the international situation.\nHegemonism and power politics continue to hold out. Peace\nand development, the two major tasks of the world today,\nstill face grave challenges.\nArmed conflicts and catastrophic wars in some parts\nof the world remain unabated, which has not only inflicted\nheavy losses of life and property on the countries and\npeoples concerned, but also casts a shadow over regional\npeace and stability and that of the whole world. All this\ncannot but cause concern and distress among the world\u2019s\npeople. As the background and causes behind these\nconflicts are complicated, to seek a just, fair and\nappropriate solution to them would call for tremendous\nand concerted efforts by all the parties concerned, the\nUnited Nations and the international community as a\nwhole. We maintain that the parties concerned should, in\nthe fundamental and long-term interests of the people,\nseek just and fair solutions through negotiations, taking\ninto full account both history and reality as well as the\nreasonable interests and positions of all sides. Where\nconsensus cannot be reached immediately, the parties\nconcerned should exercise restraint and patience so as to\nprevent contradictions from intensifying and at the same\ntime try to create conditions and an atmosphere for an\neventual peaceful settlement.\nUnited Nations peace-keeping operations in recent\nyears have played a useful role in settling international\ndisputes peacefully. They have both accumulated\nsuccessful experience and learned lessons from setbacks.\nWe believe that, to ensure a healthy development of\nUnited Nations peace-keeping operations and activities in\nother related fields such as preventive diplomacy, the\nfollowing guidelines should be established and followed:\nObservation of the purposes and principles of the\nUnited Nations Charter, in particular the principle of\nrespect for State sovereignty and non-interference in the\ninternal affairs of other countries;\nSettlement of disputes through peaceful means such\nas good offices, mediation and negotiations instead of\nresort to frequent mandatory actions. Even humanitarian\noperations should not resort to military means;\nOpposition to double standards and the imposition of\nthe policies and views of one or a few countries on the\nSecurity Council. Some countries should not be allowed\nto carry out military intervention in the name of the\nUnited Nations;\nFor peace-keeping operations, adherence to the\nprinciples that have proved effective, such as obtaining\nprior consent from the parties concerned, observing strict\nneutrality and the non-use of force except for self-\ndefence;\nAdoption of a realistic approach and confining the\noperation within one\u2019s capability. Peace-keeping\noperations should be launched only when conditions are\nripe and should refrain, in whatever circumstances, from\n10\n\n\nbecoming a party to a conflict in deviation from the\nfundamental orientation of such operations.\nIt has been demonstrated time and again that United\nNations peace-keeping operations, if divorced from these\nguidelines, would, contrary to our wishes, fail to achieve\ntheir desired objectives and might even go astray.\nLast May, the Review and Extension Conference of\nthe States Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\nNuclear Weapons (NPT) adopted the decision to renew the\nNPT indefinitely. This serves the interests of all signatories,\nhelps to strengthen the international non-proliferation\nregime and is conducive to the maintenance of world peace\nand security. China believes that nuclear non-proliferation\nis only an interim step towards the ultimate goal of the\ncomplete prohibition and total destruction of nuclear\nweapons. The indefinite extension of the NPT must not be\nconstrued as an indefinite license for the nuclear-weapon\nStates to perpetuate their prerogatives.\nOne year ago, also from this rostrum, on behalf of the\nChinese Government I called for the conclusion of a\nconvention on the complete prohibition of nuclear weapons\nand put forward a series of complete and interrelated\nproposals on nuclear disarmament. We are pleased to note\nthat the negotiations on a comprehensive test-ban treaty\nhave produced some gratifying progress. China supports the\nconclusion of such a treaty no later than 1996 and will\ncontinue to work with other countries to this end. Once the\ntreaty enters into force, China will stop its nuclear testing.\nChina\u2019s possession of a limited nuclear capability is\nentirely for self-defence and for deterring the nuclear threat\nagainst it. The Chinese Government has from the very\nbeginning unilaterally undertaken not to be the first to use\nnuclear weapons at any time and under any circumstances\nand not to use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against\nnon-nuclear-weapon States. China\u2019s nuclear weapons\ntherefore do not constitute a threat to any country. We\nstrongly urge other nuclear-weapon States to respond\npositively to China\u2019s initiative by immediately starting\nnegotiations aimed at concluding a treaty on mutual non-\nfirst-use of nuclear weapons and an agreement on the non-\nuse or non-threat of use of nuclear weapons against non-\nnuclear-weapon States and nuclear-free zones.\nIt has become a trend in today\u2019s world that when\ncountries formulate their domestic and foreign policies they\naccord top priority to the economy and pay close attention\nto national economic development. The worldwide tendency\ntowards economic integration, regionalization and the\nformation of economic groupings has accelerated, and\ncompetition among States in the economic, trade,\nscientific and technological fields has further intensified.\nUnder such circumstances, the developing countries are\nfaced with a formidable challenge as they strive for\neconomic growth and higher living standards for their\npeople.\nFurthermore, over 1 billion people on this planet\nremain in abject poverty; this constitutes one of the world\ncommunity\u2019s most acute problems. Given much-needed\nsupport to the developing countries as they reactivate their\neconomies and creating a favourable external environment\nfor them are not only important conditions for the shared\neconomic growth and common prosperity of all countries,\nbut also a crucial guarantee for lasting peace and stability\nthroughout the world. Given the present situation, the\nUnited Nations should ask itself to pay at least as much\nattention to development as to peace, effectively perform\nits duties under the Charter and play a more dynamic role\nin galvanizing economic growth and development in the\ndeveloping countries. The reform of the United Nations\nmust result in the strengthening, not the weakening, of its\nrole in the area of development.\nTrue, fairly rapid economic growth in the developing\ncountries must depend primarily on their own efforts.\nHowever, it is also important for the international\ncommunity, and the developed countries in particular, to\ntake practical and effective measures to open markets,\nprovide development funds, transfer technology, increase\ndevelopment aid and reduce the debt burden in favour of\nthe developing countries. International economic\ncooperation should be guided by the principle of mutual\nopening-up, equality and mutual benefit. Such practices as\nimplementing protectionist policies of one form or another\nand attaching political strings to economic assistance to\ndeveloping countries are obviously misguided.\nProfound changes have taken place in China amid\nthe surging tide of change and development across the\nworld. The 17 years that have elapsed since the beginning\nof reform and opening-up in China have been\nunprecedented in terms of the economic growth rate and\nthe improvement of the people\u2019s living standards. At\npresent, China enjoys political stability, economic\nprosperity, ethnic harmony and vigorous advances in\ndemocracy, legality and community undertakings. China\u2019s\nexchanges and cooperation with the rest of the world have\nreached a level unprecedented in both scope and depth.\nAlthough there may still be many difficulties and\nchallenges along the road ahead, we are confident that,\n11\n\n\nthrough several generations of hard work, our people will\nlift China out of economic and cultural backwardness and\nturn it into a highly prosperous and democratic modern\ncountry.\nThe Chinese people are peace-loving people. China\u2019s\nhistory for over a century following the Opium War was\none of tears, blood and humiliation in which the Chinese\nnation was subjected to repeated aggression, suppression\nand plunder at the hands of the big Powers. Do unto others\nas you would have others do unto you. The Chinese people\ntreasure their hard-won independence and freedom and will\nnever commit aggression or intervene against others. China\nis opposed to hegemonism and power politics of any kind\nand will never seek hegemony for itself. With a population\nof 1.2 billion, China will remain a low-income developing\ncountry for a very long time and the steady improvement of\nour people\u2019s living standards will remain our objective,\ntowards the attainment of which no effort will be spared.\nEven when China grows stronger, it will continue firmly to\npursue its independent foreign policy of peace and will live\nin amity with other nations. A stable and prosperous China\nis a positive factor for peace and development in Asia and\nthe world at large. This is a conclusion that people of\nvision around the world have come to share.\nThe Chinese people have waged heroic and unyielding\nstruggles to resist external aggression and oppression and to\ndefend the sovereignty, independence and unity of the\ncountry. There is but one China in the world. The\nGovernment of the People\u2019s Republic of China is the sole\nlegal Government of China. It is the sole representative of\nChina at the United Nations, and Taiwan is an inalienable\npart of China. The peaceful reunification of the two sides\nof the Taiwan Straits represents the unshakable will and\ndetermination of the entire Chinese people, including our\ncompatriots in Taiwan. Proceeding from this reality, the\nChinese Government has put forward the correct proposal\non peaceful reunification within the framework of the\nconcept of \u201cone country, two systems\u201d and a series of\nrealistic and practicable policies and measures. The past\nfew years have seen a steady expansion and deepening of\nexchanges and contacts between the two sides in various\nfields. Any attempt to obstruct peaceful reunification and to\nsplit Taiwan from China is doomed to failure. Should\nanyone try to do so, he would be lifting a stone only to\ndrop it on his own toes.\nHistory moves on. Mankind is progressing. In four\nyears we will usher in a new millennium. The future is full\nof promise. Let us join hands and make concerted efforts to\nbring about a better world in which there are peace and\ncooperation, justice and equality, mutual respect and\ncommon development, a world of universal prosperity and\ncontinuous progress.\n"

        "file_text": "First of all I should like to extend my warmest\ncongratulations to you, Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral, a\nrenowned and distinguished academician and\ninternationalist, on your well-deserved election as\nPresident of this historic session of the General Assembly\nmarked by the commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary\nof the United Nations. I should also like to pay a tribute\nto Mr. Amara Essy in recognition of the admirable work\nhe performed as President of the forty-ninth session of the\nAssembly.\nAt the end of the twentieth century and the dawn of\na new millennium, in a world characterized by a\nglobalization of the economy and the dynamics of\ninternational relations, our reality is conditioned by factors\nsuch as the substantial progress of science, the\ntranscendence of the technological revolution, the decisive\ninfluence of communications and information, the\nexpansion of trade and the consequences of cultural and\nreligious interaction. However, an acute imbalance of\nsocial and economic aspects coexists with these factors,\nmainly in the developing world, whose inhabitants\naccount for three quarters of mankind.\nWe are faced with problems that were not foreseen\nat the beginning of this century, including the\ninternationalization of environmental problems,\nfragmentation and the revival of violent nationalisms,\npolitical and social instability, and the decrease in the\ntransfer of international resources for development.\nIn many third world countries social problems are\nincreasingly becoming more acute. Extreme poverty,\naccompanied by hunger, malnutrition, abandonment,\nunemployment, disease and ignorance, has been combined\nin many regions with guerrilla movements and armed\ninsurrection. Several countries face the consequences of\nthe foreign debt crisis, associated with the lack of\ninternational political solidarity to relieve it. In many\nregions corruption has become an endemic disease. The\nproduction, consumption of and trafficking in narcotic\ndrugs devastate our traditional social structures. Violence,\n5\n\n\nrural and urban, is on the increase, and the brutal means\nfrequently used to suppress it actually promote its growth.\nThus, in my capacity as Secretary pro tempore of the Rio\nGroup, and as Ecuador\u2019s representative in the Group, I\nshould like, on its behalf, to call for the convening of a\nsecond international conference on narcotic drugs to\nexamine appropriate mechanisms to foster the world fight\nagainst drug trafficking and its dire consequences.\nKeeping this perspective in mind, Ecuador will\ncontinue to favour the adoption of urgent measures within\nthe international community to fight vigorously against all\nthese social problems, which affect so many countries. The\nGeneral Assembly proclaimed 1996 as the International\nYear for the Eradication of Poverty. My country hopes that,\nwith this proclamation, international public opinion will\nbecome more conscious of the complexity of this grave\nproblem and will try to find measures for its solution.\nSince the end of the cold war, international tensions\nhave eased, and the intensification of trust between States\nhas fostered the adoption of measures concerning nuclear\ndisarmament. However, the danger implied by the\nproliferation and use of nuclear weapons prevails. For this\nreason, Ecuador strongly condemned the nuclear tests by\nChina and France. We hope that the general appeal to cease\nall such tests will receive a positive response from these\ntwo countries.\nEcuador favoured the consensus for an indefinite\nextension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\nWeapons, and, at the same time, considered that this\nhistoric decision formed part of an integral unity with the\nprinciples and objectives adopted on that occasion for the\nnon-proliferation of nuclear weapons and also with\ndisarmament. In this regard, Ecuador recalls that the\nnegotiations concerning a comprehensive nuclear-test-ban\ntreaty should conclude in 1996, at the latest, and that\nnegotiations to ban fissionable materials for nuclear\nweapons should be scheduled shortly, with a view to\nachieving general and complete disarmament, pursuant the\nprovisions of article VI of the Non-Proliferation Treaty.\nIn this context, the full enforcement of the Treaty of\nTlatelolco has made Latin America a nuclear-weapon-free\nzone. Our region offers this example as an incentive for the\nestablishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones, especially in\nareas of greater tension.\nMy country applauds the agreements reached by Israel\nand the national Palestinian Authority, which will\nundoubtedly contribute to the consolidation of peace in one\nof the regions most stricken by insecurity, violence and\narmed confrontations \u2014 the Middle East. We consider\nthat these efforts and the measures to be taken in\naccordance with agreements already concluded will\ncontribute to the total pacification of this region.\nConsequently, Ecuador expresses to the two parties its\nencouragement and its confidence that, with international\nsupport, they will continue along the path of peace that\nthey have, happily, taken.\nOn the other hand, we must express our deep\nconcern about the ongoing armed actions in the former\nYugoslavia, in spite of the Security Council\u2019s frequent\nappeals and resolutions. We believe that the Powers with\nhigher international responsibilities should resolutely take\nthe necessary steps to end this regrettable situation. At the\nsame time, Ecuador wishes to join in appeals concerning\nthe dangerous situation in Burundi, which could result in\nbloody events comparable to those in Rwanda.\nThe main purpose of the United Nations, its very\nreason for being, is the maintenance of international peace\nand security. It has been pointed out that since 1989 more\nthan a hundred armed conflicts have erupted around the\nworld \u2014 most of them due to domestic problems. Such\nsituations have endangered the maintenance of\ninternational world peace and security \u2014 even world\npeace in some cases \u2014 showing the increasingly clear\ninterrelationship between domestic and international\naffairs. That is why Ecuador believes that peace does not\nsimply mean the absence of armed conflicts; it also\ncomprises the political, economic and social conditions in\nwhich our peoples evolve. It should therefore be\nrecognized that the non-military issues of human security\nand sustainable development have been added to the\ntraditional security concepts.\nEcuador believes, therefore, that the United Nations,\nwith its 50 years\u2019 experience of successes and failures,\nmust be prepared to face the new challenges appearing\nthroughout the world. Furthermore, it should be pointed\nout that the international community today has more trust\nin the world Organization and is more often seeking more\ndirect, more effective, intervention to reduce or resolve\npolitical, economic or social conflicts. This situation\ndemands that the United Nations should be strengthened\nand restructured.\nMy country believes that the Security Council should\nbe restructured to reflect adequately not only the new\ninternational world order but also the current membership\nof the United Nations. It should also become more\n6\n\n\ncapable \u2014 through the adoption of early-warning\nmeasures \u2014 of taking prompt and effective action in the\nfields of conflict-prevention and the continued deployment\nof peace-keeping operations to re-establish and consolidate\npeace. We do not believe that this urgent need to\nrestructure the Council will be met by the mere inclusion of\ntwo major industrial Powers as new permanent members.\nWhen the question of increased membership is being\ndiscussed, we maintain that if the current imbalance is to be\nprevented from continuing to deteriorate, all geographical\nregions should be appropriately represented.\nWe disagree with the extension of the veto privilege\nto additional members. Since this is a mechanism created\nto respond to world political realities that no longer exist,\nthe Powers possessing this privilege should willingly agree\nto restrict its practice exclusively to issues related to\nChapter VII of the Charter. The whole world would\nwelcome such a decision by the five permanent members\nas an effective step towards a more democratic United\nNations.\nThe General Assembly, too, should be thoroughly\nrevitalized to enable it to carry out its duties under Article\n11 of the Charter in an effective and responsible manner,\nand so that its resolutions \u2014 in particular, those concerning\nissues related to the maintenance of international peace and\nsecurity \u2014 may, duly observed and enforced, exercise the\ninfluence we would hope to see of resolutions of the\nhighest political organ of the United Nations. The\nEconomic and Social Council should also respond more\nadequately to the broad requirements set forth in the\nCharter. The Trusteeship Council has lost its significance,\nand should be entirely restructured. Similarly, the broad\nfunctions assigned to the Secretary-General in Article 99 of\nthe Charter should be exercised to the fullest.\nEcuador believes it is necessary to review the structure\nand functions of the Bretton Woods institutions and their\nrelations with the United Nations. In order to obtain optimal\nresults and fully utilize existing resources, it is essential to\ncoordinate international efforts with regard to the\ninternational monetary system and economic and social\nprogress.\nThe severe financial crisis facing the United Nations\ncould be alleviated were the Member States that are most\nin arrears, for various reasons, to make a sincere effort to\nmeet their obligations. It is unacceptable to transfer the\nburden of resolving this crisis to the developing countries,\nwhose weak economies cannot satisfy such demands.\nHaving made respect for all human rights the motto\nof its Government, Ecuador attaches particular importance\nto United Nations actions in favour of the protection and\npromotion of such rights. It views with great concern the\nmassive violations of human rights and the recrudescence\nof what were thought to be extinct practices, such as\n\u201cethnic cleansing\u201d, which in some cases \u2014 as in the\nformer Yugoslavia \u2014 have reached genocidal proportions,\nall of which constitute an unequivocal threat to\ninternational peace. Ecuador expresses its revulsion at,\nand condemns, attacks against civilians, especially the\nelderly, women and children, which are creating a\ngrowing number of refugees. Such violations are a\nchallenge not only to the United Nations and the many\nvalid international instruments, but to the moral\nconscience of all mankind.\nEcuador promotes and supports all measures\ndesigned to put a stop to this deplorable situation, to\npunish the guilty and to re-establish a climate of trust,\nharmony and peace. It believes that the international\ncommunity has a clear and unavoidable responsibility in\nthis regard. We hope that the General Assembly, and\nparticularly the Security Council, will take the necessary\nsteps to deal effectively with the dangerous breaches of\ninternational peace and security such violations represent.\nWe express our confidence in and support for the United\nNations High Commissioner for Human Rights, and hopes\nthat the Assembly will provide the administrative and\nfinancial resources necessary for him to carry out his\nimportant tasks to the full.\nEcuador believes that democratic systems are the\nproper response to peoples\u2019 yearning for freedom and\nfraternal coexistence and for cultural expression.\nTo attain the objectives of the International Decade\nof the World\u2019s Indigenous People, Ecuador, a multi-ethnic\ncountry, has submitted various concrete programmes and\ninitiatives, in consultation with national indigenous\norganizations, designed to improve the economic, social\nand cultural status of those groups while fully respecting\ntheir distinctive characteristics. It hopes to be able to rely\non international cooperation in bringing these initiatives\nand programmes to fruition.\nIn previous decades the United Nations led the\nstruggle for the self-determination of peoples, which\nresulted in an end to the shameful colonial system. From\nthe earliest years of its existence the Organization\ncondemned the apartheid system, and it continued to do\nso until apartheid was abolished. The time has now come\n7\n\n\nfor the United Nations to fight for the realization of the\nright to development, based on solid economic and social\nfoundations, implying a promise of better living conditions\nfor millions of human beings. Stable and lasting peace can\nbe achieved only through a sustainable and harmonious\ndevelopment.\nThat development must go hand in hand with urgent\nsolutions to the problem of preserving the great heritage of\nmankind \u2014 the environment. Agenda 21, resulting from the\n\u201cEarth Summit\u201d, must be complied with. To play its part,\nEcuador will continue to seek international cooperation to\npreserve its immense ecological wealth, not only of its\ncontinental territory, but also \u2014 and particularly \u2014 in the\nAmazonian region and the Galapagos Islands.\nIn keeping with its policy of opening its economy,\nEcuador has become the first new member of the World\nTrade Organization (WTO), which enables it, inter alia, to\nbenefit from the guaranteed application of the principle of\nnon-discrimination in its trade relations with all other\nmembers, to negotiate better terms for trade in Ecuadorian\ngoods and services, to obtain technical support and\nassistance and to enjoy the favourable terms of trade\naccorded developing countries.\nMy country considers that a stable relationship should\nbe established between the World Trade Organization and\nthe United Nations, and we therefore actively support the\ndrafting of an agreement between these two Organizations\nin keeping with the Marrakech Accord and the San\nFrancisco Charter. That could be the basis for the\nestablishment of a new, more just and efficient international\norder, in which respect for the human person is guaranteed,\npeople\u2019s welfare is fostered, economic development is\nshared and the balance and fairness of international trade\nare guaranteed, so as to create a society based on\ninternational cooperation, solidarity and interdependence.\nThe United Nations is called upon to perform an\nimportant task in realizing this new order. To that end, not\nonly must the Organization as a whole be restructured, but\nall Member States, great and small, must offer their total\npolitical support to the United Nations.\nEcuador has always upheld its historical, Amazonian\nand peaceful tradition and its respect for the rule of law. It\nhas adhered to the purposes and principles of the Charter,\nincluding non-recourse to the threat or use of force against\nthe territorial integrity of any other State and the obligation\nto resolve international disputes exclusively through\npeaceful means.\nProblems created by breaches of the peace occur in\nevery part of the globe. Thus, early this year Ecuador was\ninvoluntarily involved in an unsought armed conflict of\nunpredictable consequences with its southern neighbour,\nPeru. The Secretary- General of the United Nations and\nthe Organization\u2019s Member States were informed of this\nunfortunate conflict, which arose out of the territorial\nproblem that has for decades soured relations between our\ntwo countries. A peaceful, just and definitive solution of\nthis controversy is a necessity not only for our two\nnations, but also for peaceful coexistence in Latin\nAmerica. My Government has always sought to avoid\nsuch conflict through diplomatic channels. The actions\ntaken by the guarantor countries under the Rio Protocol\nof 1942 were extremely important in arriving at a\ncease-fire during the military confrontation and in leading\nto the pacification process agreed to in the Itamaraty\nPeace Declaration of 17 February 1995 and ratified in the\nMontevideo Declaration of 28 February. This process has\ngradually led to the restoration of peace. We trust that,\nwith the assistance of Argentina, Brazil, Chile and the\nUnited States, and their military observers still deployed\nin the conflict area, the aspirations of the Ecuadorian and\nPeruvian peoples will be fulfilled and that a definitive\nsolution to the problem on the terms that I have\nmentioned will be achieved.\nThe action taken by the guarantor countries\nregarding the conflict between Ecuador and Peru has\nproved particularly effective, and we are certain it will\nlead to a total normalization of relations between Ecuador\nand Peru. At the recent meeting of the Heads of State and\nGovernment of the countries of the Rio Group, held last\n4 and 5 September, there were important signs of\nrelaxation of tension in the statements made by the Heads\nof State of both countries as well as in the encouraging\npositions of the other countries, which we believe,\nprovide not only a clear orientation towards peace but\nalso support for complete peaceful coexistence, while at\nthe same time creating a space for dialogue, constructive\nnegotiations and a resumption of the integrationist\nprocesses that serve to consolidate peace. All this,\nmoreover, will clear a sure path towards cooperation, in\nvarious spheres of our relations with our neighbours and\nwith other countries, with mutual respect and\nunderstanding. I believe we have begun to move towards\na better understanding, and if we prepare a framework of\ngood will we will be able not only to bring our divergent\npositions closer together but also to reach agreements for\nlasting solutions.\n8\n\n\nThe problems threatening international peace \u2014 which\narouse natural fears, create anxiety, work against the\npeople\u2019s well-being, cause enormous losses of human life\nand bring about an immense deterioration of social and\neconomic development \u2014 are no doubt the gravest\nproblems, and they call for action for peace by all means\npossible. They are deep-rooted problems that require a\npositive response from international organizations, both\nglobal and regional, when their assistance is needed to\nsolve such problems.\n"

        "file_text": "It will doubtless\nbe understood if, before beginning my statement, I express,\nas Minister of Foreign Affairs of Portugal, the particular\nsatisfaction which I feel in seeing an illustrious fellow\ncountryman, Professor Diogo Freitas do Amaral, an eminent\npublic figure and a professor at my alma mater, the\nUniversity of Lisbon, presiding over the work of the fiftieth\nsession of the General Assembly. Allow me to convey my\nwarmest and fondest congratulations to you, Mr. President,\nand, at the same time, my gratitude to all Member States\nfor the vote of confidence in Portugal that this represents.\nI would also like to pay tribute to my colleague from\nC\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Mr. Amara Essy, for the dedicated and\ncompetent manner in which he steered the work of the\nforty-ninth session of the General Assembly.\nTo you, Mr. Secretary-General, I reaffirm my\nadmiration for the way in which you have carried out your\nfunctions during a period in which the United Nations is\nincreasingly called upon to intervene ever more actively in\nmany fields of international life.\nIn his statement, my Spanish colleague has already set\nout, in the name of the 15 States of the European Union,\ncertain positions which are also shared by Portugal.\nNevertheless, I would like to refer to some matters which\nare of particular importance to my country.\nPeace continues to be the primary objective of, and\nthe biggest challenge faced by, the United Nations.\nThe proliferation of peace-keeping operations\nlaunched by the Security Council in recent years and the\nhigh levels of human and financial resources committed\nto them are indicative of the commitment and collective\nefforts of the United Nations system and its Member\nStates.\nThe results achieved in some countries \u2014 and I am\npleased to refer here to the case of the United Nations\nOperation in Mozambique (ONUMOZ) and the recent\ndevelopments in the peace process in Angola \u2014 are\nreason enough to indicate that we should not reduce our\nlevel of commitment nor the scope of our activities. We\nshould, however, also be flexible and creative, here as\nelsewhere, in order to avoid the rigidity of models and\nadapt peace-keeping operations to the specific conditions\nof each case.\nWhile it is true that the United Nations must not\nabdicate its mission of helping to restore peace, we\nbelieve that we should focus our efforts, above all, on the\nprevention of conflicts.\nThe Agenda for Peace requires effective coordination\nof the various Departments and agencies of the United\nNations system in order to provide an integrated view of\nthe many factors which contribute to the development of\ncrises. In the search for peace, the question of the\ncomplementarity between the United Nations and\nintergovernmental organizations of a regional nature is\nalso particularly relevant.\nWith this in mind, Portugal has actively supported,\nsince the beginning, the creation and implementation of\nthe mechanism for conflict prevention, management and\nresolution established by the Organization of African\nUnity (OAU) at the Cairo Summit in 1993. We have also\nparticipated in the search for the means which will permit\nthe strengthening and efficacy of those instruments.\nAlong the same lines, while holding the presidency\nof the Western European Union (WEU) during the first\nhalf of this year, Portugal put the issue of conflict\nprevention on the agenda of that organization and focused\nthe need for WEU to develop support mechanisms in this\nregard.\n23\n\n\nAlso, in the Organization for Security and Cooperation\nin Europe (OSCE), where preventive diplomacy is the\nfoundation of its activities, Portugal has contributed so that\nthe Organization can continue to have a decisive role to\nplay in the maintenance of stability in a region which runs\nfrom Vancouver to Vladivostok. Alongside the security\nmodel for the twenty-first century, this will surely be one\nof the subjects that will receive in-depth treatment at the\nnext OSCE Summit, which will take place in Lisbon at the\nend of next year.\nWith regard to disarmament, as another of the\ncomponents of the efforts in favour of peace, Portugal\nwelcomes the historic decision taken by consensus on\n11 May this year in this very Hall to indefinitely extend the\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.\nAlso encouraging is the progress obtained at the\nDisarmament Conference, especially with regard to the\nincreased expectations of rapidly completing a\ncomprehensive test ban Treaty.\nThe results of the high-level meeting, held last July,\nthat resulted in donations towards a voluntary United\nNations fund for de-mining should also be stressed here. In\nthat context, Portugal announced that it would be making a\nbilateral contribution.\nEqually, I welcome the negotiations currently under\nway in Vienna for the revision of the United Nations\nConvention on Conventional Weapons.\nThe enlargement of the Disarmament Conference is\nurgently required, keeping in mind the need for a\nstrengthening of the negotiation of international legal\ninstruments, as well as their observance by an increasing\nnumber of States.\nThere can be no peace in the world while large\nsections of the world\u2019s population continue to live beneath\nlevels considered fundamental for human dignity. Integrated\nand sustainable development, focused on people, is\ntherefore the other great challenge which cannot be\nseparated from the search for peace. The Agenda for\nDevelopment and the Agenda for Peace constitute a single\nunit \u2014 one makes no sense, nor can it be achieved, without\nthe other.\nIn this context, it is necessary to recognize the need to\nrevise the entire system of international development aid,\nand to reflect on the role that, in this area, should fall to the\nUnited Nations. Ours should be a global and coherent\nvision.\nThe integrated and sustainable development which\nwe desire must be pursued on all fronts: at the economic\nlevel, to be sure, but also in the consolidation and\ndeepening of democratic institutions; in the promotion of\nhuman rights across the board; in the increasing\nparticipation of women in the most diverse sectors of\nsocial and political life; in the defence of the rights of\nchildren, ethnic minorities and all underprivileged\nmembers of society; in humanitarian assistance; and in the\nprotection of the environment.\nTo achieve all these goals, we must implement the\ndecisions taken at major United Nations conferences, for\nit is at these conferences \u2014 those of Rio de Janeiro,\nVienna, Cairo, Copenhagen and Beijing, as well as the\nforthcoming conference in Istanbul next year \u2014 that the\n\u201cAgenda for Development\u201d gradually takes shape.\nNon-governmental organizations, as well as other\ngroups through which the vitality of civil society is\ndemonstrated, are privileged agents in aid and\ndevelopment, and are our partners in the \u201cAgenda for\nDevelopment\u201d. This is due to their particular capacity of\npenetration in the field, of making contact with the people\nand of understanding their real needs.\nOf all areas of development, there are two in\nparticular to which I would like now to turn: the\nprotection and promotion of human rights, and the\nimportance of the environment.\nThe protection and promotion of human rights is a\nconstant priority of Portuguese foreign policy. We\ncontinue to believe in the importance of critical dialogue\nin order to reach the fundamental objective of respect for\nthose rights, and we are following the activities of the\nHigh Commissioner and the Centre for Human Rights.\nThe fact that protection of the environment is\ninextricably linked to the notion of balanced development\nhas led it to gain an increasing relevancy in our foreign\npolicy concerns. In this context, I wish to refer in\nparticular to the oceans, especially with regard to the\ndevelopment of a balanced management of fish stocks and\nmarine resources.\nAs Portugal\u2019s territory includes two archipelagos \u2014\nthe Azores and Madeira \u2014 I would like to stress our\n24\n\n\nparticular sensitivity to the problems faced by small island\nStates in development and environmental issues.\nFurthermore, I express my hope that the International\nYear of the Oceans, a Portuguese initiative adopted by the\nGeneral Assembly at its forty-ninth session, will provide an\nurgently needed opportunity for a full debate on these\nquestions. We will strive in that direction and hope that the\nholding in the same year in Lisbon of Expo 98 \u2014 an\nexposition on that subject \u2014 will result in a fruitful\ncoordination of these efforts.\nThe legislative activity of the United Nations in\nmaintaining the ecological balance and the management of\ninternational waterways is of special importance. Portugal\nintends to follow with particular interest the work on this\nissue that is being undertaken by the International Law\nCommission. We hope that in the near future a convention\non this matter will be adopted which would include\ninternational norms of responsibility \u2014 applicable under\ndomestic or international jurisdiction.\nIn the context of an \u201cagenda for development\u201d, I\nwould like once again, to underline my personal conviction\nand the position of Portugal that Africa must quite\nobviously be one of the priorities of the international\ncommunity. We were therefore pleased to welcome the\nannouncement made by the Secretary-General in Lisbon\nconcerning the launching of the \u201cUnited Nations New\nAgenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s\u201d.\nThe forthcoming conference for the Great Lakes\nregion, convened under the sponsorship of the United\nNations and the Organization of African Unity (OAU) to\naddress the tragic situation of a number of countries of that\nregion, will certainly constitute a test of the true\ncommitment of the international community to the African\ncontinent: a test of the capacity to identify the objectives of\npeace and development; a test of the much-needed\ncomplementarity between the United Nations and regional\norganizations.\nDespite the persistence of disturbing cases of political\nand social instability in a number of countries of the\ncontinent, as well as, of course, the open conflicts and\nserious violations of human rights which still continue, it is\nonly fair to recognize that in many African States\nsignificant steps have been taken towards the peaceful\nsettlement of conflicts and the consolidation of the\nprocesses of political and social democratization.\nI am pleased to be able to say that the majority of\nthese processes were carried out under the aegis of the\nUnited Nations, and Portugal is proud to have actively\nparticipated in a number of them: in the international\nstructures of support to the process of democratic\ntransition in South Africa; in the negotiations which led\nto the Peace Accord in Mozambique, having been\nrepresented in all the commissions created by that Accord\nand in the United Nations Operation in Mozambique\n(ONUMOZ); and as part of the troika of observers of the\npeace process in Angola.\nWith this process in mind, I hope that, following the\nmeetings held at Lusaka, Franceville, and now Brussels,\nbetween the President of the Republic of Angola and the\nleader of UNITA, steps will continue to be taken towards\na definitive reconciliation of the Angolan family while\nstrictly complying with the Lusaka Protocol, which\nrestores the spirit of the Bicesse Agreement signed in\nPortugal in 1991.\nIt is equally important, keeping in mind Security\nCouncil resolution 1008 (1995), Lusaka Protocol be\nadequately encouraged by the international community. I\ncannot fail, therefore, to express my concern over the\ndelay in the deployment to Angola of all the forces and\ncontingents of the United Nations Angola Verification\nMission (UNAVEM III), where Portugal is already\npresent with a communications and logistics unit, as well\nas a number of staff officers in the command structure\nand civilian, military and police observers.\nThe tragic human suffering and the terrible material\ndestruction brought about by more than 20 years of\nconflict also require that the international community \u2014\nfollowing the round table on Angola being held in\nBrussels under the auspices of the United Nations\nDevelopment Programme \u2014 continues to respond\ngenerously to the humanitarian aid needs and the\nchallenge of reconstructing the country, particularly in the\nareas of demining and the social reintegration of the\ndisplaced and the demobilized.\nThe New Agenda for Africa is pressing. It should\nlead to the promotion of vast integrated programmes of\ndevelopment aid which would coordinate, in the most\nefficient manner possible, the resources of the\ninternational community. It should seek to support and\nencourage African countries to choose the path of peace,\npolitical democracy, stability and social justice, respect\nfor human rights and economic development.\n25\n\n\nThe strengthening of the ties which link Portugal to\nthe five Portuguese speaking countries is and shall remain\na constant goal of my country\u2019s foreign policy.\nWhile talking of the ties that unite the countries that\nspeak Portuguese, I wish to underline the importance of the\nmeeting which, last July in Lisbon, brought together the\nMinisters of Foreign Affairs of Angola, Brazil, Cape Verde,\nGuinea-Bissau, Mozambique, Portugal, and Sao Tome and\nPrincipe.\nThat meeting permitted the reaffirmation of purpose\nwhich motivates those respective Governments with regard\nto the institutionalization of the community of Portuguese\nspeaking countries. We hope that this next year will witness\nthe formalization of this community, which, to all intents\nand purposes, already exists in the hearts and souls of its\npeoples and has become more and more concrete in many\nways.\nAt a time such as this, when we are celebrating the\nfiftieth anniversary of the United Nations and assessing its\nsuccesses and its failures, we cannot but, unfortunately,\ninclude the question of East Timor among the latter.\nThe 20 years which have passed since the illegal\noccupation of East Timor and the denial of the exercise of\nthe right to self-determination of its people, far from\nallowing the question to be forgotten and the status quo to\nbe consolidated have, on the contrary, worsened the\ntensions and focused ever more strongly the attention of\nworld public opinion.\nThe lesson of these last 20 years has been that force\nsolves nothing in East Timor nor will it ever resolve\nanything. Without a solution which, in conformity with the\nCharter and international law, takes into account the\nlegitimate rights of its people, including that of freely\nexpressing themselves on their political future, there will be\nno peace or respect for human rights in East Timor.\nI wish to reiterate here the commitment of Portugal\ntowards finding, through peaceful and negotiated means,\nsuch a solution. With that aim in mind, we continue to\ncooperate with the Secretary-General in the process of\ndialogue which, under his auspices, we have maintained\nwith Indonesia.\nDespite the fundamental difference which continues to\nseparate us on the core of the problem, we believe that the\nprocess of dialogue, with all its difficulties, registered very\nsignificant progress: representative Timorese personalities\nfrom various political sectors have now become\nassociated with this process.\nWe have always held that the rights and primary\ninterests at stake in this question are those of the\nTimorese people, and that their voice and their wishes\nwill have to be heard in order for a solution to be found.\nI sincerely hope that this first step marks the beginning of\na new, more positive and constructive phase of the\nprocess of dialogue concerning East Timor, one which\nwill lead us more quickly to the end of this tragic\nsituation.\nI turn now to Europe. The situation in the former\nYugoslavia continues to be a principal motive of concern.\nWe are naturally encouraged by the results obtained at the\nMinisterial meeting held in Geneva on 8 September,\ncongratulate the members of the Contact Group for\nobtaining those results and hope that the meeting being\nheld here today in New York will drive the process\nforward. At any rate, the consolidation of the results still\ndepends on keeping the international community united,\non the cohesion of the Contact Group, and on close\ncoordination of the initiatives and actions taken by\ninternational organizations. Portugal will continue to\nparticipate actively in these efforts and we shall maintain\nour presence on the ground while it remains useful and\nnecessary.\nIn its relationship with Latin America, Portugal has,\nas is well known, very strong human, historical and\ncultural ties: with Brazil, for reasons known to all, but\nalso with the other countries of Latin America, with\nwhich we are seeking an ever-closer relationship. Ties\nwith Latin America will always occupy an important\nplace in Portuguese foreign policy. This is made clear by\nour active participation in the Ibero-American Summits of\nHeads of State and Government.\nWe welcome the fact that Latin America is today\nclearly giving new value to its role in the international\nsystem. Portugal resolutely supports the projects for\nregional Latin American integration and, as a member of\nthe European Union, favours the establishment of wide\nagreements with institutions of regional integration \u2014\nnamely, the Southern Cone Common Market\n(MERCOSUL) and other processes of integration under\nway on the American continent. I am referring also to the\nconsolidation of the North American Free Trade\nAgreement (NAFTA) and the future establishment of a\nfree-trade area in the Americas.\n26\n\n\nPortugal, both bilaterally and within the framework of\na number of organizations such as the European Union, the\nNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the\nWestern European Union, has promoted the strengthening\nand deepening of ties with the countries of the Maghreb, a\nregion of fundamental importance today for the security,\nstability and development of the entire Mediterranean area.\nTherefore, a number of European Councils, beginning\nwith that of Lisbon, have detailed new ideas and new\ninstruments of partnership that relate to a number of areas\nand that will bring closer together the two shores of the\nMediterranean; they will be decided upon at the\nforthcoming Euro-Mediterranean Conference in Barcelona\nin November.\nPortugal continues to follow closely the progress\nreached in the Middle East peace process, especially as\nregards the negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians.\nWe must pay tribute here to the courage with which both\nsides have pursued the path of peace; they have frequently\nencountered obstacles \u2014 sometimes tragic ones \u2014 but they\nhave not remained hostage to them. Proof of this is the\nimportant accord to be solemnly signed in Washington in\njust a few days. I hope that this atmosphere of dialogue will\nalso be consolidated among the other parties.\nPortugal, both within the European Union and\nbilaterally, has contributed to the assistance for the\nPalestinian people and for the support of its structures.\nTurning to Asia, I must first mention with satisfaction\nthat, as a result of the close cooperation between Portugal\nand China and in full respect for the joint declaration\nbetween those two countries, the process of Macau\u2019s\ntransition continues to be carried out in a harmonious\nmanner. The common objective of both countries in this\nprocess remains constant: to guarantee the stability and\nprosperity of that territory and the maintenance of its\nspecial characteristics, in the framework of the transfer of\nadministration in December 1999.\nPortugal recognizes the increasing importance that the\nAsian continent is assuming on the international stage. My\ncountry feels that it has profound historical and cultural ties\nto that region. In this context, my Government hopes that\nthe meeting planned for next March in Bangkok will\nconstitute a significant step towards an ever-more-open and\nwider dialogue on all questions of mutual interest to the\nEuropean Union and Asia.\nTo achieve the fundamental and primary goals of\npeace and development, and to face the situations I have\nreferred to, the Organization must undertake a realistic\nexercise of self- examination.\nIt is, above all, essential for the Organization to have\na sound financial foundation. I do not believe I am\nexaggerating by stating that we are in the midst of a crisis\nthat is without precedent and that, if not promptly and\nbravely addressed, will surely lead the Organization to\nrupture. At this point, two stages appear available to us in\nthe search for a solution: strict payment in full and on\ntime of our obligations; the need for corrections which\nwill permit a reduction of expenses or their fairer\ndistribution amongst us.\nWith regard to the first point, I cannot avoid\ncriticizing the attempts to renege on commitments which\nhave already been made, by consensus. How can an\nexpense be adopted by consensus but its payment\nrefused? What kind of credibility can then be expected in\nwhat concerns international commitments?\nAs to the second aspect, reforms are necessary that\nwill reflect each State\u2019s capacity to pay and the alterations\nto that capacity. In this spirit, my Government,\nresponding to an appeal made by the Secretary-General,\ntook the initiative earlier this year to increase voluntarily\nits contributions to the peace-keeping budget. Thus we\nhave moved from group C to group B on the scale of\nassessments. The decision will mean a five-fold increase\nin our initial contributions. We took this decision because\nwe consider that it is a step in the right direction in what\nconcerns the financial reform of the Organization. We\ntook this decision to express our commitment to the\nimportance and success of the work of this Organization.\nWe took this decision because we knew this increase\nmight benefit other countries that are experiencing\ntemporary difficulties. We hope that our move will be\nfollowed by other States whose economic situation has,\nlike Portugal\u2019s, improved in recent years.\nIt is not merely in the financial area that the United\nNations must contemplate reform. Equally important is\nthe reform of the Security Council, which must in the\nnear future reflect the political, economic and\ndemographic realities of the contemporary world. In this\ncontext, an adequate and balanced representation of all\nregions of the world would confer on the Council greater\nefficacy in the formulation and implementation of its\ndecisions and would make it the beneficiary of wide\nsupport from all Member States, which would, in this\n27\n\n\nmanner, feel duly represented on it. It is undoubtedly a\ncomplex process, an evolutionary one, in which differences\nremain profound and which will necessarily be based on a\ncompromise solution.\nI cannot conclude without reaffirming here the\ncandidature of Portugal for one of the two non-permanent\nseats on the Security Council attributed to the Western\nEuropean Group for the period 1996 through 1997. Our\ncandidature is based on a number of reasons.\nFirst, because we believe, as a country with a\nuniversalist nature accustomed to contact with all regions of\nthe globe for more than five centuries and to understanding\nand accepting different cultures and civilizations, that we\nwill be able to contribute to the search for solutions in strict\ncompliance with the purposes and principles set out in the\nCharter of the United Nations.\nSecondly, having been only once before a member of\nthe Security Council, we understand that countries like\nPortugal have not only the right, but also the duty, to\nparticipate in that body more regularly.\nIn this context, I would like to underline here the\nsituation of countries like Portugal \u2014 in fact, the majority\nof those represented here \u2014 that, based on democratic\nprinciples such as that of rotation, can, wish to, and should\nbe able to, contribute to international peace and security.\nAnd this they can do in a particularly constructive manner,\nas, by not pursuing geo-strategic interests of hegemonic\nregional promotion or of any other type, they can, on the\ncontrary, contribute by being accessible, available and\nmoderate in the search for compromise solutions.\nOn the other hand, through our participation in peace-\nkeeping operations, our voluntary increase of our financial\ncontributions to the Organization, our participation in\nimportant United Nations organs, we consider that we are\nready to carry out the role which we may be called upon\nto play.\nWe are ready to listen and not to impose. We place\nour trust in negotiation and not on pressure; we support\nwhat is fair and balanced, and do not consider any\nformula which does not seek to build bridges for the\ncreation of consensus solutions.\nIn candidatures such as this, to achieve the goals set\nout, some are tempted to adopt attitudes which are of\ngreat visibility, but which are of a merely superficial\nnature. Others are tempted also to promise that which is\nquickly forgotten, or even to make commitments which in\nthe end are unfulfilled.\nOn our part, we prefer to rely on the inherent merits\nof our candidature and, in this context, to actively pursue\nin a committed manner, the defence of our positions,\nideas and proposals.\nWe believe, therefore, in the support and warm\nwelcome that the candidature of Portugal for the Security\nCouncil will receive in the elections to take place during\nthe next session of the General Assembly.\nNext month we will celebrate at the highest level, in\na solemn session, the fiftieth anniversary of the United\nNations, which will provide an opportunity for reflection\non the future of this Organization. Portugal hopes that a\nstrengthened determination of all Member States will\nemerge to reaffirm the principles and values of the\nCharter and result in the better adaption of the\nOrganization to the complex realities of international life\ntoday.\nThis is certainly a great challenge. New generations\nhope that we will be able to face these responsibilities.\n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of the Government and the people of\nBurkina Faso, permit me to convey to you, Mr. President,\nmy sincere congratulations on your well-deserved election\nto the presidency of this historic session of the General\nAssembly.\nYour country, Portugal, has ties of friendship and\ncooperation with my own, based on the noble ideals of the\nCharter, and it has always worked to promote friendship\nand solidarity among peoples. Your election is therefore a\nrecognition of your personal skills and qualities and also a\nwell-deserved tribute to your country. I am certain that the\nother members of the Bureau will place their recognized\nskills at your disposal so that, together, you may guide the\nwork of this session successfully.\nI wish also to convey our warmest congratulations and\ngratitude to my brother and friend, Foreign Minister Amara\nEssy, of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, for the remarkable work he did as\nPresident at the forty-ninth session. With his tact and\ndiscretion he gave a tremendous impetus to the work of our\nOrganization throughout the year.\nLastly, let me once again pay a well-deserved tribute\nto our Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, who\nhas, ever since taking office as head of the Organization,\nbeen working side by side with us to give real content to\nthe basic commitments embodied in the Charter. The\nAgenda for Peace and the Agenda for Development he has\nproduced and the consideration they have been given since\ntheir appearance have, we believe, been instrumental in\nensuring that mankind, now and in future years, will enjoy\nan environment of peace, security and prosperity.\nThe creation of the United Nations 50 years ago\nawakened tremendous hopes for mankind, which had, in\nthe space of a single generation, suffered from two\nparticularly savage wars with consequences that sorely\naffected the entire world and for which all peoples paid\na heavy toll.\nThe ambitious programme of the Organization\u2019s\nfounding fathers was to ensure for the future collective\nsecurity, peace among nations and the harmonious\ndevelopment of peoples.\nFifty years after that profession of faith, the record\ncontinues to reflect the contradictions and antagonisms\nthat undermine our own States. However, no Organization\nhas so successfully embodied mankind\u2019s hopes for a\nbetter world.\nAdmittedly, conflicts continue to exist and\ndevelopment seems more than ever a fantasy. However,\nthanks to the concerted action of States, the world has\nexperienced no widespread conflict. Indeed, whenever a\nthreat to world peace has arisen, the United Nations has\nbeen able to bring machinery to bear to limit the\ndestructive effects.\nThus, we have faith in the United Nations even\nthough the half century through which mankind has lived\nsince its creation has been experienced many ups and\ndowns. But what would it have been like had the United\nNations not existed to channel activities for peace, to\noversee the post-war period and the cold war, to give its\nmoral sanction to the emancipation of peoples, to\ncoordinate assistance for economic and social\ndevelopment and to set a moral standard and order\nrelations among nations and human beings?\nThose are important achievements, but they ought\nnot make us forgetful of the fact that on the eve of the\nOrganization\u2019s fiftieth anniversary there are still many\nhotbeds of tension in many parts of the world.\nIn Europe, the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina,\nnotwithstanding some glimmers of hope on the horizon,\ncontinues to cause concern to all States. We hope that the\ntalks now under way among the parties concerned will\nlead to a comprehensive settlement of the situation.\nIn the Middle East the prospects opened up by the\nDeclaration of Principles signed at Washington on 13\nSeptember 1993 between the Government of Israel and\nthe Palestine Liberation Organization continue to yield\n5\n\n\npromising results. Despite the extremists of every stamp\nwho are incapable of accepting alternatives to violence and\ndeath, negotiations have not been broken off. The signing\nat Washington on 28 September 1995 of the Agreement\nnegotiated at Taba on a timetable for the second phase of\nthe Israeli Army\u2019s withdrawal from the West Bank and the\ntransfer of additional powers to the Palestinian Authority is\na further step in the right direction. Burkina Faso\nencourages this pattern of negotiation, which led to the\nPeace Treaty between Jordan and Israel of 26 October 1994\nand to the opening of talks on the Golan Heights between\nIsrael and Syria. We also encourage talks on the Lebanese-\nIsraeli relationship.\nIn Asia, Burkina Faso welcomes the spirit of dialogue\nand cooperation that prevails between the two Koreas and\nbetween the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea and\nthe United States of America. We would note, however,\nthat a country like the Republic of China in Taiwan has not\nbeen able to be among us again this year, at a time when\nwe are to celebrate a historic event.\nWith respect to the question of Jammu and Kashmir,\nBurkina Faso urges India and Pakistan, two fraternal\nneighbouring countries, to find a solution to that problem\nthrough bilateral negotiations.\nThe African continent is facing many problems with\ndeep and complex roots. Many African countries continue\nto be destabilized by savage conflicts that are causing\nmillions of refugees and displaced persons to take to the\nroads and surge across international borders, where their\nprecarious living conditions demand our attention.\nIn Central Africa, the Great Lakes region remains a\npowder-keg that can explode at any moment. The miasma\nof the tragedy in Rwanda can infect other regions if the\nproblem of refugees and displaced persons is not very\nrapidly and correctly settled. We urge the Government and\npeople of Rwanda to continue to mobilize against\nextremism and to seek genuine national reconciliation based\non justice, equity and tolerance as well as on the country\u2019s\neconomic and social reconstruction.\nIn Burundi, notwithstanding the efforts of the\ninternational community, the situation continues to be\ndisturbing. It seems evident that that country will enjoy\npeace and security only when there is a clear and manifest\nresolve on the part of its political leaders to guide their\ncountry to peace and concord without hegemonistic designs\nor hidden ethnic agenda. In that respect the Government\nConvention signed on 10 September 1994 is a starting-\npoint that should be respected.\nThe international community has a very great\nresponsibility in this region. Rwanda, Burundi and the\ncountries of asylum have an urgent and pressing need for\nassistance. Thus, the United Nations Conference on peace,\nsecurity and stability in the Great Lakes region should be\nconvened as soon as possible so as to give the situation\nall the attention it deserves.\nFor its part, Burkina Faso is contributing to the\nprocess by participating, on the one hand, in the\nOrganization of African Unity Observation Mission in\nBurundi while, on the other hand, under the auspices of\nthe Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for\nRefugees, it is participating in the maintenance of security\nin the Rwandan refugee camps in Zaire.\nIn Somalia, the warlords continue to wreak havoc in\nthe country, unmoved by the suffering of the Somali\npeople. We can only hope that as events unfold and\nlessons are learned from experience they will come to\nunderstand the vanity and incongruity of their behaviour\nand that they will reexamine their course of action and\navert disaster for their country.\nIn Sudan, Burkina Faso supports the work being\ndone by the Intergovernmental Authority on Drought and\nDevelopment to find a solution to the fratricidal conflict\nthat has divided that country for so many years. We\nwelcome the steps in that direction being taken by\nPresident Daniel arap Moi of Kenya.\nIn West Africa the determination of the States of the\nsubregion and the efforts made to develop understanding\nand some confidence between the factions in Liberia have\nled to the signing at Abuja, in Nigeria, on 19 August\n1995, of an agreement that offers prospects of peace for\nLiberia. Burkina Faso, as a member of the Committee of\nNine on Liberia of the Economic Community of West\nAfrican States (ECOWAS), was privileged to act as\nwitness to that Agreement between the Liberian factions.\nLike the other members of ECOWAS, it will be vigilant\nin ensuring that its terms are strictly complied with until\nthe general elections scheduled for 1996 are held.\nSierra Leone, a neighbour of Liberia, has for a\nnumber of years endured a cycle of violence that has\ninflicted unspeakable suffering on the civilian population.\nAt a time when Liberia is committing itself to the path of\n6\n\n\npeace, we urge those involved in the conflict in Sierra\nLeone to do the same, by opting for negotiations.\nBurkina Faso welcomes the positive developments in\nthe situation in Angola. We hope that the spirit of dialogue\nthat now prevails through the Lusaka Protocol of 20\nSeptember 1994 will enable that long-suffering country to\nreturn to the path of peace, democracy and development.\nI want to hail the work of the United Nations and the\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU), which are making\nenormous efforts to settle conflicts. We are firmly\nconvinced that peace is indivisible and that the United\nNations remains its primary champion throughout the\nworld, and especially in Africa. More than ever before,\nAfrica is seeking its proper course. While there is universal\nagreement on the need for democratic regimes, good\ngovernance and respect for human rights, the paths we must\ntravel to achieve those things are tortuous and difficult. Yet,\nin our view, crises stemming from the transition to\ndemocracy will be quickly overcome. The real grounds for\nconcern lie rather in the dangerous implosion we see today\nin African societies that are based on poorly managed\ndemocratic processes and chaotic governance and, above\nall, whose populations suffer grinding poverty.\nHere Africa must face up to its own realities. Without\nquestioning the need for international solidarity or the\nprimacy of the United Nations in conflict settlement,\nBurkina Faso, like other African countries, knows that\nAfrica must be the first to invest in the solution of its\nproblems. That is what it is doing, without waiting for\nadequate means to be provided. It is in that spirit that\nBurkina Faso and its leader, President Blaise Compaor\u00e9,\nhave been supporting the efforts of our brethren in\nneighbouring countries of the subregion and elsewhere on\nthe continent.\nIt was also in that spirit that Burkina Faso joined the\nother countries of the Economic Community of West\nAfrican States (ECOWAS) in working towards the\nagreement between the contending factions in Liberia. And\nit is in that same spirit that Burkina Faso supports the\nMechanism of the Organization of African Unity for the\nPrevention, Management and Resolution of Conflicts in\nAfrica, which is an African response to new crisis situations\non the continent.\nIn short, Africa has its problems. To be sure, it has\nreceived bilateral support from members of the international\ncommunity. But on the multilateral level, unfortunately, all\nthe global programmes adopted to date have been\nimplemented only in a timid and inadequate manner. The\nmost recent of these, including the United Nations New\nAgenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s and\nthe Programme of Action for the Least Developed\nCountries for the 1990s, are suffering terribly from a lack\nof financial resources and, to be frank, from a lack of\npolitical will on the part of the majority of our partners\nfrom the developed world. In this connection, our\napprehensions were confirmed by the results of the recent\nhigh-level intergovernmental meeting to undertake a mid-\nterm review of the implementation of the Programme of\nAction for the Least Developed Countries for the 1990s.\nMeanwhile, our debt burden has obstructed\nproductive new investment, and deteriorating terms of\ntrade have cancelled out earnings from commodities.\nMore and more, Africa is losing its share of the\ninternational market, ultimately facing inescapable\nmarginalization at a time when the globalization of the\nworld economy is becoming apparent. But globalization\ndemands solidarity and interdependence. We must make\na choice: if wealth does not spill over borders, then\npoverty and destitution will.\nOne of the problems calling for world solidarity is\nthat of the environment, and especially the fight against\ndrought and desertification. When, faced with the great\ndroughts of the 1970s in Western Africa, Burkina Faso\nmounted a campaign to combat this scourge, the\ninternational community did not seem to understand its\nimportance. Today, protecting the environment is one of\nthe priority tasks of States. The Rio Conference on\nEnvironment and Development, the June 1994 adoption of\nthe United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification\nin Those Countries Experiencing Serious Drought and/or\nDesertification, Particularly in Africa, and the entry into\nforce of the Convention on Biological Diversity and the\nFramework Convention on Climate Change have truly\ngiven fresh impetus to greater awareness in this area. But\nwhat good are all these instruments without the resources\nneeded to fight the evils they are meant to attack?\nBurkina Faso made a substantial contribution to the\ndrafting of the United Nations Convention to Combat\nDesertification in Those Countries Experiencing Serious\nDrought and/or Desertification, Particularly in Africa, and\nhopes that it will quickly enter into force, to give even\ngreater momentum to the efforts of our countries within\nthe Permanent Inter-State Committee for Drought Control\nin the Sahel, and, with respect to East Africa, within the\nIntergovernmental Authority on Drought and\nDevelopment.\n7\n\n\nOn the eve of its fiftieth anniversary the United\nNations stands at a crossroads. It must turn away from\ncold-war reflexes and stride resolutely towards the horizon\nof the twenty-first century. It must adapt quickly to the new\ncontext of a more open, globalized world, and must from\nnow on accept the clear determination of all States to\nparticipate in world affairs. In this context, the United\nNations needs to make the changes that will enable it to\nbetter profit from the contributions that States and regions\nare ready to make.\nBut the most biggest challenge facing the United\nNations is undoubtedly that of the poverty and destitution\nthat still afflict one fifth of mankind. The world of\nsolidarity and brotherhood that we want to build will be\npossible only if all human beings can live in dignity. In that\nconnection, we have been working for five years on\nprinciples and objectives for children, women, the\nenvironment, human rights, population and social\ndevelopment. Let us implement them.\nIt is with that hope that we approach the work of the\nfiftieth session of the General Assembly. On behalf of\nBurkina Faso, I reaffirm our complete devotion to the noble\nideals of the United Nations.\n"

        "file_text": "It is the honour of the delegation of Costa\nRica to congratulate you, Sir, on your election to the\npresidency of the General Assembly at this historic\nsession marking the fiftieth anniversary of the United\nNations. We are extremely pleased that a distinguished\nson of Portugal, a country so closely linked to Latin\n4\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\n\nAmerica by history and culture, has been chosen for this\nhigh position. We offer you our full cooperation in the\nperformance of your important duties.\nWe wish to express to Member States the gratitude of\nthe Government and the people of Costa Rica for having\nelected our country to one of the vice-presidencies of the\nAssembly. That election is a significant honour.\nIt also gives me pleasure to join previous speakers in\nthanking the Minister for Foreign Affairs of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire,\nHis Excellency Mr. Amara Essy, for the splendid way in\nwhich he performed his duties as President of the General\nAssembly at its forty-ninth session.\nCosta Rica wishes to convey its recognition of the\nindefatigable work carried out by the Secretary-General and\nby other Secretariat officials towards peace and security.\nThe devoted efforts of the Secretary-General to champion\na safer, fairer, more peaceful and more humane world for\nfuture generations will be a great legacy for mankind, along\nwith his determination to transform and modernize the\nOrganization and carry it into the future.\nFifty years ago, Mr. Julio Acosta, former President of\nthe Republic and Minister for Foreign Affairs of Costa\nRica, who headed our country\u2019s delegation to the United\nNations Conference on International Organization at San\nFrancisco, said that the future of the world lay with the\nCharter of the United Nations, which was the most\nimportant human document of the last 1,000 years. That,\nindeed, is what it has been, at least over the last 50 years,\ndespite the many difficulties, the many frustrations, the\nmany conflicts. The Charter of the United Nations has set\na new course for mankind and has provided the\ninternational community with an ethical code that grows\nstronger every day.\nCosta Rica, a founding Member of the Organization,\nis firmly committed to the United Nations, in accordance\nwith its long-standing regime of democracy and respect for\nhuman rights. The values and principles which give shape\nto this Organization were an integral part of Costa Rican\nlife many years before the San Francisco Conference. With\nthe abolition of the armed forces in 1948, our country\nrenewed its faith in law and its hope that reason, not force,\nwould govern relations among human beings. With that\ndecision of President Jos\u00e9 Figueres, Costa Rica addressed\nthe world and declared peace. With the same thought in\nmind, the Government of Costa Rica has promoted many\nUnited Nations initiatives in support of peace and human\nrights, including the establishment of the University for\nPeace, the declaration of the International Year of Peace\nand the creation of the office of the United Nations High\nCommissioner for Human Rights. All these ideas are\naimed at realizing mankind\u2019s dream of sustainable peace.\nIn the spirit of commemorating in deeds the fiftieth\nanniversary of the Organization, Costa Rica proposed a\nWorld Week of Peace, to begin on 24 October this year.\nThis initiative, sponsored by a large number of countries\nand unanimously adopted by the General Assembly on\n12 July 1995, would silence weapons everywhere in the\nworld for at least a week, so that in the future sustainable\npeace might prevail over destructive war. Costa Rica\nhopes that during the Week all Member States will carry\nout pro-peace activities and reflect on how important it is\nfor mankind to learn to live under the sign of concord.\nMy delegation is aware of the practical constraints that\nstand in the way of the World Week of Peace achieving\nits goals on the desired scale. However, it is our belief\nthat any move that could be taken this week to promote\ndialogue, coexistence and harmony between nations would\nbe a valuable contribution to the celebration of the fiftieth\nanniversary of the United Nations and to the building of\nthe future. The effort will have been worthwhile if even\none human being \u2014 a child, a woman or a man \u2014 is\nsaved from death as a result of this initiative.\nThere are no conflicts without solutions. All ground\nis fertile for reconciliation. How many tears were shed in\nSouth Africa, how much blood was spilled in the Middle\nEast! However, animosity has gradually disappeared and\nharmony is beginning to flourish. Multicultural democracy\nis giving a new and peaceful direction to the history of\nSouth Africa. With the recent agreement on the West\nBank, Israelis and Palestinians continue to show that\npeace is always possible. If there is a will for peace,\npeace can be achieved. In that context, the United Nations\nmust continue to be the forum where all the peoples of\nthe world have fair representation. No country should be\nexcluded from becoming a Member of this Organization.\nFor many years, the world prevented a general\nconflagration by resorting to containment. Today,\nalthough the East-West confrontation has dissipated, and\npreventive diplomacy is making headway, there are still\nlatent seeds of world conflict, concentrated in the sub-\nhuman conditions in which a large portion of the world\u2019s\npopulation live, and evident also in the massive decay of\nthe environment.\nThe urgent need to solve senseless conflicts such as\nthe one in the former Yugoslavia and to end the violence\n5\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\n\nbesetting so many places in the world should not make us\nlose sight of the fact that true peace involves a series of\nelements much more significant than the mere absence of\nwar. As has been recently stated by His Holiness Pope John\nPaul II, who offered to the world such a beautiful message\nof hope and goodwill today from this Hall,\n\u201c... peace is not limited to the silence of cannons. It is\nnourished with justice and freedom. It needs the\natmosphere of a spirit rich in some fundamental\nelements, such as the sense of God, the taste for\nbeauty, the love of truth, the choice of solidarity, and\nthe capacity for tenderness and the courage to\nforgive.\u201d\nThe fiftieth anniversary of the Organization is an\noccasion for reflection, but we should also use it to\nmeditate on the challenge of our times: to achieve\nsustainable development.\nIn Central America we have committed ourselves\nfirmly to a comprehensive peace process and\ndemocratization, in a regional effort to build peace and\ndemocracy where these are needed, and to strengthen them\nwhere they already exist. This journey is culminating today\nin the encouraging advances experienced in the dialogue in\nGuatemala. Costa Rica is optimistic about the efforts to find\na lasting peaceful solution to the problem involving that\nbrotherly country. We give our full support to the\nnegotiation process being developed to that end under the\nauspices of the United Nations.\nCentral Americans, who for many years have\nsuccessfully advocated this process of peace and\ndemocratization, are today also committed to an alliance to\ngenerate in our region a new model of development,\ncombining freedom and the well-being of the vast majority,\nwith respect for the natural environment. This Central\nAmerican commitment to the region itself and to the\ninternational community is being implemented through\nvarious actions and development projects. We hope that the\ninternational community as a whole will understand and\nappreciate Central America\u2019s effort, and will lend it its\nsupport, as several friendly nations have already done.\nAs an integral part of the process of the consolidation\nof peace and the building of sustainable development,\nrespect for human rights is no longer just a legal and moral\nobligation of Governments; it has become an essential\ncondition for harmonious life in every society. However,\nwe cannot disregard the fact that many situations in which\nthese rights are still ignored or violated persist, making the\ntask of the relevant international bodies doubly important.\nIt is not legal to violate human rights, but it is not right\nto sit idly by, using the pretext of respect for sovereignty,\nwhich is only hypothetical respect and borders on\ncomplicity.\nFor Costa Rica, a party to the International\nCovenants on this matter and the headquarters of the\nInter-American Court of Human Rights, it is essential that\nthe United Nations assume a more dynamic and energetic\nrole in the protection of fundamental human rights and\nrequire from Member States strict compliance with their\nresponsibilities in this area. For this purpose, protective\nentities, in particular the Office of the United Nations\nHigh Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), should be\nprovided with more resources. We must also strengthen\nmeasures against States which ignore the\nrecommendations of those bodies, or prevent them from\nperforming their duties.\nWe are also concerned that overcoming the balance\nof terror has not put an end to the arms race, and that is\na matter of concern to us. We cannot understand why at\nthis time in history there are still countries which, with\nsurprising levity, destroy the environment and endanger\ntheir neighbours with nuclear tests. This is a flagrant\nviolation of the commitments that marked the conclusion\nof the negotiations to extend the Treaty on the Non-\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons, and has a negative\neffect on the tasks related to the drafting of the\ncomprehensive nuclear test-ban treaty. Costa Rica has\nnever possessed, and does not want to possess, nuclear or\nchemical weapons, and strongly urges participant States\nto speedily conclude negotiations on this treaty and to\nensure that it takes effect as soon as possible.\nHowever, the danger of a nuclear holocaust should\nnot make us unconcerned about the problems caused by\nconventional weapons, the traffic in which has a tragic\nimpact on the third world and keeps a series of very\nharmful conflicts alive. Many Governments of\nunderdeveloped countries continue to waste resources on\nweapons, resources needed desperately by their own\npeople for basic necessities. The democracies of the\nindustrialized world continue providing those weapons in\na business which undoubtedly, on a short-term basis, is\nfinancially more profitable than cooperation for\ndevelopment.\nIn 1994, relying on an initiative of the Government\nof Romania, a group of 25 countries proposed to the\nGeneral Assembly the adoption of a voluntary, global and\nnon-discriminatory code of conduct for the international\n6\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\n\ntransfer of weapons. My delegation believes that this\nsubject must be reactivated without delay and also that\nconcrete action must be taken to make the Register of\nConventional Weapons within the United Nations effective.\nThe reduction of military spending has an immediate\nrepercussion on budget allocations for the promotion of\ndevelopment and well-being. In Costa Rica, we learned this\nlesson almost half a century ago and we have had no\nreason since then to regret our decision. However, we also\nbelieve that providing special treatment, such as cooperation\nfor development and the transfer of technology for peaceful\npurposes, to countries which reduce military spending\nwould be a great incentive, as has been suggested by Oscar\nArias, a former President of Costa Rica and a Nobel Peace\nPrize Laureate in 1987.\nIn the spirit of building a new world, a world better\nthan the one that existed 50 years ago, the international\ncommunity has the duty to promote changes in the area of\ninternational economic relations.\nIn recent years, there have been significant\nreformulations in international trade plans. A World Trade\nOrganization has been created to replace the General\nAgreement on Tariffs and Trade, and there has been a\nproliferation of regional free-trade plans. However, this has\nnot dissipated the worrying trends towards protectionism\nthat are increasingly being developed by industrialized\nnations. While the underdeveloped countries are applying\nprogrammes with a view to the adjustment and the opening\nup of trade, the richest countries are imposing burdensome\nlimitations on trade. My delegation considers that the ninth\nsession of the United Nations Conference on Trade and\nDevelopment (UNCTAD), to be held in South Africa in\n1996, must become a fundamental forum for the discussion\nof these problems.\nSince the first meeting of UNCTAD, held in Geneva\nin 1964, 77 countries of the Third World have joined in\ndemanding more equitable conditions in regard to world\ntrade. The fight for this new international economic order\nhas today become a priority because, even though the\nmilitary-political blocs which divided the world in the\nrecent past have now disappeared, the gap between North\nand South is becoming ever greater. In the circumstances,\nwe consider that the presidency of the Group of 77 and\nChina, to which Costa Rica was appointed a few days ago,\nis not only a great honour but also an important\nresponsibility. Costa Rica is deeply grateful for the support\nit received in achieving this significant position and we\nhope that in the performance of our duties we will make a\nconstructive contribution towards the launching of the\nGroup of 77 into the new international realities.\nFor some years now, it has been suggested that there\nis a need to redesign the United Nations in order to give\nthe Organization a new look in keeping with a different\nworld situation. Costa Rica, on various occasions, has\nexpressed its support for initiatives in this area, including\nthe suggestion that Germany and Japan should become\npermanent members of the Security Council, and that we\nshould guarantee permanent representation for all regions\nin that body. Today, on the occasion of the celebration of\nthe fiftieth anniversary, we wish to reiterate Costa Rica\u2019s\nfirm commitment to the renovation of the United Nations.\nIt is urgent to take steps along the lines pointed out by\nthe Secretary-General in his \u201cAn Agenda for Peace\u201d and\n\u201cAn Agenda for Development\u201d, and it is important that\nthe international system should comply with the\nresolutions of the General Assembly and the mandates of\nthe Security Council. It is also essential to provide a\nfollow-up to, and implement, the commitments made at\nthe Rio, Copenhagen and Beijing conferences.\nIn celebrating the fifty years of its existence, the\nUnited Nations is still young. It remains young because\nits spirit is still generously irrigated with idealism and\nwith faith in mankind. The Organization remains young\nbecause it still believes that the human being has a greater\ncapacity to convince than to shoot, to love than to hate,\nto build than to destroy, to procreate than to kill.\nLet us preserve this essence of youth in our\nOrganization. In 1995, as in 1945, in spite of\ndisappointments, bitter days and years, the United Nations\nrepresents the hope that there will be a future for our\nchildren. The United Nations is the most important\ndemonstration that there will be a future because the\nwords uttered in this Hall many years ago by the then\nForeign Minister and later President of Costa Rica, Daniel\nOduber, are still valid. He said that the United Nations\nhad revealed itself to be the only entity capable of\nminimizing the sufferings which, alternating with the\nsatisfaction of being alive and of performing our duties,\nwere the common lot of mankind.\nI would conclude with the inspiring words uttered by\nHis Holiness Pope John Paul II in this Hall this morning,\n\u201cThe answer to the fear which darkens human\nexistence at the end of the century is the common\neffort to build a civilization of love, founded on the\nuniversal values of peace, solidarity, justice and\n7\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\n\nliberty.\u201d (Official Records of the General Assembly,\nFiftieth Session, Plenary Meetings, 20th meeting, p. 6).\n"

        "file_text": "As\nwe will soon be commemorating half a century of United\nNations work, may I start by presenting warm fiftieth-\nanniversary greetings from Brunei Darussalam to all our\nfellow Members.\nAlso, before commenting on our present situation, I\nwould like to take this brief opportunity to thank two\ngroups of people who do not receive much publicity and\nwho I hope will not be overlooked in the general\ncelebration.\nFirst, I think it would be most appropriate at this\ntime to mention those who have served this Organization\nin the field as representatives of our various agencies or\nas part of our peace-keeping operations and special\nmissions. Their work has always been at the heart of\nUnited Nations efforts. It has given people throughout the\nworld a chance to look ahead with hope, and we wish all\nwho are engaged in this work much continued success.\nAt the same time, I would like to look outside our\nOrganization and thank our hosts. Here I am referring to\nthe people of New York and all the other cities around\n20\n\n\nthe world who for 50 years have accepted the demanding\nresponsibility of being a United Nations venue. Their\nsupport and good will have been crucial, and I would like\nto say how much we appreciate this.\nWith that, may I now turn to current business and\noffer the President my congratulations on his election. I am\nsure he will guide us well during what we hope will be a\nmost successful year.\nI would also like to thank the outgoing President, His\nExcellency Mr. Amara Essy, for his contribution to our\nwork over the past year and to convey my best wishes to\nthe Secretary-General and his staff.\nGiven all the recent changes which have taken place\nin world affairs, our fiftieth anniversary comes at a critical\nperiod. I would therefore like to offer a few thoughts on the\napproach we in Brunei Darussalam would like to see the\nUnited Nations taking in the future.\nFifty years ago, at the first session of the General\nAssembly, President Truman\u2019s opening address described\nthe purpose of the United Nations as being\n\u201cto provide the means for maintaining international\npeace in the future\u201d. (Official Records of the General\nAssembly, First Session, Plenary Meetings, 34th\nmeeting, p. 682)\nThe approach the United Nations took at that time was\nsuccessful. It certainly stopped great Powers from making\nwar on each other in Europe. However, it also led to the\ncold war. This is now over, but it seems to have left behind\na situation in which there is great potential for instability in\nthe rest of the world.\nMuch of this, of course, is the result of the changes\nwhich have taken place in 50 years. The centres of power\nhave moved, and the danger spots have shifted. We all\ndepend on each other a lot more for peace, security and\ndevelopment. The changes are so profound that many of us\nfeel they may call for an equally profound reform of this\nOrganization.\nBrunei Darussalam is a fairly new Member, but we\ntend to think there is a strong case for this. We believe the\nUnited Nations has to adapt to change. We also hope this\ncan be done soon. The future could hold some very serious\nproblems, and they will require a United Nations which is\nwell prepared to handle them.\nThe very worrying signs of what could lie ahead are\nalready quite clear. There are humanitarian problems on\na vast scale. We face social and environmental issues\nwhich affect the whole world. There is instability in world\nfinancial affairs. Trade disputes disrupt the peaceful\nconduct of international commerce. There is also what we\nbelieve is the most serious concern of all: the\ndevelopment gap between the North and the South is\ngrowing wider and wider.\nThis all means that the United Nations has an\nextremely challenging agenda as it starts out on the next\n50 years of its existence. An international situation now\nexists in which it is essential that we recognize the stake\neach of us has in the welfare of all the others. We all\nhave to reaffirm our commitment to working very closely\ntogether as United Nations Members.\nSo perhaps the most encouraging feature of\ninternational affairs today is that in every part of the\nworld countries are trying very hard indeed to respond to\nthis new challenge. I also think it is fair to say that\nwhatever can be done by individual countries or regional\nassociation is being attempted.\nHaving said that, however, I must add that there is\none thing we cannot do: no country or regional group on\nits own can make the whole world stable and peaceful.\nFor this, we rely on the United Nations. It is the only\nmechanism which can deal with the basic causes of\ninstability. Therefore, I would like to suggest that this is\nthe most important responsibility of the United Nations\ntoday. If it is to carry it out successfully, however, I also\nsuggest that there are a number of useful lessons to be\nlearned from recent experiences.\nThe first of these arises from the crisis faced by the\nGovernment of Bosnia and Herzegovina since 1991.\nCertainly, we are pleased to see welcome signs of hope\nin that country.\nHowever, I think it will be very difficult for most of\nus to forget how badly United Nations personnel have\nbeen treated. Nor do we wish ever again to experience the\nfrustration we have felt over our representatives\u2019 inability\nto implement Security Council resolutions.\nThe Bosnian tragedy has obviously raised a great\nnumber of questions. But, above all, I feel, we have been\ntaught one extremely important thing: if the United\nNations is to be involved in a future situation like this, its\n21\n\n\nrepresentatives must be given all the resources they need,\nso that they can carry out their tasks effectively.\nA second lesson can be drawn, from the Middle East.\nWe are still hopeful that the peace process there will reach\na just and comprehensive conclusion. However, what has\nbeen shown in Palestine is what was also evident in\nCambodia: peace negotiations and even peace treaties\nrequire more than just formal recognition by the\ninternational community; practical assistance from us all is\nneeded if the result is to be lasting peace.\nThe third recent lesson I see for us lies in recognizing\nto the full that the end of the cold war has made us aware\nof many other aspects of security which lie deeper than just\nmilitary defence.\nNext year, we hope that a comprehensive test ban\ntreaty will be in effect. Among other things, it would be a\nmost appropriate way to acknowledge the reminders we\nhave had this year of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. But it\nshould also mean that everyone accepts that it is\nunthinkable for nuclear weapons ever to be used again. The\nultimate aim now is the abolition of all such weapons. If\nthis is indeed accepted, then the idea of nuclear weapons as\na deterrent cannot be logically sustained; nor can the need\nto continue testing such weapons.\nInstead, the logic of the post cold war period applies\nand leads us to the more modern concept of security. In\nother words, we should be doing everything we can to take\nadvantage of the peace dividend and work together to solve\nthe great environmental, social and economic challenges we\nall face.\nThere is one more lesson I believe this early post cold\nwar period has taught us. It is perhaps the most urgent of\nall. This is that the increasing gap between the North and\nthe South in terms of development and the possibility of\nmaking progress must be closed.\nThe Secretary-General has suggested an important\nshift in emphasis for the United Nations \u2014 from politics to\nglobal economic development. I think the Secretary-General\nis quite right. It is essential that the United Nations move\nin this direction. Peace-keeping, though much valued, is a\ncostly, short-term response to global peace. The longer-term\nsolution is widespread economic development. What we do\nask, however, is that this be done urgently as time is not on\nthe side of developing nations.\nWe naturally cannot predict what form the United\nNations will take in the next half century of its existence.\nOne thing, however, is beyond question, I feel: the world\nis even more than ever in need of the moral force of\nUnited Nations principles to guide it.\nMay I assure you, Mr. President, that in its efforts to\nremain strong and effective and credible, the United\nNations has the lasting support and commitment of the\nGovernment and the people of Brunei Darussalam.\n"

        "file_text": "Let me first congratulate\nyou, Sir, on your election to the presidency of the fiftieth\nsession of the General Assembly. I wish you a successful\npresidency. Appreciation is also due to your distinguished\npredecessor, His Excellency Mr. Amara Essy, who provided\nthe leadership during the forty-ninth session of the General\nAssembly.\nThe General Assembly is meeting in the midst of\nhectic schedules of events to commemorate the fiftieth\nanniversary of the United Nations. Some of us have become\npreoccupied with these celebrations. We should ask whether\nthese activities are merely media events or could seriously\ncontribute to a better United Nations. Will the high point\nof the fiftieth anniversary be reduced to a special\ncommemorative meeting condensed into a declaration of\ngood intentions which no one seriously cares for, or\nshould we resist the tendency to celebrate, to expend\nmillions on galas and parties and to eulogize through\nrhetorical speeches the anniversary of the establishment of\nthe United Nations? After all we cannot even answer the\nbasic questions of where we stand and what the United\nNations is, whipping boy or serious, enduring player.\nAdmittedly it is easier to raise questions than to find\nanswers. But these questions must be raised and they\ndeserve to be answered. In its fiftieth year the United\nNations system finds itself criticized for being unable to\nhandle basic and critical political, economic and social\nissues. Despite earlier hopes of a just world order\nfollowing the end of the cold war, what we still see is a\nUnited Nations which dances to the grating music of the\nmajor Powers, in total disregard for the high principles\nand objectives pledged at its formation. We will have to\nconclude that the narrow national interest of the few is\nstill what the United Nations is all about. Also, the\nprinciple which largely moves the major Powers, that\nwhat they need for themselves must influence their\ndealings with the needs of others, is fully operative,\nmaking nonsense of interdependence, social compassion\nand justice.\nAnd so we must forget the promise of an\ninternational political leadership that can collectively\n\n\ncome to grips with the myriad issues for a shared survival.\nConfrontation between States, intra-State conflicts,\neconomic and military threats, the dehumanizing effects of\npoverty: all these are heightened rather than diminished by\nthe end of the cold war. The contradictory impulses of\ninterdependence and isolationism are more evident than\never before. Not only is humanitarianism drying up fast, but\nwhat survives is replete with conditionalities. The United\nNations presents a shattered image with a threadbare moral\nauthority, despite the important early successes in\ndecolonization and the subsequent elimination of apartheid.\nThe victors of 1945 have clung tenaciously to the\nlevers of power. They control the high ground, exercising\ninfluence and power as nakedly as when they were colonial\nPowers. Only the masks have changed. The multilateral\norganizations created on the eve of war\u2019s end were and still\nare structured to further their economic interests and the\npursuit of their strategic political goals. The Security\nCouncil, the World Bank and the International Monetary\nFund have merely become the instruments of power\nperpetuation. Less than six months ago, we witnessed the\nuse of the United Nations to push through, draconian-like,\nthe nuclear non-proliferation Treaty. Before the ink was\ndry, some of the nuclear Powers proceeded to test their\ndiabolical weapons. What, may I ask, qualifies some\ncountries to possess the means of mass destruction in\nperpetuity? It is time that the nuclear-weapon States\ncommitted themselves to nuclear disarmament through a\nprogrammed reduction of their nuclear arsenals within a\nspecific time-frame, beginning with the immediate cessation\nof all nuclear tests and culminating in their total\nelimination. Soon it may be too costly and too late.\nPerversely, the major Powers not only continue to\ncompete in developing ever more destructive conventional\nweapons but also compete to sell arms. And when some\ndeveloping countries buy arms the Western-controlled\nmedia accuse them of indulging in arms races.\nWe seem to have inherited a world in which moral\nconsiderations have no real role to play in which acts of\nrealpolitik have no moral consequences. Tears appear to be\nshed about the human tragedies in Bosnia, Rwanda, Liberia,\nSomalia and Chechnya, but many have become desensitized\nto the horrors that flash across our screens. The Charter\nincorporating the idealism and dreams of 1945 is more\nhonoured in violations of it than in adherence to it. Tell us:\nHow have the principles of the Charter on the non-use of\nforce and the illegality of claiming territory acquired by\naggression been of help to the Bosnians? What protection\nor solace has the genocide Convention been to those\nslaughtered in Rwanda, Bosnia, Cambodia and Chechnya?\nThe lesson for the peoples of these countries is clear: no\ninternational order or international ethos will be defended\nunless the major Powers see that their vital interests are\nat risk.\nThe United Nations has been party to the double talk\nin Bosnia, insisting that morality has no place in peace-\nkeeping since the impartiality that peace-keepers had to\nmaintain required them to eschew making any judgement\nabout the rights and wrongs of the situation. I ask the\nUnited Nations whether there can be a middle ground\nwhere genocide and \u201cethnic cleansing\u201d are concerned. I\nask the Secretary-General of the United Nations whether\nhe is obliged to defend the moral principles in the United\nNations Charter or whether he should console the dying\nand the bereaved by saying that there are others elsewhere\nwho are suffering worse fates.\nIs there not, in the context of the larger picture, a\nspecial role for the United Nations to provide\ninternational leadership? Clearly the major Powers have\nfailed to provide leadership, choosing only to act in\nfurtherance of their national or domestic political\ninterests. They continue to harp on human rights and the\nsanctity of human life but they act only when they run no\nrisk.\nAdmittedly, blame must also be apportioned to many\nof us in the third world. Some of us have led our people\ndown the path of despair and misery. With the demise of\ncolonialism there was the promise of freedom and\ndevelopment. Yet many succumbed to the temptations of\ncreature comfort, failing to further the rights and welfare\nof our own people. But then, when we were colonies, the\nonly form of government we knew was authoritarian\ncolonialism. It is too much to expect some of us, at the\nmidnight flag-lowering, suddenly to become democratic\nand sophisticated.\nThe threat of a brutalized world has never been more\nevident than in the Serb programme of \u201cethnic cleansing\u201d\nin Bosnia and Herzegovina and the massacres in Rwanda.\nFor a long time the major Powers were opposed to taking\nstrong measures against the Serbs. We are seeing\nbelatedly some sense of purpose in the North Atlantic\nTreaty Organization (NATO) bombings and efforts to\nnegotiate a solution. However, we should be cautious\nabout rushing towards solutions that reward aggression\nand genocide. It is possible that some in the West and in\nthe United Nations had longed for Bosnia\u2019s quick defeat.\nIt would have saved them from making any decision. But\n2\n\n\nthe Bosnians refused to oblige. In Rwanda the European\ntroops withdrew when the massacres began. And in Somalia\nfailure to understand the situation led to the victims fighting\ntheir United Nations saviours.\nThe United Nations Secretariat must take some of the\nblame for all these brutalities. In Rwanda it truly shirked its\nduty, while in Bosnia it sent in a protection force which\nwas instructed not to protect the Bosnians. Why it should\nbe called the United Nations Protection Force\n(UNPROFOR) has been a mystery until recently. It was\nthere to protect itself. It makes a distinction between\npeace-keeping and peace-enforcement. If there is peace to\nkeep, why are military forces needed? Are not the forces\nput there because of the possibility of breaches of the\npeace? And when there are breaches the forces must stop\nthem, if peace-keeping is to be meaningful. But, instead,\nwhen peace is broken the United Nations threatens to\nwithdraw and leave the victims to their fate.\nFortunately, in Palestine, another historical flash point,\nefforts continue to be made towards durable peace. That\npeace process must result in a Palestinian homeland, a\nviable State at peace with its neighbours. The attempts to\nweaken the present Palestinian leadership by undermining\nits credibility will only result in the rise of extremism and\na protracted and bloody intra- Palestinian conflict which\nwill spill over into Israel and elsewhere.\nThe absence of international leadership and\ncommitment is evident in the area of development as well.\nThe rhetoric of development is increasingly devoid of\nmeaningful content. The North has turned its back on\ncommitments relating to development assistance. Yet such\nis the concern for the survival of insects and plant life that\nhuman development must be stopped if it is suspected it\nmight endanger a few animals or plants. That there are\nplenty of the same species elsewhere is considered\nirrelevant. And so one-fifth of the world\u2019s population\nremains mired in poverty, having been denied development\nassistance by the rich and the powerful. The latter have\nretreated into their regional clubs and cosy arrangements for\nperpetuating unconscionable levels of consumption. Some\nof the countries of the South have tried to pull themselves\nup literally by their bootstraps. But the moment they appear\nto succeed the carpet is pulled out from under their feet.\nGeneralized System of Preferences (GSP) privileges are\nwithdrawn and their records on human rights, democracy,\nand so on, are scrutinized in order to obstruct their progress.\nSome among the more successful countries of the\nSouth have been enticed to join the rich and the strong, so\nthey may not lend what little strength they have to their\ncompatriots.\nCommitment to the environment should not be\nturned into an occasion for recrimination and the pointing\nof fingers. Worse, it should not be politically\ninstrumentalized to disadvantage the South. Development\ncan take place without irreparable damage to the\nenvironment. Forcing the developing countries to remain\nundeveloped in order to preserve the environment for the\nrich is manifestly unfair. Yet the environmental obstacles\nplaced in the way of the poor South will do just that,\nbeggaring the poor to enrich the already rich.\nPoverty itself creates an environment that is as\ndamaging to humanity as any other kind of environmental\npollution. Obviously, we need to determine our priorities.\nDo we keep the poor permanently poor so that the rich\ncan enjoy the environment, or do we sacrifice the\nenvironment a little in the interest of relieving poverty?\nWe in Malaysia accept that economic development\nshould not be at the expense of other groups or future\ngenerations. Environmental sustainability, social equity\nand a culture that allows for the fulfilment of human\nneeds must replace the culture of materialism. The\nWestern consumer society, which is spreading world\nwide, requires ever-increasing consumption to keep\nproduction and profits continually rising. For this, more\nfuel is needed, and the trend in the use of fossil fuels in\nrecent years is alarming. Yet very little is being done to\ncurb such wasteful use of a depleting resource, while the\ndevelopment of renewable resources, such as hydropower,\nmeets with all kinds of objections. Progressively\nindustrializing Malaysia has the capacity and the\nresources to design and implement a model of\ndevelopment sensitive to the needs and cultural values of\ndeveloping countries without imitating the flawed Western\nmodel. We ask only that misguided crusaders should keep\nout. These modern-day imitations of the Communist\nagitators would do well to look to their own countries\u2019\nwasteful consumption and carbon-dioxide emissions.\nSocial disintegration is a serious problem as the\nworld\u2019s population becomes more urbanized. This is not\nhelped by the West\u2019s seeking to impose its moral values.\nThe institutions that hold society together are now being\nundermined. At the Beijing Women\u2019s Summit, despite a\nconsensus cobbled together to alleviate the sufferings of\nwomen, the mad quest for personal freedom took one\nmore tradition-bashing step. People, it seems, cannot be\nfree unless they have sexual freedom, a freedom that\n3\n\n\nrejects the inhibitions of traditional and religious values, of\nmarriage and family as institutions of society. Sexual\nfreedom will render fidelity meaningless as much as it\nrenders marriages anachronistic. The new liberalism extends\nto a new definition of the family, which is to include\nhomosexual pairs, unmarried women with children by\nunknown fathers, groups of men and women living together\nwith no fixed partners, and many other combinations.\nIf the West wants to be liberal and sexually free, that\nis its right. What is wrong is the attempt to impose its\nmorality, or lack of it, on the rest of the world, and in\nBeijing that was what it tried to do. The United Nations\nshould not lend itself to this kind of undemocratic disregard\nfor the rights of others.\nOf late there has been much talk about reform of the\nUnited Nations. Clearly, there is a need for this after 50\nyears of the United Nations carrying the tattered baggage of\nthe last world war. Surely the results of that war cannot be\nreflected in the structure and procedures of the United\nNations for ever. It has to end some time, and the fiftieth\nanniversary is as good a time as any for burying the relics\nof past follies.\nSince democracy seems to have displaced religion as\na faith, it is fitting that there should be democratic reforms\nin the United Nations. Some of those countries which had\nvested themselves with infallibility and permanency have\nnow become second-raters. New players have emerged that\nshould be accorded recognition. A more equitable\nrepresentation on the Security Council is a must. This\nmeans that permanent seats should be given to regions,\npossibly determined by a regional mechanism.\nThe veto power should be dropped. Under no\ncircumstances must the Security Council be made an\ninstrument of any one country.\nReform must also extend to the financing of the\nUnited Nations. It is wholly unacceptable that Member\nStates, especially the rich ones, should fall into arrears with\nimpunity and yet exercise special rights and influence. The\nmembership rules must be applied to one and all. New\nbases for assessment should be laid down, taking into\nconsideration the wealth, or lack of it, of Members.\nVarious global taxation schemes, including modest\nlevies on global air travel, a tax on global speculative flows\nof capital, a tax on the exploitation of mankind\u2019s common\nassets on the seabed and a tax on the trade in weapons of\nwar, have all been proposed. Of those, the last one, based\non the principle that he who profits from the tools of war\nmust contribute to the maintenance of peace, merits\nurgent attention and adoption.\nReform of the United Nations also requires the\ncleansing of the bureaucratic Augean stables in the\nSecretariat. The morale of the international civil service\nis at its lowest ebb. The excesses and the fat must be\ntrimmed, but failure to do so must not be used as an\nexcuse for not paying dues or for opting out.\nIt is heartening to note that the United Nations\nConference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) and\nother United Nations economic agencies have now\nacknowledged that linking trade and non-trade issues\nserves no useful purpose either for the developed or for\nthe developing countries. Unemployment in the developed\ncountries is due not to workers\u2019 in developing countries\nworking hard to compensate for their lack of other\ncompetitive advantages, but, rather, to the profligate ways\nof the developed nations, with their high wages and\nunemployment benefits. Why it is assumed that workers\nin developed countries would work when they are to be\npaid for not working is a mystery on a par with the idea\nthat people would be happy and productive if the diligent\nwere paid as much as the indolent.\nThe reform of global institutions must encompass the\nBretton Woods institutions. Their energies and resources\nmust be channelled towards the battle against the\npollution caused by poverty worldwide. The Bretton\nWoods institutions have to cease acting as debt collectors\nfor the mighty and the rich bankers, who, in turn, must\nlearn to live within the rules of their own creation, with\nregard to taking commercial risks which go hand in hand\nwith the pursuit of gain. A return to their original\nmandates \u2014 to promote balanced development, in the\ncase of the World Bank, and to enforce monetary and\nfiscal responsibility in all countries, irrespective of their\nstatus in the global economy \u2014 is a first priority. Reform\nmust include a re-evaluation of the governance\narrangements at the Bank and the Fund through a\nrealignment and reallocation of quotas and shareholdings\nthat take into account the changed structure of the world\neconomy. New arrangements for governance must\nrecognize the growing clout of the newly emerging\neconomies that now contribute to a rising share of global\noutput, to trade and to capital flows.\nThe debt millstone weighs heavily on the poor. This\nburden must be eased, especially for the poorest nations of\nAfrica and Asia. Malaysia hopes that effective actions will\nbe taken forthwith, taking into account decisions made at\nthe forty-ninth session of the General Assembly on finding\na durable solution to the external-debt problem of\ndeveloping countries.\nWhile bilateral debts extended by donor countries have\nover the years been restructured and rescheduled \u2014 though\nwith humiliating conditions imposed by the Paris Club of\ncreditors \u2014 multilateral institutions, led by the World\nBank, have steadfastly refused to consider restructuring debt\nowed to them. The World Bank continues to increase its\nprofit levels and amasses reserves which today stand in\nexcess of $16 billion. Why are these reserves, built from\npayments by developing countries, not used for debt relief?\nAnd why do we allow the intransigence of one or two\ncountries to preclude the issuance of special drawing rights\nby the International Monetary Fund? These and other issues\nmust feature in a reform of the Bretton Woods institutions.\nThe conclusion of the Uruguay Round and the\nestablishment of the World Trade Organization offer a\nglimmer of hope for rule-based trading relationships.\nMalaysia applauds and welcomes the underlying principles,\nand we pledge ourselves to play by the mutually agreed\nundertakings.\nRegrettably, powerful trading nations threaten, through\nunilateral actions, to undermine the carefully negotiated\nagreements. The deliberate creation of regional trading\nblocs, the introduction of managed trade and the attempts\nto link human rights, environmental considerations and\nlabour codes to trade are major threats which, if\nimplemented, would dim the hope of a free environment for\ntrade. We reject such attempts. The new protectionism will\nreturn the world to a bygone era when trade wars led to\nmilitary confrontations.\nFinally, we have the new threats with the advent of\nthe information age. The poor countries have long suffered\nfrom biased reporting by the world media, controlled by the\ndeveloped world. Now the computer network created for\nthe spread of knowledge and information has become\npolluted by the irresponsible dissemination of filth through\nit. Someone is making money from this filth.\nThe world community must find a way to keep out\nsuch filth and to provide for legal action to be taken against\nits purveyors by aggrieved countries, even when they\nbroadcast from outside their borders. They should be\nallowed to bring these miscreants to trial in the aggrieved\ncountries, under their laws. After all, we have already had\nmany instances of extraterritorial application of the laws\nof some countries without so much as a by-your-leave.\nFreedom of information is fine, but even in this age\nof freedom we cannot allow morals to be completely\nundermined in order to enrich the merchants of porn and\nfilth.\nWhen all is said and done, we still have to admit\nthat the United Nations is the only truly multinational\nOrganization where the voices of small nations can be\nheard. We support the United Nations, but we must\ncorrect the tendency to make it an instrument of the rich\nand the powerful. The United Nations must stand on the\nside of the collective needs of people and nations in order\nto serve all mankind.\n"

        "file_text": "Just last June we celebrated the fiftieth\nanniversary of the signing of the San Francisco Charter,\nwhich to this day still governs our Organization. On that\noccasion, all Member States were able to take stock of\nthe road we have travelled in 50 years of endeavouring to\ntransform our planet Earth into one enamoured of peace,\nfreedom and justice.\nNot so long ago from this rostrum, through\nMr. Ange-F\u00e9lix Patass\u00e9, President of the Central African\nRepublic, my country pondered the scope and significance\nof the important events that are continually shaking the\nworld and touching the conscience of one and all.\nMy country, at that time, looked forward to a new\nera of peace and security such as once existed in the\nGarden of Eden, and we welcomed the idea of fair and\nfruitful cooperation, especially for the benefit of the least\ndeveloped countries such as the Central African Republic.\nBut what do we see today?\nIt is a tradition for the United Nations to meet in the\nGeneral Assembly to reflect on the way in which it\n16\n\n\nintends to assume its responsibilities in guiding the fate of\nmankind, but there can be no doubt that this collective\nendeavour can only be pursued in the light of the objectives\nwe have set \u2014 that is to say, international security and\nsustainable development. And so, this session, more than\nany other, is of special importance for my country, the\nCentral African Republic, because our universal\nOrganization will need to ask itself whether it has fully\nachieved its goals.\nI am therefore very pleased to convey to the Assembly\nthe best wishes of His Excellency, the President of the\nCentral African Republic, Ange-F\u00e9lix Patass\u00e9, the Head of\nState, for complete success. Together with all of the Central\nAfrican people, he places deep confidence and unshakable\nfaith in the future of our Organization. I feel certain that the\ngreat personal abilities of Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral will\nenable us to look forward to the complete success of our\nwork. To Mr. Amara Essy, the outgoing President, I wish\nto convey my sincere congratulations for the dynamism,\ncompetence and effectiveness with which he so brilliantly\nconducted the work of the last session of the General\nAssembly, thereby doing credit to all of Africa. Allow me\nalso to express again my sincere congratulations to the\nSecretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for the\noutstanding competence, constant dedication and unmatched\nefficiency with which he is directing the work of our\nOrganization.\nSince the end of the cold war, all nations have rightly\nlooked forward to an international environment that is more\nconducive to cooperation and dialogue than to confrontation\nas was the case in the past. The tireless efforts of the\ninternational community to achieve this have been most\npraiseworthy despite the difficulties encountered in some\ncases in achieving peace and security, which are\nindispensable in the economic, social and cultural\ndevelopment of nations.\nIn this regard, we should therefore, once again,\nexpress thanks to the international community, which took\npart in the emergence of a true democracy in the Central\nAfrican Republic, a democracy whose day-to-day practice\nis acknowledged beyond its own borders. Strengthened by\nthat achievement, my country is practising a policy of\npreventive diplomacy and development and has just\ncompleted the first phase of this change, notably through\nthe restoration of public confidence and establishing\ndemocratic institutions, re-establishing fiscal health and\ncontrol, health measures, training and education and by the\nadoption and promulgation, on 14 January 1995, of a new\nand truly democratic constitution. The Constitution, which\nwas adopted by an overwhelming majority, introduces a\npolicy of decentralization, with its corollary of\nregionalization aimed at involving the population in the\ntasks of development and at mobilizing all local resources\nfor the enhancement of the standard of living of the rural\nmasses.\nThe second phase of the programme pertains to other\nmajor challenges such as the regional development, the\nopening up of the country from its land-locked status both\ninternally and externally; agriculture and livestock-\nbreeding; the development of natural resources; and\nagricultural and forest management.\nAll of these ambitious plans can be carried out only\nif there is a climate of confidence and peace in our\nsubregion \u2014 Central Africa. My country has fully\nunderstood this and has pursued a policy of good-\nneighbourliness to bring about peace both within and\noutside the Central African Republic. Thus, we\nconsistently contribute, through preventive diplomacy, to\nefforts to prevent international conflicts.\nA land-locked country whose present Government is\nburdened with a heavy and multifaceted legacy, the\nCentral African Republic is constantly searching for\nlogistical means to support the economic development\nefforts in order to promote an increase in production and\nstrengthen the fight against poverty.\nThat is why the future programmes of structural\nadjustment should necessarily include social dimensions\nbecause, as has been stated by our Prime Minister, our\nHead of Government, the Central African Republic cannot\ncreate new social outcasts, new disadvantaged classes\nresulting from these structural reforms, which are often\nvery restrictive.\nAt a time when the efforts of the international\ncommunity are being speeded up in order to relax\ntensions in the world, it is more specifically in the low-\nincome and poor countries that we are increasingly seeing\narmed conflicts producing massive destruction.\nWitness the case of Somalia where, after the\nwithdrawal of the United Nations Operation in Somalia\n(UNOSOM), the acute problem of repatriating and\nresettling some 500,000 refugees and 400,000 displaced\npersons calls for the efforts of all of the international\ncommunity.\n17\n\n\nWitness also the case of Burundi where the\nsituation is of concern to my Government, which constantly\nencourages that neighbouring Government to secure the\npeace.\nHowever, my delegation commends the Joint\nDeclaration of Peace signed between the President of the\nRepublic and the Prime Minister, which, I am sure, will\nmake it possible to reduce the tension and the threat to\nsecurity in Burundi, where problems of humanitarian\nassistance to refugees are becoming a source of constant\nconcern to all of the international community.\nIn Rwanda, the machinery of the Organization of\nAfrican Unity for the prevention, management and\nsettlement of conflicts will become fully operative with a\nview to bringing to an end the many sufferings of the\npeople of Rwanda.\nOn the one hand, my delegation encourages a return\nto normal democratic life in that kindred nation and on the\nother the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda\n(UNAMIR) and the international community as a whole are\nurged to become even more concerned with the question of\nsecurity and with the questions of refugees and displaced\npersons.\nAlong this line of thinking, my delegation highly\nappreciates the farsightedness of Angola\u2019s President,\nEduardo dos Santos, and of his brother, Mr. Jonas Savimbi\nof UNITA, who, thanks to the commendable mediation of\nPresident El Hadj Omar Bongo of Gabon, agreed\ndefinitively to conclude peace through the Franceville\nagreement.\nMy delegation is concerned at the situation in Sierra\nLeone, where war has been raging for four years, with great\nloss of life and property.\nHowever, we welcome the positive turn of events in\nLiberia, where all of the armed factions have understood\nthe need to lay down their weapons and to sit down around\nthe table to negotiate a peace \u2014 for this war, which has\nlasted all too long, will have known no victors and no\nvanquished.\nThe Central African Republic welcomes the fact that\nour Organization has been able to affect the course of some\nevents that were major sources of concern to the\ninternational community. Despite the many situations of\ntension that are sometimes difficult to control, we must\nwelcome the fact that in the two years preceding this\nfiftieth anniversary of the United Nations we have\nwitnessed Africa\u2019s complete political liberation, the end\nof apartheid and the gradual introduction of democracy,\nnotwithstanding isolated setbacks from time to time.\nWe would cite in particular the Middle East, where\nsignificant progress has been achieved in the peace\nprocess in the region and where real, praiseworthy efforts\nare being made daily by the parties concerned, despite\noccasional difficulties encountered in implementing the\ncommitments that have been entered into.\nThis gives me an opportunity to congratulate the\npeoples of Israel and Palestine on their persistent efforts,\nwhich were crowned with success by the signature, on 29\nSeptember at Washington, of agreements pertaining to the\nsecond phase of that peace process.\nCongratulations should also be extended in respect\nof Chechnya, where the Peace Agreement recently\nconcluded between the parties will contribute to\nconsolidating a true and lasting peace in the region.\nWith regard to the situation in Kashmir, we call\nupon our friends in India and Pakistan to come to an\nunderstanding and work out a negotiated solution to the\nproblem, in the name of justice.\nTurning to the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina,\nthe Central African Government hails the praiseworthy\nefforts of France and the United States to calm troubled\nwaters. The international community too should exert\nevery effort to restore peace and security to Bosnia and\nHerzegovina, where ethnic, nationalistic or religious\ntendencies pose a dangerous threat to the tranquillity and\nstability of that part of Europe.\nNo one is immune to these ancient sources of\nconflict, and the Central African Republic sympathizes\nwith the countries and peoples enduring such tragic trials.\nIn a few days the United Nations will celebrate its\nfiftieth anniversary, without having brought into being the\nlong-sought new world economic order. The countries of\nthe North continue to be powerful while those of the\nSouth continue to mark time with an official development\nassistance that has declined from 0.38 per cent in 1980 to\n0.33 per cent in 1993. Some donors are no longer meeting\ntheir commitments, so Africa continues to live through a\ntime of poverty, natural disasters, migrations and all kinds\nof other misfortunes. My delegation therefore believes\nthat trade must be urgently liberalized through a\n18\n\n\nsubstantial reduction in tariffs and other trade barriers,\nthrough the elimination of discriminatory treatment in\ninternational trade relations and by stimulating world\neconomic growth and sustainable development in the\ninterests of all countries, the developing countries in\nparticular.\nIndeed, the entry into force on 1 January 1995 of the\nAgreement establishing the World Trade Organization could\nnot have been more timely, for were it to be fully\nimplemented it would solve a great many of the problems\nof the land-locked developing countries, the Central African\nRepublic among them. And, as President Ange-F\u00e9lix\nPatass\u00e9 said here last year,\n\u201cWhat we need to save the continent is a real\nMarshall Plan, because at the present time multilateral\nand bilateral assistance remain insufficient to promote\nsustained and lasting growth.\u201d (Official Records of the\nGeneral Assembly, Forty-ninth Session, Plenary\nMeetings, 19th meeting, p. 5)\nMy delegation is among those that would strongly\nurge the most powerful Member States to commit\nthemselves to working towards the achievement of the goals\nset forth in the Charter in order to ensure that the world\ndoes not drift ineluctably towards chaos and disaster.\nFinally, with regard to the advancement of democracy,\nthe efforts of the United Nations will never be sufficient so\nlong as the Republic of China on Taiwan is not admitted as\na Member of this prestigious institution.\nAs His Excellency Mr. Ange-F\u00e9lix Patass\u00e9, President\nof the Central African Republic, noted in his appeal last\nyear, under the Charter of the United Nations there are no\nlarge nations and there are no small nations, for all must\ncontribute to peace and universal progress towards a just,\nhumane and democratic world.\nDemocracy and respect for fundamental human rights\nhave and will have no meaning so long as the hard-working\npopulation of the Republic of China on Taiwan is not\nrepresented here in the Assembly. In this connection it\nwould be fitting to take into account the precedents that\nexist with regard to the parallel representation of States in\nthe United Nations.\nWe would recall the following words of the President\nof the General Assembly at the opening meeting of this\nfiftieth session of the Assembly on 19 September:\n\u201c... the United Nations has ceased to be an\nintergovernmental organization with a limited\nmembership and has become the only international\norganization that is universal. Efforts must be made\nto ensure that all States that are not yet Members\nshould seek to be admitted in the near future. For\nthe same reason, the most serious penalty imposed\non a Member State should never be expulsion, but\nrather suspension, for the United Nations must, as a\nmatter of principle, include all the world\u2019s\ncountries.\u201d (Official Records of the General\nAssembly, Fiftieth Session, Plenary Meetings, 1st\nmeeting, p. 7)\nThe Government of the Central African Republic\nalso believes that dedication to international peace and\nsecurity should prohibit our engaging in any form of\nintimidation or confrontation that can damage\nrapprochement among States or, especially, weaken\nsecurity. This requires the highly desirable admission of\nthe Republic of China to the United Nations.\nWith regard to the restructuring of the Organization\nat the end of its half century of life, the Government of\nthe Central African Republic is firmly convinced that the\nonly remedy to the delays experienced in intervening in\nor contributing to the resolution of tensions or open\nconflicts is to be found in a decentralization of the\nsystem. That decentralization should begin with the\ndemocratic and equitable representation of Member States\nin the Security Council and at all levels. We regard this\nas the only approach capable of taking proper account of\ngeopolitical and economic specificities.\nIn any event, this session should provide an\nopportunity to draft a new organizational chart for the\nUnited Nations and to adapt the Organization\u2019s structures\nand functions in the light of our stocktaking and relevant\ncomments by Member States.\nFor its part, the Central African Republic reserves\nthe right to speak out in the debates in the Committees\nand during the ceremonies commemorating the fiftieth\nanniversary of the United Nations. Whatever the case,\neverything should contribute to make the twenty-first\ncentury the century of Africa.\nIn conclusion, the Central African Republic firmly\nbelieves that only respect for and observance of the spirit\nand letter of the Charter of the United Nations will truly\nenable us to solve the problems that confront us as this\ncentury draws to a close. We hope that this session will\n19\n\n\nmark a new stage on the way to effective cooperation for\nprogress and peace for the international community as a\nwhole.\n"

        "file_text": "I have the honour to\nmake the following statement on behalf of His Excellency\nMr. A. S. M. Mostafizur Rahman, the Foreign Minister of\nBangladesh, who, though present in New York, is unable\nto attend this Assembly for reasons of health.\n\u201cI warmly congratulate Mr. Diogo Freitas do\nAmaral on his unanimous election as President of\nthis historic fiftieth anniversary session of the United\nNations General Assembly. His election is a tribute,\nnot only to him personally, but to his great country,\nPortugal. I am confident that he will do great honour\nto the legacy of his predecessor, His Excellency Mr.\nAmara Essy of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, to whom we owe deep\nappreciation, not least for his sponsorship of the\nestablishment, on 14 September, of the Open-ended\nHigh-level Working Group on the strengthening of\nthe United Nations system.\n\u201cLet me also commend our Secretary-General,\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for his dedicated and\nuntiring efforts to promote the effectiveness of this\nworld body.\n\u201cIn this fiftieth anniversary year, the United\nNations has reached a critical turning-point in\nappraising its past and in charting a viable course for\nits future, based on the renewed commitment, trust\nand consensus of its Member States.\n\u201cThe world of today is obviously quite different\nfrom that of 1945. Then, the United Nations, in the\nwake of the devastating global conflagration that\nwas the Second World War, was called upon\nto save succeeding generations from the\nscourge of war'.\nIn the wake of the cold war, the United Nations is\nnow called upon to consolidate and secure an\nuncertain and amorphous peace.\n13\n\n\n\u201cThe end of the cold war had fuelled hopes that\nthe United Nations, freed from nuclear and ideological\nconfrontation, would devote its full attention to\nbuilding a peaceful and more equitable world; tackle\nthe challenge of world poverty; advance regional\nconflicts to resolution; distribute the benefits of peace\ndividends; and move towards fulfilling the unrealized\npremises of the Charter, especially with regard to\ncollective security.\n\u201cThese hopes were belied. The world of the\n1990s is more dangerous in many ways than the cold-\nwar era. There is greater tension in more places, a\nfurther degradation in the quality of life and many\nmore complex issues of law and ethics, management\nand practical cooperation. Negative impulses have\nassumed a variety of dimensions within States,\nbetween groups of States and globally.\n\u201cWithin States, nations have come under siege\nfrom multiple threats, retarding their capacity to act\neffectively or independently. Political instability has\nfuelled an economic breakdown, and economic\nbackwardness has created political upheaval in a\nnever-ending vicious circle. Long-suppressed national,\nethnic and cultural rivalries have resurfaced,\nunleashing bigotry, extremism and violence. They\nhave generated powerful centrifugal forces that have\nnot only threatened to but actually breached\nestablished boundaries. Demagogues, political\nseparatists and fringe groups are being encouraged and\nsupported by external forces to challenge the\nlegitimacy of Governments and their capacity to\ngovern.\n\u201cOn another plane, fears are surfacing that the\nbipolar world of the past 50 years could now assume\na North-South configuration, not between opposing\npolitical and social systems, but between rich and poor\nnations. Anxiety is increasing in the South that their\ninterests are being marginalized; that development\nresources are being diverted or are dwindling; that\ntheir potential to act as partners in revitalizing the\nworld economy is being ignored; and that new\nconstraints and conditionalities are being selectively\nimposed.\n\u201cGlobally, new forces are emerging that no State\nacting alone can control but which threaten the\nlegitimacy of all States. Pollution, eco-damage,\ndevastating diseases, speculative dealers and money-\nlaunderers, organized crime, arms smugglers and\nterrorists have eaten into all societies, vitiated values\nand crippled development. Rapid technological and\ntransnational processes are reducing the ability of\nStates to act on their own or to regulate domestic\npolicies affecting the movement of goods, services,\nlabour and capital. Tensions over resources are a\ncase in point. Forty per cent of the world\u2019s\npopulation live on the banks of rivers or lakes\nshared by two or more countries. Dams and\nirrigation projects cause serious tension and actual\nconflict.\n\u201cIronically, at a time when the United Nations\nis in greater demand then ever before and its\ncapacity stretched to the limit, a serious campaign of\nvilification has been launched against it. It has been\ncharged with mismanagement, inefficiency,\ncorruption, excessive costs and over-staffing. Its\ngrowing membership, in the wake of decolonization,\nhas been termed irresponsible, obstructive and\ndivisive, and it has been accused of indiscriminately\nexercising the so-called tyranny of the majority'.\nThis tarnished image, propagated by a few but\nrejected by many, has left deep scars that have\ndiminished the United Nations.\n\u201cIt is against this background that I now turn to\nsome of the priority concerns facing Bangladesh.\n\u201cFirst and foremost is the financial crisis that\nthreatens to undermine the United Nations. The\nSecretary-General has declared that the United\nNations is already technically bankrupt. The\nfinancial situation has to be placed on an adequate\nand sustainable footing and its deterioration urgently\nreversed.\n\u201cBangladesh has consistently held that the\ncurrent financial difficulties were primarily a cash-\nflow imbalance due mainly to the failure by some\nMember States, in particular some major\ncontributors, to fulfil their Charter obligations in full\nand on time. These Member States must give\npractical effect to their commitment to the United\nNations by paying their assessed contribution in full\nand on time, including all arrears. Capacity to pay\nremains the fundamental tenet in determining\nMember States\u2019 contributions. To proceed on the\nbasis that simply a revision of the scales of\nassessment would provide a panacea to all financial\nills is simplistic and misleading. It will neither\nchange the aggregate amount of revenues available\n14\n\n\nto the United Nations nor guarantee better cash flows\nor prompt payment. While it is likely that for some\ntime to come the bulk of United Nations revenues will\ncome from assessments and voluntary contributions,\nBangladesh supports exploring the possibility of\nproviding independent revenue sources for the United\nNations through various international transactions and\ntaxation.\n\u201cBangladesh supports the reform efforts that have\nbeen initiated to revitalize and restructure the main\norgans of the United Nations and to achieve a more\ndynamic interrelationship for them. We intend to\nparticipate actively and constructively in the open-\nended, high-level Working Group on United Nations\nreform which is to review the Secretary-General\u2019s\nAgendas for Peace and Development, respectively, and\nthe report submitted by Member States and\nindependent commissions. While we support the idea\nthat the broad objective of the reform is to strengthen\nthe response and efficiency of the United Nations\nsystem in promoting the goals of development,\nsecurity, justice and equality and to improve\naccountability and responsibility, we reject pursuit of\nreforms of a purely mechanical or managerial nature.\nIt seems ironic that the yardstick for determining what\nshould or should not be pruned has been applied\nselectively in the past, with peace-keeping operations\napproved by the Security Council proliferating at the\ncost of development programmes. Catchwords of cost-\neffectiveness, financial stringency, trimming\nmanagement, redundancy, waste and inefficiency seem\nintended more to constrain control and reduce the\nUnited Nations role than improve its capability of\nresponding to the needs of the international\ncommunity.\n\u201cOur position with regard to Security Council\nreform has concentrated more on strengthening the\ntransparency and efficiency of the Council\u2019s mandate\nthan on enlargement of the permanent membership.\nWhile we fully support enlargement of the overall size\nof the Council to reflect the growth in membership of\nthe United Nations, we believe that an increase in\npermanent members should be considered only on the\nbasis of the most stringent criteria, and on the basis of\nglobal recognition and consensus. We are opposed in\nprinciple to creating new centres of privilege or\ndistinctions that can distort the principle of sovereign\nequality.\n\u201cBangladesh welcomes the consensus achieved\nin the outcomes of the major conferences in Cairo,\nCopenhagen and Beijing on population, social\ndevelopment and women, which supplement the\nresults of the Earth Summit, the children\u2019s Summit\nand the Vienna Conference on Human Rights.\nTogether they have forged a meaningful and\ncomprehensive social agenda that has reinforced\npoverty eradication and people-centred sustainable\ndevelopment. It must be emphasized, however, that\nsocial development is dependent on economic\ngrowth, which can be fuelled only in an international\neconomic environment which is conducive to it.\n\u201cThe global society is only as strong as its\nweakest link. The plight of the least developed\ncountries assumes special relevance and importance\nin this 1995 mid-term review year of the least\ndeveloped countries\u2019 Programme of Action for the\n1990s. Their continuing crises calls for immediate\nremedial action especially in increasing official\ndevelopment assistance, writing off debts and\nassuring greater trade access on preferential terms.\n\u201cBangladesh has followed closely and supports\nstrongly the evolution and development of the\nSecretary-General\u2019s Agenda for Peace. We agree\nwith the priority emphasis that has been placed on\npreventive diplomacy and conflict-prevention\nmeasures and recognize especially their cost-\neffectiveness. We believe that regional efforts and\nregional agencies should be utilized more frequently\nand their capacity strengthened. Bangladesh has\nactively contributed to the peace-keeping mission of\nthe United Nations and has always favourably\nresponded in providing troops. We have closely\nexamined and positively responded to the request for\nthe provision of stand-by troops. We are also\nfavourably inclined to support a rapid-reaction\ncapability for providing humanitarian assistance.\n\u201cAt plenary meetings the General Assembly\nwill have occasion to address in greater depth some\nof the most pressing and critical political issues on\nthe agenda, including the ongoing conflict in Bosnia\nand Herzegovina, in which prospects for a\nnegotiated solution have considerably brightened on\nthe basis of the Contact Group\u2019s Peace Plan and the\nGeneva Declaration of Principles of\n8 September 1995; the continuing peace efforts in\nthe Middle East and the new interim agreement\nbetween Israel and Palestinian leaders as a follow-up\n15\n\n\nto the Oslo Agreement; the status of democracy and\nhuman rights in Haiti; and the review of the work of\ninternational tribunals established in former\nYugoslavia and in Rwanda. Given the fluidity and\nrapid evolution of events in some of these crises, it is\nour hope to comment on them at length during\nconsideration of the specific item.\n\u201cLet me say in conclusion that there is no doubt\nin our mind that the United Nations remains the only\nforum where we can meet the challenges of the future\nby drawing upon our combined solidarity and\nwillingness to confront them together. Bangladesh\nreaffirms its firm and unwavering commitment to this\nworld body and the pursuit of its great goals.\u201d\n"

        "file_text": "Forty-five years\nago, in 1950, a destructive hurricane battered my island\ncountry. It destroyed our small homes, levelled our\nsugar-cane fields, left death and destruction in its path and\nmade Antigua and Barbuda a destitute colony. It was the\nvery worst hurricane that Antigua and Barbuda had ever\nexperienced. Several hurricanes were to strike us after\n1950, including Hurricane Hugo in 1989.\nThirty-five days ago, however, Hurricane Luis visited\nits fury on my small island developing State. For more than\n48 hours, its mighty gusts blew the roofs from thousands of\nhomes, schools, churches, government buildings, hotels. Its\nsustained winds, exceeding 160 miles per hour, uprooted\nmany of Antigua and Barbuda\u2019s old trees, decapitated\nthousands of stately palms, and deposited the leaves and\nbroken limbs of our evergreen trees everywhere. The\nswollen sea sent surf and sand swirling into the lobbies and\nbeachfront rooms of our hotels \u2014 the source of our\nnational income. Sheets of rain, carried relentlessly by the\nwinds of Hurricane Luis, made everything wet and\neveryone weary. Our electricity and telephone systems were\ndestroyed when thousands of poles succumbed to the fury\nof its winds, snapping cables and smashing equipment as\nthey fell to the earth. Our fishermen lost their boats, our\nfarmers lost their fields, and our people lost some of our\ncourage. Nature appeared to have declared war on us.\nWhen the ferocious winds of Hurricane Luis subsided, 48\nhours after landfall, the verdant, lush, tropical vegetation\nthat had drawn millions to our shores over the years had\ndisappeared; our islands were a mere caricature of their\nprevious glory. The engine of our economy has stalled;\ntourism, the source of Antigua and Barbuda\u2019s income, has\nbeen severely compromised and we may not be able to\nrestart the industry for several weeks. Fishermen and\nfarmers, storekeepers and hotel workers are now without\nincomes; thousands are jobless. The threat of creeping\npoverty hangs over a people that, 14 years ago, at the end\nof 150 years of colonialism, had started to enjoy an\nimproved standard of living, higher than ever recorded in\nour 350-year modern history. Forty-eight hours after\nHurricane Luis had traversed the Caribbean, the\nvulnerability of small island States was again made\nmanifest. Dominica, Guadeloupe, Saint Kitts and Nevis,\nSaint Maarten, Anguilla and Montserrat all suffered a fate\nsimilar to Antigua and Barbuda\u2019s. Coming on the heels of\nLuis, Hurricane Marilyn would batter the island of Saint\nThomas. Small island States and territories, thriving and\nrobust on one day, were paralysed and incapacitated\nwithin 48 hours.\nDevelopment is not sustainable if 17 hurricanes are\nto trample through our region each year; yet climate\nexperts have given us notice that the phenomenon known\nas global warming will generate a greater number of\n\u201cextreme weather events\u201d, more ferocious and monstrous\nin each succeeding year. Hurricane Luis was 700 miles\nwide; its wind gusts reached almost 200 miles per hour;\nand its sustained winds exceeded 160 miles per hour. It\nwas unique in its size and devilish in its fury.\nThere may never be sufficient evidence to link the\nglobal warming phenomenon to any single hurricane; but\nthe pattern is evident. I draw the Assembly\u2019s attention to\na study entitled \u201cConfronting Climate Change\u201d, published\nby the Cambridge University Press. In it we read:\n\u201cIf global temperatures continue to rise in\naccordance with current predictions, increases in the\nnumber and severity of storms, floods, droughts, and\nother short-term weather extremes may be one of the\nearliest observed and most dramatic effects.\u201d\n8\n\n\nCarbon dioxide emissions, caused by the burning of\npetroleum, coal, wood and gas, since the start of the\nindustrial revolution in Western Europe 200 years ago, have\nbegun to warm the planet and to place the survival of small\nislands in jeopardy.\nThree years ago, at the Earth Summit in Rio, Brazil,\nthe nations of the world had their representatives sign the\nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.\nI read from the Convention:\n\u201cThe ultimate objective of this Convention and\nany related legal instruments that the Conference of\nthe Parties may adopt is to achieve ... stabilization of\ngreenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a\nlevel that would prevent dangerous [man-made]\ninterference with the climate system.\u201d (article 2)\nEarlier this year, the nations of the world met in\nBerlin, Germany, to consider a proposal matching this\nobjective and linked to this Convention; it was put forward\nby 41 vulnerable small island States. Many industrialized\ncountries, guilty of emitting into our Earth\u2019s atmosphere\nbillions of tons of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse\ngases, would not then agree to any reduction in these gases.\nWe cannot stand idly by, experience the deadly effects of\nglobal warming, and be satisfied with promises. Harmful\nproduction, wasteful consumption and dangerous disposal\npatterns continue to characterize the behaviour of the largest\nindustrialized States. They sow the wind; small island\nStates reap the whirlwind. In the South Pacific, where\ndefenceless small island States predominate, another large\nindustrialized State chooses to explode several nuclear\nbombs, euphemistically called \u201cnuclear devices\u201d. We\nremain opposed to the testing of all nuclear weapons. If\nthose bombs are as harmless and as safe as that State\nclaims, then why not test them on its own soil? The same\ndisregard for the weak and small States holds for the\ntransboundary movement of hazardous wastes, especially\nshipments of nuclear wastes through the Caribbean Sea. We\nare dreadfully afraid of an accident and equally fearful of\nthe impact of news of an accident on our development.\nWe have done much of what is required of us to\nensure that our development proceeds apace and with few\nsetbacks. Evidence of our intelligent use of our meagre\nresource base is captured in the annual Human\nDevelopment Report published by the United Nations\nDevelopment Programme (UNDP). For example, my\nCaribbean country shares a common currency with five\nother small island States and one territory. We call it the\nEastern Caribbean dollar. Its value has remained unchanged\nsince 1976. For almost two decades, self-discipline and\nprobity have been the hallmark of the Eastern Caribbean\nCentral Bank.\nHurricane Luis has severely disabled four of the\nseven economies which share the currency \u2014 Dominica,\nSaint Kitts and Nevis, Montserrat, and Antigua and\nBarbuda. And unfair attempts by Central American\nbanana producers to eliminate the English-speaking\nCaribbean\u2019s 3 per cent of the world market share threaten\nto undo the other three economies \u2014 those of Grenada,\nSaint Lucia, and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. The\nEastern Caribbean dollar (EC$) can only remain stable if\nour economies earn foreign exchange. Unfair trade, just\nlike hurricanes, can devastate our vulnerable small island\nStates\u2019 economies and make the earning of foreign\nexchange impossible.\nWe share a currency, and we share a university. The\nUniversity of the West Indies is soon to celebrate its\nfiftieth year of continued existence, having graduated an\noverwhelming number of professionals from the 17 States\nand territories of the English-speaking Caribbean which\ncall it their own. This year my Government provided 73\nscholarships to the most deserving youth in Antigua and\nBarbuda, with amounts ranging from $EC 54,000 to\n$10,000 each. We intend to build the national capacity to\nensure that sustainable human development is more than\na wish.\nWe share a currency, we share a university, we share\na judiciary. The Eastern Caribbean Court of Appeals has\ndemonstrated that justice and cost-effectiveness can be\ntwin handmaids of small island States. Eight of us also\ncombine our national defence forces to form a Regional\nSecurity System (RSS). Though small by any standard,\nwe have succeeded in increasing our defences\nexponentially, while containing defence costs\nsignificantly. The recent invasion of the Comoros Islands\nby a mercenary band which took its President hostage and\nseized power there serves as a reminder of the security\nconstraints facing small island States.\nOur efforts at regional collaboration extend beyond\na common currency, a university, a judiciary and a\ndefence force. You have recently pronounced, Sir, on the\nsuccess of \u201cinterlocking, regional building blocks\u201d in\nEurope. Thirty years ago, before many of our Caribbean\ncountries were independent and free, we commenced that\nprocess by creating, in 1965, the Caribbean Free Trade\nAgreement (Carita). Carita has metamorphosed into the\nCaribbean Community and Common Market (Caricom),\n9\n\n\nand earlier this year the Association of Caribbean States\n(ACS) was formed by all the States and territories which\nshare the Caribbean Sea. More than 200 million people\nform this new market. Antigua and Barbuda has done much\nof what is required of it to achieve sustainable\ndevelopment. The results of our many and varied efforts\ncannot bear fruit if, year after year, hurricanes destroy that\nwhich we have created. We look to the United Nations to\nhelp in persuading the industrialized countries to adopt the\nToronto targets, as a first step in our common effort to\nensure the survival of this planet which we all share.\nWe have faith in the United Nations because the\nimage of the United Nations in my country and region is\npositive and good. When a volcano threatened to erupt on\nthe neighbouring island of Montserrat and my country\noffered safe refuge to half of that island\u2019s population, the\nUnited Nations Resident Representative in Barbados led a\nUnited Nations team of experts to Antigua; they came to\ndetermine how the United Nations could assist. Following\nthe devastation wrought by Hurricane Luis, the United\nNations Development Programme Barbados country office,\nthe Department of Humanitarian Affairs, the World Health\nOrganization and several other United Nations agencies and\nbodies quickly launched an international appeal to help us\nreconstruct. The most distinguished citizen of Antigua and\nBarbuda, His Excellency the Governor-General, was also\nquick to agree to be the Chairman of the UN 50 National\nCommittee. This willingness serves as a measure of the\nhigh regard in which the United Nations is held.\nMy small island State can also boast that it has paid\nits contribution to the United Nations in full; we owe no\narrears, despite the burden which membership dues and\npeace-keeping operations impose on our limited resources.\nWe can only encourage the wealthy and the powerful to\npay their obligations. For us the United Nations is more\nthan a symbol; more, too, than an instrument for the narrow\nnational interests of Antigua and Barbuda. For us, the\nUnited Nations is the guarantor of international law, an\nagent for international peace and security, a catalyst for\ndevelopment and prosperity.\nThe Secretary-General has noted that the greatest\nthreats to peace are adverse social and economic conditions\nwithin States and among States. As a consequence, during\nthe past three years the international community has\nconvened six global conferences to plot the course of\nhuman history in the coming century and beyond.\nCollectively, the United Nations Conference on\nEnvironment and Development, the World Conference on\nHuman Rights, the First Global Conference on the\nSustainable Development of Small Island Developing\nStates, the International Conference on Population and\nDevelopment, the World Summit for Social Development,\nand the Fourth World Conference on Women collectively\ncreate a multifaceted framework of action; this will be\ncompleted by the Second United Nations Conference on\nHuman Settlements (Habitat II), in 1996. These\nconferences act as a guide to Member States as they seek\nto address the challenges inherent in the interrelated areas\nof peace and development.\nStates must now seek to implement the several\nProgrammes of Action. We are particularly gratified by\nthe extent to which the last two conferences build on the\npositions which we took at the Global Conference on the\nSustainable Development of Small Island Developing\nStates. In particular, my delegation would wish to\nemphasize the importance of empowering women. The\ninclusion of women in the councils of the Government of\nAntigua and Barbuda, and at senior levels in the public\nservice and the private sector, gives credence to the\nearnestness of our commitment to the advancement of\nwomen. Without the full and equal participation of\nwomen, sustainable development cannot be achieved.\nIn congratulating you on your election to your high\noffice, Mr. President, my country is very cognizant of the\nrole which Vasco da Gama played in bringing distant\nworlds together. Today we find in you the same foresight\nand imagination displayed by your most well-known\ncitizen. These qualities are necessary for leading this\nhistoric fiftieth session of the United Nations General\nAssembly. We congratulate Foreign Minister Mr. Amara\nEssy, the President of the forty-ninth session, on his\nsterling stewardship of this Organization.\nAt several junctures in its 50-year history, the\npurpose and goals of this United Nations have been\nredefined. In 1945, following the end of the Second\nWorld War, the United Nations was created as a policy\ninstrument of the victorious Powers to prevent further\nlarge-scale destruction and massive loss of life. For more\nthan a decade the United Nations was focused on\npreventing a third world war.\nIn 1957 a little country in Africa twisted the tail of\nits colonial master, and Kwame Nkrumah emerged from\njail in Ghana to lead his country and to redefine the\npurpose of this United Nations. When the United Nations\nwas created in 1945, colonialism defined the relations\nbetween the powerful and the weak, between Europe and\nmuch of Asia and Africa. The adoption of resolution\n10\n\n\n1514 (XV) in 1960 turned the United Nations into a policy\ninstrument to end colonialism.\nFor more than a decade after 1960 the focus of the\nUnited Nations was to destroy colonialism and apartheid.\nMy small island nation did not even enter into the\nconsciousness of the founders in 1945. We are the\nbeneficiaries of the struggle to end colonialism. The\npresence here of small island States is mere happenstance,\nsince few expected that there could be any such creation as\na micro-State, seated in this Hall as an equal of the\nmightiest and the largest States. In that regard, we would\nwish to welcome the island State of Palau to membership\nin this Organization.\nBut by 1970 the United Nations had begun to address\ninequities in international trade and development, and the\nsearch for a more just international economic order\ndisplaced the concerns of 1945. In the 1970s, also, the cold\nwar exploded. Regional wars in southern Africa, Central\nAmerica and the Middle East were fuelled by the two\nsuper-Powers. By the end of the 1980s the constraints\nimposed by the cold war and the demands on our resources\nfor peace-keeping made the United Nations a much more\ncomplicated instrument than it had ever been.\nToday our United Nations must struggle with the\nunfinished business of earlier decades. Small island States,\nin the 1990s, aware that their very existence is at stake,\nhave tried to make the United Nations focus on the\nenvironment and development, especially climate change.\nIf we fail in this quest, this civilization will destroy us and,\nin the process, destroy itself. Island States are much like the\ncanary in the coal mine; we are the messengers, signalling\nthe danger to the rest of the world.\nHaving suffered through Hurricane Hugo and\nHurricane Luis, we thank the many Governments,\ninstitutions and people who have come to our rescue. The\npeople of Antigua and Barbuda are aware of the\nvulnerability of small islands. We know our history and we\nknow the role played by small States in shaping the present.\nMy Prime Minister, the Honourable Lester Bryant Bird, has\napplauded the people of Antigua and Barbuda for their\nresilience and indomitable will in the face of adversity. If\nwe can endure 200 years of chattel slavery, and 150 years\nof brutal colonialism, then surely we can recover from two\nnights of a horrible hurricane, he has said. We believe that\nsmall island States at this United Nations can also shape the\nnext five decades in human history. We are here for that\npurpose, and we intend to succeed.\n"

        "file_text": "First of all, let me express to His Excellency Mr. Diogo\nFreitas do Amaral my sincere congratulations on his\nelection to the responsible post of President of the General\nAssembly. There can be no doubt that his rich experience,\nboth in life and in diplomacy, will serve to enhance the\nproductive work of our anniversary session.\nMr. Traor\u00e9 (Mali), Vice-President, took the Chair.\nFive decades ago, having achieved victory over the\nforces of evil in the Second World War, the international\ncommunity evinced the wisdom and political will to build\ntogether the universal home of peace and common security:\nthe United Nations. And perhaps the main result of the past\nfew decades has been that, with the help of the United\nNations, we managed to save the world from another\nworld war. All of us can be proud of that.\nAlthough the \u201cbig\u201d war spared us, this in no way\ndiminished the increasing danger of small wars in the\nworld, which have caused intense suffering and misery.\nEconomic and social development in the countries where\nthese wars take place is set back for decades. And\nalthough the civil war in Tajikistan is now behind us, it\nis still necessary to pursue the final settlement of the civil\nconflict.\nIt was the dialogue initiated by the Government of\nTajikistan, rather than violent confrontation, that began to\nyield tangible results. A significant role here was played\nby international interaction and by joint efforts on the\nregional level.\nA perceptible acceleration in the process of dialogue\nresulted from the meetings between the President of the\nRepublic of Tajikistan, Mr. Imomali Rakhmonov, and the\nleadership of the armed opposition in Kabul and Tehran.\nThis incontestably demonstrated our good will and our\nsincere aspiration for the early achievement of complete\nstability and accord on Tajik soil.\nWe are sincerely grateful to the leaders of the\nIslamic State of Afghanistan and the Islamic Republic of\nIran for their personal contribution in arranging the\nmeetings between the President of Tajikistan,\nMr. Rakhmonov, and the leader of the opposition,\nMr. Nuri. The efforts of these and other countries acting\nas observers in the inter-Tajik negotiations tangibly\nsupplemented the mediating activity of the United\nNations.\nWe are grateful to the Secretary-General,\nHis Excellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, his Special\nEnvoy, Ambassador P\u00edriz Ball\u00f3n, and also the regional\nand intergovernmental organizations that acted as\nobservers at the inter-Tajik negotiations for their\nsubstantial contribution to the resolution of the conflict.\nThe results of these multilateral efforts have already\nbecome apparent. Signed by the sides in the middle of\nAugust this year, the Protocol on the fundamental\nprinciples for establishing peace and national accord in\nTajikistan, which contains, inter alia, the decision to\nextend the term of cease-fire agreement until\n26 February 1996, has created a solid basis for the\nattainment of general agreement for peace and national\naccord in Tajikistan.\n20\n\n\nThe Government of Tajikistan is in favour of the\nearliest possible start to an ongoing round of negotiations\nwith the Opposition. We plan to begin this very soon. The\nintention is that in the course of the forthcoming dialogue\nthe Government and its opponents will agree upon a\ncomplete set of issues for a comprehensive peace\nsettlement. A prerequisite for that is that the Opposition\nagree to act with the Government on a common legal basis.\nWhat is important is that, having signed the protocol to\nwhich I have referred, the Opposition undertook to conduct\nits political struggle exclusively by peaceful means and in\naccordance with current legislation in the Republic of\nTajikistan.\nWe cannot ignore the fact that there are difficulties in\nthis process. Among the representatives of the hard-line\nwing of the Opposition there are forces whose attitude\nfavours terrorism and political and religious extremism. To\nachieve their own narrow, selfish ends they are inclined to\nstick to the policy of keeping strong pressure on the\nGovernment. Their arsenal includes terrorist acts,\nintimidation of people inside the country, constant violation\nof the Tajik-Afghan border, which is protected by border\nguards of Russia, Kazakstan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan,\nas well as by our own soldiers.\nThe continuous interference from outside in the\ninter-Tajik conflict has had a negative impact on the\nsettlement process. Evidence of that is the continuing\nexplosive situation on the Tajik-Afghan border, which tends\nto destabilize the situation in Tajikistan as well as in all of\nCentral Asia.\nThe unstable situation makes it possible for criminal\nelements to engage in the illegal supply of drugs and arms\non a large scale across the southern border of Tajikistan.\nThe consequences of these criminal acts have a negative\nimpact, not just in our country or in the Commonwealth of\nIndependent States (CIS), but also far beyond the borders\nof the CIS.\nIn this connection, it is appropriate to recall that the\nleadership of Tajikistan and the States whose military\ncontingents comprise the peace-keeping forces of the CIS\nhave repeatedly requested that these forces be given the\nstatus of a United Nations operation. An important reason\nfor that is the accumulated experience of close and\nconstructive collaboration between the United Nations\nMission of Observers in Tajikistan and the collective peace-\nkeeping forces of the CIS, as well as the border-guard\nforces in Tajikistan. This collaboration is already one of the\nmost important factors in stabilizing the situation.\nThe completed process of constitutional reforms and\nthe concomitant peaceful transformation in State power\nhave also contributed to the inter-Tajik settlement.\nIndependent Tajikistan has now acquired a Constitution;\nthe President of the country, who is its guarantor, came\nto office as the result of popular elections; legislative\npower is vested in a newly elected Parliament, the Majlisi\nOli; all branches of power at the centre, as well as\nlocally, have been strengthened and are working\neffectively; and the principle of the primacy of the law\nhas made active headway in the country.\nIt is not sufficient simply to note that all these\nprocesses took place in the period between the forty-ninth\nsession and the fiftieth anniversary session of the General\nAssembly: it is fair to note also that much was achieved\nwith the assistance of the United Nations institutions and\nspecialized agencies.\nWhile there may have been significant progress in\nthe political process, it has proved quite difficult to\nimprove the situation in the national economy in the\nperiod of transition without any support from outside,\ndespite the concrete steps that are being taken towards\nmarket reforms. A national currency has been introduced,\nprices have been liberalized, the process of accelerated\nprivatization is under way, and so on.\nIn other words, the conditions have been created for\nthe development of the economy in the transition period.\nAt the same time, restoring those aspects of daily life that\nwere destroyed by the civil war of 1992 has been\nextremely difficult. Our health care, education and social\nsecurity are in critical condition.\nThe question of the return and settlement of refugees\nand displaced persons and their social rehabilitation\nremains crucial. We are grateful for the efforts of\nspecialized agencies of the United Nations and other\ninternational organizations for their generosity to our\ncountry in helping to resolve the refugee problem.\nAs is known, Tajikistan does not have access to the\nsea. However, it possesses significant quantities of natural\nresources, and it has substantial industrial potential. If our\ncountry were to be approached by international financial\norganizations this would significantly ease the situation\nand accelerate the process of reform in the economy.\nWe call upon the States Members of the United\nNations to cooperate in mutually beneficial partnership.\nStabilization in the economy of Tajikistan will not only\n21\n\n\nserve to satisfy the socio-economic needs of our people; it\nwill become an important factor for further development of\ndemocratic institutions in our country, strengthening the\nmachinery for the defence of human rights and the process\nof national accord and the consolidation of society.\nAs an equal member of the world community, the\nRepublic of Tajikistan, to the extent of its potential, will\nstrive to participate actively in international political life.\nTajikistan actively supports the strengthening of the\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, to\nwhich it is a party, as well as a comprehensive nuclear-test\nban.\nMy country attaches great importance to the\ndevelopment of broad cooperation, not only with the United\nNations but also with regional organizations. The Republic\nof Tajikistan is a striking example of successful practical\ninteraction between two influential international\norganizations \u2014 the United Nations and the Organization\nfor Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) \u2014 in their\ncommon interests. The ties between Tajikistan and the\nOSCE are developing in all major areas of that\norganization\u2019s activity. We also attach great importance to\nthe activity of Tajikistan within the Organization of the\nIslamic Conference.\nOur country pays particular attention to the state of\naffairs in the Commonwealth of Independent States and to\nthe consistent development of that organization\u2019s ties with\neach of its members.\nThe development of the situation in the central Asian\nregion is of vital importance to our Republic. The\nGovernment of my country is a staunch advocate of the\nparity approach to the settlement of regional political\nproblems and of the closest possible economic integration\nof the States in its region.\nFinally, I should like to say a few words about the\nsituation in a neighbouring country \u2014 Afghanistan, which\nis one of the most dreadful casualties in the aftermath of\nthe cold war. There appears to be no end to the internecine\nconflict in the territory of this long-suffering nation. We\nbelieve that the United Nations and the world community\nhave sufficient political and moral weight to exert a\nmeaningful influence on the parties to this fratricidal\nconflict with a view to ending the bloodshed as soon as\npossible. This would undoubtedly be one of the most\nsignificant contributions by the United Nations to the\nestablishment of universal peace and security.\nThe 50-year history of the United Nations has\nenriched us with the invaluable capacity to live in peace\nwith each other despite our differences. Applying this\nexperience, we must give our peoples high hopes for life\nin the third millennium. In this sense, we share very much\nthe concept of the Secretary-General\u2019s report \u201cAn Agenda\nfor Development\u201d. Consonant with this are the joint\ninitiatives of the CIS States at the fiftieth session of the\nUnited Nations General Assembly \u2014 initiatives in which\nTajikistan has participated. The most relevant of these is\nthe convening of an international conference on refugees\nand migrants in post-Soviet territory.\nThe package of documented initiatives from the CIS\nStates confirms our will to further integrate the\nCommonwealth into the international community, and to\nseek more active participation in the work of United\nNations institutions and its specialized agencies. Our joint\nefforts do not mean that we wish to work in isolation.\nThey simply testify to the fact that there is a great deal\nthat unites us, and there is much we share in common\nwith respect to our development besides having many\nsimilar problems.\nThe entire civilized world, with great concern and\nindeed with growing alarm about what will happen to\nfuture generations, has been observing increasing\nincidents of international terrorism, religious fanaticism\nand ultra-nationalism. The task of the world community\nis to unite efforts to counteract the forces of evil. The\ntragic events in Tokyo, Oklahoma and Budenovsk show\nthat the world must intensify the struggle in those\ndirections, including foiling the attempts of terrorists to\nget access to weapons of mass destruction, whether they\nbe nuclear, chemical or any other kind.\nInternational terrorism, drug trafficking and the illicit\ntraffic in weapons, the emergence of \u201chot spots\u201d here and\nthere on the planet: these are all interconnected\nphenomena. The pain and suffering of the people in these\n\u201chot spots\u201d call for urgent and joint steps to be taken to\nwage uncompromising war against these demons of the\nend of the twentieth century.\nAs the situation now stands, either the principles of\nhigh morality and humanity will prevail or the world will\nbe doomed to further suffering. We have no right to allow\nsociety to return to the epoch of barbarism.\nOn the eve of the end of the Second World War the\nfounders of the United Nations dreamed about ruling out\nany global catastrophes in the future. The 50 years of our\n22\n\n\nOrganization\u2019s history provide convincing evidence of the\nconstant antagonism between the forces of reason and light\nand those of injustice and hatred. Today we bow our heads\nin respect before the tens of millions of people who\nsacrificed their lives for the sake of peace and justice.\nOver the 50 years of its existence the United Nations\nhas essentially saved the world from new universal\nslaughter. Our common task is now to step into the twenty-\nfirst century having learned wisdom from the experience of\nthe past, and having provided our children and\ngrandchildren with durable peace, the right to free\ndevelopment and spiritual progress.\n"

        "file_text": "It is indeed fitting that\nthis historic fiftieth session of the General Assembly is\nbeing presided over by Mr. Freitas do Amara of Portugal,\na distinguished teacher of law, an experienced\nparliamentarian, and the founder of one of the major\npolitical parties that helped to return vibrant democracy to\nhis homeland. He will meet the challenges of this office\nwith the intellect and skill that have marked his service to\nhis country and region.\nHis Excellency, Mr. Amara Essy, who presided over\nthe forty-ninth session of the General Assembly, has my\nwarmest appreciation of his leadership through a complex\nagenda.\nI salute the Secretary-General as well as the women\nand men of the Secretariat, the specialized agencies and\nother bodies of the United Nations for their extraordinary\nwork during this difficult time in the Organization\u2019s\nhistory.\nI embrace the representatives of Palau, the newest\nMember State \u2014 our sister in the South Pacific region.\nWe of Solomon Islands, a politically stable\ndemocracy, live in peace, but we have known the cruelty\nand havoc of modern war. Not only did the Battle of\nGuadalcanal in the Second World War inflict damage on\nour natural environment, leaving behind untold numbers\nof dangerous armaments, but it caused adverse effects on\nhuman and economic development as well. We number\nless than 400,000 people of diverse ethnic origins, speak\nsome 87 distinct languages in various dialects, and live\ntogether on hundreds of islands spread over 1600 square\nkilometres of ocean. We live in a part of the world of\nexquisite beauty with a delicate marine and forest ecology\nthat is critical to our well-being and survival.\nFrom the perspective of my country, peace and\ndevelopment are inextricably linked. The Agenda for\nDevelopment and the Agenda for Peace make this as clear\nas the brilliant and pollution-free waters of our sun-\ndrenched lagoons. In his latest report on the work of the\nOrganization, the Secretary-General observed that\ndevelopment:\n\u201cthe foremost and most far-reaching task of our time\n... must be seen in its many dimensions \u2014 in the\ncontexts of peace, the economy, environmental\nprotection, social justice and democracy\u201d. (A/50/1,\npara. 182)\nEach is critical for development, but without peace the\nother dimensions shrink like characters in stories for\nchildren.\nWe applaud the Secretary-General\u2019s efforts to\nimplement the Agenda for Peace. The development of a\nframework for coordinating the planning and\nimplementation of complex field operations is welcome.\nIn its efforts to broker peace, the United Nations has\nwrestled with seemingly intractable problems. Solomon\nIslands, one of the least developed countries, living in\npeace, gladly contributes its financial share to peace-\nkeeping and supports initiatives to protect United Nations\npersonnel and to aid civilian populations.\n8\n\n\nYet, ethnic strife and armed conflict rage in many\nplaces with suffering and devastation beyond\ncomprehension. The violation of human rights continues.\nPoverty saps the creativity and vitality of thousands of\nmillions. Vast numbers of children, especially female\nchildren, do not have their basic needs met and many do\nnot survive infancy or early childhood. Solomon Islands,\nwhich reaffirms its commitment to the Convention on the\nRights of the Child, applauds the work of the United\nNations Children\u2019s Fund. Minimal education, illiteracy,\nlabouring in unspeakable conditions, prostitution and life on\nthe streets are the conditions of many children. The mass\nmedia with an educational purpose have a powerful role in\nchanging all of this as Solomon Islanders living in\ncommunities separated by the sea have learned. Moreover,\nmany of the world\u2019s women continue to face serious\neconomic and social discrimination as the 1995 Human\nDevelopment Report to the United Nations Development\nProgramme demonstrates. The education of women in\nSolomon Islands is critical to them, their children, their\nfamilies and the nation. Without it, sustainable development\nand the levelling of population growth are unattainable\ngoals.\nSolomon Islands applauds the steps taken by the\nUnited States of America and the Russian Federation to\nreduce their nuclear arsenals in accordance with Start I, on\nthe reduction and limitation of strategic offensive arms. We\nlook forward to agreement on and implementation of the\nTreaty on Further Reduction and Limitation of Strategic\nOffensive Arms (Start II).\nSolomon Islands and its sister States in the Pacific\nregion fearfully watch the ominous nuclear-weapons tests\nof France and the People\u2019s Republic of China. We\nespecially deplore the fact that France is conducting them\nin the South Pacific with its fragile marine ecology\nessential to the lives of island peoples. Recent reports in the\nFrench media indicate that the potential danger of these\ntests is far greater than we have been led to believe. The\nthreats to people, animals and plants \u2014 even the genetic\nfoundations of life \u2014 are terribly real. Do we need\nadditional evidence of this after Hiroshima and Nagasaki?\nWhy are more nuclear tests really required? How valid is\nthe concept of nuclear deterrence now? If, as France claims,\nnuclear-weapons explosions on Mururoa Atoll and\nFangataufa Atoll in French Polynesia are so safe, why not\nset them off in the soil of the mother country? Its presence\nin Polynesia and New Caledonia makes France our\nneighbour in the Pacific where a post-cold-war redefinition\nof the region is well under way. Do good neighbours\nendanger the environment that sustains them? Are we not\ngambling away the future of humankind at the nuclear-\nweapons dice table? To the nuclear-threshold States, these\ntests send the wrong signal. The Pacific is certainly the\nwrong place; now, today, is the wrong time; and for\ninternational cooperation, this is the wrong policy.\nGlobal warming, as the intergovernmental climate-\nchange experts are now confirming, continues. The\nconsequences for the small island States are most serious,\nincluding the potential impact of sea-level rise. They\nthreaten our agricultural and fish production, thereby\nendangering our economy and undermining our ability to\ndevelop. Clearly, this global problem requires a global\nsolution, but the industrial countries must take the lead if\njoint solutions are to be successfully implemented.\nSolomon Islands is contributing to the quest for\ninternational peace and security in a number of ways.\nTowards disarmament, we have ratified the Treaty on the\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), and we\ntook an active part in the NPT Review and Extension\nConference, joining in the consensus to extend the NPT\nindefinitely. We ratified the Treaty of Rarotonga\nestablishing the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone.\nEstablishing nuclear-free zones is an important initiative\ntowards creating a non-proliferation regime in cooperation\nwith other States. Solomon Islands, along with others,\nmade two submissions to the International Court of\nJustice on the legality of the use or threat of use of\nnuclear weapons, a matter now before the Court.\nSolomon Islands is participating in the process for\nthe completion of a comprehensive test-ban treaty by\nSeptember 1996. We believe that a comprehensive test-\nban treaty is the fulcrum upon which nuclear disarmament\nwill be raised from dream to reality. Ultimately,\ndisarmament is a question of courage and overcoming\nfear. It begins within, and its achievement must come\nfrom within as well \u2014 inside them and us, inside you and\nme.\nAs for environmental issues, Solomon Islands is a\nState party to the United Nations Framework Convention\non Climate Change and fully supports the Berlin mandate,\nwhich includes the Alliance of Small Island States\nprotocol. With so much of our present and future\neconomy based on our forests and marine life, we\nembrace the Convention on Biological Diversity, which\nSolomon Islands acceded to this year, the Barbados\nProgramme of Action, the Noum\u00e9a Convention, and the\nInternational Coral Reef Initiative. We support a global\nprogramme of action to protect the marine environment\n9\n\n\nfrom land-based activities. Concerned about the shipment\nand importation of hazardous and radioactive wastes in the\nSouth Pacific region, Solomon Islands endorses the Waigani\nConvention recently adopted at the twenty-sixth South\nPacific Forum, held in Papua New Guinea, and calls for the\nrehabilitation of former nuclear-weapon test sites and\nassistance to the peoples who were forced from those\nplaces.\nWe live in a world of disturbing, often cruel, contrasts.\nThese, sustainable development has to address. In his report\non the work of the Organization, the Secretary-General\nstates that\n\u201cdevelopment at its core must be about improvement\nof human well-being, the removal of poverty, hunger,\ndisease and ignorance, ensuring productive\nemployment and the satisfaction of priority needs of\nall people in a way that can be sustained over future\ngenerations; ... the emerging consensus on the priority\nand dimensions of development should find expression\nin a new framework for international cooperation\u201d.\n(A/50/1, para. 182)\nSolomon Islands views this emerging consensus as the\nbeginning of a new diplomacy that puts people at the heart\nof development. The new diplomacy should work\nvigorously to implement the programmes of action crafted\nat the World Summit for Children, the Earth Summit, the\nWorld Conference on Human Rights, the International\nConference on Population and Development, the World\nSummit for Social Development, the Global Conference on\nthe Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing\nStates and the Fourth World Conference on Women. After\nHabitat II, in Istanbul next year, we do not require more\nlarge conferences, for the time being at least. Rather, we\nneed international will and partnership, political\ncommitment, and thoughtful, decisive action to ensure that\nthese programmes of action are implemented.\nAs the Declaration of Barbados affirms,\n\u201cSmall island developing nations are particularly\nvulnerable to natural as well as environmental\ndisasters and have a limited capacity to respond to and\nrecover from such disasters.\u201d (A/CONF.167/9, annex\nI, part one, section III, para. 1)\nLimited in size and with vulnerable economies, they must\ndepend on a narrow resource base and upon international\ntrade, without the means to influence its terms. Solomon\nIslands and the other small island developing States require\ninternational partnership and cooperation to achieve and\nmaintain sustainable development.\nThe new diplomacy based on people-centred\ndevelopment has at its heart a spiritual dimension which\nembraces the ideals of democracy, tolerance, peaceful\ncoexistence, justice and the rights of persons and peoples.\nIt cares for the environment and rejects greed and\nintolerance. This new diplomacy will be a reflection of an\nagenda for democracy and tolerance, which Solomon\nIslands believes should be formulated to complete the\ntriad of agendas. Such an agenda ought to be a basis for\nreforming the United Nations in general and the Security\nCouncil in particular. For Security Council reform to\nwork, it must put people at the centre instead of a\ndominating nation, group of nations or region.\nCommitted to democracy and tolerance, Solomon\nIslands calls for renewed consideration of the exceptional\nsituation of the Republic of China on Taiwan in the\ninternational context, on the basis of the principle of\nuniversality and in accordance with the established model\nof parallel representation of divided countries at the\nUnited Nations. The Republic of China\u2019s standing as the\nfifteenth largest trading nation in the world, with the\ntwentieth highest gross national product and the largest\nforeign-exchange holdings, its continuing assistance to\nmany developing countries and its efforts to strengthen\ninternational economic cooperation are obvious and\ncannot be ignored by the world\u2019s highest forum. In\naddition, the Republic of China\u2019s contribution to world\npeace and its unfailing support of United Nations\nactivities are undeniable evidence of its qualifications to\nreceive proper consideration for having a seat at the\nUnited Nations. Solomon Islands therefore calls for a\nrenewed focus on the issue of readmitting the Republic of\nChina as a Member of the United Nations.\nSolomon Islands believes in a United Nations that\ncalls for tolerance and works to practise it, a United\nNations that promotes the values of diversity, tolerance,\npluralism, peace, justice, solidarity and responsibility\ntowards others and unknown future generations. Here,\ndifferences in race, religion, language and political\ndoctrine are not obstacles, but challenges to\nunderstanding, compassion, insight and patience.\nThe only hope for humanity is world peace, to be\nachieved by a change in attitude from one of \u201cmine and\nmy world\u201d to one of \u201cwe and our world\u201d.\n10\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "The General Assembly\u2019s choice of Mr. Freitas do\nAmaral to serve as President at this fiftieth session is a\nfitting tribute to his eminent qualities and to the role his\ncountry, Portugal, has always played in international\nrelations. I would like to congratulate him on behalf of my\ndelegation and assure him of our cooperation.\nWe are grateful to his predecessor, His Excellency\nMr. Amara Essy, for the skilful way in which he reflected\nand conveyed our concerns throughout his mandate.\nI would like to reaffirm the profound gratitude of the\nGovernment of Congo to the Secretary-General, Mr.\nBoutros Boutros-Ghali, for the concern he showed to find\na settlement to the political crisis that overwhelmed my\ncountry in the first two years after the democratic election\nof Professor Pascal Lissouba as President of the Republic.\nDespite the fact that the United Nations inherited the\ndifficulties of what were often troubled times and despite\nits often controversial role, it remains the repository of\nhope for the peoples of the world. The fiftieth anniversary\nis a fitting time to look at what the Organization\u2019s\nexperience has taught us so that we may be able to\nestablish a more confident and optimistic idea of how the\nOrganization and mankind as a whole will move into the\nthird millennium.\nThis session with its inherent symbolism, coming as\nit does at an exceptional period in the development of\ninternational relations, places us squarely between the\nfading dogmas that for a long time seemed to inspire the\nperfect system of management and human development,\nand the universal desire of the most destitute people for\ngreater political freedom, development and the assertion\nof their moral and cultural identity.\nAs countries once subjected to ideological, political\nand economic domination move steadfastly forward, the\nUnited Nations remains, as ever, the ideal vehicle for\npreventing upheaval from shattering world peace.\nIn other words, faced with the new world situation,\nthis celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of our\nOrganization can be analysed only in terms of a break\nwith the past and a time to take stock of new realities in\nthe face of the overriding need to establish new\nmachinery to govern the international community.\nThe various scenes rightly described for us from this\nrostrum undoubtedly show the world as it is and as we\nwould like it to be. I, therefore, endorse the concerns and\nproposals voiced here, particularly, as regards the\nrestructuring of the United Nations system, the Agenda\nfor Development. There are so many seemingly self-\nevident issues that will, I am sure, enjoy the consensual\nsupport of all delegations, as happened at the recent\nUnited Nations conferences, which have given our States\n25\n\n\na platform from which to deal with the major problems of\nthe world.\nFrom Rio to Beijing, via Vienna, Cairo and\nCopenhagen, we have established priorities and made\ncommitments that we hope will be translated into action.\nAs the Secretary-General of the United Nations rightly\nnoted in his report \u201cAn Agenda for Development\u201d, peace is\nthe foundation for development. The persistence of hotbeds\nof tension in certain parts of the world is not conducive to\nthe emergence of new prosperous nations. Quite the\ncontrary, in the absence of peace, these hotbeds of tension\nthwart prospects for development more and more every day.\nIn this context, we should encourage the peoples of\nAngola and Liberia to continue along the difficult path to\nnational reconciliation after the several years of fratricidal\ncivil war they have endured.\nWe must be gratified by the strengthening of the peace\nprocess in the Middle East through the Israeli-Palestinian\nagreement of 28 September 1995.\nWe should, finally, hail the recent developments in the\nsituation in Bosnia and Herzegovina marked by the efforts\nof the parties to the conflict to seek ways and means to\nachieve peace.\nUnfortunately, while expressing our satisfaction at the\nrestoration of the democratic regime following the coup\nd\u2019\u00e9tat in Sao Tome, thanks to international condemnation,\nwe must denounce from this lofty rostrum, any seizure of\npower by armed force as has just happened once again in\nthe Comoros.\nFinally, we would like to express our great concern at\nthe instability and insecurity that persist in Africa,\nparticularly in the countries of the Great Lakes.\nThe situation in that part of the African continent is a\nhuman tragedy. There, as elsewhere in Africa where\nviolence is rampant, ethnic hatred and intolerance have\ncaused massive flows of refugees to flee to neighbouring\ncountries.\nThis is what has happened in Zaire, a fraternal and\nneighbouring country which, from this rostrum, appealed\nfor solidarity from the international community in helping\nit to overcome the consequences of this tragedy with\nrespect for human dignity. We express the hope that this\nappeal will be heeded by the entire international\ncommunity.\nIn the face of all this, it is not difficult to understand\nwhy Congo cannot fail to support the idea of holding a\nconference on peace and stability in that region. We wish\nto state that we are ready, as are other members of the\nUnited Nations Standing Advisory Committee on Security\nQuestions in Central Africa, to go along with this\ninitiative in accordance with the Brazzaville Declaration\non cooperation for peace and security in Central Africa.\nThis Declaration, adopted after the Committee\u2019s seventh\nmeeting on 1 September 1995, is truly a profession of\nfaith, in which States reaffirm their determination to work\ntowards the establishment of confidence, peace and\nsecurity in the Central African region.\nThe valuable support which the United Nations\nSecretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, has\nconstantly given to our Committee has contributed to the\nfruitful results our States have achieved. Furthermore, this\nsupport guarantees success in achieving the objectives of\nestablishing a collective security system in Central Africa.\nWe thank him once again.\nToday, as in the past, the limits and sluggishness of\nmost of the States of the African continent remain\nunchanged. They are due, on the one hand, to the overall\ntrend towards acceptance of stereotypes and, on the other\nhand, to the fact that the requirements of modern times\nare out of kilter with the basic values underpinning our\nsocieties.\nTherefore, the democratization of institutional life,\nwhich we have embraced victoriously also seems to be a\nbreeding-ground for long-contained contradictions. Here,\nthey manifest themselves as conflict, even fratricidal wars.\nMy own country, Congo, has not been spared these post-\ndemocratic upheavals and vagaries.\nAllow me to refrain from any dire descriptions\nwhich the images of the tragedy experienced by the\npeople of Congo would conjure up. This is because I take\ngreat pride in expressing the hope of a new African\npolitical class, to which I belong, that it will be able to\nfollow in the footsteps of great democratic nations and\nbanish evil for ever.\nThis new generation would like to pioneer new\ngovernance. By that I mean a new way of exercising\npower, unflawed by hereditary belligerent instincts, that\ntakes account of the psychological and moral aspects of\n26\n\n\nour civilization and the specific features of the societal\nenvironment without jeopardizing the universal values that\nguarantee life with dignity.\nIn truth, I would like to invite everyone here to share\nin the heartfelt cry of the citizen of a country which, having\nembarked on the road to the democratization of its\ninstitutions and thus the free choice by the people of their\nleaders, has turned its back on wanton and barbaric\nviolence.\nThis violence was dictated by the obsession with\npower on the part of those who lost the elections \u2014 power\nat all costs, absolute power. Other examples on the African\ncontinent support this grim picture.\nThe mid-term review of the democratization\nprocess \u2014 a review that began in Africa three years ago \u2014\nprompts me to put the following questions to the Assembly,\nin view of our societies\u2019 crisis situation:\nWith respect to multi-ethnic States, is it legitimate to\nassume that the mere codification of constitutional norms\ncopied from older democracies is sufficient to transform\nfeudal entities into democratic ones and so move on to a\nmarket economy, and to move from autocratic tribal rule to\nthat of intellectual and political elites chosen for their keen\nsense of duty in the service of nations?\nIs it legitimate to believe and accept that simply\nsubordinating our assistance to African countries to the\nneed for their democratization will suffice to persuade their\nformer leaders \u2014 who for two or three decades governed\nour States without opposition or any sharing of power \u2014 of\nthe virtues of democracy?\nSuch a change, in our view, can take place only as\npart of a lengthy process. Furthermore, an undoubted\nrequirement is that Africa accede to democracy by\nconducting an in-depth analysis of its contemporary\npolitical history and then adopt rules for political\ngovernance that have consensus as a necessary dimension,\nrules that can ensure power-sharing by the major political\ngroups and the necessary stability for democratic\ninstitutions. In this connection, my country\u2019s experience has\nbeen a sort of litmus test.\nNo solution could have been found without the\npersonal and unwavering dedication of the President of our\nRepublic, His Excellency Mr. Pascal Lissouba, whose\nwisdom and keen sense of dialogue served as a catalyst. On\nthe basis of our own social values, traditions, realities and\nhistory, our Head of State, without underestimating the\nrelevance of the principle that elections are necessary to\ndemocracy, has assumed the role of a real paterfamilias,\ngathering around him Congolese people of every\npersuasion.\nIn this spirit, at the initiative of the President of the\nRepublic, a Forum on the Culture of Peace, organized\njointly by the Congolese Government and the United\nNations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization\n(UNESCO), was held in November 1994 in Brazzaville.\nThe decisions taken there have enabled us to make a fresh\nstart. Two of them pertain to the reorganization of the\npolice, with a view to better adapting it to its traditional\ntask as a republican police force, and to the restoration of\nthe power of the judiciary.\nSeveral months later, following political\nconsultations, a broader Government that included the\nopposition was set up. The current power-sharing between\nthose who represent institutional legitimacy by virtue of\nbeing elected and those who did not receive the popular\nvote attests to a consensual undertaking based on the idea\nof participatory democracy. This approach is rooted in the\nmanner in which our village communities were long\ngoverned and reduces the sources of conflict that\naccession to power could have triggered.\nA democratization process that unfolds in this way\nhas the necessary resources at its disposal to bear fruit, if\nthere is peace. The quest for peace is therefore a crucial\nrequirement for our States. The democratization of\ninstitutions will remain a pipe dream if there is no will,\non the part either of the African political elites or of the\ninternational community, to approach the democratic\nprocess in Africa in a manner that takes into account both\nthe quality of the political classes that governed from\nindependence until the beginning of democratization and\nthe need to restore peace where obstacles are placed in its\npath or it is directly threatened.\nIn order to put the idea of participatory democracy\ninto effect, the Congolese Government, once peace had\nbeen restored, began a national programme of\nadministrative and economic decentralization in order to\nenable the various political forces to exercise political\npower at a more grass-roots level. Today, town, village\nand regional councils have been established that take part\nin the decentralized governance of various communities.\nThus, decentralization is a prime example of one of the\nmajor steps in power-sharing.\n27\n\n\nBut in the final analysis, in Congo as elsewhere in\nAfrica \u2014 especially in Central Africa \u2014 peace remains\nfragile. It is still, to all intents and purposes, at the mercy\nof the political appetites of those who believe that, in the\nname of democracy and regardless of the people\u2019s choice,\nthey have the divine right to be in power and the obligation\nto oppose those who accede to it.\nThis observation led me to ask the seventh ministerial\nmeeting of the United Nations Standing Advisory\nCommittee on Security Questions in Central Africa, which\nwas held in Brazzaville from 28 August to 1 September\n1995 and over which I had the honour of presiding, to think\nabout the following point.\nDemocracy, which we all wholeheartedly aspire to,\nwill be doomed to failure if we do not take the wise\ndecision to equip ourselves with not only the necessary\nintellectual means but also, and above all, the political will\nto reflect on the kind of government our countries should\nhave in the world of today. This reflection must necessarily\nbe based on history and on the moral and legal rules that\nhave provided our various communities with peace, stability\nand respect for the rights of the individual and for property\nrights. Such reflection will be useful, I believe, if we are to\nspare our peoples the ordeal of fratricidal wars.\nClearly, democracy cannot be a source of peace or\ntake hold lastingly in our countries if accession to political\npower on the part of a group of persons is regarded by\nother members of the international community as the\nexercise of power by one ethnic group or a coalition of\nethnic groups. Likewise, to exercise moderation and\nrestraint is the moral duty of those who win elections and\nwho wield power. This is a crucial requirement in order to\ngive a feeling of security to those whose past political\npractices have left them convinced that they can be in\npower only if one or several members of their own ethnic\ngroup or of their region are also involved. This is the evil\nthat has been eating away at Africa and at its path towards\ntrue democratization.\nIn fact, a democratic regime is without any doubt the\none that will enable our countries to promote the flourishing\nof their elites and to ensure their development and safety.\nHowever, as members will note, our collective aspiration to\ngreater freedom and equality has at times borne the seeds\nof destruction. This is because the transplant that the\nsurgeons of democracy thought they needed to perform\nautomatically on Africa \u2014 without taking into account the\npossibility that certain of its elements might be rejected \u2014\nhas come up against our own social realities, which are\ncharacterized by the fact that for all time, and especially\nsince independence, politics has been, and remains, the\nroyal road to upward social mobility.\nIn such an environment, the rotation of power \u2014\none of the basic rules of classic democratic regimes \u2014 is\nperceived as a way of marginalizing that part of the\ncommunity that loses the political elections. The rule of\nthe rotation of power, which is perceived and applied by\nthe winners of elections as a means of removing from\npower those who have lost \u2014 which in older democracies\nis a normal occurrence \u2014 is viewed in our countries as\na source of conflict, as my own country\u2019s example shows.\nIn such circumstances, should not the establishment\nof a democratic regime in our countries be understood, in\nthe context of a consensual vision of governance, as a\ntransitory stage towards a democracy that would include\nthe classic concept of the rotation of power?\nIt would seem wise today to tackle the democratic\nphenomenon by including in the rules and in the basic\nfoundation of democracy a peacemaking dimension that,\nwhile stemming from our socio-political realities and our\nown world view, would fit into a global framework. The\nrotation of political power would, in this transitional\nstage, take on a new, less conflictual dimension, while\nremaining one of the elements of genuine democracy.\nSuch an approach would confer greater legitimacy on\nthose who are elected.\nThe international community is therefore once again\ncalled upon to help Africa bring peace to itself and to\nprovide itself with stable democratic regimes. This is the\nonly way that Africa\u2019s development can be achieved.\nMay this historic session of the General Assembly\nbe a decisive turning-point for new victories ushering in\na better world and an Africa moving forward towards\ndemocracy and progress.\nThe meeting rose at 1.25 p.m.\n28\n"

        "file_text": "I should like to begin by\nextending to you, Sir, my warmest congratulations on your\nelection as President of the General Assembly. This is not\nmerely a recognition of your long experience and your\noutstanding ability and diplomatic skill, but also a reflection\nof the esteem in which your country, Portugal, is held in\nthe United Nations. We are certain that under your able\nguidance the work of this very important session of the\nGeneral Assembly will be a landmark in the history of the\nOrganization.\nI should also like to pay a warm tribute to the\nSecretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Boutros\nBoutros-Ghali, for the determined leadership which he has\ndemonstrated on vital issues and for his reports on the work\nof the Organization, which have already resulted in the\nadoption of a series of measures, providing working tools\nfor the activities of the United Nations. Cyprus is\nparticularly grateful to the Secretary-General and his\ndedicated staff for their untiring efforts to find a just and\nlasting solution to the question of Cyprus on the basis of\nUnited Nations resolutions.\nIn April 1945, when it was obvious that the world\nwas breaking up into two armed camps, delegates from\nthe then independent nations met to create a world\norganization capable of building an era of peace and\ninternational cooperation out of the chaos and conflict of\nthe Second World War. They drafted the United Nations\nCharter, a document of principles and norms, aimed at\neffectively dealing with aggression and improving human\nrights and economic and social conditions for people\neverywhere.\nFor five decades the spirit of the Charter was kept\nalive under very difficult circumstances, even when in\nmany cases the United Nations took the blame for the\nfailings of its Member States. It is an indisputable fact\nthat the United Nations, despite its shortcomings, has\nmanaged the transforming of colonies into independent\ncountries, restoring democracies and promoting the rule\nof law. It has also been successful in resolving conflicts\nin many parts of the world \u2014 in Namibia, in\nMozambique, in Angola, in Cambodia, in Central\nAmerica and in the Caribbean \u2014 and it has provided the\ninspiration for the drafting of major arms-control treaties.\nIts peace-keepers have saved thousands of lives, fed\n1\n\n\nmillions of people, and helped to restore a degree of\nnormality in areas of conflict.\nEqually, it has played an important role in promoting\nhuman rights and stimulating economic recovery, monetary\nstability and growth in the developing world. Furthermore,\nover the past 50 years there has been a series of United\nNations-inspired conferences which dealt with major issues\nthat vitally affect the peoples of the world. More recently,\nUnited Nations-sponsored conferences, including the Earth\nSummit at Rio, the Vienna World Conference on Human\nRights, the Cairo International Conference on Population\nand Development, the Copenhagen World Summit for\nSocial Development and the Beijing Fourth World\nConference on Women, have left their indelible imprint on\nthe history of mankind. On the other hand, there have been\nreversals \u2014 in Rwanda United Nations efforts failed to\navert genocide, and in Somalia the tragedy continues.\nEqually distressing is the unabated bloodshed in the\nBalkans, while United Nations efforts on the problem of my\ncountry are still to bear fruit.\nFifty years of existence provide an important\nopportunity to look back, to reflect on both our successes\nand failures. But it is also an opportunity to look forward,\nto determine where we can and should go from here,\nespecially now, when the cold war, now ended, has\nregrettably generated a wide range of security problems\nstemming from economic, political or social tensions or\nissues of nationalism. The complex nature of the challenges\ncalls for multilateral action and an integrated approach.\nDrawing from the lessons of the past and the challenges of\nthe present, we must open up new ways to use the\nmechanisms provided originally by the Charter.\nIn this context, the continuing debate on the Agenda\nfor Peace has stimulated new thinking about the particular\nchanges needed to re-equip the United Nations for its role\nin this field, so as to vindicate the vision of its founders.\nFrom this rostrum I have had the opportunity to present in\nsome detail our views on the proposed conceptual\norientations. I do not need to stress that my country is fully\ncommitted to these goals. The recent history of Cyprus can\nbe seen as a case study, demonstrating the need for such an\ninitiative and the importance of further expanding its\nconcepts.\nUnder the United Nations Charter disarmament and\narms control are integral parts of international peace and\nsecurity. Though for decades progress towards disarmament\nand arms control was made impossible by the rigidities of\nbipolarization, the latter\u2019s demise has now opened up new\npossibilities.\nIn the last two years we have witnessed major\nachievements, the most important of which was the\ndecision to extend indefinitely and unconditionally the\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons,\nalong with the strengthening of the review process for the\nTreaty and the adoption of a set of principles and\nobjectives for nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament.\nFurthermore, we will soon be entering into commitments\nfor the conclusion of the comprehensive test-ban treaty\nand the negotiation of a treaty banning the production of\nfissile material for nuclear purposes. These should be seen\nas products of the momentum which has built up in the\ndisarmament field since the end of the cold war. We\nshare the view that much still needs to be done in the\nareas of both non-conventional and conventional weapons,\nfor, as long as military threats to security exist, the\ndisarmament and arms-control process will continue to be\nan essential element of international security.\nThe reduction of forces and armaments alone cannot\nprovide for or guarantee international security, but it can\nreduce the risk of an outbreak of military conflict and can\ncontribute to confidence-building and conflict resolution.\nIn this context, I would like to remind this body of my\nproposal for the complete demilitarization of the Republic\nof Cyprus: the withdrawal of the Turkish occupation\nforces, the disbanding of the National Guard of Cyprus,\nthe handing over of all its arms and military equipment to\nthe custody of the United Nations Peace-keeping Force\nand the placing into a United Nations account of all\nmoney saved from the purchase of arms, to be used for\ninfrastructure development projects beneficial to both\ncommunities. I feel that our proposal reflects not only our\ngood intentions but also the spirit of the times.\nUnfortunately, it was rejected by Turkey.\nGenuine security also includes economic well-being,\nprotection of human rights and environmental\nsustainability. All these dimensions function together, in\nan interlocking and mutually reinforcing way, as\nfoundations of peace. There is much concern today that\nthe United Nations should have an agenda and working\nmethod of direct relevance to the economic and social\nneeds of societies in which individuals or groups are\ndeprived of their freedom or of the basic necessities on\nwhich human life depends. Newspapers and television\nscreens air these needs daily. The international\ncommunity\u2019s ability to offer a decent and secure existence\nto all its citizens is called into question by the numerous\n2\n\n\nhuman tragedies, atrocities of war, terrorism, traffic in\nillegal drugs and long-term ecological degradation of our\nplanet.\nIt is self-evident that global cooperation and effective\naction is a sine qua non for effectively combating these and\nother evils tormenting world society. Our most important\ngoal must be the implementation of our existing\ncommitments, as provided for in the Charter. In placing the\nemphasis on this, we are setting no modest objective. What\nwe should recognize is that the body of principles and\ncommitments which have been built up over the last 50\nyears cover the full range of civil, political, economic and\nsocial issues.\nOur task should be to reduce the obvious gap between\naccepted principles and everyday practice, to apply these\nprinciples without discrimination and at the same time to\nconsider ways of strengthening further the existing\nmechanisms. In this context, we must face up to the\nproblem of holding to full account those who flout the\nauthority of the United Nations, persistently refuse to\nrespect the rights of others and choose to disregard the\ninternational commitments which they have freely accepted.\nWhen I speak of the need to uphold the authority of\nthe United Nations, I feel entitled to use as an example the\nexperience of my country and its people. Since 1974, when\nTurkish forces invaded Cyprus, 37 per cent of the territory\nof the Republic has remained under military occupation by\nTurkey. The Turkish occupation troops, instead of\nwithdrawing after repeated calls by solemn Security Council\nand General Assembly resolutions, are increasing in number\nand modernizing their military equipment, thus posing not\nonly a serious threat to the security of our region but also\na challenge to the authority of the United Nations. The\nSecretary-General has stated in his reports to the Security\nCouncil that the area of Cyprus under occupation by the\nTurkish forces is the most militarized area in the world.\nAnother point of particular concern to us is the\nmassive violation of the human rights of the displaced\npersons who were forcibly evicted from their homes by the\nTurkish occupation forces and whose homes and property\nhave been usurped by illegal settlers imported from Turkey\nto Cyprus in an effort to change the demographic\ncomposition of our population and colonize the part of\nCyprus occupied by the Turkish forces. All these flagrant\nhuman rights violations have been committed against my\ncountry despite a number of General Assembly and\nSecurity Council resolutions calling on all States to respect\nthe sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity and unity\nof the Republic of Cyprus and to avoid any actions which\ncould change the demographic structure of the island.\nTurkey\u2019s defiance extends also to resolutions calling\nfor the withdrawal of foreign forces from the Republic of\nCyprus, the return of the refugees to their homes under\nconditions of safety, the humanitarian issues of the\nmissing persons and the implementation of the third\nVienna agreement, regarding the living conditions and\nwelfare of persons in enclaves in areas under the control\nof the Turkish occupation forces.\nOn this solemn occasion, I wish sincerely to express,\non behalf of the people of Cyprus, the Government and\nmyself, deep appreciation for the solidarity offered us by\nthe Assembly. I ask that its most valuable support be\nreinforced with added emphasis, for it is high time the\nresolutions of the United Nations on Cyprus were\nimplemented if a just and lasting solution is to be arrived\nat without further delay. We must remember that failure\nto uphold international law and respect for human rights\nin one situation sets a precedent for similar failures\nelsewhere, with often catastrophic consequences. Recent\nexperiences have demonstrated this all too blatantly.\nAt every turning point in modern history, nations\nconvene to shape a new world order. This is another such\nhistoric turning point, and the United Nations is the forum\nfor the world order we must build. We have, I believe, a\ncollective responsibility to understand the nature of the\nnew, post-cold-war role of the United Nations, to continue\nour effort towards the institutional reforms needed to re-\nequip the United Nations for its role and to make\ncommitments of the human and financial resources\nnecessary for the United Nations to carry out effectively\nits mission. We believe that the topics of prime\nconsideration should include the restructuring of the\nSecurity Council, the system of international security as\nprovided for in the Charter, the further development and\nimplementation of the basic concepts of An Agenda for\nPeace and An Agenda for Development and the finances\nof the United Nations.\nIt is now generally accepted that the Security\nCouncil\u2019s membership must be increased so as to become\nmore representative of the Organization\u2019s membership. It\nis also recognized that it has to improve the effectiveness\nof its decision-making to deal with the challenges of\ninternational security in the future. Openness in its\nproceedings, democratization in its decision-taking\nprocedures, and broader consultation by the permanent\nmembers with non-permanent members and with those\n3\n\n\noutside the Council whose interests are affected by a\nparticular issue before it, will contribute to the effectiveness\nof this all-important United Nations body.\nOn the other hand, we should ensure that the General\nAssembly, the universal organ of the United Nations, where\nthe sovereign equality of Member States is democratically\ndepicted, be fully respected and utilized more, if we are to\nserve well the peoples of the world.\nIt is of paramount importance to recognize that, for\npeace and stability to be maintained and for democracy to\nbe rooted, economic and social development is\nindispensable. That is why we welcome the efforts of the\nUnited Nations to answer social and economic problems,\nthough the United Nations was created primarily as a\npolitical body to address political issues. Today, however,\nmore than ever, we must face social and economic\nchallenges, for it is not enough to bring forth the end of\nstrife and violence. It has been correctly said that if we\ncontain violence but ignore poverty we will sooner or later\ndiscover that we have simply traded one misery for another.\nThe historic Middle East accord offers a good example\nin this respect, where what has been achieved in the course\nof the peace process should be cemented by the economic\nsupport of the international community, thus ensuring a just\nand lasting peace in the Middle East.\nNever in the history of mankind has the awareness of\ninterdependence and globalism been so strong as it is today,\nand never has mankind had so much technological know-\nhow at its disposal. Building upon the accumulation of 50\nyears of United Nations experience in multilateral relations\nand the everlasting principles and ideals of the United\nNations Charter, we can and must do everything within our\npower to bequeath to coming generations a better world,\nwhere security, democracy, human rights and prosperity\nprevail and are shared by all.\n"

        "file_text": "Since the United Nations was founded, Mexico has made\na committed and enthusiastic contribution to its positive\ndevelopment. Without exception, Mexico has effectively\npromoted the principles, the letter and the spirit of the\nSan Francisco Charter. Today Mexico confirms before the\nworld its unswerving commitment to peace, development\nand collective understanding, which are the inspiration of\nthe United Nations.\n\nWe have had five decades of collective diplomacy,\ncontroversy over the scope and limitations of multilateral\naction, difficult adaptations for the United Nations to a\nworld that is constantly changing at a dizzying pace; five\ndecades in which the ship of the United Nations has often\nbeen pounded by the waves of intolerance, of the\narbitrary and irrational use of power and force and of\novert violations of the norms of international law. Despite\nthe pounding it has received, the ship remains afloat.\nToday it has 185 nations on board, and it is still\nmankind\u2019s best alternative for bringing future generations\nto a safer and stabler port than the one we inherited at the\nend of the Second World War.\nIn these first 50 years the foundations have been laid\nfor building a new civilization at a higher level for\npeaceful coexistence between nations. Never before in\nhistory has mankind possessed an instrument as universal\nand spirited as the United Nations. The general debate in\nthis fiftieth anniversary year is an appropriate occasion for\nus to pledge ourselves to preserving the achievements of\nthe United Nations and outlining the form it should take\nin the next century. Clearly, the world cannot do without\nthe United Nations, but it is also obvious that its\nstructures are in need of far-reaching changes in order to\nbe up to the challenges of the present day.\nThe recurring topic is the need to reform the\nOrganization, and the main issues are, among others, the\nfollowing:\nFirst, Mexico attaches priority to the examination of\nthe reform of the Security Council and has proposed an\nincrease in the Council\u2019s membership, strictly respecting\nthe principle of equitable geographical distribution in the\n15\n\n\ncontext of a genuine reform of its working methods,\nincluding reconsideration of the use and the existence of the\nveto power.\nA second issue is the limitations on the role of the\nSecretary-General, which have very significantly curtailed\nhis ability to act.\nThirdly, there is the failure of a large number of\nMember States to meet their financial obligations.\nA fourth issue is the extreme bureaucratization of\nsome of the specialized agencies of the United Nations\nsystem and the lack of coordination of their activities, as\nwell as the lack of political support by the Members for\nother agencies, such as the United Nations Industrial\nDevelopment Organization (UNIDO), which carry out very\nuseful functions.\nThe enthusiasm generated by the end of the bipolar\nconfrontation has lessened due to the emergence of vast and\npainful ethnic, religious and regional conflicts, especially in\nthe former Yugoslavia and in several countries in Africa \u2014\nconflicts whose resolution we must urgently seek.\nFortunately, there are reasons for optimism, such as the\nprogress achieved in the negotiations in the Middle East,\nwhich we must acknowledge and continue to encourage.\nWe view with special satisfaction the progress of the\nnegotiations toward a firm and lasting peace in Guatemala,\nto which the Secretary-General and the Group of Friends,\namong them Mexico, have greatly contributed.\nThe issue of disarmament has for many years been a\npriority on the agenda of the international community. Just\na few months ago, we agreed on the indefinite extension of\nthe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. At\nthe same time, we reaffirmed by consensus important\ncommitments relating to disarmament, including agreement\nby all nuclear weapon States to make systematic and\nprogressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally, with\nthe goal of eliminating these weapons within a programme\nof general and complete disarmament. We now need to\nestablish deadlines for the attainment of these objectives\nand remain vigilant, through the review mechanism we also\napproved at the Conference, in monitoring the commitments\nentered into.\nNevertheless, the vast majority of members of the\ninternational community are clearly dissatisfied with the\npace of the negotiations on the subject. It would seem that\nthe necessary political will does not exist to take advantage\nof the detente between the major military Powers to move\nahead in the sphere of disarmament. Rather, the fear\npersists that this process may be reversible. This of course\nmakes it advisable to redouble efforts to make progress\non disarmament issues, as well as to devote attention to\na specific programme of mutual confidence-building\nmeasures among States.\nThe conclusion in 1996 of a treaty of universal\nvalidity proclaiming an absolute ban on nuclear-weapon\ntests in all environments is the priority task in the\ndisarmament field. This treaty, currently being negotiated\nin Geneva, should be opened for signature before the\nbeginning of the next session of the General Assembly.\nWith a view to speeding up the attainment of that\nobjective, all the nuclear-weapon States should embrace\nthe \u201czero option\u201d, as the United States of America, France\nand the United Kingdom have already done.\nThe Government of Mexico is extremely concerned\nat the recent decisions by the People\u2019s Republic of China\nand France to conduct nuclear-weapon tests despite\nrepeated calls by the international community for them to\ndesist from such action. We condemn those tests and\nreiterate our respectful but firm appeal to these countries\nto proclaim a moratorium which will remain in force until\nthe nuclear test-ban treaty is concluded. The States parties\nto the Treaty of Tlatelolco and the member States of the\nTreaty of Rarotonga will be submitting a draft resolution\nto that end for consideration by the Assembly. Moreover,\nwe share the view of those States that have indicated their\nsupport for the immediate launching of negotiations to\nensure the prohibition of the production of fissionable\nmaterials for nuclear weapons, which was indeed another\nof the commitments agreed to by consensus at the Review\nand Extension Conference of the Treaty on the\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.\nAlong with the efforts to bring about nuclear\ndisarmament, impetus must also be given to the process\nof conventional disarmament. Mexico supports and is\nencouraging the negotiation of conventional-disarmament\nagreements which will ensure transparency and limit the\nmanufacture and trade in and transfer of certain types of\nconventional weapons, both regionally and worldwide.\nIn the Conference on conventional weapons now\nunder way in Vienna, Mexico will promote the\nprohibition of the use, production, storage and transfer of\nland-mines and will submit proposals on the use of\nsmall-calibre weapons, cluster bombs, flechettes and\nair-fueled explosives.\n16\n\n\nThe fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations give us\nan opportunity to reflect on what has been achieved and on\nwhat we need to change. It should be recalled that the past\nyear has also marked the fiftieth anniversary of the\ninstitutions established at the memorable Bretton Woods\nmeeting. The agreements that set up the International\nMonetary Fund and the World Bank have promoted\neconomic cooperation over the five decades following their\nestablishment. The globalization of production, of trade and,\nabove all, of finance, is undoubtedly a stimulant to\neconomic development. Yet it could cause crises which\nthese financial institutions are not at present able to meet\neffectively.\nMexico recognizes and is grateful for the support\nreceived from the international community in the financial\ncrisis it has experienced. The enormous efforts being made\nevery day by the Mexican people to resolve this situation\nwould have had to be even greater if we had not been able\nto count on the support of the international community,\nboth from friendly Governments and from multilateral\nagencies. Nevertheless, we must acknowledge that the\nMexican crisis has afforded evidence of the vulnerability of\nthe international financial system as a whole.\nFor the modern State, and especially for developing\ncountries, the successful conclusion of our structural-change\nprocess requires a stable international financial system, the\ntimely and effective financial support that the international\nfinancing institutions can extend to us, and the ability of\nthose institutions to detect and prevent crises facing\nmember countries in the external sector.\nLet me now comment on the economic situation in my\ncountry. Mexico decided to face head-on the problems\nwhich led to the financial crisis head-on and to establish\nimmediately, with the support of the international\ncommunity, a strict economic programme entailing dynamic\nbut necessary adjustment measures.\nWe have taken difficult decisions, with a clear\npurpose: to recognize the need for adjustment while\nmitigating its costs to the fullest possible extent and at the\nsame time constructing a new platform for the sustained\ndevelopment of the economy.\nAs of now, inflation in Mexico is markedly declining,\nas are interest rates; productive activity in key sectors of\nthe economy is beginning to regain its dynamism; and the\nMexican economy is continuing its process of structural\ntransformation with a view to maintaining and increasing\nour competitiveness. The balance of trade, which was in\nsevere deficit, is now showing a surplus, and we are\ncontinuing to look for other markets in the world, be they\ndeveloped or developing, in order to diversify our trade.\nWe fully recognize the social costs of the crisis, and\nsteps are being taken to mitigate its effects. To assess the\nsituation in its true light, however, it is not sufficient to\nconsider only the cost of the present economic policy.\nThe still greater cost that would have been incurred if\ndecisive action had not been taken in this serious situation\nmust also be taken into account.\nMexico will continue to insist not only on the\napplication of existing treaties in force, the universally\nrecognized principles of law and the decisions of\ninternational tribunals, but also on the major contribution\nmade by some United Nations resolutions to the\ndevelopment of international law.\nTherefore, we denounce in this forum, mankind\u2019s\nhighest, any attempt to apply, on an extraterritorial basis\nthe laws of a State to citizens of third countries, as the\nmisnamed \u201cFreedom and Democratic Solidarity with Cuba\nAct\u201d would do. We appeal to the sense of justice, equity\nand international solidarity of the United States Congress\nto stop what would be, if passed, a clear violation of\ninternational law and an unacceptable political precedent\nfor the rest of the world.\nAs a further clear demonstration of our commitment\nto the rule of law as a standard of conduct, and in\nresponse to the appeal made by the Secretary-General in\nhis document entitled \u201cAn Agenda for Peace\u201d, Mexico\nwould be prepared to withdraw the reservation made in its\nstatement of acceptance of the compulsory jurisdiction of\nthe International Court of Justice if other countries did the\nsame.\nMexico supports the principle of shared\nresponsibility among nations for the major issues of the\nnew world agenda: the maintenance of a just peace in the\nworld, the fight against poverty, moves to ensure\ninternational financial stability, free trade, the battle\nagainst drug trafficking, the regulation of migratory\nmovements, with strict respect for the human rights of\nmigrants, the strengthening of democracy, and the\nprotection of human rights. Furthermore, on a selective\nbasis, we think it is appropriate to formulate action\nprogrammes through world conferences, such as the\nInternational Conference on Population and Development,\nin Cairo, and the World Summit on Social Development,\nin Copenhagen; and the incorporation of women in our\n17\n\n\nsociety on equal terms on the basis of the recent Beijing\nDeclaration and Platform for Action.\nDrug consumption and trafficking have become one of\nthe principal threats to the health and welfare of societies,\nendangering their economic, political and social structures.\nDrug trafficking and related illicit activities, such as the\nillegal traffic in arms, money laundering, terrorism,\ncorruption and other criminal activities, constitute the most\nimportant challenge to the administration of justice in many\ncountries.\nIt is essential for the international community to\nredouble its efforts to eliminate the demand, production,\nsupply, trafficking and illegal distribution of drugs. It is\nvital to forge new consensus around an international\nstrategy against drug trafficking. For this reason, the\nPresident of Mexico, Mr. Ernesto Zedillo, has proposed the\nholding of an international conference to work out propose\nnew solutions to this problem. The tenth anniversary of the\nUnited Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in\nNarcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances seems a\nparticularly appropriate time for such a gathering.\nWe trust that the General Assembly at this session will\nsee merit in and find full justification for our proposal,\nwhich has already been endorsed by a significant number\nof countries, and we reaffirm, of course, our readiness to\nengage in broad dialogue on the scope and content of this\ninitiative.\nNew forms of intolerance, racism and xenophobia\nthreaten world peace. The United Nations must carry out an\nurgent analysis of the growing significance of international\nmigratory flows in all geographical regions which are today\naffected by such destructive attitudes. We call on the\ninternational community to initiate a dialogue which will\nmake it possible to find constructive solutions to this\nphenomenon, in a context of full respect for the human\nrights of migrants and their families, including workers\u2019\nrights.\nStarting with this general debate, the United Nations\nis entering upon a period as full as of uncertainty as of\nopportunity. The twenty-first century will differ from all the\npreceding centuries in that, for the first time, we shall have\nthe opportunity of building a truly world-wide civilization,\nand, by the same token, a set of universal values to guide\nand modulate the activity of all States. The emergence of\na collective awareness, the inexhaustible talent of human\nbeings and the desire that negotiation and understanding\nshould prevail over any idea of force or imposition are the\ncornerstones of a new world order in which there will be\nroom for the richest and most noble contributions of all\npeoples.\nIn the phase the United Nations is now entering,\nMexico will maintain its unswerving support for the\ngreatest causes of mankind. As part of this commitment,\nwe shall bring the moral qualities, the pacifist vocation\nand the spirit of solidarity of the Mexican people to bear\non the building of an international system capable of\nimproving the human condition and ensuring the dignity\nand survival of mankind and of the planet that we share\nwith one another.\n"

        "file_text": "It is with great\npleasure that I congratulate you, Mr. President, on your\nelection as President of the General Assembly at this\nfiftieth session, at which we are commemorating the\nfounding of the United Nations half a century ago. Your\nvast experience as a statesman and scholar is our assurance\nthat this session will be crowned with success.\nI wish to thank your distinguished predecessor, the\nForeign Minister of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, whose untiring efforts to\nstimulate the reform process in our world Organization\ndeserve special gratitude.\nAustria, a member of the European Union since 1\nJanuary 1995, fully endorses the comprehensive statement\nmade on behalf of the Union by His Excellency Mr. Javier\nSolana Madariaga, the Spanish Foreign Minister.\nThe Austrian Federal Government is strongly\ncommitted to the objectives of the United Nations Charter\nand to the work of the Organization. The United Nations\nhas traditionally been a priority of the Austrian foreign\npolicy. Later this year, on 14 December, Austria will\ncelebrate the 40th birthday of its admission to membership\nof the United Nations.\nLast June, our Parliament held a commemorative\nsession on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the\nsigning of the United Nations Charter at San Francisco. At\nthat meeting, all political parties represented in Parliament\npraised the achievements of the United Nations, expressed\ntheir appreciation of the untiring efforts of the Secretary-\nGeneral in the quest for peace, justice and development,\nand reaffirmed the commitment of Austria to a strong and\nvibrant United Nations.\nAustria\u2019s strong commitment to the world\nOrganization is reflected in Vienna\u2019s role as one of the\nHeadquarters of the United Nations. The Federal\nGovernment and the City of Vienna lend maximum support\nto the United Nations Office as well as to the United\nNations agencies and programmes based in our capital.\nMore than 36,000 Austrians have served as \u201cblue\nhelmets\u201d in United Nations peace-keeping operations,\nsome of them as force commanders. More than 30 of our\ncountrymen have lost their lives in the service of peace.\nThis dedication to peace-keeping led the Federal\nGovernment to organize the Vienna Seminar on\nPeacemaking and Peace-Keeping for the Next Century,\nwhich was opened by the Secretary-General of the United\nNations in March of this year. The report on this\nConference was distributed this morning.\nMy country also attaches particular importance to\ncivilian peace-keeping and sponsors a very successful\ntraining programme on civilian peace-keeping and\npeace-building. At the city of Schlaining, this programme\nprepares election observers, human rights observers and\nhumanitarian affairs officers for their difficult tasks.\nConcrete proposals for improving the civilian components\nof United Nations field missions were formulated at the\nInternational Conference on the Preparation of Civilian\nPersonnel of United Nations Field Missions. In addition,\nAustria makes concerted efforts to support the United\nNations preventive diplomacy capabilities. The Austrian\nGovernment will provide the Secretary-General with a list\nof personalities whose great experience will be at the\ndisposal of the United Nations.\nAfter the end of the cold war, new hopes were\nvested in the Security Council. The United Nations took\ndecisive action in response to military aggression against\na sovereign State and undertook successful multipurpose\npeace-keeping missions to resolve several long-standing\nconflicts.\nAt the same time, however, the international\ncommunity and the Security Council were called upon to\nhandle radically new situations. The United Nations had\nto respond to these new types of conflict with its\ntraditional instruments: peace-keeping missions were\ndeployed to keep a non-existent peace. As we all know,\nthe United Nations missions in Somalia and in Bosnia and\nHerzegovina led to humiliation for the Organization and\nthe international community.\nWith regard to Bosnia and Herzegovina there is at\nlast some realistic hope that the renewed determination of\nthe United Nations, combined with the decisive support of\nNATO, may bring about a durable settlement and - above\nall - put an end to the plight of millions of innocent\n21\n\n\nvictims, of whom the citizens of Sarajevo have become the\nsymbol. Terminating the barbaric siege of the Bosnian\ncapital, which has lasted since the spring of 1992, carries\nparticular significance.\nAustria fully supports the initiative undertaken by the\nUnited States, in the framework of the Contact Group, to\nreach a comprehensive peace agreement that will ensure the\nexistence and territorial integrity of the Republic of Bosnia\nand Herzegovina and the peaceful reintegration of Eastern\nSlavonia. We welcome the agreement on Basic Principles\nreached in New York earlier this week as an important\nfurther step on the long and difficult road to peace.\nWe remain deeply concerned about the fate of\nhundreds of thousands of refugees. Austria attaches the\nutmost importance to the rights of all refugees and\ndisplaced persons to freely return to their homes, as already\nstated by the London Conference of August 1992.\nLet me equally stress how important it is for the future\nof the region that all crimes be brought to light and the\nculprits punished. In this context, the War Crimes Tribunal\nset up in The Hague can play a crucial role.\nThe efforts of the United Nations troops and their\ncommanders, who constantly risk their lives for the cause\nof peace, deserve our admiration. I should like also to\nhonour the memory of three of the main architects of the\nUnited States peace initiative who last August became\nvictims of the siege of Sarajevo.\nDuring that same month, the Special Rapporteur of the\nUnited Nations Commission on Human Rights, Mr.\nTadeusz Mazowiecki, resigned over what he called\n\u201cthe lack of consistency and courage displayed by the\ninternational community\u201d.\nHis relentless efforts in pointing out and documenting\ncrimes against humanity committed in the war have earned\nhim our highest respect. We welcome the continuation of\nthis important task under the eminent leadership of Ms.\nRehn.\nA comprehensive settlement also needs to include\nsatisfactory solutions for minorities, not only in Croatia and\nBosnia and Herzegovina, but also in the Federal Republic\nof Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) and in particular in\nKosovo, Vojvodina and Sanjak.\nThe prospect of a well-coordinated contribution by\nthe world community to the reconstruction of the\ndevastated areas and to the relaunching of economic\nactivities could help in facilitating the prospects for peace\nand its eventual consolidation.\nFurthermore, Austria believes that regional arms-\ncontrol measures will be another decisive factor in the\neffort to secure peace and should therefore be initiated as\nearly as possible.\nIn the Middle East, long and arduous negotiations\nhave now led to an important breakthrough. We applaud\nas a major step towards final peace and cooperation in the\nregion yesterday\u2019s signing of the agreement between\nIsrael and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) on\nthe transfer of authority.\nToday, the main threats to peace and security are no\nlonger predominantly attacks by one country against\nanother sovereign State. We are faced with conflicts\noriginating in ethnic tensions, authoritarian rule, economic\ndespair or migratory movements. Peace and security are\ntherefore threatened not only by violations of the code of\nconduct among States, but increasingly by violations of\ninternational standards on the relationship between\ncitizens and their Governments and among different\ngroups within countries. Our instruments for conflict\nresolution have to be adapted to these new circumstances.\nPart of this effort has to be an enhanced early-\nwarning capacity of the United Nations. The earlier the\nUnited Nations can attempt to mediate, the more likely\nare its missions to meet with success. By increasing the\nnumber of cases where preventive diplomacy can be used\nsuccessfully \u2014 thus avoiding the need for military peace-\nkeeping \u2014 an early-warning system would also be a great\ninvestment.\nWe also need to reinforce the capacity of the United\nNations to assist Member States in their efforts to\nimprove democratic structures, including the holding of\nfree and fair elections, the full observance of human\nrights, the rights of minorities and fundamental freedoms,\nthe strengthening of the rule of law, the fostering of\npopular participation and accountability of Governments,\nand the development of a prosperous civil society.\nFurthermore, the capacity of the United Nations needs to\nbe strengthened in order to confront new threats to peace\nand security, such as organized crime and illicit\ntrafficking in drugs.\n22\n\n\nAustria has always been strongly committed to\ndisarmament, arms control and non-proliferation. We trust\nthat the indefinite extension of the Treaty on the Non-\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) earlier this year\nwill permit and encourage further substantial disarmament\nmeasures, in particular the early conclusion of a\ncomprehensive test-ban treaty. We are confident that\nnegotiations on the treaty will be concluded next year and\nthat the decision by one or more of the nuclear Powers to\nconduct additional nuclear-weapons tests \u2014 a decision that\ncontinues to cause deep concern in Austria \u2014 will not\ndelay the conclusion of the negotiations.\nIn this context, allow me to reiterate the invitation of\nthe Austrian Federal Government to establish the future\ncomprehensive test-ban treaty organization in Vienna, and\nto express my gratitude for the widespread support this\nproposal has received and continues to receive.\nThe human rights agenda has for many years been\ndominated by the quest to establish international standards,\nculminating in the adoption of the Vienna Declaration and\nProgramme of Action. The recent Fourth World Conference\non Women, held in Beijing, strongly reaffirmed the central\nrole of these documents in the struggle for human rights\nand their special significance in the context of the human\nrights of women. Today, we have to concentrate on the\nimplementation of these standards. We must take all\nnecessary measures to fulfil our international human rights\nobligations vis-\u00e0-vis our own peoples; we have to take a\nfirm stand against human rights violations, wherever they\noccur; and we must assist Governments genuinely\ncommitted to improving the human rights situation in their\ncountries.\nThe ever-more urgent question of minority rights\nneeds to be an integral part of this agenda. In this context,\nI should like to mention that Austria and Italy together have\narrived at an autonomous solution concerning the Austrian\nminority in South Tyrol, Italy, which could inspire other\nminorities and which is continuing to develop in a positive\nand dynamic way.\nIn order to implement the human rights agenda, we\nmust better integrate the United Nations human rights\nprogrammes, under the leadership of the High\nCommissioner for Human Rights, into the mainstream of\nUnited Nations activities. Based on the lessons learned and\nexperiences acquired within the United Nations system, we\nshould further improve the instrument of on-site human\nrights monitoring. We firmly believe in the need to\nstrengthen the United Nations programme of technical\nassistance in the field of human rights and the technical\ncooperation programme in the field of crime prevention\nand criminal justice.\nAustria also welcomes the great efforts the United\nNations system has made to cope with humanitarian\ncrises. As a country that has received Bosnian refugees \u2014\nwho number approximately one per cent of the total\nAustrian population \u2014 Austria is particularly aware of the\nhuman dimensions of the refugee problem. Delivering\nhumanitarian assistance, particularly in the field of major\nman-made catastrophes, has become an important\nchallenge. The well-being of millions of people, be they\nin Rwanda, Somalia or Bosnia and Herzegovina, depends\non this assistance and the selfless work of many\nspecialized United Nations bodies and agencies, such as\nthe High Commissioner for Refugees, the World Food\nProgramme, UNICEF and the Department for\nHumanitarian Affairs. Many people owe their very\nsurvival to these organizations\u2019 activities. Through its\ncontributions to the European Community Humanitarian\nOffice (ECHO), Austria shares in the support given to\nmultilateral humanitarian programmes by their biggest\ndonor, the European Union. My Government will do its\nutmost to enhance direct Austrian contributions to United\nNations programmes as part of our \u201cburden sharing\u201d in\nthe field of multilateral humanitarian assistance.\nAdapting the United Nations institutional structures\nto today\u2019s reality also requires reform of the Security\nCouncil. It needs to be enlarged by those Powers whose\ninternational influence has increased over the last 50\nyears. However, any enlargement of the Council must\nneither compromise its efficiency nor the opportunities of\nsmaller countries to be represented in the Council.\nIn our intensive deliberations about the composition\nand procedures of the Council, we must not lose sight of\nits primary function. Security Council resolutions are\neffective only if they gain political relevance outside this\nbuilding and if parties to a conflict abide by them. If\nSecurity Council resolutions are to facilitate political\nsolutions of international crises, they must reflect the\npolitical will of Member States to implement them.\nAustria welcomes the reform efforts undertaken by\nthe Secretary-General in the area of management of the\nUnited Nations. We hope that these initiatives will be\nfurther pursued. We are pleased to see that the Office of\nInternal Oversight Services has become operational. We\nsupport the strengthening of this Office in order to further\nenhance stringent control mechanisms and thus increase\n23\n\n\nMember States\u2019 confidence that the Organization is\nefficiently managed.\nAbove all, the United Nations has to be an\norganization in which problem-solving on all issues is\nclosely monitored in an integrated manner. Coordination\nand cooperation among international organizations such as\nthe United Nations, the World Bank, the International\nMonetary Fund (IMF) and the World Trade Organization\n(WTO) need to be increased.\nIn its fiftieth year, the United Nations is suffering\nfrom a chronic financial crisis that needs to be resolved\nurgently. A comprehensive and thorough reform is\nnecessary. Member States must pay their assessed\ncontributions in full, on time and without conditions.\nUnder the co-chairmanship of Austria, the High-level\nOpen-ended Working Group on the Financial Situation of\nthe United Nations has prepared the ground for agreement\non comprehensive reform measures. A solution to the\nfinancial crisis will have to be based on the continued\nrecognition of the special responsibility of the Permanent\nMembers of the Security Council, as well as on a scale of\nassessment reflecting today\u2019s economic realities.\nIn the future, the United Nations system will need\nadditional financing mechanisms for the funding of global\npriorities. A number of proposals have already been made,\nincluding minimal charges on foreign exchange transactions\nand charges to be levied on international airline travel. The\npoint has been made that all these proposals require\nin-depth consideration by competent bodies. Austria\ntherefore proposes that the General Assembly should decide\non a comprehensive study to be undertaken by various\ncomponents of the United Nations system in collaboration\nwith outside experts in order to advance the international\ndiscussion on charges or taxes pertaining to such\ninternational transactions.\nNegotiations on the crucial issue of reform are under\nway. Reform is possible only if Member States are truly\ncommitted to the Organization, which is and remains the\nonly forum to address global issues. Let us use this historic\nfiftieth session of the General Assembly to commit\nourselves to decisive reform in order to make our\nOrganization fit for the challenges of the next century.\n"

        "file_text": "First of all, allow me to congratulate my\ncolleague, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Portugal,\nProfessor Diogo Freitas Do Amaral, on the occasion of\nhis election to the high post of the President of the\nGeneral Assembly.\nEach of the 50 sessions of the General Assembly has\nbeen a step for the international community on a difficult\nroad in search of peace within itself, for the strengthening\nof the indispensable role of the United Nations. The\ncurrent session will be marked as the anniversary session\nby the addresses to be made by the Heads of State and\nGovernment in late October. Russia\u2019s views on the\nprospects and difficulties of establishing partnership in a\nmulti-polar and interdependent world \u2014 and it is with\nequal partnership that we link our national and state\ninterests \u2014 will be stated by the Head of the Russian\nState, President Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin.\nIf half a century of experience of the United Nations\nteaches us anything, it teaches us first of all that only the\nequality of States and respect for the diversity of cultures,\nreligions and national traditions can serve as the basis for\nsecurity and prosperity in the modern world. But the\nformula \u201cunity in diversity\u201d also presupposes everyone\u2019s\ncompliance with fundamental principles of international\nlaw and order, respect for human rights and the\n6\n\n\npromotion of economic progress. This is the essence of the\nUnited Nations Charter, which identifies both common\nideals and goals and equal rights and obligations for all\nStates without \u201cdouble standards\u201d.\nThey say that generals always prepare for the last war.\nPoliticians and diplomats have no right to prepare for the\nlast peace. On the contrary, it is necessary to avoid slipping\nback into a bloc mentality and dividing countries into\n\u201cfriends and foes\u201d, whether in politics or in economics.\nWe can indeed make the next 50 years an era of the\nUnited Nations if we accept as its basis the indivisibility of\ninternational security and sustainable social and economic\ndevelopment for all.\nThis question becomes more and more acute against\nthe background of humanitarian disasters in Africa and\nother regions of the \u201cthird world\u201d, and the social price of\nthe initial stage of reforms in the post-socialist countries.\nNo one will be able to hide from global problems behind\ndividing lines of national egotism and economic\ndiscrimination, or even expanding military alliances. Such\nthings will not rein in, but rather spur on the spread of\ninternational terrorism and drugs, and whip up the flames\nof local conflicts and the arms race.\nOne of the principles of the \u201cAgenda for\nDevelopment\u201d which is being formulated now should be the\nearly elimination of the remaining discriminatory\nrestrictions in the world economy, trade and technology\ntransfer. In particular, Russia, which is successfully\nimplementing unparalleled reforms, should be recognized as\nan equal trade and economic partner with an economy in\ntransition.\nSuch a strategy should also provide for the promotion\nof the economic rehabilitation of countries and regions\naffected by armed conflicts. The United Nations, its\nspecialized agencies and Member States should immediately\nbegin to address directly the problem of the economic\nrehabilitation of Bosnia and the former Yugoslavia as a\nwhole, whose peoples have suffered from war and\neconomic sanctions that have been in effect for too long.\nRussia is ready to take an active part in these efforts, and\nwe do and will continue to contribute substantially to a\npolitical settlement. The real chances for such a settlement\nshould not be sacrificed to power or unilateral approaches.\nThe international community should make equally\ngreat efforts to achieve progress in all aspects of the peace\nprocess in the Middle East and the post-conflict\nrehabilitation of all States of that region. We congratulate\nIsrael and the Palestinians on the occasion of their\nreaching an agreement in Taba, whose official signing\nceremony will take place on 28 September next in\nWashington under the chairmanship of President Clinton.\nWe intend to continue our joint efforts with the United\nStates and to make our contribution to the coming\nAmman summit conference.\nEurope needs a new model of general and\ncomprehensive security, without double standards or\ndividing lines.\nInternational dialogue on this issue is already under\nway. I believe that the active involvement of the United\nNations and its specialized agencies is necessary to the\nefforts aimed at the development of this model.\nIncidentally, the General Assembly was born in the Old\nWorld.\nA new approach is required to disarmament issues in\nEurope. On the basis of the implementation of the\nConventional Armed Forces in Europe Treaty (certainly\ntaking into account new realities) as early as next spring\nwe should arrive at new major agreements based on the\nunity of the vital security interests of the peoples of the\ncontinent instead of the bloc logic of the past.\nOur proposal to all nuclear-weapon States to\nelaborate a treaty on nuclear safety and strategic stability\nhas become even more timely.\nThe indefinite extension of the Non-Proliferation\nTreaty establishes favourable conditions for this. Our\ncommon task is to create the necessary political\nconditions for those States that have not already done so\nto accede to it as non-nuclear States. We consider it\nnecessary, as a matter of priority, to conclude as soon as\npossible, but not later than 1996, work on the\ncomprehensive test-ban treaty. From this rostrum, Russia\ncalls for a universal and permanent moratorium on\nnuclear tests.\nThe summit of the \u201cPolitical Eight\u201d on nuclear\nsafety, which is to be held next spring in Moscow at the\ninitiative of the President of Russia and which was\napproved in Halifax, will make a major contribution to\nglobal stability.\nWe would like the United Nations to take urgent\nmeasures on the prevention of illicit trafficking in light\nfirearms and the proliferation of anti-personnel mines. It\n7\n\n\nis these \u201clight\u201d firearms that have led to enormous human\nlosses in Rwanda and Angola, Liberia and Bosnia,\nTajikistan and Abkhazia. Russia has already introduced a\nmoratorium on the export of the most dangerous types of\nanti-personnel mines. We urge other States to follow our\nexample.\nThis issue should be seriously considered in the United\nNations Disarmament Commission. While supporting the\nactivities of the Commission, we believe that it should\nadopt a new agenda corresponding to the current scale of\ncooperation in the area of security and to new threats and\nchallenges in this field.\nThe problem of global adherence to a single standard\nin the area of human rights and basic democratic\ninstitutions is very acute. Russia, approaching free,\nmultipartite parliamentary and presidential elections, is\nmaking its own contribution to the establishment of these\nvery standards. We invite observers from foreign States and\ninternational organizations to attend the forthcoming\nelections.\nIt was not so long ago that dozens of agenda items of\nthe General Assembly were devoted to the struggle against\napartheid. Now it seems unbelievable that this problem has\nbeen solved, owing to a large extent, to the efforts of the\nUnited Nations. I sincerely welcome the accomplishments\nof the people and the Government of South Africa, headed\nby Nelson Mandela, in the democratization and creation of\na free, multiracial society.\nBut did we manage to overcome the danger of\nviolence arising through fascism, racism, and political and\nreligious extremism? Alas, the answer is far from\nreassuring. That is why the international community has no\nright to abandon its efforts in this direction and must not\ntolerate the emergence of double standards.\nThe signing of the CIS conventions on human rights\nand fundamental freedoms and on the rights of national and\nlanguage minorities was the response of the CIS States to\nthe United Nations recommendations on the creation of a\nsingle humanitarian sphere in this part of the world.\nHowever, much has yet to be done before a unitary\napproach to human rights can become a norm of life for,\namong others, 25 million of our compatriots in some\ncountries of the Commonwealth and the Baltic States. A\ndouble standard here is unacceptable.\nRussia is interested in the adoption at this session of\ndecisions on such issues as the struggle against racism, all\nforms of xenophobia and aggressive nationalism, ensuring\nthe rights of minorities and the promotion of democracy\nand the rule of law in countries in transition. The United\nNations should further pursue its policy of qualitative\nimprovement of the international human rights protection\nmachinery, primarily by strengthening its control and\npreventive functions and enhancing its focus on specific\naction. The policy of single standards must become an\nincontestable rule in the sphere of peace-keeping as well.\nJustice without force is powerless, while force without\njustice is tyrannical.\nThere have been many achievements in United\nNations peace-keeping efforts. Without the Blue Helmets,\nthe world would be much more dangerous and dozens of\nconflicts would have been much more bloody. We are\nproud that approximately 20,000 Russian servicemen are\nserving as peace-keepers in United Nations and CIS\noperations.\nHowever, if we want force always to go hand-in-\nhand with justice in the activities of the United Nations\nand those who cooperate in them, strict observance of\nSecurity Council decisions must be ensured. Here, the\nSecretary-General and his staff can always count on the\nsupport of Russia and, I am confident, of all other\nMembers of the United Nations. The United Nations\nshould be protected from setbacks like that which has\noccurred in Bosnia.\nIn general, it is necessary radically to improve\nUnited Nations peace-keeping through precision of the\ncriteria and terms of the United Nations involvement in\nareas of tension; a close linkage between peace-keeping\noperations and efforts to achieve the peaceful settlement\nof conflicts; the efficient operation of the whole\nfunctional chain \u2014 peace-keeping planning, command\nand control. We are for the earliest possible\nimplementation of the Secretary-General\u2019s proposal on the\nestablishment of United Nations reserve forces.\nWe welcome the conclusion of the Convention on\nthe protection of United Nations personnel, which I\nsigned today on behalf of Russia. This instrument will\nhelp to save lives of hundreds of peace-keepers in hot\nspots of the world.\nPeace-making activities undertaken by Russia and its\nCommonwealth partners contribute to a considerable\nextent to ensuring regional and international stability. We\nappreciate fruitful cooperation with the United Nations in\nTajikistan and Georgia. However, the United Nations\n8\n\n\nsupport of our collective efforts sometimes unfortunately\nreminds us of a saying: \u201cToo little, too late\u201d. Russia,\ntogether with its CIS partners, expects the United Nations\nto make a radical change in its attitude towards peace-\nmaking problems in our part of the world.\nDuring the 50 years of the existence of the United\nNations, sanctions have been an instrument that the\nOrganization has used to deal with the instigators of\nconflicts. Now, the time has come to give this instrument\na more selective and precise nature. The principal criteria\nin this regard are: distinct objectives underlying sanctions,\nadvanced coordination of conditions, and mechanisms for\nlifting them once the objectives are attained.\nAs a newly elected member of the Executive Council\nof the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for\nRefugees, Russia intends to make an essential contribution\nto overcoming a new global crisis, namely the tragedy of\nmillions of refugees. To this end, we intend to seek\npractical results from the international conference on\nrefugees and migrants within the post-Soviet space.\nAt this session the General Assembly should give new\nimpetus to collective efforts by the international community\nin combating crime, illicit drug-trafficking and terrorism.\nThe explosions in Oklahoma and Paris, the taking of\nhostages in Budennovsk and chemical terrorist attacks in\nTokyo \u2014 these are bells tolling for us all.\nWhatever agenda item we consider, we are convinced\ntime and again that the answers are to be found only on the\nbasis of a single standard: respect for the United Nations\nCharter and for the purposes and principles of the United\nNations that have withstood the severe tests of the past five\ndecades and are lighting the way into the twenty-first\ncentury.\n"

        "file_text": "The United Nations has today reached a historic\nturning-point for at this session, we are celebrating the\nfiftieth anniversary of its founding. I am convinced that\nthis Assembly will benefit greatly from the President\u2019s\nvast experience as a distinguished jurist. On behalf of my\ndelegation, I would like to extend to Mr. Freitas do\nAmaral my sincere congratulations on his election to the\npresidency of the General Assembly for a session which\nwill undoubtedly prove to be productive.\nWe are deeply indebted to Mr. Amara Essy for the\nactive and competent way in which he conducted the\nproceedings of the forty-ninth session of the General\nAssembly. It should indeed be noted that a number of\nproblems and reforms had the benefit of particular\nattention under his presidency.\nWe would also like to express our gratitude and our\nhigh regard to the Secretary-General for his enlightened\nand pragmatic leadership. Today, more than ever, the\nuniversality of the United Nations offers to many of us\nthe possibility of having our voices heard throughout the\nworld. We would also congratulate the Secretary-General\non his efforts to preserve and strengthen the role of the\nUnited Nations in its work for peace, collective security\nand development.\nThe situation in the world today, marked as it is by\na multiplicity of hotbeds of tension, demonstrates to us \u2014\nif that were necessary \u2014 the paramount role of the\nUnited Nations. This is naturally a subject for reflection\n22\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\n\nand of course a useful matter for us to ponder when we\nanalyse our compliance with the Charter and the ideals set\nforth in it as we now stand on the threshold of an era\nwhich, without any doubt, will prove vital for mankind.\nToday, indeed, we are living in a different world \u2014 a\nworld which the end of the cold war has stripped of the\nstructures and priorities that were familiar to it. New crises,\ndifficult to understand and to which we must today find\nappropriate responses, have arisen in all parts of the world.\nNeither States nor even regions can deal with them\neffectively and individually.\nThe explosion of ethnic identities, too long suppressed,\nand the breaking up of States, have posed formidable\nchallenges to the international community, thus threatening\ninternational peace and security. The crises that are\nravaging the world today are not as specific as those of the\ncold-war era. Since they fall outside the focus of interest of\nthe great Powers, the responsibility for action falls on the\nUnited Nations. However, the absence of clear-cut\nmandates, plus the inadequacy of resources, is partially\nresponsible for the performance of the United Nations in its\nnew role as guarantor of peace. In the light of these\ncircumstances, it is no surprise that early intervention is\noften late in coming. But when the United Nations does\npossess the necessary resources and support, it can achieve\ncommendable results.\nThe persistence of social and economic crises, the\ncollapse of Governments and structures underlie this\noutbreak of civil conflicts in the world. It is clear that it is\nnot enough simply to separate the combatants and stop the\nfighting in order to eliminate the multidimensional causes\nof these conflicts. Until these causes are understood and\ncombated from the very outset of the crisis, we will never\nbe in a position to combat the flagrant acts of violence\nagainst civilian populations. Until we are ready to offer\nfirm resistance to injustice, to acts of aggression, to\ncontinuing violations of human rights and peoples, we will\nbe doomed to watching history repeat itself over and over\nagain. Recent experiences of the United Nations have\ndemonstrated this, but none of them is more revealing than\nthe history of Bosnia.\nNothing has contributed as much as Bosnia to\nengendering a feeling of outrage within the international\ncommunity. Although numerous resolutions of the Security\nCouncil reaffirming the sovereignty and territorial integrity\nof Bosnia, confirming the inadmissibility of the annexation\nof territory by force and condemning \u201cethnic cleansing\u201d\nhave been adopted, the reaction of the international\ncommunity to the challenge posed by the Serbs has\nalways been hesitant and confused. The cost of this war\nin terms of loss of human life, hardship and material\ndestruction is frightening. Serb bombings have turned the\ndesignated \u201csafe areas\u201d into vast prisons. Sarajevo has\nsuffered by far the most from Serb strangulation.\nHowever, the fall of the \u201csafe areas\u201d of Srebrenica\nand Zepa marked a turning-point in the attitude of the\ngreat Powers in this long and bloody conflict. These acts\nof genocide undoubtedly constitute one of the greatest\nhumiliations for the international community since the\nSecond World War. The combined effects of bombings\nand diplomacy seem to have negated Serb domination on\nthe ground at the same time as it has promoted prospects\nfor peace. Furthermore, United Nations personnel and\nhumanitarian convoys are no longer exposed to Serb\nattacks thanks to the recent resolve shown by the North\nAtlantic Treaty Organization. For the time being,\naggression is not paying off and the Serbs seem to have\npartially renounced their traditional tactic of murdering\ncivilians with impunity. Over all, developments in the\nsituation have dealt a new hand and breathed new life\ninto the peace process. We welcome this new attitude, but\npeace must be both durable and honourable for all people.\nBosnia, as a sovereign State, must be protected. Similarly,\nSarajevo must be preserved as a multiracial and\nmulticultural city.\nThe handshake between President Arafat and Prime\nMinister Rabin in September 1993 was a source of great\nhope and we can but rejoice further at recent events. The\nsecond phase of negotiations led to the signing in\nWashington of the Taba Accord on 28 September 1995.\nWe can only welcome that outcome. We encourage the\ntwo parties to persevere in their efforts to expedite the\nimplementation of these agreements. They must strive to\ncontain the violence of extremists and to take all\nnecessary measures to strengthen mutual trust, which will,\nundoubtedly, contribute to lasting peace.\nThe mutual recognition of Israel and of the PLO has\nopened up a tremendous opportunity to strengthen peace\nand development in the Middle East, as well as trading\nand economic potential for the entire region. These are\nthe stakes and neither of the parties, neither the\nPalestinians nor the Israelis, should underestimate the\nimportance of this new perspective.\nSometimes there are mixed feelings about United\nNations efforts around the world to contain hostilities and\nsettle disputes. The United Nations has effectively been\n23\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\n\nparalysed and hamstrung by the lack of resources and the\nabsence of any precise mandate during the crisis in\nRwanda. The establishment of the International Tribunal,\nfor Rwanda which is responsible for trying and prosecuting\nthe persons guilty of genocide has also been delayed.\nSerious political dialogue can be broached, because it\nwould be hard to deny that those who promoted,\nencouraged or committed crimes must be taken to court.\nFurthermore, the whole issue of the reconciliation and\nreconstruction of the country has failed because of\npersistent internal tension and delays in the deployment of\ninternational aid. An enormous task still lies ahead, not just\nin terms of the repatriation of refugees but also of the\nreconstruction of destroyed infrastructures, including\nhousing, schools and medical facilities.\nIn many respects, there are great similarities between\nthe situation in Burundi and that in Rwanda. To date,\nall-out civil war has been avoided but the situation remains\nextremely volatile. The region as a whole is in need of true\nreconciliation. We welcome the efforts of the Secretary-\nGeneral, who is trying, through constant contact, dialogue\nand visits to the area, to resolve these complex problems.\nHis recent decision to appoint an experienced diplomat to\norganize a national conference to promote reconciliation\nand mutual understanding among the countries of the region\nis a wise decision.\nAfter almost two decades of fratricidal and destructive\nwarfare, Mozambique is today ready to begin the work of\nnational reconstruction following the peace process. We\nshould congratulate all the parties that have taken part in\nthe political transformation of Mozambique on having\nadhered to the peace process. Mozambique, with its\ntremendous potential for economic recovery and\ndevelopment, has a great future ahead, which it should turn\nto full advantage. This is a country for which the\ninternational community has every reason to congratulate\nitself for having given it timely support and substantial\nresources to back the peace process.\nIn Haiti, the refusal of the army to comply with the\npeace agreement and its intransigence in spite of the\ncondemnation of the international community left the\nUnited Nations with no alternative but to take resolute\naction, beginning with economic sanctions, and then\ninternational intervention. This made it possible for the\nUnited Nations to deploy a peace-keeping mission there.\nWith the return of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide,\npolitical violence and human rights violations have been\ngreatly reduced. There is now a basis for ensuring the\nsecurity of the population, guaranteeing increased political\nparticipation and consolidating democracy.\nThe untiring efforts in the long and difficult\nnegotiations in Lusaka to restore peace in Angola finally\nled to an agreement on a general cease-fire and the\nestablishment of a government. The United Nations\nplayed a prominent role in these negotiations with the full\nsupport of three observer States. Much remains to be\ndone, but progress has been steady and positive. The\nfuture of Angola will depend on the political will and\ndetermination of its leaders to forge a new vision, a new\nnation.\nIn Liberia, the determination of the United Nations\nand of the countries of the region has made it possible\nfinally to conclude an agreement between the parties.\nHostilities are nearing an end, and a cease-fire is to be\nnegotiated. This agreement, concluded just a month ago,\ndoes not mean that our troubles are over, but we can see\nthe light at the end of the tunnel. The Liberian people\nseem determined to put a final end to this long and\ndestructive war, and it is the duty of the international\ncommunity to contribute to this long-awaited outcome the\nnecessary resources and substantial support.\nLast year, we witnessed the end of United Nations\noperations in Somalia, when it became clear that the\ndetermination of the various Somali parties to reach a\ncompromise in the interests of the people of Somalia was\nvisibly lacking. Somalia has fallen into oblivion. It is\nsuffering from total political paralysis. Once again, it is\nthe same old story: warfare among factions. The country\nmust be helped to get off to a new start in order to create\nbetter prospects for peace and stability.\nWe must recall that the prospect of a new civil war\nis more likely than ever. The spectre of famine is looming\non the horizon. And the personnel of international aid\norganizations faces a difficult choice: to accept a state of\nincreasing insecurity or to abandon the country to chaos.\nWe want to hope that, no matter how complex and\ndesperate the political situation in Somalia, the\ninternational community will not abandon that country\nand will continue to provide the necessary support to the\nSomalis, in particular in the realm of humanitarian\nassistance. We hope, moreover, that our brothers in\nSomalia will find the path to wisdom and engage in\nconstructive negotiations to put an end to the suffering of\nthe Somali people.\n24\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\n\nMy country, the Republic of Djibouti, continues to\nface difficulties in our economic development that are\nexacerbated by the presence of refugees and displaced\npersons, which make up more than 25 per cent of our\npopulation. The pressure thus placed on our infrastructures,\nour medical services, our housing sector and on education\nand employment is more than we are able to deal with. The\ncumulative effects of the civil wars that have raged in\nrecent years, both in our country and in neighbouring\ncountries, and of natural disasters \u2014 drought as well as\nfloods \u2014 have seriously hindered our efforts in the area of\ndevelopment.\nA new era of peace and political stability has begun in\nmy country, which regained its reputation as an oasis of\npeace after the signing of the peace agreement of December\n1994 and the formation in June 1995 of a new Government\nthat reflected the new situation.\nOnce peace had been achieved, and without any\ntransition, we began the difficult process of redressing our\ncountry\u2019s finances and economy, which had been seriously\naffected by the consequences of three years of internal\nconflict and the negative world economic situation.\nThe first phase of a vast restructuring programme,\nproposed by the Government and approved by the\nParliament, has just been launched through the\nimplementation of various measures involving severe\nbudgetary restrictions. In addition to these measures, we are\ncurrently negotiating with the International Monetary Fund\nand the World Bank for the means to carry out a structural\nadjustment programme. Furthermore, in accordance with the\nresolutions of the Copenhagen World Summit for Social\nDevelopment, we wish to preserve our social achievements,\nwithout which no lasting development can be envisaged.\nOn the regional level, Djibouti is still working towards\nthe establishment of a climate of cooperation in all areas.\nThe member countries of the Inter-Governmental Authority\non Drought and Development (IGADD) and of the\nCommon Market for Eastern and Southern Africa\n(COMESA) have great potential and resources, and IGADD\nand COMESA are the best instruments for harmonization\nand coordination to maximize the exploitation of these\nresources.\nOn the international scene, Djibouti has discharged\nproductively and responsibly its current term in the Security\nCouncil, and thanks all the countries that have supported it.\nOur participation in peace-keeping operations, particularly\nin Rwanda and Haiti, where Djibouti\u2019s police and armed\nforces are currently serving, is one of the best proofs of\nthis.\nTogether with its neighbours, Djibouti hopes to be in\na position to struggle against, and overcome, the\nconsequences of instability and conflicts in our region.\nWe share the Secretary-General\u2019s view that the work\nof the United Nations is frequently misunderstood. The\ndevelopment crisis is often overlooked because of the\npriority given the short-term alleviation of emergency\nsituations. But development is no less urgent \u2014 quite to\nthe contrary \u2014 because today development is a global\nissue, and peace, the economy, the environment, social\njustice and democracy are its various aspects. The\npressures created by poverty, unemployment and social\ndisintegration are no longer contained within individual\nfrontiers; they affect our entire \u201cglobal village\u201d, moving\nfrom country to country and from region to region. Only\nconsistent growth and lasting development will be able to\nhalt them. But, clearly, no country, no region can alone\nsuccessfully face these problems. Even the best-\nperforming economies will face high unemployment if\nworld economic growth is not sufficient to absorb their\nproduction. If we restrict ourselves to promoting growth\nin some sectors to the exclusion of others, the result of\nthe growth will be unimpressive.\nBut it is most surprising that despite the fact that\nworld economic growth yields sufficient resources to\neasily eliminate extreme poverty from the face of the\nEarth, poverty not only persists but continues to increase.\nThe world has a great need of an engine for growth\nworldwide, a role played by the United States\nimmediately after the Second World War, when it\nbroadened world markets. But we can no longer hope that\na single country will take on this function. Likewise,\noutdated international economic policies and institutions\nare standing in the way of investments, the creation of\ndevelopment programmes and the markets necessary to\nincrease demand in the third-world countries and\nconsequently stimulate economic growth.\nAside from this global reality, the difficulties faced\nby sub-Saharan Africa are sui generis. The Secretary-\nGeneral himself recently called the economic results in\nAfrica disappointing, even in the countries that are\nengaged in-depth reforms. Thirty-three of the 48 least-\ndeveloped countries in the world are in Africa. There are\nmany results of this state of affairs and they are well\nknown. The recent onslaught of ethnic conflicts and civil\nwars has greatly contributed to instability, to the many\n25\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\n\nfaces of poverty and to the underdevelopment of that\nregion. These conflicts have forced millions of people to\nseek refuge in other countries or to become displaced\npersons. The situation is particularly tragic for women and\nchildren.\nIf Africa is to have a serious chance to develop, the\ncrushing burden of foreign debt must be alleviated. The\nlong-term debt of the African continent, amounting to $37\nbillion, constitutes about one-half of the debt owed by all\nthe countries of the \u201cthird world\u201d. Very few of those\ncountries are in a position to repay their debt.\nHowever, for Africa at least to come close to the\nobjective of 6 per cent of annual growth in its gross\ndomestic product, as envisaged by the United Nations New\nAgenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s, would\nrequire substantial external assistance. Even those among us\nwho, in Africa, have opted for free markets and healthy\ncurrencies, view privatization and balanced budgets with\nscepticism.\nThis situation, exacerbated by the shocks created by\nstructural adjustment programmes and political reform, is\ncontinuing to intensify internal pressures and social\ntensions.\nIt is important to maintain aid levels during this\ntransitional period because this will contribute to stabilizing\nthe economic conditions that would permit the emergence\nof political and social conditions propitious to free\ninstitutions. Without such assistance, our fragile economies\nare threatened with collapse before they can even attempt\nto carry out their reforms. Yet, the fact is that for the\nmajority of African countries now engaged in this effort,\nthe flow of capital and assistance in all forms is beginning\nto dry up.\nAs the President of the General Assembly has rightly\nsaid, the world is passing through a transitional period that\nis still \u201cvague, confused and imprecise\u201d (Official Records\nof the General Assembly, Fiftieth Session, Plenary\nMeetings, 1st meeting, p. 6). The effort to identify, to\nunderstand, to assign priorities and to try to remedy\nproblems whose dimensions have profoundly changed has\njust begun. It is revealing, indeed, that in his statement the\nPresident told the General Assembly that the new\ninternational order that is to be built must not leave out the\nUnited Nations, either by replacing it or by doing away\nentirely with it.\nFor the United Nations represents a concept of work,\nan expression of the idea whereby all mankind should\nunite its strength to solve problems and improve its\nconditions of life. To replace, weaken or marginalize the\nUnited Nations would constitute an assault on this\nconcept.\nThe United Nations, that is, mankind working\ntogether, should be the central mechanism through which\nthe world can achieve lasting growth and to lend\ncredibility and legitimacy to our efforts. Peace and\nsecurity remain important questions, but development and\neconomic and social problems are just as vital.\nThe structure of the United Nations should reflect\nthe realities and present problems as they really exist in\norder to tackle them in an effective, professional way.\nDjibouti favours the constant monitoring of United\nNations operations in order to define means and methods\nto eliminate all waste and reduce unnecessary costs.\nHowever, the improvement of the functioning and\nthe structure of the United Nations will prove of limited\nuse if the Organization does not have the resources it\nneeds to operate. The time has perhaps come to envisage\nnew methods for financing the United Nations. In\naddition, in the realm of collective security there is a vital\nneed to enlarge the Security Council, while respecting the\nprinciple of equitable geographical representation, and to\nmake it more democratic and more transparent. The\nstructure and functions of the Council should be\nperiodically reviewed as the international situation\nevolves.\nIn conclusion, we are the United Nations, and the\nUnited Nations is us. Together we can achieve great\nthings.\n"

In this post-cold-war era, we have been\nconfronted by global changes so profound and massive\nthat we are just beginning to understand some of their\nramifications. These changes have generated challenges\nand contradictory trends in international relations which\nhave cast a dark shadow on our contemporary world and\nintensified our sense of uncertainty as we stand on the\nthreshold of a new century. On the other hand, a\ndeepening sense of interdependence has prompted nations\nto devise more equitable and mutually beneficial patterns\nof cooperation \u2014 and this has provided us with a new\nsource of hope. Fittingly indeed, on this fiftieth\nanniversary of the United Nations, hope is the dominant\nfeeling in the world today just as it was hope, for a more\npeaceful and tolerant world, which inspired the founding\nof the United Nations in San Francisco half a century\nago.\n6\n\n\nWith the Second World War barely over, the\ninternational community of that time sought to establish a\nworld organization which would \u201csave succeeding\ngenerations from the scourge of war\u201d by instituting a\nsystem of collective security based on the repudiation of the\nuse of force \u201csave in the common interest\u201d, and on the\nbasic principles of sovereign equality, freedom, justice and\nthe rule of law. This splendid vision was not to be realized,\nfor soon the cold war set in between two rival military and\nideological blocs locked in a struggle for dominance. Power\npolitics and the quest for hegemony and spheres of\ninfluence paralysed the collective security system. That may\nbe why the United Nations has not been able to prevent the\nmore than 150 armed conflicts which, since its founding,\nhave erupted in various parts of the world, taking a horrible\ntoll in human lives and material devastation. And that also\npartly explains the persistence of inequities and imbalances\nin international economic relations.\nThe United Nations was but a decade old when the\nfirst generation of leaders of Asia and Africa, reacting to\nthe debilitating effects of the cold war and the problems\nbesetting the world at the time, met in Bandung to\narticulate a new ethos which would reaffirm the ideals and\nprinciples enshrined in the United Nations Charter and\ngovern relationships between and among nations, great and\nsmall. Thus in 1955 the leaders of Asia and Africa laid\ndown the \u201cDasa Sila of Bandung\u201d \u2014 the \u201cTen Principles\nof Bandung\u201d \u2014 which embodied fundamental principles of\ninter-State relations in accordance with the spirit of the\nUnited Nations Charter.\nThe seeds that germinated in Bandung took firm root\nsix years later in Belgrade with the formal institution of the\nNon-Aligned Movement. Since then, the Movement has\nserved as a moral and political force that provided an\nalternative vision to the bloc politics of the cold war.\nPursuing that vision, the Movement contributed to the\ntriumph of such causes as the world-wide struggle against\ncolonialism; the drive against institutionalized racism,\nparticularly apartheid; the advocacy for nuclear\ndisarmament, which is finally under way; and, lately, the\nlaunching of a global partnership for development. It is no\ncoincidence that these are the very same issues as those on\nthe agenda of the United Nations, for it is precisely within\nthe United Nations and through its processes and\ninstitutions that the Non-Aligned Movement has waged its\nstruggles for, and pursued its advocacy of, the principles\nand ideas enshrined in the United Nations Charter and\nreiterated in the Dasa Sila of Bandung. There is no doubt\nthat the United Nations has served as the principal\ninstrument for the amelioration of the human condition\nthrough the pursuit of peace and development.\nIn spite of the constraints to its system of collective\nsecurity, the United Nations has nevertheless undertaken\na large number of peace-keeping and peacemaking\noperations. Admittedly, not all United Nations peace-\nkeeping efforts have been regarded as successful, but they\nhave consistently promoted progress in negotiations\nbetween the parties in conflict. In the process the United\nNations has expanded the meaning of peace-keeping\nbeyond mere impartial interposition to include the\nprotection of humanitarian aid, refugees and displaced\npersons as well as assistance to countries holding\nelections. Even the set-backs and difficulties encountered\nin peace-keeping operations have yielded useful insights\nthat could help secure the success of similar undertakings\nin the future.\nWith the implementation of \u201cAn Agenda for Peace\u201d\nand its Supplement, further progress may be expected, not\nonly in peace-keeping but also in preventive diplomacy,\npeacemaking, post-conflict peace-building and the\ncomplementary role of regional organizations in\nmaintaining peace and security.\nWe are heartened that the Agenda for Peace has\nbeen complemented with \u201cAn Agenda for Development\u201d,\nwhich would not only enhance the capability of United\nNations to do its work in the economic and social spheres\nbut which will also facilitate the forging of a global\npartnership for development.\nHowever, the United Nations is much more than a\nforum for maintaining security, resolving conflicts and\nkeeping the peace. The Organization, its specialized\nagencies and related institutions have been engaged in an\nimmense array of activities that touch every aspect of\npeople\u2019s lives all over the world.\nIt is therefore most regrettable to note that the\nseverest financial crisis in the history of the United\nNations casts a dark shadow over the fiftieth anniversary.\nIn particular, the failure of one major Member State to\nmeet its obligations by withholding legally obligated\ncontributions is not only contrary to Article 17 of the\nCharter but has also driven the Organization to the very\nbrink of insolvency. This aggravating situation has forced\nthe Secretary-General to try to resolve the crisis through\npostponing reimbursements to the troop-contributing\ncountries. This places an unfair burden on those countries\nand penalizes especially the developing countries among\n7\n\n\nthem. If the situation were to continue without urgent and\neffective measures being taken to resolve it, peace-keeping\noperations would grind to a halt and all our endeavours to\nmaintain peace and security would be endangered. The\nfiftieth anniversary presents us with an opportunity to\naddress this fundamental issue of the United Nations\ninsolvency at the highest political level, including possible\nrecourse to innovative global taxation schemes.\nThe achievements of the United Nations over the past\nfive decades make a compelling case for the further\nstrengthening of multilateral cooperation, and we believe\nthat the United Nations can be an even better instrument of\nmultilateral cooperation if we act with greater purpose and\ndetermination in rectifying its inadequacies and\nshortcomings through a comprehensive process of\nrestructuring, revitalization and democratization.\nMy delegation is therefore gratified that steps have\nbeen taken to revitalize the role of the General Assembly,\nincluding the reorganization of its Committee structures and\nthe streamlining of its agenda for greater efficiency and\nefficacy.\nIndonesia also believes that the membership of the\nSecurity Council, including its permanent members, should\nbe increased so as to reflect the changed international\nsituation since 1945 and to accommodate the interests and\nconcerns of developing countries, which comprise the\noverwhelming majority of the Organization. It is a glaring\nanomaly that on the roster of permanent members of the\nCouncil Europe is overrepresented, Asia is underrepresented\nand Africa and Latin America are not represented at all. We\nare also of the view that additional permanent members\nshould be chosen on the basis, not only of equitable\ngeographical representation, but also of such objective\ncriteria as the political, economic and demographic weight\nof a country, its capability and proven track record of\ncontributing to the promotion of peace, security and\ndevelopment, both regionally and globally, and its\ncommitment to assume the responsibilities inherent in\npermanent membership. It may also be timely and pertinent\nto review the manner in which the veto is exercised at\npresent with a view to mitigating its arbitrary use and to\nensuring a more democratic decision-making process.\nOne central challenge not yet fully met by the United\nNations in its fiftieth year is that of general disarmament,\nparticularly in its nuclear dimension. The 1995 Review and\nExtension Conference of the Treaty on the Non-\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) adopted three\ndecisions, namely, to extend the Treaty indefinitely, to\nstrengthen its review process and to agree on certain\nprinciples and objectives for non-proliferation and\ndisarmament. Yet the Conference failed to address the\ninequalities inherent in the Treaty. Issues long identified\nas crucial components of the non-proliferation regime\nwere marginalized. The indefinite extension of the NPT\nremoved the element of urgency from obligations under\narticle VI of the Treaty, which may legitimize existing\nnuclear arsenals and perpetuate their further\nmodernization. Hence, our priority agenda in the\ndisarmament field should continue to be one of seeking\nfurther deep reductions in those arsenals with a view to\ntheir ultimate, total elimination, curbing the horizontal and\nvertical proliferation of nuclear weapons, banning the\nproduction of fissile materials for weapons purposes,\nensuring the peaceful applications of nuclear technology\non a predictable and long-term basis, initiating\nnegotiations towards an international convention on\nsecurity assurances to non-nuclear States, and concluding\nthe ongoing negotiations on a comprehensive test-ban\ntreaty.\nIt is in this context that we have deplored the\nunderground testing by France and China, not only\nbecause of health and environmental considerations but\nprecisely because it contravenes the spirit of the 1995\nReview and Extension Conference of the NPT and\nundermines the ongoing efforts to conclude a\ncomprehensive test-ban treaty. While urging the nuclear\nPowers to desist from conducting further tests, we believe\nit is imperative that concerted efforts should now be\ndirected at achieving a treaty banning nuclear testing in\nall environments and for all time, without any loopholes\nor exceptions, by 1996.\nPerhaps the greatest tragedy of recent times is that\nwhich has befallen the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\nThe brutal aggression perpetrated again this independent\nMember State of the United Nations and the slaughter and\n\u201cethnic cleansing\u201d of its people have shocked the whole\nworld. Denied its legitimate right to defend itself as a\nresult of an unjust arms embargo, Bosnia and\nHerzegovina faces the prospect of the forcible dismantling\nof its multicultural, multi-ethnic and multireligious society\nand the erosion of its internationally recognized\nsovereignty, independence and territorial integrity.\nThe major Powers, which early on could have put an\nend to this tragedy, have failed the cause of justice and of\na principled solution, offering instead rationalizations for\nwhat clearly amounts to a policy of appeasement. Only\nnow, after an excruciating wait, have the United Nations\n8\n\n\nand the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) finally\ntaken firm action. On the ground, the tide of battle seems\nto be turning, while at the same time a new peace process\nis unfolding which appears to have some viability.\nIndonesia welcomes the accords recently reached between\nthe Foreign Ministers of the Republic of Bosnia and\nHerzegovina, the Republic of Croatia and the Federal\nRepublic of Yugoslavia, comprised of a set of broad\nprinciples that are to govern a peaceful settlement of the\nconflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Developments have\nthus entered a crucial stage, and it is of paramount\nimportance for the international community to ensure that\nneither an unjust nor an unworkable peace be forced on\nBosnia and Herzegovina.\nIn this regard, President Soeharto has offered\nIndonesia\u2019s good offices to facilitate a peace process based\non direct negotiations among the leaders of the States\ndirectly involved in the conflict. These negotiations should\nbe conducted on the basis of certain basic principles, such\nas peaceful coexistence and non-interference in internal\naffairs. Any settlement should take into account existing\nUnited Nations resolutions and existing proposals for\nsettlement and should entail mutual recognition by the\nStates that were components of the former Yugoslavia,\nrespect for internationally recognized boundaries and\nprotection of minorities. Furthermore, the process should\nproceed in stages, from direct negotiations between the\nleaders themselves to an appropriately structured\ninternational conference, to be held when agreement has\nbeen reached on the basic elements of a settlement.\nIn the Middle East the pursuit of peace has continued\nto gather momentum. The historic Declaration of Principles\nsigned two years ago was bolstered by the agreement\nreached last week between the Palestine Liberation\nOrganization (PLO) and Israel, which calls for an extension\nof Palestinian self-rule in the occupied territories, phased\nwithdrawal of Israeli forces and free elections for a\nPalestinian Council, thereby paving the way for a final\nsettlement of the Palestinian-Israeli dimension of the Arab-\nIsraeli conflict. Indonesia welcomes the agreement as an\nimportant watershed in the Middle East peace process. But\nthe path to a lasting peace still faces major hurdles and\nchallenges, including those posed by Israeli settlements in\nthe West Bank, the unresolved question of Palestinian\nrefugees 50 years after they were forced to flee their\nhomeland and the status of Al-Quds Al-Sharif. At the same\ntime, progress must also be achieved on the other tracks of\nthe Arab-Israeli negotiations, which is a sine qua non for a\ncomprehensive settlement of the Middle East question. The\nultimate guarantee for a durable and just peace is Israel\u2019s\nwithdrawal from all occupied territories, including the\nSyrian Golan Heights and southern Lebanon.\nThe global economy today is reportedly at its\nstrongest in many years. According to the World\nEconomic and Social Survey of 1995, it has attained an\naverage growth in output of 3 per cent per year. But the\nrising tide of production has not lifted all economies.\nThus, notwithstanding the promise of global recovery,\nover 2 billion people remain poverty-stricken, often under\ncircumstances of extreme deprivation. Up to 18 million\ndie annually from hunger, malnutrition and poverty-\nrelated causes. The gap between the haves and the have-\nnots continues to widen, doubling in size over the past\nthree decades between the richest 20 per cent and the\npoorest.\nPolicy decisions affecting the developing countries\nare increasingly being made by international agencies or\ngroups, such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF),\nthe World Bank, the World Trade Organization (WTO)\nand the Group of Seven. It even seems that the United\nNations itself is being marginalized, as decision-making\non international economic and financial issues continues\nto shift to the Bretton Woods institutions, where the\nparticipation of the developing countries is less equitable.\nIt is no secret that some countries would like to\ninaugurate a global system in which finance and\nmacroeconomic management become the exclusive\ndomain of the IMF, development strategies that of the\nWorld Bank and international trade matters that of the\nWTO.\nI submit, however, that given the expanding role of\nthe developing countries in the world economy and the\ngrowing interdependence between States, the participation\nof developing countries should be enhanced rather than\ncurtailed. The solution of global economic problems\nrequires a global partnership for development, and that\npartnership cannot be forged without sustained dialogue\nand cooperation on key economic issues between the\ndeveloped and the developing countries. This is why, after\nthe Jakarta summit of the Non-Aligned Movement, where\neconomic development was restored to the top of its\nagenda, the Movement sought to relaunch a constructive\ndialogue between the North and the South based on\nmutual interest, common benefit and equitably shared\nresponsibility. That kind of dialogue has been welcomed\nin this Assembly, and it is our hope that other key players\nin the globalization process, such as non-governmental\norganizations, transnational corporations and international\nfinancial institutions, will in time also join that dialogue.\n9\n\n\nJust as important is the revitalization of the institutions\nwhich the United Nations Charter set in place 50 years ago\nto lay the social and economic foundations for peace. We\nmust ensure, however, that in the process we will\nstrengthen the role of the developing countries in decision-\nmaking and enhance the democratic character of the United\nNations.\nIt is in this context that I have opposed the idea of\nestablishing an economic security council to take the place\nof the Economic and Social Council, because it is bound to\nfrustrate our efforts to democratize the functioning of the\nUnited Nations. As to the attendant suggestion to wind up\nthe work of the United Nations Conference on Trade and\nDevelopment (UNCTAD) and the United Nations Industrial\nDevelopment Organization (UNIDO), I believe, to the\ncontrary, that these two bodies are vital to the achievement\nof accelerated, sustainable and equitably spread\ndevelopment, especially for the developing countries. Since\nits establishment 30 years ago, UNCTAD has consistently\nendeavoured to redress the inequities and imbalances in the\nworld economy and to give a greater voice and role to the\ndeveloping countries in its management. UNIDO, too, has\nproven to be of concrete benefit to the developing\ncountries, in particular in their efforts to accelerate their\nindustrial development. Both UNCTAD and UNIDO,\ntherefore, should be strengthened rather than be allowed to\nbe whittled down or eliminated.\nWe believe that the problems now plaguing many\ndeveloping countries could have been forestalled if they had\nadequate access to international markets, to financial\nresources and to appropriate technologies. And while we\nexpect that the results of the Uruguay Round will alleviate\nthe crisis by liberalizing the international trading system,\nwe also know that the lion\u2019s share of the benefits will\naccrue to the developed countries. This imbalance is due to\nthe significant loss of differential treatment in trade for the\ndeveloping countries, the limited progress achieved in\nlifting restrictions on agricultural exports and the imposition\nof trade conditionalities based on labour codes,\neco-labelling and so on. If the new trading regime is to\nhave a positive impact on the developing countries, these\nproblems and imbalances should be squarely addressed, and\nthe rights and interests of the developing countries,\nparticularly the least developed among them, should be\nupheld.\nAmid such trends as increasing globalization, the\nintegration of global financial markets and speculation\nduring periods of national adjustment to privatization, the\ndeveloping countries have become increasingly vulnerable.\nAmong the developing countries, those in Africa are\nparticularly disadvantaged because their external-debt\nproblems have virtually excluded them from investment\nflows \u2014 they must rely on official development\nassistance (ODA), which continues to decline. At the\nsame time, negative financial flows continue to hamper\ntheir development efforts. In 1994 alone the continent\u2019s\nindebtedness was double that of other developing\ncountries. It is therefore incumbent upon the international\ncommunity to give its priority attention to the critical\nsituation in Africa.\nThe World Summit for Social Development,\nconvened earlier this year in Copenhagen, underscored the\ndetermination of the international community to raise\nglobal standards of living and to address the problems of\npoverty, unemployment and social integration. Its\nDeclaration and Programme of Action offer a pragmatic\nand feasible course to alleviate mass human suffering and\nto elevate the human condition. Now we must translate\nrhetoric into action, and realize the true potential for\nglobal prosperity.\nAn integral part of that process is the\nimplementation of the Declaration and Platform for\nAction adopted at the Fourth World Conference on\nWomen, recently concluded in Beijing. For only through\nthe empowerment and advancement of women by such\nmeans as access to economic resources, to education and\nto the decision-making processes in all fields and at all\nlevels can the social and economic welfare of humankind\nprogress. It is essential, therefore, that we create an\nenvironment conducive to women\u2019s full participation in\nthe development process, as both its agents and its\nbeneficiaries, if we are to move forward in our efforts to\nachieve sustained economic growth, sustainable\ndevelopment and social justice.\nThe observance of the fiftieth anniversary of the\nUnited Nations is particularly significant to us in\nIndonesia, for it takes place while we celebrate the fiftieth\nanniversary of the proclamation of our independence. To\nus, this is not a mere coincidence in time but a\nconvergence of ideals and values. Neither is it a\ncoincidence that the Charter of the United Nations and the\nConstitution of Indonesia embrace the same principles and\nobjectives, such as independence, social justice, equality\nand abiding peace. For the United Nations and Indonesia\nemerged from the crucible of the Second World War and\nthe struggle for independence yearning and hoping for the\nuniversal peace that can only be derived from a sharing\nof the fruits of freedom and justice by all humankind.\n10\n\n\nSince then, the United Nations and all of us, the\npeoples who are its constituents, have gone through another\ncrucible, that of the cold war and the massive global\nchanges that attended its wake. And, again, we have\nemerged with a yearning and a hope that the peace\nenvisaged in the United Nations Charter 50 years ago will\nbe attained in our time. The difference is that this time we\nhave 50 years of experience to illuminate our endeavours\nand to sharpen our perspective of the future. On this\noccasion, as we rededicate ourselves to the vision of the\nUnited Nations Charter, let us resolve to use our collective\nexperience in our continuing efforts to revitalize and\nstrengthen the Organization that is the vehicle of our hope.\n"

        "file_text": "It is my pleasure at the outset to express my\ncongratulations to Mr. Freitas do Amaral personally, and to\nhis friendly country, Portugal, upon his election to the\npresidency of the General Assembly. We are confident that\nhis experience, wisdom and statesmanship will contribute\nto the success of this session\u2019s deliberations. May I assure\nhim of the cooperation of the Syrian delegation in achieving\nthe desired objectives. May I also extend the expression\nof our thanks and appreciation to his predecessor,\nMr. Amara Essy, for his untiring efforts during his\npresidency of the previous session.\nOn this occasion, we should like to express our\nappreciation to the Secretary-General of the United\nNations for his efforts to enhance the standing and role of\nthe United Nations and to focus the international\ncommunity\u2019s attention on the most outstanding issues of\nour times.\nThis session of the General Assembly has great\nsignificance in the life of the United Nations, as it\ncoincides with the fiftieth anniversary of the founding of\nthis international Organization which remains,\nnotwithstanding any criticisms, an unequalled organization\nin the history of international relations. It is the house\nunder whose roof the representatives of all the world\u2019s\nStates meet each year: friends and foes, adversaries and\nallies, on the basis of commitment to the purposes and\nprinciples of the United Nations Charter, foremost among\nwhich are: maintenance of international peace and\nsecurity; respect for the fundamental rights of men and of\nStates, both small and large; affirmation of equality under\nthose rights; non-interference in the internal affairs of\nStates, and standing up to aggression in accordance with\nthe principles of justice and international law.\nThe problem facing the United Nations, in our\nbelief, does not lie in the purposes and principles of the\nCharter, but rather in the decision-making mechanism in\nthe United Nations and in the selective manner of\nimplementing those decisions. Furthermore, the grave\nfinancial crisis afflicting this international Organization is\nin fact but the reflection of a political crisis fundamentally\ncentred on the identity of the United Nations and its role\nin the post-cold- war period. The question that arises in\nthis context is: does this international Organization truly\nrepresent the aspirations of its Members\u2019 peoples, as\nstated in the preamble of its Charter, namely, \u201cWe the\npeoples of the United Nations\u201d? Is it not surprising to\nhear even the State with the largest population and the\nlargest surface area complain, despite its permanent\nmembership in the Security Council, of interference in its\ninternal affairs?\nGiven such a situation, will it be feasible to\nintroduce meaningful democratic reforms of the United\nNations structure that would be acceptable and agreeable\nto the Organization\u2019s Member States, both large and\nsmall, rich and poor, of the North or of the South? Or is\n15\n\n\nit that the democracy of the majority by which national\ndecisions are taken is not valid for decision-making in the\nUnited Nations or in international relations?\nIn any case, we do not live in an ideal world, even if\nwe aspire after such a world. We are convinced that it is\nessential to promote constructive international dialogue and\ncooperation if we are to achieve the introduction of reforms\nthat, both in substance and in form, would realize the\naspirations of Member States and address the issues and\nneeds of developing countries. Top of the list of those\nneeds is the alleviation of the developing countries\u2019 debt\nburdens, encouraging investments in their economies,\nopening markets to their products and lifting any\nrestrictions on the transfer to them of sophisticated and\nnuclear technologies for peaceful purposes.\nOver and above all this, what the developing countries\nneed is that their political, humanitarian and cultural issues\nshould be dealt with by dialogue on a basis of mutual\nrespect and non-interference in their internal affairs. That\nindeed would be the most appropriate and correct means of\nlaying the foundations of an international cooperation with\na human face, which would guarantee the interests of all\nand, thereby, lead to a more secure, stable and prosperous\nworld.\nThe changes which the world has been witnessing in\nthe international area since the beginning of the 1990s, no\nmatter how tremendous their impact and their results could\nbe, will never alter the fundamental principles and values\nthat humanity has struggled to attain and adhere to since the\ndawn of history. Right cannot be turned around overnight\nto become wrong, just exactly as equality cannot be turned\naround to become hegemony, racism cannot be made a\nvirtue and the occupation of the land of others by force\ncannot be legitimized.\nWe live in a region which is the birthplace of the three\nrevealed religions and of human civilizations. Our roots in\nthe region go very deep. We read, hear and, indeed, feel\nhow Israel attempts to falsify the history and geography of\nthis region as well as the achievements of its peoples. We\nsee how it attempts to mislead public opinion into the\nconviction that its democracy and its laws shall determine\nthe fate of the occupied Arab territories, and not the\nprinciples of international law and the resolutions of the\nUnited Nations. Those resolutions consider as null and void\nIsrael\u2019s annexation of Al-Quds and the application of its\nlaws to the Golan, and require Israel to withdraw from all\nthe occupied Arab territories in order for a just and\ncomprehensive peace to be achieved in the region.\nThe fact that Israel does not heed the resolutions of\nthe United Nations, regardless of the negotiations that\nhave been going on for four years, is an act of defiance\nnot only vis-\u00e0-vis the Arabs, but also of the entire\ninternational community and, especially, of the Security\nCouncil and its relevant resolutions.\nThe latest developments in the peace process have\nshown that Israel\u2019s rulers are not interested in seeking a\ngenuine, just and comprehensive peace that would put an\nend to strife, occupation and colonial settlement and\nguarantee security and stability to all. Their main concern\nhas been to extract from those who negotiate with them\nsignatures on hundreds of pages and maps which shackle\nthe Palestinian people, after all the great sacrifices it has\nmade, and thrust that people on an endless road of loss\nand agony, not on any road that would lead to liberation\nand independence.\nIn our view, agreements of this type, which will lead\nto yet another endless series of negotiations and\nagreements, will never pass the test of the final solution,\nsimply because each and every one of them carries within\nit the seeds of tension and conflict.\nSince the Oslo agreement, Syria has made it clear,\nfrom this rostrum, that it neither supports nor seeks to\nobstruct such agreements. Today, while we reiterate this\nposition, we must point out that if such agreements are\nused to cause harm to Syria\u2019s national and pan-Arab\ninterests and rights, we shall be compelled to reconsider\nthat position.\nThe American initiative, on the basis of which the\nMadrid Conference was convened, asserted that its aim\nwas to achieve a just and comprehensive peace in the\nMiddle East on the basis of Security Council resolutions\n242 (1967) and 338 (1973) and the principle of land for\npeace. Furthermore, among the guarantees given to Syria\nby the United States of America was that the United\nStates would not agree to the annexation by Israel of one\nsingle inch of the Golan territory occupied in 1967. It was\non that basis that Syria opened the door of peace in the\nMadrid Conference. Syria will continue to hold fast to\nthese foundations, which in substance signify a continuing\nAmerican commitment to Syria\u2019s fundamental rights and\ninterests. The force of this American commitment is not\naltered by the deviation by some Arab parties from the\nMadrid formula, whose staunchest advocate ought to be\nthe United States, a sponsor of the Conference.\n16\n\n\nContrary to Israel\u2019s claims, the Madrid formula and\nthe American initiative did not call for secret negotiations\nand did not provide for a specified level of negotiators. Had\nit been otherwise, there would have been no need\nwhatsoever to hold the Madrid Conference. Syria and the\nArab States expect the United States, as a sponsor of the\npeace process, to fulfil its commitments towards Syria and\nLebanon and to seek to eliminate the obstacles that Israel\ncontinues to put on the road to a just and comprehensive\npeace in the region that would lead to Israel\u2019s complete\nwithdrawal from the Golan to the line of 4 June 1967 and\nalso from Southern Lebanon, in implementation of Security\nCouncil resolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973) and 425 (1978).\nSyria reaffirms its commitment to peace on the basis\nof the foundations which launched the peace process and on\nno other bases or other formulae, whose only aim would be\nto satisfy Israel\u2019s arrogance and entrench its hegemony and\nnot to bring to the peoples of the region the security,\nstability and dignity after which they aspire.\nIsrael can fool some people some of the time, but it\ncannot fool all people all the time. The negotiations\nbetween Syria and Israel over the past four years have\nshown that Israel wishes to negotiate only for the purpose\nof equivocating and backpedalling from the requirements of\npeace or for the purpose of using the negotiations as a\nmeans of imposing its conditions, which contradict the\nletter and spirit of the relevant Security Council resolutions.\nThis is the real reason why the negotiations on the Syrian\ntrack have faltered.\nIn any case, a false peace will never find its way into\nany Syrian home, regardless of the challenges and the\nobstacles created by Israel. All our Syrian citizens know\nthat Arabs, Muslims and all peoples who put their faith in\njustice and peace stand steadfastly by Syria and its leader\nin the battle for a just and comprehensive peace, a genuine\npeace that the people can embrace with dignity.\nArmed conflicts and devastating wars continue to rage\nin various parts of the world. Those conflicts which inflict\ngreat human and material losses on the peoples of the\nStates they afflict have begun to cast lengthening dark\nshadows on regional and world peace and stability.\nThe indescribable suffering of the people of Bosnia\nand Herzegovina makes it necessary for the international\ncommunity to intensify efforts to achieve a just settlement\nthat would guarantee the unity and territorial integrity of the\nRepublic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and safeguard the\nsecurity and stability of the Balkan region.\nSyria reaffirms its attachment to safeguarding the\nunity of the territory and people of Iraq and its rejection\nof any attempt at dividing Iraq or at interfering in its\ninternal affairs. Syria believes that a speedy\nimplementation by the Iraqi Government of the remaining\nSecurity Council resolutions, side by side with resolving\nthe issue of Kuwaiti prisoners, would facilitate working\nfor lifting the embargo and mitigating the suffering of the\nbrotherly Iraqi people.\nSyria calls also for responding to the initiative of the\nLeague of Arab States regarding the Lockerbie crisis.\nThis initiative would lead to a solution to the crisis and\nthereby put an end to the embargo imposed on brotherly\nLibya.\nSyria hopes that a peaceful solution will be reached\nto the three-island crisis between the United Arab\nEmirates and the Islamic Republic of Iran, through direct\ndialogue, in the interests of cooperation and good-\nneighbourliness between the two countries. Settlement of\nthe issue will guarantee the rights of both parties and\nuphold the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the\nStates of the region.\nSyria calls on all the warring factions in Somalia to\nend the infighting and to overcome their differences in the\ninterests of national reconciliation, which is indispensable\nfor restoring security and stability to that country and for\nstimulating efforts to reconstruct the country and restore\nits Arab and international role.\nMy country, Syria, had the honour of participating\nin the founding of this international Organization, whose\nfiftieth anniversary is now being celebrated. While the\npages of history mention other organizations which did\nnot rise to the expectations of the world\u2019s peoples, the\nsurvival of our organization for the past five decades is\ntestimony to the loftiness of the purposes and principles\nof its Charter. Despite the conflicts and challenges faced\nby today\u2019s world, we look to the future with optimism.\nHistory does not march backwards and every stage of\ndevelopment and change cannot but be better than the one\nbefore. Wars that have flared up in more than one part of\nthe world cannot but recede gradually, then peter out and\nexist no more.\nThis is our hope. Peace which is not achieved today\nwill dawn tomorrow. This is what we shall try to achieve\n17\n\n\nlooking forward to a better life of justice and humaneness\nin that it will be built on cooperation between our nations\nin the political, economic and cultural fields, in the interests\nof all mankind.\nLet us hope that the fiftieth anniversary of the\nfounding of the United Nations will be a bright beacon of\nchange in the history of mankind.\n"

        "file_text": "I take great pleasure today in\naddressing this distinguished world audience on behalf of\nthe delegation of Equatorial Guinea in the context of the\nfiftieth session of the United Nations General Assembly. I\nwish first to congratulate His Excellency Mr. Freitas\ndo Amaral of Portugal on his election to preside over our\nwork. I wish him every success in the presidency of the\nGeneral Assembly at its fiftieth session. He can always rely\non the cooperation and solidarity of my delegation.\nThis fiftieth session of the Assembly is taking place at\na time when we are seeing a radical change of course \u2014 a\nneeded one, in our opinion \u2014 in the life of the United\nNations in today\u2019s world.\nIn its first half-century, as a speaker has already said\nin this Hall, the United Nations has been a child of its time,\nthe time of the aftermath of the Second World War. It\ncame into being to work for peace, world security and\ndevelopment. Now we must determine whether these\nobjectives have been achieved. Peace meant avoiding war\nand military conflict. Global security meant preventing the\nescalation of conflicts. Development meant mobilizing the\nfinancial resources required for the reconstruction of the\nworld and to redress its underdevelopment.\nAs we celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the United\nNations we are bound to acknowledge that although the\nOrganization has achieved certain successes in the area of\npreventing disputes among nations and has taken measures\nand initiatives to promote the resolution of certain conflicts,\npeace, security and development are not yet permanent\nfeatures of daily life in our earthly home.\nThe fall of the East-West ideological barriers\nartificially imposed by the cold war aroused expectations\nof an age of peace in the world. The spread of democracy\nand the new world-wide awareness of the importance of\nrespect for human rights further heightened these\nexpectations at the beginning of this decade.\nIn this context my country, the Republic of\nEquatorial Guinea, has striven to achieve these objectives\nof peace, security and development.\nFollowing the ousting of the dictatorship and the\none-party system, our Government, as early as 1979,\nadopted a consistent and comprehensive strategy which\nwas a reflection of a national consensus in favour of a\nmodel of society for the future of our nation that would\nbe based on peace, democracy and development. In this\ncontext we have undertaken a series of political reforms\nfully supported by all forces and currents of opinion in\nour society.\nSince 1992 the Government, following the lead of\nHis Excellency, Mr. Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, President\nof the Republic and Head of State of Equatorial Guinea,\nhas been responsive to the people\u2019s aspirations to\nfreedom, democracy and participation in the management\nof public affairs. With a population of only 420,000 the\ncountry has 14 legal political movements. This\nprogramme was established and has been satisfactorily\nimplemented since 1993, with municipal elections having\nbeen held on 17 September 1995. The Constitution and\nthe electoral timetable that has been established provide\nfor the holding of presidential elections in the coming\nyear, 1996.\nHowever, despite these endeavours and despite my\nGovernment\u2019s resolve to secure fundamental freedoms for\nour people on a firm foundation, foreign interests, for\ntheir own unavowed purposes, want to see the democratic\nprocess in my country shaped as the saying is \u201cin the\nimage and likeness\u201d of those alien interests.\nSince the beginning of the political transition the\ntreatment meted out to Equatorial Guinea by certain\nStates Members of the Organization has been utterly\ndifferent from that granted to other countries in Central\nAfrica and in the rest of the continent, whose political\nevolution has been similar to our own, involving in some\ncases tragic consequences; that leads us to suspect that the\n23\n\n\ndisinformation and defamation campaign waged\ninternationally against the Government of Equatorial Guinea\nis the manifestation of hegemonistic ambitions and struggles\nfor influence that threaten not only the peace and social\nharmony that prevail in the country but also its territorial\nintegrity.\nWe do not understand how Equatorial Guinea\u2019s\ndemocratization process differs from what is going on in\nother countries in our area. We have said yes to pluralism,\ndemocracy and participation. We have said yes to human\nrights, and we practise respect for human rights. We do not\nunderstand why different types of measures are applied to\nmy country. We regret that instead of receiving moral\nsupport and solidarity to help us consolidate our\nachievements, we are subjected to economic blockades and\nthe unilateral suspension of cooperative programmes agreed\nby convention. Instead of receiving understanding for what\ncould be the result of deficiencies of structure or of\ndemocratic culture in the society of Equatorial Guinea as a\nwhole, we are subjected to reproach, intimidation, threats\nand a humiliating and intolerable interference in our\ncountry\u2019s internal affairs.\nWe do not believe that a tragic breakdown of social\nand economic structures, such as has taken place in the\nbrotherly countries of Liberia, Rwanda, Angola, Somalia\nand other countries and regions of the African continent,\nrepresents the best form of cooperation with and assistance\nto African peoples.\nI wish to declare before this forum of the international\ncommunity that outside influences are engineering and\ninstigating an internal conflict in my country that would\nhave unforeseeable consequences.\nIndeed, some political circles and communications\nmedia are waging a campaign from Spain, the old colonial\nPower, to intensify the differences between the people of\nEquatorial Guinea, supporting some and harassing others,\nthus provoking divisions and antagonisms. Even graver is\nthe support offered to the Self-determination Movement of\nthe Island of Bioko, a secessionist group. In addition, a\nstation of Radio Exterior de Espa\u00f1a has been created and\naimed expressly at Equatorial Guinea to carry out a\npoisonous disinformation campaign deliberately intended to\ndistort the socio-political reality of the country. The\nbroadcasts of Radio Exterior de Espa\u00f1a are the most\ndisruptive element in the country\u2019s democratization process\nand constitute a Petri dish that spawns acts of violence and\nthe destabilization of Equatorial Guinea\u2019s social structures.\nWe wish to apprise the international community of\nthis matter, and we ask it to request the Spanish\nGovernment to put an end to this aggression perpetrated\nfrom its territory by the public entity Radio Exterior de\nEspa\u00f1a and by certain political circles. Under the pretext\nof supporting the democratic process under way in our\ncountry, those political circles, consisting of\nParliamentarians, party and labour leaders, associations\nand pressure groups, clandestinely support, coordinate and\nfinance secessionist movements and political parties\nstanding in radical opposition to the legitimate\nGovernment of Equatorial Guinea. This overt interference\nis intended to bring about violent political changes in my\ncountry.\nClear evidence of this interference can be seen in the\ncurrent disinformation and discreditation campaign being\nwaged from Spain by those political circles and\ncommunications media following the municipal elections\nheld in my country on 17 September last. Those circles\nplanned and illegally financed the electoral campaign of\nthe radical opposition, banded together in the Joint\nOpposition Platform (POC). They have created confusion\nby trying to manipulate the electoral results.\nThose same Spanish political circles are today trying\nto manipulate international public opinion by falsely\naccusing the Government of electoral fraud and violations\nof human rights. The recent report of the United Nations\nSpecial Rapporteur, Mr. Alejandro Artucio, suffices to\ngive the lie to these accusations. My Government\ncomplies with the programme and recommendations of\nthe United Nations Commission on Human Rights.\nOne cannot credibly claim to be supporting political\nreform in my country by stirring up antagonism and\ndisputes between the political sectors of my country. One\ncannot credibly claim to be helping the people of\nEquatorial Guinea by suspending cooperation in the\neducational, health and agricultural sectors. One cannot\ncredibly claim to be helping the people of Equatorial\nGuinea by inciting the donor community to block projects\nof proven social effectiveness. We sincerely believe that\none cannot help any people by depriving it of the\nresources and opportunities to improve its living\nconditions.\nMy country lives in peace and order. We just need\na friendly, sincere and respectful helping hand. We are\ntold that there can be no development without democracy,\nand we agree. But our experience, which we believe has\nbeen shared by other developing countries, is that\n24\n\n\ndemocracy amid poverty and underdevelopment is a pipe\ndream. Poverty and underdevelopment breed violence and\nsocial and political instability.\nWe therefore sincerely seek international relations\ncharacterized by mutual support and solidarity, not partisan\npressure, in order to consolidate this climate that makes\ndemocracy and the development of our peoples possible.\nMy second request, in accordance with what the\ndeveloping countries have been asking for for over a\ndecade, is that the current unfair international economic\nsystem be replaced. Nevertheless, all these global\nagreements \u2014 such as those of the recent World Summit\nfor Social Development, the United Nations Conference on\nEnvironment and Development, the Fourth World\nConference on Women, held in Beijing, and the latest\nagreements of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade\n(GATT) \u2014 have served only to bring us to today\u2019s sad\nimpasse, which reveals the radical and irreconcilable\nattitudes of both sides. The so-called developed countries of\nthe North and the developing countries of the South,\ndivided by selfishness, ambition and intolerance, deprive\nfuture generations of a better world.\nA few days before celebrating the fiftieth anniversary\nof our Organization, there still persists in the United\nNations the spirit of a bipolar world dominated by\nsuspicions on both sides, mistrust, discrimination, attitudes\nof superiority, a lack of political will to develop frank and\nsincere cooperation and a desire for hegemony in\ninternational relations.\nThe response of the United Nations to the questions\nasked by those who spoke before me and to the challenges\nof the new changes on the international stage must contain\ntwo indispensable elements. The first is that the United\nNations should represent the interests of everyone, by\nintroducing certain structural reforms making it possible to\nattain the objectives for which it was created. Secondly, we\nmust provide the United Nations with a deeper-going\ncapacity for genuine dialogue between the nations that\nmake it up and speak to the world in a language of\nunderstanding.\nThe necessary dialogue must be global and must\nencompass all aspects of international relations, be they\neconomic, political or cultural. It is impractical to limit\ndialogue between nations, regardless of their size and\npower, since all the countries of the world must take an\nactive part in the dialogue process in order to arrive\ntogether at a common and secure destiny, abandoning no\none to the abyss of underdevelopment and abject poverty.\nThis is the challenge of the next 50 years for our\nOrganization. May God bless the United Nations.\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me to convey to the President of the\nGeneral Assembly the congratulations of the Government\nand people of Bolivia upon his election to the presidency of\nthe fiftieth session of the General Assembly. He can be\nassured that my delegation will cooperate with him to\nensure the full success of this important session.\nThe commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the\nentry into force of the United Nations Charter affords a\nfresh opportunity for critical and renewed reflection on the\nscope, difficulties and role of the multilateral system.\nDuring the year 1995 important meetings of universal\nscope have taken place, such as the World Summit on\nSocial Development, the Fourth World Conference on\nWomen, and the Review and Extension Conference on the\nTreaty on Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. Those\nmeetings, together with others of a bilateral, subregional or\nregional character \u2014 notably the Hemispheric Summit in\nMiami \u2014 show that the principles which presided over the\ncreation of the United Nations are still very much alive, and\ndemonstrate the need to make significant further headway\nin promoting peace, human rights, democracy, and\neconomic and social development.\n\nMeetings at the highest level of the world\u2019s political\nleaders and their representatives, ready to assume\nundertakings on issues of such significance, are indicative\nof a strong political will and reveal an interest in finding\nconcrete collective responses to the problems of our time.\nAs a result of those Conferences, the world\ncommunity has at hand new approaches that enrich and\nstrengthen prior agreements as it seeks to cope successfully\nwith contemporary challenges. For example, social\ndevelopment and recognition of the due role of women in\nsociety have ceased to be mere promises; they are\nbecoming definite realities before the end of this century.\nThe International Decade of the World\u2019s Indigenous\nPeople will make it possible for priority attention to be\ngiven to that important sector of the community.\nThe end of the cold war has not released the material\nand human resources that were committed to that contest.\nNor has it freed our minds of concern over war and\ndestruction. There persist negative situations and\nprejudices, which were born during that period when the\nworld was divided into antagonistic blocs, and which no\nlonger have any justification.\nThe long-awaited peace dividend has not been\nforthcoming; on the contrary, we see a proliferation of\nconflicts in many parts of the world. Many of these\nsituations are due to still unresolved social and national\nproblems, to a backlog of injustices and long-standing\nresentments, to geopolitical and economic interests which,\nfrom within and from outside, have exacerbated\nconfrontation for decades, and, above all, to\nGovernments\u2019 difficulties in defining an effective form of\ncooperation for the peaceful solution of problems.\nIn this context, we reiterate our support for the\nprinciples and the renewed objectives of the Movement of\nNon-Aligned Countries, whose chairmanship is shortly to\nbe assumed by the sister republic of Colombia.\nWe feel a sense of solidarity with the peoples of the\nformer Yugoslavia, who are enduring the torment of an\nunjustifiable war. We also express our solidarity with the\nmillions of human beings affected by military conflict,\nunilateral blockades, hindrances to free contact with the\noutside world, and by having been uprooted from their\nlands.\nWe reiterate what the Heads of State or Government\nof the Rio Group stated at their recent summit meeting in\nQuito:\n\u201cWe express our concern over attempts to\nenforce domestic laws beyond territorial boundaries\nin violation of international law and the fundamental\nprinciples governing coexistence in the region. Such\nactions violate the sovereignty of other States and\nare contrary to unanimously adopted transparent\ntrade practices\u201d. (A/50/425, annex, para. 13)\nBolivia expresses its condemnation of grave\nviolations of international law, war crimes, violations of\nthe fundamental rules of coexistence, manifestations of\nracism, and other offenses against humanity, all of which\nshould be vigorously condemned. The work of the United\nNations in this field has been important, but it needs to be\nfurther refined. In that work, the role of regional and\nsubregional organizations for cooperation and\ncoordination is essential and should gain greater\nimportance in years to come. These organizations include\n26\n\n\nthe Organization of American States, the Rio Group and the\nvarious regional and subregional instruments of economic\nintegration, to which my Government lends its full support.\nWe rejoice that Haiti and other countries have made\nfirm strides towards peace and democratic governance.\nLikewise, Bolivia notes with particular interest, and\ncommends, the peace process in the Middle East, whose\nadvances in the face of difficulties give us cause to be\noptimistic and to hope for reconciliation through the\nfashioning of innovative solutions with a distinctive explicit\npolitical content. The agreement signed yesterday between\nIsrael and Palestine is an example of determination and\nvision of historic proportions.\nBolivia has expressed its rejection of the resumption\nof nuclear tests, which jeopardize negotiations towards the\nspeedy adoption of a comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty.\nWe condemn terrorism and organized crime, whose\nscope and reach cut across national boundaries and which\nthus threatens security and constitutional stability\neverywhere. Bolivia has signed several bilateral treaties\nintended to advance international cooperation on legal\nmatters within a framework of strict respect for sovereignty,\nbut at the same time closing off avenues to impunity for\ninternational crime.\nAs our awareness of the rights and duties of\nmultilateral interdependence grows, cooperation in\nachieving the inherent right to development of all the\nworld\u2019s peoples should come to the fore.\nIn the new international situation, Bolivia supports\ninitiatives aimed at strengthening the United Nations and\nshares the conviction that it is necessary to carry out major\nreforms in its structure and functioning. Bolivia believes it\nessential as a first step in that direction to strengthen the\nGeneral Assembly as the principal organ providing for\neffective participation by all countries.\nMy Government supports initiatives aimed at\nexpanding the Security Council, in both its permanent and\nits non-permanent membership. Such an expansion should\nreflect the diversity of the world\u2019s regions and enable all\nStates to participate effectively and responsibly in the\ncommitment to guarantee peace, security and the timely\nsettlement of conflicts, in a transparent manner and in\nkeeping with the interests of the international community,\nnot only in the narrow framework of the individual interests\nof States.\nI also highlight the importance we attach to the\nUnited Nations in the area of international cooperation,\nespecially in the economic sphere and on matters of social\nand technological development, and the urgency of\nrestoring to the Economic and Social Council the high\nstature it originally possessed.\nThe principles of justice and international law must\nbe our main guiding light in seeking solutions to the\nproblems we face.\nWith regard to Bolivia\u2019s maritime question, which\nwe have brought before international forums, I wish to\ndeclare to this Assembly the political will of my\nGovernment to embark upon negotiations that are\nconsonant with our historic responsibility, that serve the\nrights and interests of all parties involved, and that ensure\na sovereign Bolivian presence on the Pacific Ocean.\nBolivia has to contend with the consequences of the land-\nlocked position imposed upon it, the economic, political\nand moral effects of which demand a solution in the\nframework of international solidarity, justice, equity and\nlaw.\nJust as countries call for international justice, we are\nobliged also to apply that principle within our own\nsocieties. That is the golden rule of the Administration of\nPresident Gonzalo S\u00e1nchez de Losada. Our message is\none of change. Never before in the history of our republic\nhave such profound and rapid structural changes been\ndemocratically and peacefully carried out as those that\nbegan in Bolivia in August 1993.\nFirst, we are implementing the law on the people\u2019s\nparticipation, which is integrating civil society into the\npolitical system. Traditionally disadvantaged populations\nnow have in their hands the ability to diagnose their\nproblems and to prescribe public policy, especially\nregarding self-help to meet their own needs. This is\nessentially a policy of redistribution, which enables a\nlarge part of the nation fully to assume their status as\ncitizens.\nSecondly, the foregoing requires training the people\nso that they will be able to meet internal and external\nchallenges. To that end, another reform undertaken by\nPresident Gonz\u00e1lo S\u00e1nchez de Lozada\u2019s administration is\neducational reform, viewed specifically in the light of\nBolivia\u2019s ethnic and cultural diversity and with the aim of\ninstitutionalizing bilingual and multicultural education.\n27\n\n\nThirdly, I am pleased to inform this Assembly that\ncapital investment in Bolivia\u2019s main public enterprises is\nmoving forward successfully and strongly. We are\ntransforming the largest productive and service units of the\ncountry to enable them to double their capital in the space\nof a few months, modernize their management in\naccordance with the requirements of international life, and\nsecure a series of real benefits for the Bolivian population,\nmaking possible individual investment by citizens of 50 per\ncent of the share capital.\nSuch initiatives represent an effort to make Bolivia\nequal to contemporary demands, especially those resulting\nfrom the international economy, which is characterized by\ngreat dynamism, innovation and competitiveness.\nInternational economic cooperation is indispensable\nand should enjoy the firm political backing of developed\ncountries and international financial institutions. For that\nreason my country expresses concern about the declining\nand negative trends of some sources of cooperation and\nfinancing. This situation is especially disturbing when seen\nin the light of the fact that Bolivia has to contend in its\nterritory with a universal problem \u2014 namely, illicit drug\ntrafficking.\nIt is paradoxical \u2014 to say the least \u2014 to urge an\nincrease in Bolivia\u2019s contribution and in Bolivia\u2019s tasks in\nthat common struggle precisely at a time when cooperation\nresources are decreasing. The task at hand is simultaneously\nto fulfil the commitments in the struggle against drug\ntrafficking and to prepare to embark on genuine sustainable\ndevelopment, especially in the rural sector, where the most\nacute poverty exists.\nGiven the magnitude of the tasks falling to Bolivia in\nthis matter, strong backing from the international\ncommunity is needed for Bolivia\u2019s national strategy in\nregard to interdiction, prevention, the eradication of surplus\ncrops, and alternative development. That contribution is\nessential to Bolivia\u2019s effort to cease being a link in the\ndrug-trafficking chain and, at the same time, ensure\npolitical and economic stability and promote development\nof the country\u2019s productive apparatus.\nWith a view to consolidating the vision of shared\nresponsibility with regard to the problem of drug-\ntrafficking, the nations of the Americas support the holding\nof a world conference to take stock of the situation and the\nstate of international cooperation in the struggle against\ndemand for and production, sale, trafficking and illicit\ndistribution of narcotics. In that context, Bolivia actively\nadvocates the holding in 1977 of a second international\nconference against drug abuse and illicit drug trafficking,\nunder the aegis of the United Nations.\nBefore concluding, I must refer to the topic of\nsustainable development.\nWe must stimulate vigorous and sustained economic\ngrowth, with social equity, in conditions that protect and\nmake efficient use of natural resources and ensure rational\ndistribution of the fruits of that growth. Henceforth, we\nmust adopt a mode of development that is nurtured by\ntechnological advances designed to curb the waste and\npollution that have characterized industrialized societies.\nAccordingly, it is with special satisfaction that I\nannounce to this Assembly that in the latter half of next\nyear Bolivia will have the privilege of hosting, in the city\nof Santa Cruz de la Sierra, the American Hemispheric\nSummit on Sustainable Development. We hope that the\nideas and proposals that emerge from that important\nmeeting will contribute to the development of our\ncountries and to better preservation of the environment in\nthis part of the world.\n"

        "file_text": "It is a sad irony that while\nwe are celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of the United\nNations, the Organization finds itself in serious financial\ncrisis. If not redressed, this crisis will threaten the very\ngoals of our Organization.\nDenmark gives top priority to a strengthening of the\nUnited Nations. Hopefully, we can make headway during\nthis session of the General Assembly as regards the\nfinancial situation of the United Nations and the \u201cAgenda\nfor Development\u201d. We hope that the High-level Working\nGroup under the chairmanship of the President of the\nGeneral Assembly will keep up the momentum of the\nreform process.\nI wish to concentrate on eight points.\nThe first is social development. The World Summit\nin Copenhagen identified new approaches for action.\nStates have the primary responsibility to attain the goals\nof the Summit. In this endeavour, we need the full\nsupport of the international community, the United\nNations, the multilateral financial institutions, regional\norganizations, local authorities and the civil society. All\npartners must participate fully and must increase their\nefforts.\nWe also need specific efforts to keep the Summit\nissues on the agenda. To stimulate the implementation of\nthe Summit results, Denmark would like to see\nestablished an independent forum on social development\nissues. This forum should supplement the work of\ninternational organizations and of intergovernmental\ncooperation. In particular, it should compile and analyze\ndata on social development issues, thus providing the\nbasis for dialogue. I hope that agreement on the creation\nof the forum can be reached at this session of the General\nAssembly.\nSustainable economic and social development\nrequires a collective effort. It requires a substantial\ntransfer of resources, concessional as well as\nunconcessional, private as well as public, from the\ndeveloped world to the developing world.\nThe total volume of assistance to developing\ncountries has declined over the past few years. We must\nchange this sad pattern. A first, necessary step would be\nfor all industrialized countries to live up to the United\nNations target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product\n(GNP). Three years ago, Denmark reached 1 per cent of\nGNP. We intend to continue that policy.\n19\n\n\nThe need for emergency relief is greater than ever. It\nis a short-sighted solution to finance emergency relief out\nof funds set aside for development. We must find additional\nfinancing.\nImproving the condition of women throughout the\nworld is of vital importance. We, the Member States of the\nUnited Nations, have the responsibility to implement the\nPlatform for Action adopted at Beijing. This platform must\nbe pursued at all levels. Let us start right now.\nThe second point is the \u201cAgenda for Peace\u201d. The ideas\nexpressed therein on preventive diplomacy and a rapid\nreaction force must be implemented, followed \u2014 after a\nconflict has ended \u2014 by confidence-building and\nhumanitarian measures.\nMany of these tasks can be carried out by regional\norganizations. Giving more responsibility to regional\norganizations would in Europe mean strengthening the\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe\n(OSCE).\nWe have seen an increase in the number and\ncomplexity of peace-keeping operations. Successful\noperations such as those in Namibia, Cambodia and, most\nrecently, Mozambique and El Salvador should not be\nforgotten. As noted by the Secretary-General, the problems\nposed by several of today\u2019s conflicts are unprecedented. We\nmust learn to tackle these new problems. United Nations\npeace-keeping forces have proved to be an invaluable tool.\nWe all have an interest in improving peace-keeping as a\nunique instrument in international crisis management.\nWe must react strongly against deliberate attacks\nagainst United Nations personnel. Such attacks are\nabsolutely unacceptable. I appeal to all Member States to\nadhere to the Convention on the Safety of United Nations\nand Associated Personnel so that persons committing\nattacks against United Nations personnel are brought to\njustice.\nDenmark attaches great importance to the United\nNations stand-by forces arrangement. We were among the\nfirst to assign troops. We are currently, together with like-\nminded countries, exploring practical ways to a further\nshortening of United Nations reaction time.\nThere is also a clear need for minimum standards as\nregards troops and equipment. Denmark supports action\ntaken by the United Nations in the field of training. The\nUnited Nations must be given the right to set quality\nstandards for troops made available to the Organization.\nThe insufficiency of funds is putting the United\nNations into an almost untenable operational situation. We\nmust soon reach consensus on reforming and stabilizing\nthe financial foundation of the Organization.\nAs regards reimbursement for equipment put at the\ndisposal of the Organization, agreement on a new system\nmust be reached during this session of the General\nAssembly.\nThe third point concerns the former Yugoslavia.\nMore than two thirds of the total number of troops under\nthe United Nations serve in the former Yugoslavia. The\ninternational community has made a substantial\ncontribution towards settling the conflict. We have kept\nnegotiations going, sometimes against all odds. We have\nsustained what may be the most difficult peace-keeping\noperation the United Nations has ever mounted. We have\nrendered extensive humanitarian aid.\nWe hope that we are now closer to peace. Still,\nmany obstacles will have to be overcome. The conflict\nremains a huge challenge to the international community.\nThe basic principles for a settlement in Bosnia\nagreed upon in Geneva early this month form a good\nbasis for further negotiations. Pressure on all parties for\na negotiated settlement must be upheld. Lasting peace can\nbe achieved only through negotiations.\nDenmark continues to give full support to the\ninternational negotiating efforts, including the efforts of\nthe Contact Group. Denmark has provided a substantial\nnumber of peace-keepers and given sizeable contributions\nto alleviate humanitarian suffering. This commitment\nstands.\nBut it is absolutely unacceptable when United\nNations peace-keepers are used as pawns in military\nconfrontations. It is intolerable to see them exposed to\nsurprise actions and direct attacks with loss of life and\ncasualties as the tragic consequence.\nThe international community must be prepared for\naction to be taken when peace is finally achieved.\nDenmark stands ready to contribute. The present situation\npresents a window of opportunity; we must seize the\nmoment.\n20\n\n\nI would like to express my congratulations on the\ninterim agreement between the Greek and the Macedonian\nGovernments and to pay tribute to the untiring efforts of\nMr. Cyrus Vance.\nMy fourth point relates to the Middle Fast peace\nprocess. The strong determination to reach results\nmanifested itself in the peace treaty signed last autumn\nbetween Israel and Jordan and in the latest agreement\nbetween Israel and the Palestinian Authority on the second\nstage of Palestinian autonomy. Unfortunately, we see less\nprogress in relations between Syria and Israel and between\nLebanon and Israel. But we welcome the clear political will\nto engage in efforts that may bring progress. All parties\nstand to gain if they realize that there is no real alternative\nto negotiations and to a just and lasting peace for\neverybody.\nMy fifth point is that there is now hope in the field of\ndisarmament, arms control and confidence-building\nmeasures. We see positive trends, in particular the\nagreement reached on indefinitely extending the Treaty on\nthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. The\nimplementation of this Treaty has also become more\neffective. The end of East-West confrontation has led to\ndramatic reductions in nuclear stockpiles. But as long as\nthese weapons exist, the risk of their use remains. Denmark\nsupports the conclusion of a comprehensive test-ban treaty\nno later than 1996. In particular we support the efforts\nmade to negotiate a true zero-yield test ban.\nAt the same time, we deeply deplore the nuclear tests\ncarried out by China and France. We urge all\nnuclear-weapon States to refrain from further testing.\nThe Conference to review the 1980 Convention on\nProhibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Certain\nConventional Weapons Which May Be Deemed to Be\nExcessively Injurious or to Have Indiscriminate Effects is\nnow taking place at Vienna. We need progress at the\nConference towards the ultimate goal of the abolition of\nanti-personnel land mines.\nThe sixth point is that the Security Council needs to\nbe enlarged to reflect the world of today. There must be\nadditional seats for non-permanent members on the\nprinciple of equitable geographical representation. Denmark\nalso supports an enlargement of the Security Council with\nGermany and representatives of the Asian, African and\nLatin American regions as permanent members.\nMy seventh point relates to human rights. The\ninternational protection of human rights must be\nimproved. International cooperation on monitoring respect\nfor human rights must be strengthened. Additional\nresources to carry out this work must be found. In\nparticular, we must strengthen the Centre for Human\nRights and the office of the High Commissioner for\nHuman Rights. Denmark will serve as a member of the\nCommission on Human Rights as from 1 January 1996.\nOur key priorities as a member of that Commission will\ninclude the fight against torture, the furthering of the right\nto development and the rights of indigenous peoples. The\nestablishment of a permanent forum within the United\nNations is a major political aspiration of indigenous\npeoples around the world. Denmark shares that aspiration.\nThe General Assembly should decide to call a\ndiplomatic conference on the establishment of a\npermanent International criminal court to try cases of\nserious international crime.\nWith my final point I wish to draw attention to the\nstatement issued today by the Nordic Foreign Ministers\non the financial situation of the United Nations. In that\nstatement the Nordic countries call on all Member States\nto fulfil their financial obligations towards the United\nNations by immediately paying all outstanding\ncontributions. Imagine how much more could be done if\nthe United Nations had its present outstanding\ncontributions \u2014 $3.5 billion \u2014 at its disposal. It is a\nparadox that those criticizing the United Nations for a\nlack of efficiency are often those who do not honour their\nfinancial obligations. They are in this way holding the\nOrganization hostage. They continue to criticize the\nUnited Nations as if the Organization were not their\norganization.\nDenmark sees no alternative to international\ncooperation to solve global problems. The will of\nMember States determines the strength of our\ncooperation. Much more can be done, provided\nGovernments are willing.\nThe United Nations has experienced much\nturbulence. The United Nations needs renewal. The\nUnited Nations needs resources. The United Nations\nneeds commitment. Denmark remains as dedicated to the\nUnited Nations today as we were 50 years ago.\n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of the\nGovernment and the people of the Commonwealth of the\nBahamas, I convey warm congratulations to Mr. Diogo\nFreitas do Amaral on his election as President of this\nhistoric fiftieth session of the General Assembly. I am\nconfident that, with his experience and diplomatic skills, he\nwill guide the work of this session to a successful\nconclusion. I wish to assure him of my delegation\u2019s full\nsupport and cooperation.\nI wish also to express my delegation\u2019s sincere\nappreciation to His Excellency Mr. Amara Essy, Minister\nfor Foreign Affairs of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, who presided over the\nwork of the forty-ninth session with great distinction.\nThe Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Boutros\nBoutros-Ghali, has continued in the discharge of his duties\nto provide outstanding leadership to this Organization. The\nBahamas is particularly grateful to the Secretary-General\nfor his untiring and visionary efforts in pursuit of world\npeace and security, development and international\ncooperation.\nGlobal changes in recent times have created\nunprecedented possibilities for both progress and disaster on\nour planet. Yet we fail to assume the responsibilities that\nboth possibilities demand. We have the machinery for this\npurpose; we must take it out, overhaul it and make it\nfunctional. This requires the review and updating of the\ninstitutions and processes of international cooperation.\nWithin the context of the global consensus around the need\nfor such an overhaul, including the adoption of new\napproaches, our tasks are greatly eased. If we accept the\nadage that form follows function, we must now determine\nwhat it is we are hoping to achieve, and what function we\nare seeking to serve. The form of the structure for ensuring\nthe effective execution of that function will then naturally\nemerge.\nThe framers of the Charter were determined to save\nsucceeding generations from the scourge of war. We have\nmanaged to do this as far as global war is concerned, but\nwhat have we saved these generations for? What is their\nheritage? What is their future? Is it good enough to save\nthem for the seemingly inevitable lot of chronic poverty,\nignorance and disease, for the threat of nuclear\nannihilation or the consequences of global warming? Is it\ngood enough to save these generations for a life where\nthe security and very existence of the planet on which\nthey live is in jeopardy?\nClearly, those responsible for establishing the\nparameters of action in the past have not produced the\nresult that is not only desirable but necessary to ensure a\nstable, secure and viable future. The question now is who\ndetermines the assignment of responsibility. Is it possible\nthat those countries most directly concerned have\nabdicated their responsibility, with the result that their fate\nnow resides in the hands of those whose interests are, at\nbest, competing?\nIt is only logical that those who stand to lose and\nbenefit most must assume the lead in establishing the\ncontours of the agenda for the process which will usher\nin the kind of order that gives coherence to their ideas\nand vision, and that provides for the attainment of their\nobjectives. This places before developing countries like\nthe Bahamas untold opportunities and challenges. One of\nthe major challenges will be to ensure that our\nrelationship with our global partners is truly one of\ninterdependence, and not masked dependence where the\nmajority of humanity are only subordinate players,\ncitizens of countries marginalized and on the periphery of\nglobal change.\nGenuine interdependence coupled with a true sense\nof interconnectedness would eliminate the desire for\nunilateral action. In this context, we are disturbed and\ndisappointed over the decision by two nuclear States to\nproceed with nuclear tests after the solemn commitments\nof the 1995 Review and Extension Conference of the\nParties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\nWeapons. The hope of the international community had\nbeen for complete moratoriums on testing until the entry\ninto force of a comprehensive test-ban treaty, envisaged\nfor the end of next year.\nThe Bahamas is especially pleased that United States\nPresident Bill Clinton, on 6 August last, unequivocally\ncommitted his Government to ending all testing of nuclear\nweapons, and further committed his Administration to the\ncompletion of negotiations on a comprehensive test-ban\ntreaty.\nDespite the easing of global tensions since the end\nof the cold war, the maintenance of international peace\n20\n\n\nand security remains a major preoccupation for the United\nNations. Religious and territorial disputes have presented\nthe international community with new challenges and with\nthe need to provide appropriate solutions.\nOf all the regional conflicts in the world today,\nparticular mention should be made of the situation in the\nformer Yugoslavia. In this regard I must express my\ndelegation\u2019s dissatisfaction with the continuation of\nhostilities in that region. It is the hope of my delegation\nthat the efforts now being undertaken by the parties\nconcerned towards achieving a negotiated solution to end\nthat conflict will meet with success.\nWe also welcome the recent agreement on expansion\nof Palestinian interim self-rule. This constitutes a major step\nforward in the Middle East peace process.\nIt is the hope of the Bahamas delegation that during\nthis fiftieth session of the General Assembly every effort\nwill be made to take decisions that will sustain efforts\ntowards the maintenance of global peace and security.\nIt is with a sense of responsibility that the Bahamas\nassumes a strong stance on the rehabilitation and\nreconstruction of Haiti. We participated in United Nations\nefforts to return President Aristide to Haiti. This is a second\nchance for Haiti. We note that since the return of President\nAristide the gross human rights violations have subsided\nand that the democratic process has now begun with the\nfirst and second rounds of elections.\nElections, however, are only the beginning. Massive\nassistance, financial and technical, is what is needed to\ncreate the proper institutional and infrastructural framework\nto facilitate rapid development in Haiti.\nThe Prime Minister of the Bahamas has stated on\nseveral occasions,\n\u201cWe in the international community have sold the\nHaitian people a bill of goods. We have told them that\ndemocracy will bring peace, stability, and economic\nand social development. We must now ensure after-\nsales services.\u201d\nTime is of the essence. The people of Haiti must not be\nallowed to lose hope for the betterment of their condition.\nWe must ensure that we receive the necessary returns on\nour investment to date. To do so requires a strategy for\nensuring that the situation that has given rise to the initial\ncrisis is not allowed to re-emerge.\nThere are now indications that some of the people of\nHaiti have already begun to lose hope. I was informed\nonly a few hours ago that 216 new refugees were found\nin the waters of the Bahamas. This brings the number of\nnew refugees who have risked their lives on the sea in the\nlast month to over 1,000. This cannot be allowed to\ncontinue. The Government of the Bahamas, together with\nthe Caribbean Community (CARICOM) partners,\nreiterates its commitment to playing its part in the\nrehabilitation of Haiti.\nThe changes in the international system have also\nmade States acutely aware that attention must now be\npaid equally to environmental security. Illustrative of this\nare the issues of nuclear testing, the transboundary\nmovement of hazardous and radioactive wastes, and\nnatural-disaster preparedness, which are of considerable\nconcern to us in the Caribbean region.\nNatural disasters have wreaked havoc upon countries\nand people. The Bahamas extends its sympathy and\nsupport to our sister Caribbean States and the United\nStates of America, which have just recently been victims\nof this phenomenon. The Bahamas is encouraged by the\nsupport given by the United Nations system, CARICOM,\nand other countries, including Japan, Canada, the United\nStates and the United Kingdom, for the rehabilitation of\nthe affected countries.\nA new approach requires a new attitude and a new\ncommitment to enforcing those aspects of the present\norder which, though potentially effective, have been\nemployed selectively at best. Respect for the rule of law,\nbasic human rights and the dignity of the individual must\nbe rediscovered. There is need for a strong ethical base to\nensure integrity and honesty in honouring agreements.\nThis becomes increasingly important in the context of the\nglobalizing effect of trade and communications\ntechnology. As commercial barriers are removed, we must\nensure that ethnic and cultural barriers are not erected in\ntheir place, as these produce intolerance and the\nconcomitant intra-State ethnic, religious and territorial\ndisputes.\nEqually important to this new approach is a\nrecognition of the revised roles for former leaders and\nactors in our affairs; traditionally, matters of national and\ninternational concern were dealt with at the\nintergovernmental level. It is now necessary to recognize\nthat individuals and institutions, both public and private,\nmust have an input. Effective management or governance\nmust be inclusive.\n21\n\n\nThis realization does not, however, remove the\nresponsibility of Governments to conduct their affairs in a\nmanner that is both democratic and transparent, thereby\nfacilitating accountability. Democratization must mean a\nguarantee of free participation, where the expressed will of\nthe people is fully reflected in the actions of Governments.\nSuch democratization must not be limited to States, but\nmust spread throughout the international system and its\nseveral components. The United Nations, as one of the\nprincipal elements of this system, must reflect this\ndemocracy in its decision-making bodies, such as the\nSecurity Council. The Bahamas has followed the\ndeliberations of the Working Group on the reform of the\nSecurity Council with great interest and hopes that the\nmomentum of those deliberations will be maintained, with\na view to reaching consensus on the issues at an early date.\nOnce again, the Bahamas wishes to record its support\nfor the entreaties made by the Republic of China on Taiwan\nto this Organization to examine the merits of establishing\nan ad hoc committee to analyse comprehensively the\ncurrent implications and future ramifications of the\npreclusion of the 21 million people in the Republic of\nChina from contributing to, and availing themselves of, all\nthe benefits derived from membership in the United Nations\nand its affiliated agencies. The Bahamas also lends its voice\nto those who encourage dialogue and meaningful\nconfidence-building steps between the People\u2019s Republic of\nChina and the Republic of China on Taiwan.\nThe Government of the Bahamas is committed to good\ngovernance and democratic principles, where human rights\nand dignity are respected, and where strong democratic\nstructures exist, involving every stratum of society. Such a\ncontext facilitates the decentralization of decision-making\nto the communities which will ultimately be affected by\nthem.\nMy Government\u2019s philosophy is based on the\nfollowing seven tenets: the exercise of honesty and\naccountability in all public matters; the development and\nstrengthening of the world\u2019s economy, so that all people\nmay aspire to suitable and acceptable living standards, and\nto meaningful improvement of the quality of their lives; the\ncommitment to providing the private sector with incentives,\nencouragement and scope for revitalizing and expanding the\nworld\u2019s economy, so as to generate sustainable employment\nopportunities for all people; the enhancement of educational\nand training opportunities and the development of suitable\nrecreational facilities, so that young people will be equipped\nfor challenging careers and can lead purposeful lives; the\nestablishment of compassionate social programmes to assist\nthose in society who are in the greatest need; the creation\nof a physical and social environment as beautiful and as\nsecure as possible, so that all people can enjoy the full\nbeauty and wonder of the world without fear, hindrance\nor intimidation; and, finally, the development of mutual\ntrust and harmony among the peoples of the world,\nirrespective of religious, racial, economic or social\ndifferences.\nMy Government recognizes the vital role of women\nin all aspects of this process. It seeks to ensure that they\nare involved in shaping and moulding their destinies by\nremoving all barriers to their access to policy-making\nlevels of society and to their full involvement in the\ndecision-making process.\nIt is gratifying to note that most of the critical areas\nof concern identified in the Platform for Action of the\nrecent Fourth World Conference on Women are being\nadequately addressed in the Bahamas.\nIn fulfilling its responsibilities for shaping this new\norder outside the Bahamas, my Government will seek to\nensure that its national priorities find room on the\ninternational agenda and in the organizations assigned to\naddress these matters. We cannot decry the international\ncommunity for lack of action if we fail to provide the\nnecessary leadership.\nWe extend such an attitude to our commitment to\nensuring that the United Nations, which constitutes the\nbest mechanism for addressing such an agenda, operates\non a sound financial basis by seeing to it that our\ncontributions are paid in full and on time. We encourage\nother nations to do likewise. It is a travesty that at a time\nwhen this Organization has been assigned such a vital\nrole in the management of international affairs it is on the\nverge of bankruptcy, with only some 60 countries out of\n185 having fully met their financial obligations to date.\nResponsibility for our future is in our hands. The\nfounding fathers of this Organization provided a solid\nfoundation. Regrettably, the structure erected thereon has\nproved inadequate for the needs of the \u201cfamily\u201d. Let us\nnow ensure that in our renovations all concerns are taken\ninto account so that we provide not only shelter but also\nwarmth and security.\n"

        "file_text": "It is a great pleasure and, indeed, an honour for\nme, to convey to the General Assembly the fond greetings\nof the people of Guinea, its Government and its President,\nGeneral Lansana Cont\u00e9, at the opening of this session,\nwhich so fortuitously coincides with the celebration of the\nfiftieth anniversary of our Organization.\nThe President returned to the Chair.\nI am very pleased to extend to you, Mr. President,\nmy warm congratulations on your brilliant election to the\npresidency of the fiftieth session of the General\nAssembly. Your election and the outstanding efforts by\nyour country, Portugal, within this great family of nations,\nare a cause of satisfaction to my delegation. I believe that\nwith your experience and your abilities as a great\ndiplomat, you will guide our deliberations with great\nsuccess.\nI would join other delegations in paying a well-\ndeserved tribute to your predecessor, Mr. Amara Essy of\nthe sister Republic of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, whose dynamism and\ngreat qualities as a sophisticated diplomat helped us move\nforward as our Organization sought answers to the\nchallenges facing our world today.\nAlso, I would here extend my Government\u2019s\nappreciation to the Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros\nBoutros-Ghali, for the enormous amount of work he has\ndone and for the resolve and wisdom that he demonstrates\nin seeking solutions to all the fundamental issues,\n16\n\n\nparticularly those relating to peace, security, development\nand democracy throughout the world.\nI should like to congratulate the people of Palau on\ntheir admission to membership in the United Nations as the\n185th Member State. The presence of their delegation here\nwith us confirms once more the universality of our\nOrganization.\nIt is clear that the last few years of this century are\nbeing played out against a background of crisis and\nconflict, creating an impression of uncertainty as to the\nfuture of the human race. But we must recognize that the\ninternational community has made considerable efforts in\npreparing global strategies for peace and security\nthroughout the world, taking into account the environment,\nsustainable development, the emancipation of women and\nthe protection of children.\nDespite these efforts, many parts of the world, sorely\ntried by poverty and backwardness, do not yet have\nsufficient food or enough drinking water, education or\nmedical care. Civil war and natural disaster continue to\nendanger the economies of those same areas, which are\nalready afflicted by a widespread world crisis.\nEntire nations, such as my own, the Republic of\nGuinea, pay a heavy price because of their geographical\nlocation. More than 600,000 refugees and displaced persons\nfrom Liberia and Sierra Leone are now living in our\ncountry. The Republic of Guinea will never abandon its\nhumanitarian duty to its Liberian and Sierra Leonean\nbrothers, and continues to suffer the consequences of a\nfratricidal war which has lasted for six years in one of\nthose neighbours and three years in the other.\nIt is true that relative calm, showing a clearer desire\nfor peace in Liberia, has been noted since the agreements\nbetween the factions were signed on 19 August 1995 at\nAbuja.\nIn the view of my delegation, this new choice of peace\nin Liberia also requires a clear-cut effort on the part of the\ninternational community. In this connection, one has to\nensure better control of weapons flows in the region. The\nGovernment of the Republic of Guinea is resolved to take\naction to that end.\nClearly, peace in Liberia will help to unblock the\ncrisis in Sierra Leone and to establish in our subregion of\nWest Africa an atmosphere of peace, security and lasting\nstability, which are all essential to our programme for\neconomic integration.\nMy Government also welcomes the Lusaka\nAgreements and we support all the efforts being made to\nimplement those Agreements with a view to ending the\ncrisis in Angola. It is our belief that if the political will\nshown on both sides is sustained, then the people of\nAngola will come to know the peace and stability they\nhave yearned for so long and will be able to work for\nnational reconstruction and economic and social\ndevelopment.\nHere we would pay tribute to the joint efforts made\nby the United Nations and the Organization of African\nUnity (OAU) and by the international community for\npeace and reconciliation in that brother country.\nOn the question of Somalia, my delegation deplores\nthe current blockage in the peace process. We would urge\nall parties to the conflict to demonstrate wisdom and\nmutual understanding with a view to finding a peaceful\nsettlement to the crisis.\nTurning to Rwanda and Burundi, my delegation\nbelieves that to encourage major efforts by the\ninternational community, those involved in those societies\nmust triumph over hatred, cultivate a spirit of forgiveness\nand promote love and dialogue.\nToday, the conflict in the Middle East is on a\npositive footing. In this regard, the advent of Palestinian\nautonomy in the Gaza Strip and Jericho, continuing\nnegotiations for extending that autonomy to territories still\nunder occupation, the Jordanian-Israeli agreement on\nborders and the Israeli-Syrian talks on the Golan are all\nsignificant advances that augur well for a comprehensive,\njust and lasting settlement of the question.\nUnited Nations resolutions on Jammu and Kashmir,\non recognition of the border between Iraq and Kuwait and\non the situation in Afghanistan should, we believe, benefit\nfrom mutual understanding between those involved. The\nsame holds true for the question of Western Sahara.\nIn the Korean peninsula, we are pleased to see an\neasing of tension. My delegation would encourage the\nNorth and the South to pursue their efforts towards the\nindependent and peaceful reunification of their country\ninto a confederated republic in keeping with the principle\nof one State, one nation, two regimes and two\nGovernments. Moreover, my Government is pleased that\n17\n\n\nthe talks between the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of\nKorea and the United States of America have led to a\nnegotiated solution of the nuclear issue on the peninsula\nand to an improvement in the relations between those two\ncountries.\nIn the former Yugoslavia and Bosnia and Herzegovina,\nthe multicultural and ancient civilization, born of the\ncontributions of diverse peoples throughout the Balkans, is\nbeing jeopardized by human fury. My delegation believes\nthat what is happening there, and indeed everywhere,\nshould remind the international community of its\nresponsibilities for peace and reconciliation among the\npeoples and their component groups.\nAll the wars that are ravaging entire regions of the\nworld today share, along with their countless dead, the\nphenomenon of an endless flow of displaced persons\nseeking, over mountains and through valleys, a place of\nrefuge. Despite the international community\u2019s spirit of\nsolidarity, refugees and displaced persons experience the\nvery worst deprivations. These days, their problem has\ngrown to unprecedented proportions of gravity and\ncomplexity. Their numbers have increased from year to\nyear, making it ever more difficult to manage the problem\nappropriately. In my delegation\u2019s view, the crises that\nspawn refugees constitute genuine threats to regional\nstability and world peace.\nGuinea, which is participating in the United Nations\nsecurity mission in the Rwandese refugee camps in Zaire,\nin keeping with a framework agreement signed with the\nOffice of the United Nations High Commissioner for\nRefugees, and taking account of its own experience with\nLiberian and Sierra Leonean refugees, believes that no\neffort should be spared to calm extremism everywhere. That\nis why my Government supports all initiatives to strengthen\nthe intervention capacities of the High Commissioner for\nRefugees. Guinea also supports the drafting of an agenda\nfor humanitarian action along the lines of \u201cAn Agenda for\nPeace\u201d and \u201cAn Agenda for Development\u201d.\nDespite the end of the East-West conflict, nuclear\nweapons remain the greatest threat to international peace\nand security, in spite of the remarkable progress made in\nbilateral and multilateral disarmament negotiations. Many\ndangers still threaten our efforts to achieve a collective\nsecurity that would include the related issues of\ndevelopment, environment and human rights.\nIn certain key areas, there is an evident and growing\ntrend in the trafficking and use of chemical and fissionable\nmaterials in conflicts, as well as the hidden or overt\ndesire of some countries to possess nuclear weapons.\nThese facts represent dangers that increase the\nresponsibilities of the United Nations, which is called\nupon to take rigorous verification measures.\nThat is why the Republic of Guinea welcomes the\npositive outcome of the New York Conference which led\nto the indefinite and unconditional extension of the Treaty\non the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. This was\nundeniably an important step towards nuclear\ndisarmament and confirmed the special responsibility of\nthe nuclear Powers. However, if it is to be effective, this\nachievement must be complemented by the immediate\nconclusion of a comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty. All\nnuclear tests must be prohibited.\nIt is obvious that this quick overview of the major\nconcerns of our age \u2014 those relating to international\nsecurity \u2014 amply demonstrate the importance today of\nUnited Nations peace-keeping operations. My Government\ntherefore welcomes the special attention given by the\nUnited Nations to the settlement of conflicts in the world.\nWe support the relevant views expressed by the\nSecretary-General in his Agenda for Peace.\nNone the less, while welcoming United Nations\ninvolvement in various theatres of operation throughout\nthe world, we must also recognize that over the past few\nyears the peace-keeping operations have, for the most\npart, yielded somewhat meagre results. This requires\ntoday, in the light of our experience, a reformulation of\nthe entire issue of such operations.\nIf they are to be effective, peacemaking and peace-\nkeeping operations must be the subject of broader\nagreement and dialogue among all the States Members of\nthe United Nations, without discrimination. It is in that\ncontext that Guinea welcomes the establishment and work\nof the mechanism of the Organization of African Unity\nfor the prevention, management and settlement of\nconflicts in Africa. We urge the United Nations and the\ninternational community to give it all the necessary\nassistance.\nEconomic and social development is a prerequisite\nof lasting peace and security. In developing countries,\nparticularly in Africa, a sense of insecurity arises out of\nuncertainty in the future. It can thus be easily understood\nwhy we often see a collapse of political and social\nbalances, leading to civil disorder and ethnic and religious\nconflicts.\n18\n\n\nDespite United Nations efforts in the economic and\nsocial field, the results remain meagre in some regions of\nthe world, particularly Africa, which is still deeply affected\nby inequality, poverty and other serious problems that often\nweaken the social fabric and undermine the foundations of\nour States.\nRecent trends in the world economy have helped to\nworsen this already precarious situation. Thus, the debt\nburden remains the main obstacle to development in poor\ncountries, forcing them to devote a major share of their\nscarce resources to it. The collapse of the prices of\ncommodities, which are their main contribution to the world\nmarket, has added to their poverty.\nOn top of these harsh conditions come the effects of\nthe implementation, by some of our States, of structural\nadjustment programmes that are sometimes poorly prepared\nand often poorly implemented. If all of these various\nreforms undertaken by our countries are to bear fruit, all of\nthe partners, national and foreign alike, will have to support\nAfrica\u2019s development efforts in an effective way. If they\nare to be mutually beneficial, the proceeds of all public and\nprivate assistance will simply have to take account of\neveryone\u2019s respective requirements for well-being.\nWithin the framework of the Uruguay Round of the\nGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, Guinea welcomes\nthe Marrakesh Agreements that gave rise to the World\nTrade Organization. Those Agreements will be viable,\nhowever, only if they take genuine account of the need to\npromote the integration of the African economy into the\nworld economy by developing its capacities and making it\nmore dynamic. In this connection we strongly support the\nidea of setting up a commodities diversification fund.\nMy delegation greatly appreciates the special attention\ngiven to Africa at the summer session of the Economic and\nSocial Council in Geneva, which considered the conditions\nfor implementation of the United Nations New Agenda for\nthe Development of Africa in the 1990s.\nBilateral initiatives must be supported in order to\nstrengthen South-South cooperation on the one hand and to\ncontinue the North-South dialogue on the other hand.\nMoreover the Agenda for Development must focus\nprimarily on Africa, where much of the population lives in\npoverty. Implementation of that Agenda, complementing the\nAgenda for Peace, will make it possible once again to\nmeasure the new political will that has emerged at recent\ninternational conferences on social development,\npopulation and development, and women.\nThe Secretary-General\u2019s Agenda for Development\noffers an appropriate framework for North-South dialogue\nand it must also enable the United Nations to provide\nbetter coordination for, and to make more operational, the\npolicies and programmes implemented by its specialized\nagencies and institutions, which have had a very limited\npositive impact on the economies of developing countries\nso far.\nIn this connection my Government notes with real\ninterest and much hope that the Food and Agriculture\nOrganization of the United Nations will be organizing a\nworld summit on food security in November 1996. That\nworld-wide meeting will make it possible we believe to\nformulate specific and appropriate solutions to the serious\neconomic problems facing developing countries.\nOf course, all these hopes will be in vain if the\nStates of the world are unable to crush drug-trafficking\nand abuse.\nWhile reconfirming our support for Agenda 21 and\nall the agreements on sustainable development, we believe\nthat it is only greater political will that will make it\npossible to translate into action the decisions that emerge\nfrom these various meetings.\nAt the Halifax Summit, held from 15 to 17 June last,\nthe Group of Seven quite rightly recognized that\nsustainable development was one of the major challenges\nof the twenty-first century. At that meeting it was also\nsaid that better quality of life for all was the objective of\nsustainable development, the foundations of which are\ndemocracy, human rights, transparent and responsible\nmanagement of public affairs, investment in the human\nindividual and protection of the environment. Guinea\nwelcomes the commitments entered into by the Group of\nSeven to support national efforts in this area.\nProtecting fundamental human rights, meeting human\nneeds, achieving social justice and human development\nare still the focus of concern of the Government of\nGuinea in its ambitious economic and social reform\nprogramme, which has been under way since 1984.\nGuinea is party to several international conventions\nrelating to human rights because it is firmly committed to\npromoting and protecting these fundamental rights and\nfreedoms.\n19\n\n\nToday I am happy to be able to tell the international\ncommunity that my country completed instituting its\ndemocratic republican institutions in June this year when\nwe organized our multiparty legislative and municipal\nelections.\nThe successful completion of this process of\ndemocratization, the establishment of a State of law, and\nthe liberalization of the economy in the Republic of Guinea\nall benefited from the support and understanding of the\ninternational community as a whole and I should like to\nthank you all for this.\nThe United Nations and its specialized agencies, as the\nparamount instrument for cooperation and multilateral\nagreement, see their responsibilities increased today more\nthan ever before. Today this universal Organization has\ncertainly acquired a certain prestige. Its help is requested in\nevery area.\nTo strengthen its effectiveness on this fiftieth\nanniversary of its founding, the United Nations must\nrestructure and revitalize its principal organs in the light of\nthe changes that have taken place in the international arena\nand taking account of the challenges facing mankind in the\nforthcoming millennium.\nThe reforms must be based on the principle of equality\namong Member States at the level of decision-making\nbodies and also within the various organs.\nIt is only in this way that our common heritage, this\nirreplaceable tool, this United Nations, will be able\nsuccessfully to discharge its mission of preserving\ninternational peace and security and promoting a fairer\nworld, more equitable and more prosperous world.\nThe success of this institution does depend of course\non an improvement in its financial situation at a time when\nits responsibilities are constantly increasing in this ever-\nchanging international situation.\nThe United Nations has existed for half a century now.\nThe solemn celebration of its first 50 years coincides with\nthe twilight of the twentieth century and it offers its 185\nMembers an opportunity to try to revitalize its activities and\nto agree on equitable representation within its principal\norgans. In Guinea commemoration of this historic event is\ntaking place with the full support of our Government.\nMay the decades to come bring greater\nunderstanding among people and among nations so as to\nensure the greater happiness of mankind.\n\n"

        "file_text": "Our presence here at the fiftieth session of the\nGeneral Assembly holds a very special meaning. On this\noccasion, we are not gathered here simply to reenact the\nannual ritual of exchanging views and official national\npositions on the principal problems that encumber the\ninternational agenda. These first 50 years during which\nthe Organization has carried out its noble task have been\nmarked by successes and disappointments.\n23\n\n\nAs President Menem said in this very forum a year\nago, the real situation in the world today offers a balance\nof light and shadow in which encouraging signs of\nconvergence exist alongside other signs that seem to point\nto the persistence of injustice and disagreement. The search\nfor a delicate balance of peace and security with\ndevelopment and social justice is the goal which we must\nconstantly pursue. This search must be translated into\nconcrete facts which demonstrate on this anniversary,\nthrough the actions of each and every Member State, the\nextent to which we have faithfully respected the spirit and\nthe letter of the Charter.\nAt this historic moment, my country has chosen\nactively to involve itself in the resolution of serious\ninternational crises through the concerted action of the\nUnited Nations.\nThe tragic situation in the Balkans has found\nArgentina present in solidarity, through its troops, in search\nof a space for dialogue and understanding after five years\nof blood and fire. Today we are witnessing the rebirth of\nhope, starting with the recent Geneva agreements and those\nthat were signed yesterday. We hope that the peoples of the\nnew republics of the Balkans can, once and for all, begin\nlife again in peace after such enormous suffering, so much\nviolence and so many unnecessary deaths.\nThe Middle East has suffered the attacks of\nextremism; yet the peace process initiated in 1993 forges\nahead. On behalf of the people and the Government of\nArgentina, I pay a tribute to the leaders of Israel and the\nPalestinian people, who, despite provocations and the\nlegitimate grievances of those who suffer, have managed to\nfix their eyes on the future and continue the task of\nconcluding agreements on each of the points that comprise\nthe complex agenda for peace in the Middle East.\nWe cannot forget our African brothers and sisters, who\nhave been affected by situations in which political struggles\nand the survival of the least fortunate are combined in a\nmost dramatic fashion. It is precisely in those situations that\nwe must reaffirm our contribution and our solidarity,\nbecause we cannot remain indifferent to the suffering and\ndeprivation of so many human beings without neglecting\nthe commitments dictated to us by the Charter and imposed\nupon us by human solidarity. To the extent of our ability,\nwe maintain our participation in the solution of such\nproblems as those of Western Sahara, Mozambique and\nAngola, a neighbour country of ours in the South Atlantic\nwith which we will cooperate actively in the United Nations\nAngola Verification Mission (UNAVEM III).\nThe case of Haiti warrants my particular\nconsideration, since it deals with an issue that directly\naffects our region of Latin America and the Caribbean.\nToday, I would like to express the Argentine\nGovernment\u2019s great pleasure at the successful process that\nculminated in the adoption of Security Council resolution\n940 (1994). Only through that resolution could the\nGovernment legitimately elected by the Haitian people be\nreestablished \u2014 a Government which, with moving\nendurance and commitment, is restoring institutional\nnormalcy and again moving ahead on the road to\neconomic development.\nArgentina is proud of its character as a Latin\nAmerican nation. In just a few days, we will have the\nhigh honour of hosting the Fifth Ibero-American Summit,\nat which all the nations of our region, together with their\nrespective mother countries, all linked by a common\nhistory and culture, will set an inspiring example of\ndialogue and cooperation in the search for solutions\nadapted to our present reality. It is precisely this reality\nand the prospects we envisage for it that make us look\nwith optimism to a Latin American future based on\ndemocracy, peace and integration.\nThe Argentine commitment to peace was recently\ndemonstrated once again through the active exercise of\nthe role mandated to us, together with Brazil, Chile and\nthe United States of America, as guarantors of the 1942\nRio Protocol, in an effort to bring the peoples of Ecuador\nand Peru together once and for all.\nBuilding upon political and economic stability,\nambitious mechanisms for integration have been designed\nthat contribute to consolidating the opening of our\neconomies, the transparency of our markets, and the\ngrowth of commercial exchange with other regions \u2014 in\nshort, the creation of the conditions necessary to secure a\nbetter future for our peoples.\nIn our case, we have made the Southern Cone\nCommon Market (Mercosur) a priority in our foreign\npolicy, with the understanding not only that its\nstrengthening will boost our economy and those of its\nmember countries, but also, and most especially, that it is\nthanks to this open approach that the men and women of\nour country and our region can come together today in an\natmosphere of economic growth after so many years of\ndisillusionment and frustration.\n24\n\n\nIn Argentina, we place special emphasis on the\nfollowing principles: good governance; the struggle against\ncorruption; discipline in fiscal matters; accountability in the\nmanagement of public finances; respect for human rights;\nlegal equality for foreign investments; and full authority for\ninstitutions within the rule of law. These are the principles\nthat form the framework designed to give a greater boost to\neconomic activity as a necessary motor for the well-being\nof the Argentina people.\nThis framework of recovery and harmony within Latin\nAmerica, however, raises important issues which remain\nunresolved.\nIn the South Atlantic, the dispute concerning\nsovereignty over the Malvinas, South Georgia and South\nSandwich Islands and the surrounding maritime spaces has\nnot yet been resolved. We will not cite yet again the\nnumerous resolutions in which the General Assembly and\nthe decolonization Committee have categorically and\nrepeatedly stated their position on this matter. Let me\nsimply recall that all of these include a clear and direct\nappeal to the two countries involved \u2014 Argentina and the\nUnited Kingdom \u2014 to reach a negotiated settlement of this\ndispute. This appeal from the Assembly remains unheeded,\ndespite the willingness we have constantly shown and the\nexcellent relations that bind our two countries. This makes\nthe issue even more baffling.\nIn spite of this, we maintain a cooperative effort with\nregard to the exploitation of fishing resources in the area in\nan attempt to protect the biomass and at the same time\nensure that significant economic activity continues.\nWith regard to oil, given the non-renewable character\nof the resources and the existence of a consolidated\ninternational doctrine which proscribes the unilateral\nexploitation of disputed resources, we are reaching a\ntemporary understanding that allows us to engage in further\nexploration and exploitation while avoiding the creation of\nnew sources of tension which might discourage initiatives\nfrom the private sector.\nThis very morning we and the United Kingdom\nSecretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs,\nMalcolm Rifkind, signed a joint declaration which will\nallow us to move forward together in this spirit.\nWith respect to the inhabitants of the islands, I repeat\nour determination to guarantee total respect for their way of\nlife, their culture, habits and institutions.\nThe dispute over the Malvinas Islands will not\ndisappear as if by magic. The peaceful recovery of the\nexercise of full sovereignty over all the territories in\ndispute and the surrounding waters, and respect for the\nway of life of the islands\u2019 inhabitants, are today part of\nArgentina\u2019s Constitution, on which there was consensus\nacross the entire political spectrum of my country. Only\nrational dialogue, without any a priori conditions from\neither party, will permit us to make progress towards the\nfinal implementation of the resolutions of the Assembly\nand of the Decolonization Committee.\nAt the end of this year Argentina will conclude its\nterm as a non-permanent member of the Security Council.\nIn our two years as a member we have witnessed\nnumerous situations that have required an immediate\nresponse on the part of the Council. Responding to these\nsituations has not been an easy task, and at times the\nserious problems that have given rise to them have failed\nto receive full attention. Nevertheless, the Council\u2019s\nresponse has confirmed on each occasion its character as\nthe central and indispensable instrument for the\nmaintenance of international peace and security.\nOur commitment to the work of the Council has not\nbeen limited to its discussions; it has extended to\nArgentina\u2019s contribution to peace-keeping operations, the\nlargest in our region. Our presence in the former\nYugoslavia, in Cyprus, Mozambique, Haiti and Kuwait \u2014\nto name but a few operations \u2014 is tangible proof of our\nconcrete, and not just rhetorical, contribution to\ninternational peace and cooperation.\nIn recent days much has been said about the process\nof reform of the Security Council. If anything has been\nproved by the extended deliberations of the ad hoc Open-\nended Working Group established for this purpose, it is\nthe extreme difficulty of finding a formula, acceptable to\neveryone, that does not introduce imbalances into the\nregion.\nIn our delegation\u2019s view, the fundamental task in this\nrespect is to protect and improve the efficiency and\nexpeditiousness of the Council. In order to achieve this,\na careful, limited increase in the membership would be in\norder, should there be the necessary consensus. This\nincrease could be supplemented with a new procedure\naimed at achieving a greater representativeness, which, by\nmeans of rotation mechanisms, would enable several of\nthe most interested countries of different regions, as well\nas those which stand to wait many years before joining\n25\n\n\nthe Council, to take part more regularly in its deliberations.\nWe believe that those countries which are legitimately\ninterested in taking part in the daily construction of a stable\nand peaceful world order could fulfil their aspirations in\nthis way.\nMoreover, further changes in the procedure of the\nCouncil should be introduced in order to increase its\ntransparency and strengthen the process of dialogue and\nexchange of information. Over the past two years we have\nactively promoted such progress, being convinced that the\ncontribution of the international community to the solution\nof its crises would be facilitated if all its members had\nmore criteria and information on which to base their\ndecisions.\nThis matter is of undeniable importance, since the\nSecurity Council is the body ultimately entrusted with the\nmaintenance of international peace and security. This\nrequires that we proceed with the utmost care, searching\nrelentlessly for consensus.\nThis year has been marked by the positive contribution\nto international peace made here in New York, when the\n179 States Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\nNuclear Weapons (NPT), decided to extend it\nunconditionally and indefinitely. We are concerned about\nthe ongoing nuclear-test programmes. Therefore, we look\nforward to the prompt conclusion of the comprehensive\nnuclear-test-ban treaty, without exceptions or permissible\nthresholds. Likewise, we hope that the Conference on\nDisarmament will address without delay the negotiation of\na convention banning the production of fissionable material.\nIt is encouraging to note the increased awareness of\nwhat the Secretary-General has rightly called the\n\u201cinternational humanitarian crisis\u201d of anti-personnel mines.\nWe trust that the 1981 Convention on inhumane weapons\nwill be strengthened as a result of the meeting to be held in\nVienna in the next few days.For our part, in addition to\nsupporting the Assembly resolutions on the subject, we\nhave declared a unilateral moratorium on mine production,\nand with regard to a case which affects us directly \u2014 the\nmines planted by our armed forces on the Malvinas Islands\nin 1982 \u2014 we have offered our cooperation and financial\nhelp to the United Kingdom for their removal, which is\nproceeding with the greatly appreciated cooperation of the\nUnited States.\nApart from the struggle for the non-proliferation of\nweapons of mass destruction, new challenges to peace and\nstability, including international terrorism, have emerged.\nToday no one can feel safe from the action of groups\nwhich are international in structure and very often rely on\nthe active or passive support of certain States. Almost\nevery day gruesome attacks reflect the reality of this new\nthreat, which calls for a determined and unequivocal\nresponse by the international community.\nWe have drawn this issue to the attention of the\nSecurity Council, and we are confident that as a result\nurgent action at the national, regional and international\nlevels will be taken to promote legislative harmonization\nand cooperation in the judicial, police and even\nintelligence spheres, in order to halt this insidious\nmanifestation of terror.\nHowever, the pressing challenges requiring\ninternational action are not restricted to the domain of\nsecurity. Emergency assistance activities and the\nsubsequent stage of rehabilitation for development\nconstitute a priority task for the United Nations. For this\nreason, in 1994 we proposed the \u201cWhite Helmets\u201d\ninitiative, which aims to deliver assistance in cases of\nextreme urgency and to mobilize resources for specific\ninstances of extreme poverty. We are pleased to note that\nthe initiative was adopted by consensus in resolution\n49/139 B, with the formidable support of 67 co-sponsors.\nIn the future we will further define details of the\ninitiative, which has already been implemented in very\nsuccessful pilot projects in our region. We hope to extend\nthis initiative to other parts of the world where even\ngreater need is experienced.\nFrom a historical perspective, 50 years may not be\nmany, but they are not insignificant in the life of an\ninternational organization that every day has to address\nnumerous and complex issues. Today we find the United\nNations committed to the solution of international crises\nwhich affect international peace and security, a far cry\nfrom the marginalization of the Organization during the\ncold war. The United Nations is actively involved in\nadvances on great social issues by means of international\nconferences such as those of Vienna, on human rights;\nCairo, on population; Copenhagen, on social matters; and\nBeijing, on women.\nThese meetings reflect the new and vigorous stage\nreached by multilateralism, which elicits universally\naccepted responses to the great currents of sustainable\nhuman development, and acts in strict conformity with the\nprovisions of the Charter, under which the promotion of\nhuman welfare, development and dignity are harmonious\n26\n\n\nand mutually complementary priorities. We remain actively\ncommitted to work to achieve these priorities in the\nframework of the United Nations, thus renewing the\ncommitment of 1945, towards which the current reform\nprocess will make a substantive contribution, with the same\nfaith we had then, nourished by decades of cooperation.\nThe year 1995 is not only the year that marks the half\ncentury of the United Nations. Two years ago the General\nAssembly, in its resolution 48/126, declared 1995 the\nUnited Nations Year for Tolerance. It occurs to me that the\nforefathers of the United Nations must have had the idea of\ntolerance deeply etched in their minds when they set the\nfoundations of this unique endeavour.\nInternational reality reminds us how often we forget\ntolerance, how often we reject, proscribe or ignore others\nfor what they are, think, say or do, or simply for existing.\nMay this anniversary be a timely occasion to remember the\nneed to reaffirm in our minds, in the education of our\nchildren and in our acts, tolerance, and, with it, the culture\nof peace.\n"

        "file_text": "It gives me great pleasure to\ncongratulate Mr. Freitas do Amaral on his election as\nPresident of the General Assembly at its fiftieth session,\nduring which he will guide our discussions on what the\nfuture of the United Nations should be. May I also convey\nmy thanks to the President of the General Assembly at its\nforty-ninth session, Mr. Amara Essy, who, as it were, tilled\nthe ground which the new President will sow.\nA fiftieth anniversary is a climacteric, usually joyous\nbut not necessarily so. In ancient India, this was around the\ntime in a man\u2019s life that he would be expected to withdraw\ninto a forest, to spend the rest of his days in contemplation\nof past and future, it being the assessment of our ancestors\nthat anything a man could usefully do he would have done\nby then. No such drastic measures are needed for the\nUnited Nations, not least because it has spent much of its\nfirst 50 years meditating in a concrete jungle. And the\nshadow of the woods of Bretton always loom over it. I do\nthink, however, that as we celebrate, which we should, the\nsurvival of the United Nations, we should judge what it has\ndone and what it now needs to do. The United Nations\nsystem has had remarkable success in helping to defeat\ncolonialism and apartheid, on social issues like universal\nhealth care and women\u2019s rights, and in banning, through\nglobal, non-discriminatory treaties, two of the three\nweapons of mass destruction. These are considerable\nachievements. But a clear pattern emerges from them.\nWhenever the United Nations has acted on principle,\nresponding to the felt needs and priorities of the majority of\nits membership, it has done well. When it has pursued\nnarrow agendas or succumbed to special pleading, it has\nnot.\nIf we were setting out tasks for the United Nations\ntoday, what would be the major trends and challenges we\nwould expect it to address? The first is the international\neconomy, transformed by global movements of trade,\ncapital and labour; driven by forces which can break\ndeveloping economies; regulated \u2014 if they can be at all \u2014\nin forums outside the United Nations, which is therefore\nmarginalized in this most momentous of contemporary\ndevelopments. The second is an opening up of political\nsystems, with democracy the norm of national\ngovernance. The United Nations welcomes this and urges\nthe recalcitrant to change, but is itself sapped by\nundemocratic systems and institutions. The third is the\nscourge of war increasingly replaced by the scourge of\nterrorism, which, for the countries that sponsor it, is war\nby other means. The United Nations, set up to save\nsucceeding generations from the scourge of war, ignores\nit, as the League of Nations, to its fatal peril, ignored the\nthreat of xenophobia.\nThese are complex and titanic forces. We, therefore,\ncannot accept, either as a statement of fact or as a basis\nof policy, the view that all this meant was that the days\nof absolute sovereignty were over. Sovereignty has never\nbeen absolute. Most Members of the United Nations\njoined immediately after emerging from colonial rule,\nwith their economies destroyed, and dependent on foreign\nlanguages for communication, on imperial capitals for\nsupport and on donors for subsistence. This is hardly the\nstuff on which absolute sovereignty is built. It was, in\nfact, one of the great virtues of the United Nations that it\ngave fledgling nations space to exercise the sovereignty\nso cruelly circumscribed elsewhere. Therefore, the United\nNations should not claim a unilateral right to intervene in\nthe affairs of its Members. Sovereignty can be diluted\nonly with the voluntary consent of nation States accepting\nobligations that are non-discriminatory or, in exceptional\ncircumstances, where State authority has collapsed. Far\nfrom enfeebling sovereignty, it is the task of the United\nNations to nurture it in a world that has made the\npowerful more dominant and the weak increasingly\npowerless. We must never forget that this Assembly is an\nassembly of our nations united. The United Nations rests\non the commitment to it of sovereign nations.\nThere is clearly an enormous need for global action\nto deal with complex issues which have no territorial\nlimits or borders. This is the task of the United Nations.\nDeveloping countries which represent the majority of the\nUnited Nations, obviously want it to focus on the issues\nof most pressing concern to them. That is not only fair:\nthat would be the democratic thing to do. For us, the\nsingle most important task is development, and we expect\nthis to be the highest priority on the international agenda,\nas it is on our domestic agendas. Sadly, it is not. The\nAgenda for Development looks lamentably like an\nappendix. Can we, at this session, pledge ourselves to\nhonour the commitments, freely negotiated but never\nimplemented, which will make development possible in\n13\n\n\nthe South and make the world, for all of us, a better and\nmore peaceful place?\nIt is just as important for the United Nations to have\na say in the decisions that guide the international economy.\nChapter IX of the Charter gave it the task to promote\nhigher standards of living, solutions of international\neconomic, social, health and related problems, and universal\nrespect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. Like\nthe United Nations, the World Trade Organization gives\nequal weight to the votes of all its members, but it would\nbe a pity if the World Trade Organization cut even the\ntenuous links between the General Agreement on Tariffs\nand Trade (GATT) and the United Nations and, decided\ninstead that global economic policies would in the future be\ncoordinated between it, the World Bank and the\nInternational Monetary Fund, where the system of weighted\nvoting makes the voice of the developing countries\nirrelevant. At the same time, several studies commissioned\nto coincide with this anniversary claim that the United\nNations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD)\nno longer has a useful purpose. This can either mean that\nthe problems UNCTAD addresses \u2014 development\nstrategies, poverty alleviation, resource transfers and debt,\nand the transfer of technology \u2014 have been settled, or are\nnow irrelevant. Neither is true. These continue to be\nburning issues for developing countries, and if the United\nNations chooses to ignore them it will not serve the needs\nof its Member States.\nThe United Nations must assume its Charter\nresponsibility to supervise and coordinate global economic\npolicies. In the World Trade Organization efforts have been\nmade to link trade to environment and labour standards.\nThe World Bank, in its World Development Report 1995,\nwarns about\n\u201cthe proliferation of protectionist demands, many of\nthem under the guise of demands for fair trade and a\nlevel playing field\u201d.\nIf, indeed, there is a genuine interest in protecting the\nenvironment and the interests of labour in developing\ncountries, why are the United Nations Environment\nProgramme (UNEP) and the International Labour\nOrganization (ILO) being sidelined in this exercise? The\nanswer must be that there is no provision in these bodies\nfor the coercive, retaliatory action which would be available\nunder the sanctions regime of the World Trade\nOrganization.\nHowever, the industrialized countries say that\nenvironmental and labour standards must be harmonized\nupwards, because otherwise transnational corporations\nwould go where these standards were the lowest. This of\ncourse implies that transnational corporations have an\nappalling and exploitative standard of behaviour, but\nwhen, in the 1970s and 1980s, the United Nations tried to\ndevelop a code of conduct for transnational corporations,\nwe were told that transnational corporations were models\nof virtue. How do these two views cohere?\nThe problem posed by these global economic forces\nis enormous. Trade is the oxygen of our economies, but\ncross-border trade between transnational corporations\nconstitutes one third of world trade and almost 15 per\ncent of gross global product. No developing country, or\ngroup of developing countries, can match this commercial\nstrength, augmented, of course, by the enormous weight\nof financial flows, which can make or break a country\u2019s\nfinancial structure.\nThe third element in the trinity of mobility in the\ninternational economy is migration. At present 125\nmillion people live outside their countries, but more than\nhalf of them move between developing countries; this is\nnot, therefore, as it has so often been misrepresented, only\na problem for the developed world. It is disturbing,\nhowever, that those who insist on unfettered and truly\nglobal flows of capital and trade also insist on restrictions\nbeing placed on the movement of labour. Economic\narguments are given to justify this, but there are also\nclaims that large migrations disturb the way a society\nthinks of itself as a unified cultural or ethnic entity.\nThe President returned to the Chair.\nIt would be honest to recognize these fears as racist.\nIndia is a model of how these fears can be overcome. On\nthe one hand, over the past decade several million illegal\nimmigrants have come into India. We know to our cost\nthe political, economic and social strain this causes.\nHowever, we do not accept a racial basis for\ndiscriminating against legal migrants. We do not accept\nthat nationhood is based on race, any more than it is\nbased on religion or any other exclusive attribute. The\nwaves of migration that have washed over India have\nmade us a multi-ethnic society; we have been culturally\nenriched, not impoverished. We urge the international\ncommunity not to let the forces of xenophobia rise again.\nSovereignty has never been threatened by fresh blood\nfreely welcomed; it has been threatened by the forces of\nracist intolerance.\n14\n\n\nThis brings me naturally to the other force that now\nthreatens the sovereignty of so many nations. Terrorism is\nthe black plague of our times and it has been made more\ndangerous by the mystique with which the media has\nendowed it. It is argued sometimes that one man\u2019s freedom\nfighter is another man\u2019s terrorist. This is specious logic. In\n1922 Mahatma Gandhi suspended for several years the\nfreedom struggle in India because, in an incident in the\nsmall village of Chauri Chaura, a mob burnt some\npolicemen to death. In Gandhi\u2019s view, the view of the\nultimate freedom-fighter, the means must sanctify the ends.\nWhat ends could possibly justify the barbarism of\ntaking an innocent foreigner in India hostage and beheading\nhim in cold blood? Foreign mercenaries did this to the\nNorwegian Hans Christian Ostro last month. An empire of\nterror is being built up with arms and money sent across\nborders; its foot soldiers are drawn from the bigoted, its\nleadership from ruthless, unprincipled men and, regrettably,\nsome women.\nAt every summit in recent years, whether of the non-\naligned, the Group of Seven, the Organization for Security\nand Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), or the Commonwealth,\nHeads of State and Government have reaffirmed their\nresolve to defeat all forms of terrorism. However, in the\nUnited Nations, where we are all represented, we have been\nunable to speak in such forthright terms. We must do so at\nthis fiftieth anniversary. To appease terrorism now will be\nas dangerous as appeasing xenophobia was in the 1930s and\nultimately as destructive of both peace and democracy,\nbecause terrorism, as I said earlier, is war by other means.\nWhether it tries to violate the territorial integrity of a\ncountry, as in India, in our State of Jammu and Kashmir, or\nto unseat duly constituted Governments, as in Afghanistan,\nthe acts of States sponsoring terrorism are, in fact, acts of\nwar.\nDemocracies, as open societies, are particularly\nvulnerable to terrorism. The United Nations welcomes the\nglobal trend that has made democracy the norm of\ngovernance, but has done nothing to defend democracies\nfrom extremist and other threats. Instead, it comforts itself\nwith the mantras that democracy is development, and\ndemocracies do not wage war. These neatly package all the\nworld\u2019s problems and absolve the United Nations of any\nfurther responsibility: establish democracy everywhere and,\nautomatically, development and peace will follow.\nBoth propositions are historically untrue. Democracies\nthat developed in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries\neither suppressed democratic rights until they became rich,\nor grew rich on the ruthless exploitation of colonies.\nWhen they shed their empires after the Second World\nWar democracy became development in Europe only in\nthe uniquely generous embrace of the Marshall Plan. The\nmyth that democracies do not wage war is destroyed by\nthe history of colonial rule and its wars, leading to the\nconflagration of the First World War. The United Nations\nshould, therefore, take these propositions as objectives,\nnot as givens. Democracy should lead to development;\ndemocracies should be peaceful.\nI want to touch briefly upon two other global issues\nwhich affect our lives \u2014 disarmament and human rights.\nAfter Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Mahatma Gandhi said that\nthe use of the atom bomb for the wholesale destruction of\nmen, women and children was the most diabolical use of\nscience. We were therefore appalled that, instead of\nstepping back from the road to nuclear ruin, the nuclear-\nweapon States sped faster and faster down it. As they\naccelerated, India tried unsuccessfully to put on the\nbrakes. In 1954 we called for an end to nuclear testing. In\n1965 we proposed principles for a non-proliferation\ntreaty. In 1982 we called for a convention to ban the use\nof nuclear weapons and for an end to the production of\nfissile material for nuclear weapons. In 1988 we proposed\nto the United Nations a comprehensive action plan for a\nworld free of nuclear weapons.\nOur goal \u2014 shared, I believe by most of us here \u2014\nis a world from which nuclear weapons have been\neliminated. The nuclear-weapon States claim to share this\ngoal, but their present objective is to retain nuclear\nweapons while making sure others do not get them.\nThe logic of this is hard to understand. It cannot be\nargued that the security of a few countries depends on\ntheir having nuclear weapons and that that of the rest\ndepends on their not having them. What makes the NPT\nsuch a pernicious document is that it legitimizes this\nillogicality, and now that it has been made permanent it\nhas made the possession of nuclear weapons by the\nnuclear-weapon States immutable and has made the goal\nof global nuclear disarmament that much more difficult.\nIt is useful to recall that when India and other\ndeveloping countries proposed the NPT, a global balance\nof responsibilities was envisaged. Those who did not have\nnuclear weapons would not seek to acquire them; those\nwho had them would not try either to refine or develop\nthem or to increase their arsenals. This balance was never\nhonoured, with the result that 25 years after the signing\nof the NPT the world is a much more dangerous place,\n15\n\n\nmade so by the proliferation of nuclear weapons in the\narsenals of the nuclear-weapon States.\nI recall this background because two years ago the\ninternational community at last agreed to negotiate a\ncomprehensive test-ban treaty. We are glad that negotiations\nare in progress, but we also note that nuclear-weapon States\nagreed to a comprehensive test-ban treaty only after\nacquiring the know-how to develop and refine their arsenals\nwithout the need for tests. In our view, the comprehensive\ntest-ban treaty must be an integral step in the process of\nnuclear disarmament. Developing new warheads or refining\nexisting ones after a comprehensive test-ban treaty is in\nplace, using innovative technologies, would be as contrary\nto the spirit of the comprehensive test-ban treaty as the\nNPT is to the spirit of non-proliferation. The comprehensive\ntest-ban treaty must contain a commitment binding on the\ninternational community, especially the nuclear-weapon\nStates, to take further measures within an agreed\ntime-frame towards the creation of a nuclear-weapon-free\nworld.\nThe existence of nuclear weapons poses a threat to\npeace and security. Only global nuclear disarmament can\nguarantee that there will never be a nuclear war. Therefore,\ndespite the unfortunate legitimization of nuclear weapons\nthrough the indefinite extension of the NPT, India will\ncontinue to work with like-minded countries for the early\nelimination of all nuclear weapons. We hope that at this\nsession the Assembly will finalize dates for the fourth\nUnited Nations special session on disarmament, in 1997.\nHuman rights have always been a preoccupation of the\nUnited Nations, but their protection and promotion of such\nrights in each country is the primary responsibility of the\ngovernment. The universality and interdependence of all\nhuman rights are also beyond question. That is precisely\nwhy the United Nations system cannot promote and protect\nhuman rights by a unilateral prioritization of individual\nfreedoms or a proliferation of intrusive mechanisms, or by\ndiverting funds from development activities to human rights\nactivities. The priorities of nations will differ. The United\nNations must balance the promotion of all human rights \u2014\ncivil, cultural, economic, political and social \u2014 preserve\nand propagate the values of every society and promote\ntolerance for diversity and cross-cultural interaction.\nPoliticizing the human-rights agenda and using it to target\ncountries is undesirable.\nThe United Nations will become responsive to these\nglobal issues and effective and efficient only if it also\nbecomes more democratic in its functioning. Developing\ncountries find it hard to identify with the agendas and\npriorities of the United Nations; they feel that it now\nrepresents the privilege of a few rather than the interests\nof the many. If the majority of its Members become\ndisenchanted with it, what role can the United Nations\neffectively play? For the United Nations to be more\neffective, the General Assembly must be given new life\nand breathe that life into the other bodies of the system.\nThe legitimacy and effectiveness of the Security Council\nmust be enhanced. An expansion of both permanent and\nnon-permanent members is a must if the Council is to\nbecome a truly representative body acting on behalf of the\nMembers of the United Nations for the maintenance of\npeace and security.\nThe members of the Movement of Non-Aligned\nCountries have put forward a comprehensive proposal for\nthe reform and restructuring of the Security Council. India\nbelieves that, to truly reflect the expanded membership of\nthe United Nations, developing countries must be included\nas permanent members. New permanent members should\nbe chosen not arbitrarily, but on objective criteria. In the\nLeague of Nations it was argued that one country had a\nspecial right of entry into the Supreme Council. When\nthat was forced through, one or two of the other aspirants\nleft the League, starting its decline. We should not repeat\nthat tragedy. On objective criteria, some countries will\nclearly qualify for permanent membership. We believe\nIndia will be among them.\nThe United Nations has in recent years devoted itself\nalmost exclusively to peace-keeping, which is important,\nbut not the central issue of our times. It is judged,\nnaturally, by its record in these operations. There have\nbeen successes and failures, and both provide the reason\nand the need for introspection. India believes that United\nNations peace-keeping operations must be based on the\nprinciples evolved over the last 50 years. Operations\nguided by these principles have usually done well. Where\nthese have been abandoned, failure has been common.\nOver the past year this truth has gained broad acceptance,\nand the Special Committee on Peace-Keeping Operations\nis now trying to collate these principles. It would be\ndesirable for the General Assembly at this fiftieth session\nto agree on them. India will contribute to this work.\nIndia has consistently supported the peace-keeping\nactivities of the United Nations. Indian troops have\nparticipated in all major peace-keeping operations, ranging\nfrom the Congo to Cambodia, Somalia and Mozambique.\nWe are currently participating in United Nations\npeace-keeping operations in Rwanda, Angola, Haiti,\n16\n\n\nLiberia and Kuwait. We have also offered a brigade of\ntroops to the United Nations stand-by arrangement. India\nwill continue to contribute to United Nations efforts to\nmaintain international peace and security.\nIf the United Nations is to become a leading player on\nthe world scene, it must be given the means needed to do\nthe job we entrust to it. Clearly, setting out on a second 50\nyears with a crippling financial crisis is not the best way to\ndo so. In India we make considerable efforts to pay our\ncontributions promptly and in full. We believe that all\nMembers must pay their assessed contributions in full and\non time. Further, those in arrears must announce a schedule\nfor settlement. There can be no progress in the on-going\nefforts for financial reform unless this is done.\nThe fiftieth session of the General Assembly is a\nhistoric one. It is our responsibility to rejuvenate the United\nNations, give it the tasks we want it to do, and the means\nwith which to do them. We set up the United Nations\nbecause we felt that all of us stood to gain from it. In the\ndark days of the cold war and in the friction between North\nand South, we seem to have lost this vision.\nSince the inception of the United Nations, India has\nbeen committed to the principles and objectives of the\nCharter. In the last five decades we have played an\nimportant role in shaping the United Nations agenda, taking\nthe lead on the crucial issues of decolonization,\ndisarmament, human rights and environment, among others.\nOn this historic occasion we pledge our continuing\ncommitment to the United Nations efforts to chart a new\ncourse for the collective benefit of all humanity. As we\nattempt to do so, I am reminded of Jawaharlal Nehru\u2019s\nspeech to the General Assembly in November 1948, in\nParis. He said:\n\u201cThe objectives are clear; your aim is clear; and yet,\nin looking at that aim, we lose ourselves often, if I\nmay venture to say so, in smaller matters and forget\nthe main objective that we were looking at. Sometimes\nit seems that the objective itself gets a little clouded\u201d.\n(Plenary Verbatim Records, Third Session, General\nAssembly, 154th meeting, p. 16)\nWe must ensure that we set aside smaller matters, that\nwe do not allow the objective to get clouded and that we\nmove forward together in harmony and for the benefit of all\nthe people of the world.\n"

        "file_text": "First of all I should\nlike to welcome the Israeli-Palestinian Interim Agreement\nbeing signed today in Washington by Yasser Arafat and\nYitzhak Rabin. This show of reconciliation should be an\nexample to parties in various conflicts the world over.\nAs the United Nations celebrates its fiftieth\nanniversary, it is time to look to the future. The world is\ndifferent. The end of the cold war, the spread of\ndemocracy, economic globalization, and the explosive\ngrowth of communications have led to far-reaching\nchanges. Distances between people are shorter, national\nboundaries are more open and global interdependence is\nincreasingly apparent.\nSecurity is no longer primarily a military matter.\nSecurity also implies building confidence, justice and\nequal opportunities to achieve lasting and sustainable\npeace, both within countries and through closer\ncooperation between countries and peoples.\nSuch cooperation is needed at the regional and\nglobal levels. Further enlargement of the European Union\nwould be a step towards a pan-European community for\npeace and security. We have a historic opportunity to\ncreate a united Europe, ultimately developing integration\nand cooperation to a point where war becomes\ninconceivable anywhere on our continent. In my vision,\nthe European Union must be a genuine peace project,\nopening itself towards the rest of Europe and the rest of\nthe world.\nAt the same time, major threats to human security\nare global. They must be met by global action. Thus, we\nmust revitalize the United Nations system, and adapt the\nOrganization to the new reality. We need an effective\ninstrument for global cooperation \u2014 for peace and\nsecurity, for sustainable development, for justice and for\na life in dignity for all.\nWe are more convinced than ever that, with 50 years\nof experience, the United Nations is an indispensable tool\n8\n\n\nfor achieving these goals. Fifty years of experience have\nstrengthened our support for the purposes and principles of\nthe United Nations Charter.\nIn pursuit of these goals, United Nations personnel all\nover the world are making major contributions. They merit\nour deep gratitude. We pay special tribute to those who\nhave lost their lives in the service of the world community\nand we extend our sympathy to their families.\nAppalling pictures of human suffering in Somalia,\nRwanda and former Yugoslavia force their way into our\nhomes. We see the United Nations humiliated. The apparent\nshortcomings of the world Organization have sown doubts\nabout the feasibility of multilateral global cooperation. But\nthe problems of the United Nations are in fact those of its\nMember States. They result from a combination of growing\nneeds and expectations, on the one hand, and insufficient\nresources and a lack of political will, on the other.\nSweden\u2019s former Prime Minister, Olof Palme,\ndeveloped this theme in a speech he gave from this rostrum\n10 years ago at the special commemorative session to mark\nthe fortieth anniversary of the United Nations. He said:\n\u201cLet us not make the United Nations the\nscapegoat for problems that reflect our own\nshortcomings. It is not the United Nations that has not\nlived up to us; it is we who have not lived up to the\nideals of the United Nations. It is by improving\nourselves and our policies that we can improve the\nUnited Nations.\u201d (Official Records of the General\nAssembly, Fortieth Session, Plenary Meetings, 43rd\nmeeting, p. 64)\nLet us not curse the dark but instead shed light. Let us\ndraw lessons both from the more difficult United Nations\noperations of recent years, and the more successful ones \u2014\nEl Salvador, Namibia, Mozambique and Cambodia.\nWe have learned that we must take action at an early\nstage, before the catastrophe is a fact, before the genie of\nviolence has escaped from the bottle. The United Nations\nCharter offers plenty of scope for preventive efforts. Action\nmust be undertaken with the consent of the States\nconcerned and their sovereignty must be respected. We\nappeal to Governments: in an internal conflict accept the\nassistance offered by the United Nations or by a regional\norganization.\nPrevention is seldom glamorous. It does not make\nheadlines. Long-term, often tedious, work, with the focus\non the fundamental causes of conflicts, must be backed\nup by deliberate political support.\nMore resources must be earmarked for preventive\nmeasures. This is an investment that is needed if we are\nto avoid new tragedies. The Swedish Government is\ncurrently studying how to improve the United Nations\ncapacity for early-warning and preventive action.\nWe have learned to focus on the security and needs\nof human beings. Our goal must always be human\ncoexistence, irrespective of cultural, religious or ethnic\ndifferences. We must never confine ourselves to drawing\nup maps that reflect the realities of power politics. We\nmust never accept the evil of \u201cethnic cleansing\u201d. If we do,\nwe will ultimately threaten ourselves and our future.\nWe have also learned the importance of the\nprinciples of international law and respect for human\nrights. Humanitarian law must be defended and reinforced\nand war crimes investigated. For example, we must find\nout what happened to those who disappeared in\nSrebrenica and Zepa. By bringing war criminals to trial\nwe will enhance respect for humanitarian law.\nPerpetrators of cruelty, rape and torture must be made to\nunderstand that they cannot act out their perversions with\nimpunity. We support the international criminal Tribunal\nfor the former Yugoslavia, and the Rwanda tribunal.\nWe have learned that a democratic culture provides\ngreater potential for prevention and conflict resolution.\nContinued democratization within individual countries\nmust be encouraged, underpinning a democratic\ninternational community. Sweden is honoured to be the\nhost country of the International Institute for Democracy\nand Electoral Assistance (IDEA), which supports\ndemocratization processes throughout the world. The work\nof IDEA will be a valuable complement to the efforts of\nthe United Nations and non-governmental organizations\nin this area.\nWe have learned that troops must be made available\nfor rapid-reaction operations when non-military measures\nhave failed. As a conflict begins to escalate, every hour\nis precious. The lack of well-trained and well-equipped\npeace-keeping forces, ready to be deployed at short\nnotice, may preclude successful action. Failure to achieve\nthe proper execution of Security Council decisions due to\nlack of troops undermines respect for the United Nations.\nWe welcome the efforts made \u2014 by Canada and\nDenmark for example \u2014 to improve the United Nations\n9\n\n\nstand-by capacity. Sweden will contribute an international\nforce to achieve this objective.\nWe have also learned that the Security Council\nmandates for United Nations peace operations must be\nmore precisely formulated. Clear messages to the parties\nconcerned are necessary. Unclear mandates may lead to\nambiguous perceptions of the United Nations role in a\nconflict.\nWe have learned the need to strengthen the United\nNations ability to command and control peace operations.\nWe welcome the reinforcements of the Secretariat that have\ntaken place. Confusion occurs when troop-contributing\ncountries intervene in the field through direct contacts with\ntheir own contingents. An effective forum for consultations\nwith troop contributors could add to more effective\nmanagement of peace operations. Such a forum should be\nestablished under the Security Council, preferably in\naccordance with Article 29 of the United Nations Charter.\nWe have also learned that coordination of diplomatic,\nhumanitarian and military efforts must be improved. Those\nwho are to do the work in the field \u2014 humanitarian\norganizations and potential troop-contributing countries \u2014\nshould participate at an early stage in discussions on the\nimplementation of mandates for complex United Nations\npeace operations. In this context, I would like to underline\nthe importance of the United Nations Department of\nHumanitarian Affairs.\nFurther, we have learned the need to involve\nnon-governmental organizations in such humanitarian\noperations. We have learned the value of comprehensive\nUnited Nations efforts in which humanitarian assistance,\npeacemaking, peace-keeping and long-term peace-building\nare carried out simultaneously, thus mutually reinforcing\neach other.\nWe have learned that monitoring respect for human\nrights can build confidence, thus allaying fears and\npreventing the use of force.\nWe have learned the vital importance of regional\norganizations for peace and security, as foreseen in Chapter\nVIII of the United Nations Charter. The Organization for\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) is already\nplaying a prominent role in conflict management in Europe.\nIn other parts of the world \u2014 in Africa, Asia and the\nAmericas \u2014 regional and subregional organizations are in\na position to fulfil similar tasks, if necessary with the\nsupport of the United Nations.\nMilitary operations should be based on decisions\ntaken by the United Nations, the OSCE or corresponding\norganizations in other regions. Other regional\narrangements may have a role in organizing and executing\nsuch operations, but the bodies I have just mentioned\nshould assume overall political and strategic\nresponsibility.\nAs we approach the twenty-first century, the fiftieth\nanniversary of the United Nations offers an opportunity to\nestablish a solid basis for improved global cooperation.\nSweden welcomes the reform process now under way in\nthe United Nations. To embrace multilateralism we must\nall rise above short-sighted interests and focus on what is\nbest for global cooperation. We need political leadership\nfrom Governments if we are to make progress.\nAdapting the United Nations to the demands of the\nnew era will involve hard work and difficult negotiations.\nWe must not miss the opportunity provided by this\nanniversary. We need speedy progress. A clear timetable\nand a comprehensive framework are required for\nnecessary change.\nThe Commission on Global Governance, under the\nchairmanship of Sir Shridath Ramphal and the Prime\nMinister of Sweden, Ingvar Carlsson, offers several\nproposals for a stronger, more efficient and more\ndemocratic United Nations. The Commission\u2019s report is\na valuable contribution and a source of inspiration for\nUnited Nations reform.\nIn order to be effective and more representative, the\nSecurity Council requires enlargement. We would\nwelcome Germany and Japan as permanent members. At\nthe same time, the need for geographical balance must be\nmet. We want a more transparent Security Council. We\nwant a composition and a decision-making process which\nprevent the division of the world into spheres of interest.\nThe reform of the Security Council should be reviewed\nafter 15 to 20 years with a view to maintaining its\nlegitimacy and to achieving optimum flexibility.\nWe meet at a time when the financial situation of\nthe United Nations is critical. Last Monday the Nordic\nForeign Ministers, in a joint statement, highlighted the\nthreat to multilateralism caused by the present financial\ncrisis. Nowhere is the crisis in multilateralism seen more\nclearly than in the unwillingness of some Member States\nto pay their assessed contributions to the United Nations\nin full, without conditions and on time. It is unacceptable\nthat so far only one third of the Member States have paid\n10\n\n\ntheir regular-budget contributions for this year. Countries\nconstantly demand more from the Organization, yet some\nof them are not willing to pay their membership fees. They\napparently want others to foot the bill.\nUnilateral withholding of payment cannot be justified.\nUnilateral measures undermine multilateralism, particularly\nwhen taken by the single most important contributor. It is\nhumiliating to see the Secretary-General spend time and\nenergy begging for funds when the world community is\ndemanding that the United Nations concentrate fully on the\ntasks which it was designed for.\nThe United Nations needs revised scales of assessment\nto better reflect Member States\u2019 ability to pay. Together\nwith the United Kingdom, my Government has presented\nconcrete proposals to address this problem.\nIn the longer term, the resource base of the United\nNations must be strengthened. The possibility of additional\nsources of funding needs also to be considered.\nPoverty and social misery are the greatest long-term\nthreats to international peace and security. Some of the\npoorest countries have been caught in vicious circles of\ndebt management. The United Nations must be given a\nstronger and better-defined role in the economic and social\nfields.\nA clearer division of work is called for in development\nassistance. Better coordination, more distinct priorities and\nmore effective management by the United Nations\ndevelopment agencies are required. The governing boards\nof these agencies must be in a better position to play their\nleading role in the implementation of development\nassistance. Furthermore, we need improved forms of\nfinancing, with a higher proportion of assistance levied and\nnegotiated in advance. More long-term planning of\nassistance is required, and the flow of funds must become\nmore predictable.\nSweden continues to be one of the largest voluntary\ncontributors to United Nations economic and social\nactivities. We expect other donor countries to assume their\nresponsibilities to the same degree. As regards total\ndevelopment assistance, it must be possible for most donor\ncountries to reach the United Nations target of 0.7 per cent\nof gross national product.\nThe United Nations is contemporary with the atomic\nbomb. Today we no longer accept living under a nuclear\nthreat. The indefinite extension of the Treaty on the Non-\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) was an important\nstep in the right direction. We urge those few States\nwhich have not yet acceded to the NPT to do so without\nfurther delay, thus making it clear to the world\ncommunity that they renounce the nuclear-weapon option.\nIn May of this year the 180 States which have\nacceded to the NPT confirmed that the ultimate goal is to\nabolish nuclear weapons. International bans on chemical\nand biological weapons are already in place. It should be\npossible, if there is political will, to achieve within 10 to\n15 years an agreement prohibiting nuclear weapons, thus\nmaking this threat to human existence a brief interlude in\nour history.\nA comprehensive test-ban treaty must be achieved in\n1996, banning all nuclear tests for all time. In the\nmeantime, we urge the nuclear-weapon States to refrain\nfrom all nuclear testing in order to ensure that faith in a\nfuture free from fear of a nuclear holocaust can be\nsustained.\nEvery day, every hour, around the world,\nanti-personnel mines indiscriminately maim innocent\ncivilians, many of them children. The ongoing Conference\nin Vienna to review the 1980 weapons Convention should\nresult in a strongly and concretely reinforced regime\nagainst anti-personnel mines. This is a fundamental, moral\nand humanitarian imperative, and it is one step on the\nroad to a total international ban on the use of\nanti-personnel mines. Moreover, substantial resources\nneed to be invested in efficient mine clearance. Sweden\nis ready to contribute expertise and assist in the\ndevelopment of more advanced technology in this field.\nFurthermore, at the Vienna Conference, Sweden has\nproposed an additional protocol on blinding weapons. For\nmore than a decade we have worked for explicit\nprohibition of blinding as a method of warfare. We now\nhope that it will be universally accepted.\nSecurity is a broad concept in today\u2019s world. We\nknow that poverty, social injustice, environmental\ndegradation, rapid population growth and massive refugee\nflows create fear, disruption and conflicts.\nThe major United Nations conferences on\nenvironment and development, human rights, population,\nsocial issues, women and human settlement all involved\ncrucial questions of survival. We welcome the outcome of\nthese conferences, the most recent of which was the\nFourth World Conference on Women, held in Beijing. We\n11\n\n\nneed to address both the root causes and the consequences\nof social injustice. Sustainable social and economic\ndevelopment can be achieved only with the full\nparticipation of women.\nTo Sweden, multilateral cooperation is the most\nimportant instrument for mastering the crucial issues of\nsurvival. For this reason, we will continue to be an active\nMember of the United Nations. For this reason, we believe\nwholeheartedly that multilateralism is not only a matter of\nsolidarity, but, indeed, a question of enlightened self-\ninterest.\nAs an expression of our strong commitment to the\nUnited Nations and to international peace and security,\nSweden is a candidate for a seat on the Security Council in\n1997-98. Our candidacy is a matter of highest priority for\nthe Swedish Government and the Swedish people. It has\nbeen launched with the full support of the other four Nordic\ncountries. As a member of the Council, we will make a\nconstructive contribution to its work. Our dedication will be\nconsistent with our record as a United Nations Member.\nOur support for United Nations ideals and activities is\nconcrete, substantial and unwavering.\n\n"

        "file_text": "It gives me great pleasure to begin my statement by\ncongratulating you, Sir, and on the Government and people\nof your country, Portugal, on your election as President of\nthe fiftieth session of the General Assembly, which\ncoincides with the Golden Jubilee of the United Nations. I\nam confident that, with your skill and expertise in\ndiplomacy and international affairs, you will be able to\nsteer the deliberations of this session most efficiently and\ncompetently.\n\nI should like also to extend deep appreciation to His\nExcellency Mr. Amara Essy, Foreign Minister of C\u00f4te\nd\u2019Ivoire, for successfully conducting the affairs of the forty-\nninth session of the General Assembly.\nAllow me also to pay tribute to the Secretary-General,\nHis Excellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for his sincere,\nincessant and dedicated efforts in the service of the\ninternational community through this Organization.\nOver the past few years, the world order has witnessed\nradical changes in its structure that have entailed\ndevelopments some of which have been positive while\nothers have been negative. On the positive side, wide-\nranging developments have been seen in many States with\nregard to the emergence of democracy, political plurality,\nrespect for human rights and basic freedoms. Such\ndevelopments have been accompanied by a natural\nyearning for the achievement of development in both its\neconomic and social domains, while developments on the\nnegative side have generated a wider cycle of racial,\nnational and religious disputes in some regions of the\nworld that have led to a noticeable retreat from respect\nfor human rights and basic freedoms of the human\nindividual, as well as regression of development both in\nthe economic and social spheres. The primary task of this\nOrganization at this point in time is, perhaps, to focus on\nstrengthening the first tendency and to limit, as much as\npossible, the second.\nIn the face of such a challenge, the task of reforming\nthe United Nations should be met with a view to\nstrengthening its role, making it more effective and\nachieving a qualitative transformation of the work of its\norgans. The Security Council stands in need of\nrestructuring with a view to increasing its membership in\nsuch a way as to reflect balanced representation of\ndeveloped and developing countries. The present\ncomposition of the Council, as it took shape in the wake\nof World War II, no longer reflects the present balance of\npower in its broader sense. Any expansion of the\npermanent membership of the Council should take into\naccount the inclusion of countries from the developing\nworld which have significant political, economic and\ndemographic weight.\nOn the other hand, the veto prerogative of the five\npermanent Member States should be reviewed and certain\nCouncil mechanisms must be substantively reformed as in\nthe case of the mechanism relating to economic sanctions.\nReform of that mechanism should ensure: firstly, limiting\nas much as possible the impact of sanctions on the\ncivilian population of the country on which the sanctions\nare imposed, and secondly, compensating third States that\nare affected by the sanctions in proportion to the damage\nsustained by them.\nIt is also necessary to achieve the universality of the\nUnited Nations in conformity with Article 4, paragraph 1,\nof the Charter, which stipulates that membership in the\nUnited Nations is open to all peace-loving nations which\naccept the obligations contained in the Charter.\nMembership should not be denied on the basis of any\npolitical or other considerations.\nPeace-keeping operations have become the corner-\nstone of the overall work and activities of the United\nNations. While my country, Jordan, prides itself on its\nwide-ranging participation in the operations, it deems it\n9\n\n\nnecessary to continue the process of comprehensively\nreviewing peace-keeping operations in the light of the\nwidening scope and number of such operations, as well as\nthe diverse nature of the tasks undertaken by the peace-\nkeepers and the dangers they are exposed to.\nAt the same time, we emphasize the need to\nstrengthen the efforts made to consolidate the foundations\nand bases of preventive diplomacy which aims to avert the\nbreak-out or escalation of conflicts, in addition to\ndeveloping the machinery for post-conflict peacemaking and\npeace-building.\nAs for the financial crisis which has impacted on\npeace-keeping operations, that crisis not only affects proper\nimplementation and the level of performance, but affects\nalso the participation of many developing countries in those\noperations. Those countries have now become reluctant to\nparticipate because they have not been reimbursed on time.\nIf such a situation persists, it may impact adversely on the\ndesired comprehensive international character of the\nstructure of peace-keeping troops and lead to the exclusion\nof developing countries therefrom, thus restricting\nparticipation to the developed countries that are financially\nable to bear the cost of their participation.\nThe only solution to this problem is for all countries\nto meet their financial obligations on time, particularly\nthose countries that contribute the bulk of the United\nNations budget. Jordan has supported the establishment of\na special fund to help start new operations whenever\nneeded. Part of the capital of this fund should be earmarked\nfor the reimbursement of the developing countries that\nparticipate in such operations. In this regard, we feel that\namendments need to be made to the reimbursement\nmechanism, so that the developing countries contributing\ntroops to peace-keeping operations may be reimbursed on\na priority basis.\nThe end of the East-West bipolarity that plagued the\nworld during the cold war and the disappearance of the\nideological demarcation line that divided the world into two\ncamps should prompt us to seize this historic opportunity\nafforded us by the current transitional period to lay down\nnew foundations for North-South cooperation and to narrow\nthe economic gap between them. The first step in that\ndirection may well be to find substantive and meaningful\nsolutions to the problem of the accumulated debts of the\ndeveloping countries.\nWhile my country welcomed the establishment of the\nWorld Trade Organization and has applied for membership,\nwe call for an in-depth study of the foundations and\ncontrols upon which freedom of trade is built. We also\ncall for a review of the strategies of economic\ndevelopment at the international level, with a view to\nimproving them in conformity with the principles of\nsustainable development and to achieve the cherished goal\nof environmental conservation.\nWhile world peace and stability are among the most\nimportant prerequisites for economic development and of\nthe social development it entails, the development cycle,\nhowever, will not be complete without consolidating the\nunderpinnings of democracy and social justice which lead\nto further development and thereby promote peace and\nstability.\nProceeding from His Majesty King Hussein\u2019s belief\nin the close relationship between peace, democracy and\ndevelopment, Jordan\u2019s earnest participation in the peace\nprocess went hand in hand with the strengthening of\ndemocracy and the consolidation of political plurality in\nJordan. As is known, the peace process which started in\nMadrid four years ago has resulted, inter alia, in the\nconclusion of the Jordanian-Israeli Peace Treaty, which\nrestored to Jordan all its territorial and water rights and\nlaid the foundation for a balanced relationship based on\nmutual and equal interests between Israel and Jordan.\nThis, of course, reflects positively on the peace, stability\nand welfare of the peoples of the region.\nEfforts are now under way to bring about a huge\nqualitative jump in regional economic development in the\nMiddle East. The States of the region are showing great\ninterest in the Amman Economic Summit, which is\nscheduled to be held at the end of this month, October\n1995, within the framework of regional cooperation, as a\nproduct of the multilateral track of the peace process.\nJordan looks forward with optimism to the\nforthcoming Barcelona Conference with the aim of\nestablishing a partnership that joins together the\nMediterranean States. This would contribute to the\nconsolidation of the comprehensive peace process in the\nMiddle East. In this respect, I should like to express deep\ngratitude and appreciation for the role played by Europe,\nJapan and other States involved in the multilateral track\nof the peace process which, together with the United\nStates of America, support the development efforts in\nJordan and of peace-building in the region.\nJordan\u2019s participation in the multilateral track of the\npeace process stems from its conviction that it is\n10\n\n\nnecessary to find effective solutions to the problems that\nhave accumulated over the many years of the Arab-Israeli\nconflict. Foremost among those problems is the question of\nrefugees. In this regard, we commend the outstanding role\nplayed by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for\nPalestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), stress the\nimportance of that role and of the essential services the\nAgency provides for the refugees. Accordingly, my country,\nas host to the largest number of refugees, feels that it is\nnecessary for UNRWA\u2019s work to continue and indeed for\nthe services it provides to be expanded. This, in turn,\nnecessitates the strengthening of UNRWA\u2019s budget, until a\nfinal solution to the refugee problem is reached through\nreturn and compensation, as provided for in the United\nNations resolutions and principles of international law.\nTherefore, while we acknowledge the donor States\u2019\ncontributions, we call upon them, from this rostrum, to\ncontinue to contribute to UNRWA\u2019s budget, so that this\nnoble goal may be achieved.\nOn the other hand, my country supports all efforts to\nadvance the negotiations on other bilateral tracks in order\nto realize the principle of \u201cthe return of land for peace\u201d on\nthe basis of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967), 338\n(1973) and 425 (1978), which constitute the essential terms\nof reference for the peace process.\nOn this occasion, I should like to commend the very\nimportant development on the Palestinian-Israeli track with\nthe conclusion of the Taba Agreement on the expansion of\nself-government in the West Bank and the subsequent\nsigning of that agreement in Washington, D.C., on 28\nSeptember 1995.\nI should like also to take this opportunity to express\nJordan\u2019s full support for the Palestinian National Authority\nin its sincere efforts to achieve the goals of a just and\ndurable peace in the region. We believe that those efforts\nwill lead to the establishment of the independent State of\nPalestine, with the holy city of Al-Quds as its capital, in\nrealization of the hopes and aspirations of the brotherly\nPalestinian people.\nMy delegation did not spare any effort during the 1995\nReview and Extension Conference of the States Parties to\nthe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons\n(NPT) in order for the Conference to produce positive\nresults that would buttress this treaty which is a major\ncornerstone of the international non-proliferation regime,\nand may bring about its universality by the accession\nthereto of all States, including Israel, and the placement of\nits nuclear facilities under the safeguards of the\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency, as well as the\nprovision of adequate security guarantees for non-nuclear-\nweapon States.\nIn addition to the decision to extend the treaty\nindefinitely and to strengthen the review process, the\nConference also adopted a resolution on the Middle East\nwhich called, inter alia, for taking the necessary measures\nto establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the region.\nJordan has participated actively and in good faith in\nall the regional talks concerning arms control and regional\nsecurity within the multilateral track of the peace process.\nWe hope that these talks will achieve their goals, namely,\nthe prevention of the proliferation of weapons of mass\ndestruction and an end to the regional arms race in the\narea of conventional weapons. These efforts have started\nto bear fruit recently with the decision to establish three\nregional security centres in Amman, Doha and Tunis. We\nmust emphasize here that the activation of these centres\ndoes not at all mean acceptance of the status quo with all\nits inherent imbalances, particularly with regard to nuclear\nweapons and other weapons of mass destruction. The\nmain objective that inspired the establishment of those\ncentres was to promote confidence-building amongst the\nStates of the region and to redress the present imbalances\nin order to achieve a more secure and stable Middle East,\nas provided for in the Jordanian-Israeli Peace Treaty.\nAt the international level, we hope that the ongoing\nnegotiations within the Conference on Disarmament in\nGeneva will lead to concluding a comprehensive test-ban\ntreaty before the end of next year. We also hope that the\nConference on Disarmament will begin negotiations\naimed at concluding a treaty on prohibition of the\nproduction of fissile material for nuclear weapons, and\nanother convention to provide non-nuclear-weapon States\nwith security assurances.\nAs for the situation in the Gulf, Jordan reaffirms its\ninterest in the security of that vital region and its earnest\ndesire to establish strong relations of cooperation based\non mutual respect and non-interference in the internal\naffairs of any State. In this regard, Jordan firmly supports\nand upholds the right of the United Arab Emirates to\nsovereignty over the three islands occupied by Iran.\nJordan also supports all efforts aiming at bringing about\nan end to the Iranian occupation so that good neighbourly\nrelations among the States of the region may be\nestablished and consolidated.\n11\n\n\nWhile we appreciate the positive step taken by Iraq in\nrecognizing the sovereignty of Kuwait and its international\nboundaries, we emphasize the need to work for lifting the\nsanctions imposed on the brotherly people of Iraq, with a\nview to putting an end to their suffering, preserving the\nunity and the integrity of the people and the territory of\nIraq and preventing its fragmentation which would endanger\nthe security and safety of the region. Jordan also stresses\nthe need to resolve the issue of the missing and detained\nKuwaitis. We consider this a matter of utmost importance\nbecause of its legal and humanitarian dimensions. We call\nfor Iraq\u2019s full compliance with all relevant Security Council\nresolutions in order to discharge the commitment to\nproperly implement Council resolutions in accordance with\nthe purposes and principles of the Charter of the United\nNations.\nHaving said this, Jordan affirms its solidarity with and\nsympathy for the Iraqi people in their plight and\nunderscores the need to respect their legitimate rights and\naspirations to freedom and democracy and to safeguard\ntheir unity. Jordan states this with a clear conscience, in\nconsonance with the Declaration of Human Rights and the\nCharter of the United Nations.\nJordan has consistently made clear its stand on the\ntragic situation in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\nIt supports the sovereignty and independence of this young\nrepublic and affirms the need to put an end to the Serbian\naggression against it. Jordan also supported the position of\nthe Contact Group established by the Organization of the\nIslamic Conference, which called for the lifting of the arms\nembargo imposed on Bosnia, in conformity with its inherent\nright to self-defence. Now, following the latest positive\ndevelopments, represented by the Declaration of Principles\nagreed upon by the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the\nStates parties to the conflict under the auspices of the\nWestern Contact Group and following the cease-fire\ndecision, Jordan supports the position of the Government of\nBosnia and Herzegovina and commends its flexibility in\ntrying to reach agreement. We attach great importance to\nthe continuation of diplomacy supported by force, which\nhas led to the withdrawal by the Serbs of their heavy\nweapons from the areas surrounding the capital city of\nSarajevo, with all that that entailed in terms of putting an\nend to the shelling of civilians, and of leading to the\naforementioned Declaration of Principles.\nWhile we are to work in earnest for the establishment\nof a safer and more secure world order that would be\nfounded on the values of freedom, tolerance and equality,\nwe must recall the early calls made by Jordan during the\n1980s, when His Royal Highness Crown Prince Hassan\ncalled for the establishment of a new humanitarian world\norder. Those calls were echoed in the proceedings of the\nUnited Nations General Assembly and translated into\nresolutions which called for and encouraged the\nestablishment and consolidation of such a world order.\nPerhaps this new humanitarian world order, because of its\naims which would make the human being the main focus\nof international action in such areas as the eradication of\npoverty and unemployment and the bridging of the gap\nbetween the rich and the poor, on both the individual and\nsocietal levels, may well furnish the solid foundation upon\nwhich we can build the desired new world order whose\nparameters have not crystallized as yet.\nIn the same context, we should encourage interfaith\ndialogue. Such a dialogue would bridge the gaps between\nthe beliefs and concepts of millions of human beings and,\nalso, would make great strides towards advancing human\ndevelopment. If achieved, this would limit religious,\nsectoral and ethnic conflicts, both internally and amongst\nvarious communities at the international level. Perhaps\nthere is a window of opportunity now afforded by the end\nof the cold war and of ideological and political conflicts.\nThis could be a rare and historic opportunity to activate\nan interfaith dialogue, thus adding a new and valuable\nforum to the existing forums of dialogue.\nWe in Jordan have always advocated interfaith\ndialogue as a safe way to combat blind bigotry and\nstereotyping. In order to achieve this, and in the midst of\nthe painful labour that the process of establishing the new\nworld order is undergoing, we must not marginalize one\nbillion Muslims, exclude them or eventually drive them\nto radicalism. Muslims must be partners in the building of\nthis new world order and must be actively involved in its\ndevelopment.\nIslam\u2019s bright image is being distorted, which is a\nmatter of grave concern for us. The pervasive anti-Islamic\nphenomenon, based on unjustified generalizations, aims at\ntarnishing the good name of Muslims and stigmatizing\nthem as terrorists and blind extremists, with a view to\ntotally distorting Islam\u2019s image. This matter must receive\ngreater attention from this international Organization. One\nshould not ignore the fact that Islam is an adaptable\ncivilization, comprising all shades of political opinion and\nall kinds of different religious thought, in addition to a\nvast, multifaceted human experience. Jordan urges the\nMember States of this international Organization to try to\nreach a better understanding of Islam as a religion, as a\n12\n\n\nculture and as a civilization, and to reject the phenomenon\nof antagonism to Islam in all its forms and manifestations.\nIn conclusion, the road to a world of peace, security\nand stability inhabited by democratic societies, a world\nwhose main goal is to attain the highest level of economic\nand social development, is a long and arduous road indeed.\nBut the achievement of these lofty and noble aims of the\nCharter of the United Nations is worthy of our sacrifices,\nand requires more serious and sincere action at the\ninternational level.\n"

        "file_text": "It is my pleasure to\ncongratulate you, Sir, on your election as President of this\nhistoric fiftieth session of the General Assembly. The\nBarbados delegation shares the confidence expressed in\nyour leadership, and offers our full cooperation as you\npreside over the deliberations of this landmark event.\nI also commend your predecessor, His Excellency\nMr. Amara Essy, Minister for Foreign Affairs of C\u00f4te\nd\u2019Ivoire, not only for his outstanding stewardship of the\nAssembly during the last year, but for the vision and\ndirection he has given to the ongoing work designed to\nfashion the United Nations of the twenty-first century.\nLet me also take this opportunity to extend a warm\nwelcome to a fellow member of small island developing\nStates, the Republic of Palau, whose admission to the\nUnited Nations took place in December 1994.\nFifty years ago, the United Nations rose from the\nashes of a devastating world war. Understandably, the\nOrganization was shaped and influenced by the\nexperience of that war and by the coalition of Powers that\nprevailed in 1945. It also grew to reflect the forces\nunderpinning the post-war system of international\nrelations \u2014 a system characterized by that paralysis of\ninternational political will known as the cold war.\nYet, to its credit, the United Nations has fostered\nremarkable progress on such vital issues as\ndecolonization, development and human rights, as well as\non a wide array of international standards, which we have\ncome to take for granted. Through its extensive network\nof organs and specialized agencies, the United Nations\nsystem has made tangible and lasting improvements in the\nlives of men, women and children all over the world.\nBut that old order has come to an end, and we face\nanew a world of tumultuous global change. Barbados sees\nthis world through the eyes of a member of the small\nisland developing States \u2014 joint products of\ndecolonization and the relative geopolitical stability that\nthe United Nations has ensured since our independence.\nAs a group, we have had mixed success in transforming\nthe legacies of colonial tutelage into genuine and\nsustained development for our peoples.\nAs small and fragile members of the global\ncommunity, we are constantly reminded of our own\neconomic and political vulnerability. For us, what happens\noutside our borders, beyond our control, whether man-\nmade or natural, sometimes has more impact on our way\nof life than anything we may do at home. One hurricane\ncan wipe out, in a matter of hours, an entire small island\neconomy. Only three weeks ago, Hurricane Luis wrought\nsuch devastation on a number of our Caribbean\nneighbours, causing major set-backs in their economic\ndevelopment. We extend our sincere sympathy to our\nbrothers and sisters at this time of distress. Barbados is\ncooperating fully with others in helping to restore normal\nlife to these Caribbean Member States.\nFor small island States, how we recover from\ndisasters such as this, and perhaps more important, how\nwe work towards ensuring that we make ourselves less\nvulnerable: these are paramount to our survival. Clearly,\nshort-term assistance and the sympathy of the\ninternational community, while crucial, are not enough.\nSmall size also means that our entire society, not just\nareas of it, is equally vulnerable to dislocations of the\nglobal economic system, including currency and\n6\nGeneral Assembly 22nd plenary meeting\nFiftieth session 13 October 1995\ncommodity price fluctuations, new international trading\narrangements, and the changing fortunes of the major\nindustrial economies.\nNotwithstanding these natural or man-made\nconstraints, many small island States, including my own,\nhave achieved rising per capita incomes and improved\nhuman development indicators but such indices provide\nonly an approximate measure of the present, based on the\npast. They do not, and cannot, measure our vulnerability,\nthe resilience or lack of resilience of our economies and\nentire societies in the face of natural disasters and rapid\nglobal economic change.\nIt is in this broad context that Barbados has given the\nhighest importance to the Global Conference on the\nSustainable Development of Small Island Developing\nStates, which my country had the honour to host last year.\nThe Programme of Action, adopted by consensus,\nunderscores the role which the stewardship of small island\nStates plays in the preservation of the global commons. We\nurge international action to step up the support pledged in\nthe Declaration of Barbados and the Programme of Action.\nMy delegation therefore calls for the steady implementation\nof the commitments and recommendations contained in\nGeneral Assembly resolution 49/122 of 19 December 1994.\nAs a small vulnerable State, Barbados views some\nareas of the global political scene with deep concern.\nFollowing the end of the cold war, the people of the world\nyearn for an era of peace and economic prosperity \u2014 but\npeace, so far, has proved elusive. The outbreak of violence\nand ethnic strife has reached unspeakable levels of human\nsuffering, taxing the capacity of the United Nations support\nsystem to the limit.\nIn the case of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the large\nmajority of Member States looks on in agony and\nhelplessness at a crisis which has called into question the\nvery credibility of the Organization and the integrity of its\npeace-keeping function. We recall words of the late Sir\nWinston Churchill today: But Bosnia has not been the\nUnited Nations \u201cfinest hour\u201d. But let us not forget that the\nUnited Nations is no more, no less, than the collective will\nof the Governments it serves.\nFor vulnerable small States, United Nations protection\nis critical. Developing countries, particularly those least able\nto afford it, bring no influence to bear on major peace-\nkeeping decisions, yet must pay their assessed share of\npeace-keeping costs, diverting scarce resources from the\ndevelopment effort. Barbados welcomes the encouraging\nsigns which have recently emerged from the peace\nprocess between the parties of former Yugoslavia, and\nhopes that an end could be soon brought to the strife and\nbloodshed in this war-torn region.\nBarbados shares the anguish of the people in the\nstrife-torn countries of Africa, in particular, Rwanda,\nBurundi, Liberia, and in similar areas of conflict around\nthe world, and hopes for early progress towards lasting\npeace in those areas. At the same time, we welcome the\npositive developments in the peace process in Angola and\nthat between Israel and Palestine. We hope that a peaceful\nand durable settlement to the problems elsewhere in the\nMiddle East may soon be reached.\nIn Haiti, where democracy is beginning to take root,\nBarbados is proud to have participated in the multilateral\ninitiatives and mission which resulted in the return of\nHaiti\u2019s democratically elected government. The return of\nPresident Aristide underscores this continuing success and\nthis continuing process. Haiti is a prime example of a\nvulnerable small island State receiving, at long last, the\nsupport and protection needed from its neighbours and the\ninternational community. Much still needs to be done if\nHaiti\u2019s recovery and development, long neglected in the\nface of political turmoil, are to be assured.\nWe urge the international community to stay the\ncourse with Haiti. We know that progress will be uneven,\nbut we applaud the Government\u2019s commitment to the\ndemocratic process. Haiti is a Caribbean country with\nwhich Barbados shares strong bonds of history and\nculture. The Haitian people can be assured of our support\nin their struggle to nurture its fledgling democracy, and\nimprove the economic and social conditions of its people.\nBarbados applauded the decision of the United\nNations last May when it extended indefinitely, the Treaty\non the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). But\nnow the spirit of this agreement has become a casualty of\nrecent events. Barbados deeply regrets the decision by\nsome States to resume nuclear testing, which runs counter\nto the spirit of the NPT and the commitment by nuclear\nweapons States to exercise the utmost restraint, pending\nentry into force of a comprehensive nuclear-test-ban\ntreaty. As a small island developing State and a non-\nnuclear-weapon State, Barbados has a vested interest in\nthe non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and the\ndisarmament of existing nuclear stockpiles.\nBarbados therefore supports the moratorium on the\ntesting of nuclear weapons in place, and urges nuclear\n7\nGeneral Assembly 22nd plenary meeting\nFiftieth session 13 October 1995\nPowers to heed the call by the international community to\nrefrain from any activity that violates the spirit of the\nTreaty. As an island State whose people depend on the sea\nfor a large part of their livelihood, Barbados is gravely\nconcerned about the potential danger to its fragile marine\necosystems. We are therefore implacably opposed to the\ntransshipment of nuclear materials and hazardous wastes\nthrough the Caribbean basin.\nInternational terrorism, transnational crime, drug\ntrafficking and money-laundering, are matters of grave\nglobal concern, particularly to a small country like\nBarbados. The destabilizing threat of related cartels to the\ndemocratic order in small States is particularly serious.\nWhile Barbados has been put on full alert, we recognize\nour limited capacity to effectively police our own borders.\nWe deeply appreciate the bilateral assistance in this area,\nand will continue to work closely with other regional\npartners and related international bodies to combat this\nglobal cancer.\nThe year 1995 is a special one for the United Nations.\nIt is a year for solemn reflection on the mission and\nachievements of the Organization, and for new directions to\nmeet the challenges ahead.\nThe world we face is characterized by increasing\nglobalization of production, liberalization of trade, and an\nexplosion of information technology. Increasingly, States\nfind themselves restricted in their capacity to control or\ninfluence the flow of international capital, other than by\nproviding hospitable conditions to attract it. Moreover, there\nis an emerging consensus on the reordering of the role of\nthe State in economic development, in the direct creation of\nwealth and in the complementary nature of the public and\nprivate sectors.\nA significant feature of this changed world is the\nemergence of non-governmental organizations as a major\ninfluence in domestic and international public policy.\nBarbados welcomes this participatory power of civil\nsociety, which has deepened and enriched the debate on\ninternational issues and helped shape the global agenda to\nbetter reflect the popular will.\nThe framers of the Charter demonstrated this foresight\nin the Preamble, not with the words \u201cWe the\nGovernments\u201d, but with the words \u201cWe the peoples\u201d. And\nas we approach the new millennium, the slow but sure\ntriumph of peoples over institutions is becoming\nincreasingly evident. An appreciation and analysis of these\nglobal changes is critical to a reformed United Nations if it\nis to meet the challenge of the twenty-first century while\nremaining faithful to the original ideals of the Charter.\nBut good governance still is, and always will be, the\nbest instrument for the expression of the popular will.\nGovernment is, after all, when exercised responsibly and\naccountably, a profoundly moral vocation. And just as\nGovernments cannot, domestically, retreat from that moral\nfunction of fostering peace and upholding justice and\nliberty, neither can they do so internationally.\nBarbados supports the reform process. A reformed\nUnited Nations system should be cost-effective and\nefficient. The process should be orderly and informed by\nsolid analytical work, with decisions based on rigorous\nevaluation of the mandates and performance of affected\ninstitutions and their relevance to the changing demands\nof developing countries. In this connection, Barbados\nbelieves that the abolition of the United Nations Industrial\nDevelopment Organization and the United Nations\nConference on Trade and Development would be\npremature. Restructuring of these institutions may well be\nwarranted, but due process should first be served.\nReform of the United Nations must not mean an\nabandonment of international cooperation and a retreat\ninto isolationism by the strong and powerful among us.\nThe growing interdependence on which the welfare of all\nour people depends makes isolationism an irresponsible\nfantasy. The problems that beset us \u2014 the degradation of\nthe environment, the plight of the poor and the\ndispossessed, narco-trafficking and money-laundering,\nhuman rights abuses, and, especially, ensuring the equal\nrights of women and children \u2014 can be solved only\nthrough more intense international cooperation.\nLet us by all means streamline this Organization and\nits allied agencies. Let us make them more effective in\nthe delivery of programmes of direct benefit to our\npeoples. But let not calls for better management and\nincreased efficiency cloud any lack of resolve by the\nmore fortunate among us to discharge their international\nresponsibilities, or hamper the Organization\u2019s capacity to\nfulfil the mandates entrusted to it by Member States.\nThe United Nations has before it a daunting task. It\nmust enlarge the Security Council to better reflect the\nrealities of membership since 1965 as well as the\ngeopolitical changes in the global environment. In\nparticular, it must redesign its peace-keeping machinery\nto cope with the changing nature of conflicts in today\u2019s\nworld \u2014 namely, conflicts mainly within nations, not\n8\nGeneral Assembly 22nd plenary meeting\nFiftieth session 13 October 1995\nbetween nations. Barbados supports the structure for such\nreform contained in \u201cAn Agenda for Peace\u201d, and salutes the\nSecretary-General for his distinctive leadership on this\ncrucial issue.\nIn the economic and social fields, the United Nations\nmust intensify its support to the development effort of\ndeveloping countries. Barbados supports the framework for\nan \u201cAgenda for Development\u201d, prepared by the Secretary-\nGeneral. The United Nations now has before it a\ncomprehensive development agenda created by the\ncontinuum of United Nations Conferences in New York, in\nRio, in Vienna, in Barbados, in Cairo, in Copenhagen and\nin Beijing. Barbados reaffirms the central role of women in\ndevelopment, which is acknowledged in the respective\nProgrammes of Action of all these Conferences. Women\nbring their unique perspective to the development\nprocess \u2014 and without it, the whole is impoverished.\nImplementation of these expanded programmes is\ncrucial. They must be carried out with commitment and\ndispatch. But even with expected improvements in\nefficiency, these critical tasks cannot be accomplished\nunless the United Nations system is placed on a sound\nfinancial footing. This is why we urge early action to solve\nthe acute financial crisis of the Organization.\nAll States, big and small, powerful and weak, learn\nthat power must be exercised responsibly. The big and\nstrong have a special role to play in a reformed United\nNations, particularly in the maintenance of peace. It is\nunrealistic not to recognize this. But the small and weak\nalso have their own vital contribution to make. Both must\nact responsibly and within both the letter and the spirit of\ninternational law.\nBarbados is confident that Member States can rise to\nthis collective challenge. The machinery is already in\nplace \u2014 in particular, the Open-ended High-level Working\nGroup on the strengthening of the United Nations system.\nBarbados will participate fully in this historic session.\nIt will work to revitalize and strengthen this unique\ninstitution, where humanity\u2019s greatest hope for peace,\nsecurity, development and social justice resides. Together,\nwe can forge a renewed United Nations capable of fulfilling\nthe promise enshrined in \u201cWe the peoples\u201d.\n"

        "file_text": "I wish first of all to\ncongratulate the President of the General Assembly upon\nhis election to his high office in the year of the fiftieth\nanniversary of the United Nations. May I, at the same time,\nextend my sincere thanks to the outgoing President, His\nExcellency Mr. Amara Essy, for his excellent work.\nFifty years ago, my countryman Trygve Lie became\nSecretary-General of an Organization with a very modest\nstructure but with a \u201csacred mandate\u201d, as he said in his\nacceptance speech,\n\u201cto build a firm foundation for the peace of the\nworld\u201d. (Official Records of the General Assembly,\nFirst Session, Plenary Meetings, 22nd meeting, p. 326)\nSince then, even greater demands have been made on the\nUnited Nations in terms of leadership, ideas, manpower and\nfinances. On the occasion of its fiftieth anniversary, we\nmust empower the United Nations to work with renewed\nvigour and effectiveness in promoting peace, human rights,\nsustainable development, equality, justice and understanding\namong peoples.\nRather than being poised to take on new challenges,\nhowever, the United Nations finds itself in a financial crisis\nof major proportions. The Secretary-General has recently\npointed out that the Organization is, in a technical sense,\ninsolvent \u2014 yes, bankrupt. Only prompt payment by a\nsmall number of Member States has enabled it to continue\nto operate. The situation is more serious than ever before\nbecause of the unprecedented amounts involved and the fact\nthat one major contributor\u2019s payment is being withheld and\nis expected to be unilaterally reduced in the years ahead.\nThis desperate financial situation reflects the\ninadequate priority given to the United Nations by many of\nits Members, which is in clear violation of their obligations.\nIt may sound harsh, but, coming from a country which\nconsistently pays $100 per capita to the United Nations\nsystem, I have difficulties in explaining to my own\nelectorate that other rich countries are not even willing to\nprovide one tenth of that level.\nAt the same time, I realize that the United Nations\nassessment system should be reformed without delay.\nMoreover, experience has shown that the United Nations\nitself needs to be reformed, restructured and modernized.\nNorway wholeheartedly supports the reform process\nlaunched to strengthen the United Nations system and\nmake it more representative and effective. This should\ninclude expansion of the membership of the Security\nCouncil and increased transparency of its methods of\nwork.\nTo meet the twin challenges of peace and sustainable\ndevelopment, the United Nations and its Member States\nshould proceed along five parallel paths.\nFirst, we must help increase local and regional\ncapacity to handle conflict situations. For instance,\nAfrican countries have signalled via the Organization of\nAfrican Unity (OAU) that they are prepared to take on a\nlarger share of the responsibility for solving their own\nproblems. In response, Norway will cooperate with\npartners in Southern Africa in building up standby\nreserves of qualified personnel for peace operations under\nUnited Nations or OAU auspices.\nSecondly, more nations must be willing to contribute\nto the United Nations peace-keeping forces. Traditional\ntroop contributors do not have the capacity to provide all\nthe personnel that will be needed in future peace-keeping\nmissions aimed at solving disputes, protecting local\npopulations and providing humanitarian assistance. Both\nthe United Nations and the traditional troop-contributing\ncountries must assist potential troop contributors with\ncompetence-building measures, just as the Nordic\ncountries are now assisting the Baltic States.\nThirdly, the rapid-reaction and standby capability of\nthe United Nations must be improved. Norway is\nprepared to join in efforts to develop new, much-needed\ninstruments to deal quickly and effectively with crisis\nsituations. The rapid-reaction capability must also include\nhumanitarian assistance. The United Nations should\ncontinue to play a central role in coordinating\nhumanitarian relief efforts.\nNorway has given high priority to measures that\nenable us to respond expeditiously to requests for\nassistance. We have established an effective preparedness\n10\n\n\nsystem for emergency assistance that covers both personnel\nand mat\u00e9riel. Emergency equipment can be airborne within\n24 hours. Experienced personnel can be in the field within\n72 hours. In Rwanda, a fully equipped field hospital,\naccompanied by the necessary personnel, was recently\ndelivered at short notice to the United Nations, in\naccordance with these procedures. With a view to\nimproving the United Nations response to support\nrequirements, Norway has offered to provide facilities for\na United Nations medical depot where medical equipment\nand supplies for peace-keeping and humanitarian operations\ncan be stored and maintained.\nFourthly, we must put even greater emphasis on\nconflict-prevention measures. The international community\nmust be present in unstable areas and must provide\neconomic incentives, mediation expertise and human rights\nmonitors. Conflict prevention is the most effective way of\nusing limited resources. Norway will continue to shoulder\nits share of the responsibility \u2014 for instance, in Guatemala,\nwhere we are actively involved in the peace process,\ntogether with the other members of the Group of Friends.\nNorway has established a special human-resource bank for\nhuman rights and democracy, which is able, at short notice,\nto offer experts to assist countries and peoples in their\nefforts to build democratic societies.\nThe international community must be prepared to act\ndecisively when atrocities are committed. Serious crimes\nshould be prosecuted by an international criminal tribunal.\nThe establishment of the ad hoc Tribunals in the former\nYugoslavia and Rwanda has provided momentum for the\nefforts to establish a permanent court. The tribunal\u2019s role\nshould be limited to cases where national jurisdiction is\nunavailable or ineffective.\nFifthly, on the occasion of its fiftieth anniversary, we\ncall on the United Nations to take a decisive lead in\npromoting sustainable development and eradicating poverty.\nEfforts to improve global security must address the issues\nof economic growth, development and poverty, while\nensuring that the use of natural resources is kept within the\ncarrying capacity of the Earth. The United Nations must\nbecome a driving force for sustainable development.\nThe United Nations is the only forum with a mandate\nto tackle the truly global problems affecting the\nenvironment and the sustainable management of natural\nresources. Let me offer some brief examples. The\nConference on Straddling Fish Stocks provided an\ninvaluable contribution to the management of fishery\nresources. We are also pleased that, just a few days ago, the\nUnited Nations Panel on Forests was able to take the first\nsteps to protect, preserve and manage the world\u2019s forests\nin a sustainable manner.\nI would like to stress the need for a concerted effort\nwithin the United Nations system to ensure that the\nresults from the major conferences in Cairo, Copenhagen\nand Beijing on, respectively, population, social\ndevelopment and women actually become translated into\nlaw and realities, locally, nationally and at the\ninternational level.\nWith a growing world population, we have witnessed\nthe spread of the gravest insult to human dignity \u2014\npoverty. Our inability to eradicate poverty haunts our\ncommon conscience. As long as the gap between rich and\npoor, whether between States or within States, continues\nto widen, we cannot claim to be on the right track. If we\nare to alleviate poverty, both donors and recipients must\nmake more resources available for social welfare\nactivities. At least 20 per cent of development assistance\nbudgets and national budgets of recipient countries should\nbe allocated to the social sector.\nThe conflict in the former Yugoslavia is far from\nbeing solved, even though the prospects for a negotiated\nsolution now appear much better than they did until\nrecently. Norway welcomes the agreement on basic\nprinciples which resulted from the Geneva meeting on\n8 September. The United States of America deserves\npraise for its persistent efforts in this regard. It is vitally\nimportant that the members of the international\ncommunity, in particular the contact group countries,\ncontinue their common approach to the solution of the\ncrisis. In this context, the United Nations and the\nEuropean Union mediators can make a valuable\ncontribution.\nThe success of the mediation efforts depends entirely\non the readiness of the parties to compromise. We\nstrongly urge all the parties to show flexibility and\nrestraint, and to refrain from attempting to obtain further\nadvantages on the battlefield. Special attention must be\ngiven to displaced persons, who, whenever possible, must\nbe allowed to repossess their homes.\nThe time has come to start reflecting on the\nreconstruction of that war-devastated region. This will\nrequire a sustained international effort. The United\nNations system together with the European Union and\nothers must play a leadership role in coordinating\nprograms in various fields, such as economic\n11\n\n\nreconstruction, humanitarian aid and assistance to refugees,\ndemocracy-building and human rights. Local leaders have\na heavy responsibility to prevent a new arms race, human\nrights abuses and the renewal of tensions in the area.\nNorway will continue to support the process of building\npeace and prosperity in the former Yugoslavia.\nI call on the General Assembly to lend its full and\nundivided support to the peace process in the Middle East.\nThe new interim agreement is a significant and necessary\nfollow-up to the Oslo agreement. Today we salute once\nmore the Israeli and the Palestinian leaders for their\ncourage and determination. As Chairman of the Ad Hoc\nLiaison Committee to coordinate donor activities, I strongly\nurge the donors to continue to support \u2014 for some donors,\nto increase their support of \u2014 the Middle East peace\nprocess by providing economic assistance to the Palestinian\npeople. Our common interest in peace in the Middle East\nis the best argument for heavy economic support to the\nPalestinian areas.\nNuclear testing is a threat to our search for common\nsecurity and to the environment, and should be banned. We\ndeeply deplore the Chinese and French tests, which we fear\nmay complicate the ongoing negotiations in Geneva on a\ncomprehensive test ban treaty. We would once again urge\nall nuclear-weapon States to refrain from further nuclear\ntesting during the negotiations and until the treaty enters\ninto force.\nLand-mines are among the most insidious weapons in\ncommon use. They cause indiscriminate and widespread\nsuffering and continue to spread terror for years or even\ndecades after hostilities have ended. We call for a total ban\non the production, stockpiling, trade and use of\nanti-personnel land-mines. In the absence of such a ban, we\nurge all countries to adhere to the United Nations 1980\ninhumane-weapons Convention. No strengthening of the\nland-mine Protocol will be effective unless adherence to it\nbecomes universal.\nFinally, let us seize the opportunity offered by the\nfiftieth anniversary of the United Nations to renew our\nsupport for the United Nations and its aims. Each and every\none of us must help to ensure that the United Nations\nbecomes what we need and what future generations have\nthe right to expect: an effective tool to harness our strength\nand unite us in maintaining peace, promoting social\nprogress and protecting human dignity.\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me at the outset to extend to you,\nMr. President, our warmest and sincerest congratulations\non your election to the presidency of the fiftieth session\nof the United Nations General Assembly. Through you, I\nshould also like to pay tribute to the relations between my\ncountry and Portugal and to note our shared expectations\nfor the Mediterranean region.\nI would be remiss were I to fail to extend my\nwarmest congratulations to your predecessor, Mr. Amara\nEssy, President of the previous session of the Assembly,\nfor the new impetus he gave to the Organization through\nthe different working groups over which he presided. I\nshould also like to pay a special tribute to the Secretary-\nGeneral, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for the wisdom and\ndetermination with which he is carrying out his noble\nmission.\nThis session of the Assembly crowns a half century\nof the world Organization\u2019s efforts to preserve world\npeace. Today, the Organization is called upon to pave the\nway to a new era, one that we hope will be marked by\nsolidarity in facing the tasks before us and the\nresponsibility we all bear.\nSince the end of the cold war the world has rid itself\nof the heavy burden of the fear of another world war, a\nwar that would have led to untold catastrophes and\ntragedies. This development, albeit new, already seems to\nbe part of the past given the speed of subsequent\ndevelopments.\nEven if East-West confrontation and the bipolarity of\npast decades have disappeared, new challenges have\nemerged over the past few years. Hotbeds of tension and\ninstability have proliferated, in many regions of the world,\nand have taken root in the soil of ethnic and political\nhostilities that often take the form of armed confrontations\nwithin the borders of any one State. Such hostilities are\noften fuelled by extremes of hardship and by deteriorating\neconomic and social conditions.\nSome negative phenomena, such as terrorism,\nextremism and the illicit traffic in arms and drugs have\nalso grown in a manner that is cause for concern as they\nundermine the stability of States.\nInherent in these new challenges are factors of\ndisintegration and collapse that throw a long shadow over\ninternational peace and security and impose new threats\nthat the international community should hasten to contain\n6\n\n\nwith decisive action which should not focus on their\noutward manifestations alone, but deal with their true\nunderlying causes, namely economic underdevelopment and\nsocial backwardness.\nIn fact, these new situations which now face the world\nin the post-cold-war era make us realize that it is\nimpossible to ensure lasting international peace and security\nby military means alone. Respect for law and international\nlegality are prerequisites as are creation of conditions that\nwould promote the economic and social development in an\ninterdependent world. These, we believe, are the\nunderpinnings upon which we should build a new world\norder.\nDue to the developments the international community\nhas been witnessing over the past few years, the United\nNations Organization has come to shoulder new\nresponsibilities towards international peace and security.\nThese responsibilities are manifest in the unprecedented\nincrease in the number of peace-keeping operations, as well\nas in new activities such as the supervision of elections and\nthe rebuilding of State structures and the economic\ninfrastructures of States. In addition, many of these\nactivities have to do with the settlement of disputes within\ncertain States.\nWhile the United Nations has to provide assistance to\ncountries that are ravaged by civil wars and internal\nconflicts, we, as members of the international community,\nare all called upon to mobilize our efforts and to strengthen\nour solidarity within the context of the efforts aimed at the\nmaintenance of peace and to identify and resolve the\nunderlying causes of such disputes. Proceeding from our\nbelief in the fundamental principles set forth in the\nSecretary-General\u2019s \u201cAgenda for Peace\u201d, particularly those\nrelating to preventive diplomacy, peacemaking and peace\nbuilding, Tunisia, during its presidency of the Organization\nof African Unity (OAU), called for stronger cooperation\nbetween the United Nations and the Organization of African\nUnity in the area of conflict prevention and the speedy\nresolution of disputes at minimum cost.\nHere we should remind of the role of the central organ\nof the OAU\u2019s mechanism for conflict prevention,\nmanagement and resolution, which has been given new\nimpetus by President Ben Ali and other African leaders in\norder to make it an effective tool in the prevention and\nsettlement of disputes in Africa.\nIn this context, Tunisia has hosted several meetings of\nthis central body, which have resulted in the adoption of\nmany important resolutions that have made it possible to\naddress certain situations which, otherwise, would have\ncalled for intervention by the international community to\nkeep peace or to prevent the outbreak of new conflicts.\nWe believe that such efforts by this central organ of the\nOAU warrant additional support. The results of such\nefforts could be improved if the appropriate financial and\nlogistical means were made available to the organ and if\ncoordination were ensured between the United Nations\nand the OAU in this regard. We do hope that the recent\ntendency to give this matter some thought will lead to the\nidentification of the ways and means whereby action by\nthe international community in this direction will develop\nfurther. On this occasion, I should like, on behalf of\nPresident Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, to pay tribute to the\ninternational community for its valuable support to\nTunisia during its presidency of the OAU, and to express\nparticular appreciation to the Secretary-General of the\nUnited Nations, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, as well as to\nall those who have provided financial and logistical\nassistance to peace-keeping operations in Africa and to\nthe States that have provided financial support to the fund\ncreated within the OAU mechanism for the settlement,\nmanagement and prevention of disputes.\nWhile some hotbeds of tension persist, some have\nbeen eliminated, and we do see a reduction in the danger\nof major conflagrations in the light of the significant\nprogress made towards disarmament and the strengthening\nof the underpinnings of international security through the\nefforts of the United Nations, as well as an improvement\nin the climate of trust and understanding that we now feel\nin international relations.\nIn the area of weapons of mass destruction, Tunisia\nwelcomed the signing of the Convention on chemical\nweapons. We believe it is a step that will lead to the\nelimination of an entire class of such weapons. This calls\nfor further substantive steps to rid the world gradually of\nthe threat of nuclear weapons, particularly in the wake of\nthe indefinite extension of the Treaty on the Non-\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT).\nAs for the Middle East, many important steps have\nbeen taken towards genuine dialogue between the parties\nconcerned.\nTunisia, which has been an active participant in the\npeace process since it began in Madrid, welcomes the\nagreement achieved yesterday between the Palestine\nLiberation Organization and Israel, and hopes that it will\nbe followed by other concrete steps towards ensuring the\n7\n\n\nachievement of the legitimate national rights of the\nPalestinian people.\nWe must adopt the same approach in order to give\nnew impetus to the negotiations between Syria and Israel on\nthe one hand, and between Lebanon and Israel on the other\nin order to ensure the withdrawal from the occupied\nterritories in the Golan and in southern Lebanon and the\nachievement of a just, comprehensive and lasting peace in\nthe region.\nIt goes without saying that the principles upon which\nthe peace process was based, namely Security Council\nresolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973), as well as General\nAssembly resolutions concerning the withdrawal from all\nArab and Palestinian lands, including Holy Al-Quds, must\nbe fully implemented. Al-Quds remains, for the Palestinian\nand the whole Islamic nation, a cornerstone for the\nsettlement of the dispute.\nWe believe that it is time for the Israeli Government\nto demonstrate realism and political courage by rising above\nthe very narrow view of security and relations with the\nneighbouring Arab States in order to allow the peoples of\nthe region to live in harmony in increasing security and\nstability.\nIn the Arab Maghreb, Tunisia, which has always\nbelieved in international legality, calls, in the light of\ninitiatives taken by Libya, for a rapid resolution of the\nLockerbie affair in order to lift the embargo imposed on\nour Libyan brethren. The negative effects of that embargo\nhave begun seriously to affect stability and development in\nall the countries of the region.\nAs for Iraq, Tunisia, which is satisfied with the\nprogress that is being made in implementing United Nations\nresolutions, calls for lifting the embargo imposed on Iraq in\norder to mitigate the suffering of the Iraqi people. At the\nsame time, Tunisia stresses the need to fully respect the\nsovereignty and territorial integrity of Kuwait and all the\ncountries of the region. By the same token, we hope that\nagreement on the basis of the norms of international law\nand the behests of good-neighbourliness and respect for the\nterritorial integrity of other States, will be reached in the\ndispute between the United Arab Emirates and the Islamic\nRepublic of Iran on Abu Moussa and the Greater and\nLesser Tumb Islands.\nI should now like to address the crisis in Bosnia,\nwhich, in our view, constitutes an aberration that embodies\na serious defiance to all humanity. This war puts us face to\nface with ideologies which, we thought, had become\nthings of the past, but which have now resurfaced in the\nguise of \u201cethnic cleansing\u201d. The international community\nhas the right to make use of the means provided by the\nUnited Nations Charter to force those who flout all\ncivilized values and trample the most basic of human\nrights to accept the independence of Bosnia and\nHerzegovina and to respect its territorial integrity.\nTunisia, which has always participated in the United\nNations efforts to maintain international peace and\nsecurity, is well-aware of the limitations of the narrow\nview that reduces the concept of security to the military\ndimension alone. Proceeding from this, Tunisia has\nsupported from the outset the international community\u2019s\ninitiative embodied in \u201cAn Agenda for Development\u201d. We\nbelieve that \u201cAn Agenda for Development\u201d, along with\n\u201cAn Agenda for Peace\u201d, help to enrich our thinking in the\nfield of multilateral cooperation at a time when countries\nof the world are becoming increasingly open to market\neconomics which, together with the consolidation of\ninterdependence, have come to be the principal economic\ncharacteristics of world economy at the end of the 20th\ncentury.\nIn view of the irreversible globalization of economic\nconcepts, the United Nations is called upon to play a\nfundamental role in formulating and implementing\ndevelopment policies. Such an important role should work\nin favour of the international community\u2019s efforts to\nrestructure the United Nations and to increase its\neffectiveness. Tunisia, which has taken part in these\nefforts, believes that any restructuring process should help\npromote the universal nature of the Organization and\nstrengthen its democratic posture, so that it may make a\nbetter contribution in the area of development. We believe\nthat the process of restructuring must go hand-in-hand\nwith a wider cooperation between the United Nations and\nthe Bretton Woods institutions in order to improve their\ninput in development.\nIn this context, joint initiatives could be taken to\nensure a better division of labour between the United\nNations and the Bretton Woods institutions with a view\nto increasing their effectiveness in the economic and\nsocial fields and within the context of development in\ngeneral. More specifically, as far as cooperation between\nthe United Nations and other parties is concerned,\nPresident Zine El Abidine Ben Ali has been calling, since\n1989, from this very rostrum, for a development\npartnership between industrialized and developing\ncountries. This initiative is a project for a new\n8\n\n\ninternational cooperation based on a dynamic view of the\nsecurity of all States. Through this proposal, Tunisia aims\nat creating a new system based on economic, political,\nsocial and democratic stability, because we believe that they\nare the very pillars of security. This Tunisian initiative is\nbased on awareness of the organic link between\ndevelopment, democracy and stability. This overall view\ntakes into account the aspirations of individuals and peoples\nwho look forward to freedom and economic, social and\ncultural well-being.\nThe Tunisian view of security and development is\nanchored in the belief that extreme importance must be\nattached to the cultural and humanitarian aspects of\ninternational relations, particularly at the regional level.\nProceeding from this belief, Tunisia has sought to\nconsolidate its cultural and political ties with all the\ncountries of the Arab Maghreb and of the Mediterranean.\nAt the Maghreb level, in cooperation with the member\nStates of the Arab Maghreb Union, Tunisia has worked to\ncreate an economic zone in the region. This has taken\nconcrete shape in the Tunisian declaration of 1994 relating\nto the creation of a free zone as a first step in putting in\nplace a Maghreb development strategy.\nTunisia\u2019s involvement in international economic affairs\nand its attempts to develop its interests with the region on\nthe northern shores of the Mediterranean are among its\nbasic foreign-policy tenets, enshrined in the partnership\nagreement with the European Union. This agreement is\nbased on joint development and aims at creating a free zone\nthat will allow Tunisia further activity within the economies\nof its European partners. It goes hand in hand with a policy\nof dialogue between the countries of the Mediterranean. On\nthe 28th and 29th of July 1995, Tunisia hosted a\npreparatory meeting for the Mediterranean region to ensure\nthe success of the meeting scheduled for next November in\nBarcelona. The Preliminary results of the Mediterranean\ndialogue give cause for optimism as they reflect a common\ndesire to safeguard the Mediterranean region from\ninternational political convulsions and economic fluctuations\nwhile ensuring its harmonious development.\nThe United Nations is called upon today to develop a\nnew concept based on the need to achieve security,\ndevelopment and democracy. These are the very principles\nin which Tunisia believes and for which we strive,\ndomestically as well as internationally. In the field of\ndevelopment, the Tunisian strategy is based on the human\nelement within a comprehensive vision that embraces all\nsegments of society, and aims at building a balanced and\nunitary society.\nIn this context, I wish to stress in particular the\nimportance that Tunisia attaches to the empowerment of\nwomen, the protection of the family and to highlight the\nfact that many achievements have been made in this\ncontext, particularly with regard to the adoption of\nstructural, legal and administrative measures to promote\nthe role of women and the family, economically and\nsocially and to enhance the role of women in our\ndevelopment efforts. At the same time, Tunisia has\nacceded to many international conventions on the equality\nof women and men, the latest of which has been the\nCopenhagen agreement which relate to the elimination of\nall forms of discrimination against women. Based on its\nrich experience in this context, Tunisia has played a very\nactive role in the March 1995 World Summit for Social\nDevelopment in Copenhagen and in the recent Fourth\nWorld Conference on Women in Beijing, whose positive\nresults we commend.\nIn this new era, Tunisia will continue to support the\nefforts of the United Nations both in the areas of\nmaintenance of peace and of development. We shall\ncontinue to participate in defining the features of the new\nworld order and to call for upholding the law and the\nnorms of international legality. It behoves the States of\nthe world to share a joint vision of the world of\ntomorrow, so that it may be characterized by more\nsolidarity and justice. We hope that the celebration of the\nfiftieth anniversary of the United Nations will reaffirm the\ncommitment of the international community to an\nOrganization without which we can never hope to build\nsuch a new world order.\n"

        "file_text": "I have the honour to convey\nto the President of the General Assembly, and through\nhim to all representatives, the warm greetings and good\nwishes of His Majesty Jigme Singye Wangchuck, King of\nBhutan, for the success of the fiftieth session of the\nGeneral Assembly. I offer Mr. Freitas do Amaral the\nfelicitations of my delegation on his election as President\nof this historic session. His election to this high office is\na tribute to him personally and to his country, Portugal,\nwhich has always played an active role in the United\nNations. My delegation wishes also to pay a tribute to His\nExcellency Mr. Amara Essy of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire for his\nskilful stewardship at the forty-ninth session. His\npresidency has enhanced the esteem of the international\ncommunity for him and for C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire.\nWe also take this opportunity to welcome the\nRepublic of Palau into our family of nations. Its\nparticipation will greatly enrich our Organization.\nThis session is of especial significance for all of us\nas we celebrate the passing of 50 years since the birth of\nthe United Nations. It is heartening to note that the grand\nand lofty vision which inspired our founding fathers still\ncontinues to inspire and guide us. More than ever before,\nwe see today the evidence of the collective human will to\nunite against threats and obstacles to the survival and\ncontinued progress of mankind. The participation of no\nfewer than 150 Heads of State or Government in the\nspecial commemorative meeting later this month is\nglowing testimony to our abiding faith in this world body.\nThe Intergovernmental High-level Meeting on the\nMid-term Global Review of the Implementation of the\nProgramme of Action for the Least Developed Countries\nfor the 1990s was held in New York recently. The least\ndeveloped countries as a group have not been able to\nmeet many of the objectives of the Programme of Action\nand their overall socio-economic situation has continued\nto deteriorate. Some of the factors responsible for this\ndeterioration are, internally, civil strife and natural\n25\n\n\ndisasters with their resulting consequences and, externally,\nthe debt problem, low levels of export and an inadequate\nflow of external finance. These countries have, however,\ncontinued to implement wide-ranging reforms and in some\ncountries these efforts have shown positive results. A\nnumber of development partners have provided increased\nsupport to the least-developed countries, for which we are\ntruly grateful. We believe that the least developed countries\nhave the primary responsibility for their own development,\nand with the support of the international community they\nhope to alleviate the desperate plight of their peoples. The\nLeast Developed Countries Division of the United Nations\nConference on Trade and Development deserves praise for\nthe excellent documentation it provided for the recent\nintergovernmental meeting on the least developed countries.\nEarlier this year, we supported the indefinite extension\nof the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons\n(NPT). This was followed shortly thereafter by several\nnuclear tests \u2014 in what we believe is a contravention of\nthe spirit of the 1995 Review and Extension Conference of\nthe NPT. We are increasingly concerned about the fate of\nthe comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty and our ultimate\ngoal of eliminating all nuclear and other weapons of mass\ndestruction.\nThe maintenance of global peace and security still\nremains the most pressing challenge for the United Nations.\nIt has become the yardstick by which the United Nations is\ntoday being judged. Increasingly, concerns are expressed as\nto whether the United Nations is able to carry out this task.\nThe tragic situations in Somalia, Bosnia and Herzegovina\nand Rwanda demonstrate the inability of the international\ncommunity to put an end to the immeasurable suffering of\nthe innocent victims. Such cases raise an important issue.\nThe number of peace-keeping missions has grown\nexponentially. The past year has seen 18 peace-keeping\nmissions involving 78,000 peace-keepers. The good news\nis that the United Nations has a vital, ever-growing role to\nplay in keeping the peace and allowing combatants a\nbreathing period in which to come to the negotiating table.\nThe down side is that the peace-keeping missions are a\nconsiderable drain on the finances of the United Nations.\nExpenditures for peace-keeping operation are now more\nthan three times the entire budget for development. Surely\ndevelopment merits high priority as well.\nThe most serious obstacles to sustainable global\ndevelopment are the fast pace of population growth and the\nincreasing degradation of the environment. The situation is\nworst in the countries that are least able to bear the burden\nand where there is already an appalling disequilibrium\nbetween people and resources. The more advanced\ncountries may delay their confrontation with the\nenvironmental crisis but unless these issues are addressed\ntoday, we may see the collapse of vital resources and\nclimatic changes in many parts of the world and new\nsecurity threats resulting from poverty and chaos. This is\naggravated by the fact that the most significant\ndevelopments in the world economy are taking place\noutside the United Nations, and our Organization is being\nincreasingly marginalized on economic, financial and\ntrade issues.\nIt is important that the world continue to keep\ninvesting in people, especially women and children, and\nthat it meet their basic needs in education, health and\nsocial welfare. The historic United Nations conferences of\nthis decade on children, environment, human rights,\npopulation, social development and women embody the\nirreversible commitment of the international community\nto chart a new course for the future. My country is firmly\ncommitted to the goals set by these conferences.\nI wish to acknowledge the special contribution of the\nUnited Nations to the development of my country. The\nUnited Nations has been actively involved in every sphere\nof development in Bhutan, and has been responsible for\nhelping us set out on the right path of sustainable\ndevelopment. Every effort has been made on our part to\nensure that all assistance received has been properly\nutilized and meaningful results achieved. I express the\nprofound gratitude of the people of Bhutan to the donor\ncommunity, which supports the United Nations\ndevelopment activities. We have particularly benefited\nfrom the activities of the United Nations Development\nProgramme, the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund, the\nWorld Food Programme, the United Nations Population\nFund, the United Nations Capital Development Fund, the\nInternational Fund for Agricultural Development, the\nUnited Nations Volunteer Programme, the Food and\nAgriculture Organization of the United Nations, the World\nHealth Organization, the International Monetary Fund and\nthe World Bank. They have contributed much to the\nwelfare of our people. We are also grateful to our\nbilateral donors, particularly India, Switzerland, Japan,\nDenmark, the Netherlands, Austria, Norway, Kuwait,\nGermany, Australia, Thailand, and the United Kingdom\nfor their cooperation and support.\nThe Working Group on the Strengthening of the\nUnited Nations System will once again look at\nstreamlining the Organization. Reform of several aspects\nof the United Nations system is vital, especially as we\n26\n\n\nconfront the many challenges of the twenty-first century.\nThere must be better distribution of power within the\nUnited Nations. The crippling financial situation caused by\nlarge arrears by Member States must be overcome. It is\nalso time to examine the new mechanisms for meeting the\nfinancial requirements of the United Nations. My delegation\nfeels that a proper study should be made and reported to\nthe Assembly at an early date. In our view, the innovative\nidea of a small levy on international air travel proposed by\nthe Foreign Minister of Australia, Senator Gareth Evans, is\nsound and practical.\nWe are of the considered view that the Security\nCouncil must be expanded to give greater representation to\ndeveloping countries in order to uphold the principles of\nequity and justice. Many least-developed countries like\nBhutan feel they are being increasingly marginalized by the\nnew agendas and priorities of the United Nations. In our\nview, the United Nations must represent the interests of all\ncountries equally, and not only those of a privileged few.\nWe therefore support the expansion of the Security Council\nto facilitate more equitable representation of developing\ncountries and deserving candidates that have emerged since\nthe United Nations was established 50 years ago. As a\nfellow South Asian nation, and as a member of the South\nAsian Association for Regional Cooperation, of which India\nis by far the largest member, we strongly support India\u2019s\ninclusion in the permanent-member category of the Security\nCouncil. India\u2019s candidature merits serious consideration on\nthe grounds of equitable geographic representation, the\nlarge size and enormous potential of the Indian economy\nand the fact that one sixth of mankind lives in India.\nBefore I conclude, I should like to join preceding\nspeakers in paying tribute to the many organizations and\nindividuals that serve with unfailing dedication and\ncommitment to further the principles and purposes of the\nUnited Nations. I should like to pay a special tribute to\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the Secretary-General of the\nUnited Nations; to the late James Grant, former Executive\nDirector of the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF),\nwho did so much for the world\u2019s children; to the many\nBlue Helmets who have sacrificed their lives so that others\nmay live in peace and security; and to the host of United\nNations personnel and volunteers who have selflessly\ndedicated their lives to the service of others, sometimes\nserving under the most trying conditions.\n\n"

        "file_text": "It gives me special pleasure to\ncongratulate Mr. Diogo Frietas do Amaral of Portugal on\nhis election as President of the General Assembly at its\nfiftieth session. I take this opportunity to extend to him my\nbest wishes for success in the deliberations of this\nimportant gathering, and I assure him of the full\ncollaboration of the delegation of Albania.\nI also congratulate Mr. do Amaral\u2019s predecessor, Mr.\nAmara Essy, on the excellent way he conducted the work\nof the last session of the General Assembly.\nTo the Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali,\nI wish to express my highest regard for his unfailing\nendeavours to provide the Organization with ever more\neffective leadership.\nMy warmest greetings go to the Republic of Palau, the\nnewest State Member of the United Nations.\nSince March 1992 \u2014 the time of the final break with\nthe Communist regime \u2014 Albania has made tremendous\nprogress in its democratic processes. The building up and\nstrengthening of political pluralism, the rule of law,\nrespect for human rights in general and for those of\nminorities in particular, as well as the transition from a\ncentralized to a market economy, constitute the main\ndirections in which Albanian society is moving. The\ncountry is sustainably engaged in speedy economic reform\nsupported by a whole new set of laws, and the results of\nintensive transformation are very tangible.\nCertainly reform is not painless. In this regard, the\nGovernment is paying special and particular attention to\nimprovement of the living conditions of some social\ngroups that are more vulnerable to economic reform. I\nwish, on behalf of the Albanian Government, to avail\nmyself of the occasion to express gratitude to the donor\ncountries, the European Member States, the United States\nand the countries of the Organization of the Islamic\nConference, as well as to international agencies such as\nthe United Nations Development Programme, the World\nBank and the International Monetary Fund, for the\nvaluable assistance provided to Albania.\nIn its efforts to eliminate the consequences of fatal\nlong isolation, Albania is convincingly engaged in an\nopen policy and has firmly abided by one of the major\nobjectives that the Government set out in its\nprogramme \u2014 the integration of the country into Europe,\nwhich implies the building of a Western-style society,\nadherence to its institutions and active participation in\nEuropean life.\nOur growing cooperation with the European Union,\nwhich we hope will in due course lead to the opening of\nnegotiations on and the conclusion of the Europe\nagreement, is a process that enjoys the backing of all\npolitical parties and all strata of the population. With a\nview to achieving full integration, we attach special\nimportance to cooperation with the Euro-Atlantic\nstructures, primarily the North Atlantic Treaty\nOrganization (NATO). Albania is the first country of the\nregion to have formally requested membership of NATO,\nand it is engaged in active cooperation within the\nPartnership for Peace. In this spirit of close cooperation,\nAlbania has offered action facilities to NATO, and it will\ncontinue to do so in the future, convinced that this will\nbenefit peace and security in the Balkans.\nTo this end, and desirous of demonstrating in a\npractical way its commitment to peace and security,\nAlbania has set up its first Albanian military unit to\nparticipate in the peace-keeping and humanitarian\n23\n\n\noperations of the United Nations and will soon put this at\nthe disposal of the Organization.\nThe tragedy of the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina,\nwhich is suffering the consequences of Belgrade\u2019s ambition\nto create a \u201cGreater Serbia\u201d \u2014 inspired by the philosophy\nof national chauvinism, the policy of \u201cethnic cleansing\u201d and\nthe forceful changing of borders \u2014 lies at the centre of the\npresent-day Balkan crisis, concentrated in the former\nYugoslavia. Identification of the causes and culprits of the\ncrisis in Bosnia and Herzegovina now makes it easier for\nthe Balkan States and the international community at large\nto make realistic assessments of the situation in all the\nterritories of the former Yugoslavia and to seek adequate\napproaches for solution.\nIt is a fact that the international community and its\nmain actors have been present at all stages in dealing with\nthe conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Unfortunately,\nhowever, it has to be admitted that, despite the action taken\nso far, they have not always been consistent. For that\nreason, efficiency has for a long time left much to be\ndesired.\nThe many resolutions of the United Nations and of the\nInternational Conference on the Former Yugoslavia, the\nactivities of the Contact Group, the projects offered and the\nplans suggested have not yet yielded the desired results.\nNevertheless, we think that the United Nations peace force\ndeserves special praise for the humanitarian assistance it\nhas provided to the innocent civilian population. A special\ntribute should be paid to the soldiers, officers, diplomats\nand journalists who lost their lives in the line of duty.\nFollowing recent developments, it appears that the\nsituation in the crisis areas is more balanced, politically and\nmilitarily, and that it offers real possibilities for solution.\nHowever, it is still very complex, and there is still the risk\nof a spill-over of the conflict to other areas \u2014 a widely\nheld view. In the face of this situation, we appreciate the\nfact that, on the initiative of the United States of America,\nthe international community is reviewing its stand on this\nconflict, including insistence on thorough implementation of\nSecurity Council resolutions adopted pursuant to Chapter\nVII of the United Nations Charter. These provide for\ncontinuation of the sanctions against the Bosnian Serbs and\nSerbia and Montenegro, as well as the stepping up of\ndiplomatic activity, backed by the use of NATO military\nintervention when necessary.\nThe Republic of Albania is deeply concerned about the\ngrave situation in Kosova. The Serbian military and police\nregime that has been installed in Kosova, with the\nelimination of the autonomy that this federal unit of the\nformer Federal Socialist Republic of Yugoslavia enjoyed,\nis continuing widespread terror against the Albanian\npopulation. The brutality of the Serbian police is evident\nevery day and in every part of Kosova. The apartheid\npolicy and practices pursued by the Serbs against the\nAlbanians have led to the compulsory exodus of hundreds\nof thousands of Albanians, mainly youngsters, to different\ncountries of the world. Part of this systematic terror are\nthe endless killings, the ransacking and the plotted\npolitical trials against the Albanians of Kosova.\nAs if this extremely tense and eruptive situation\nwere not enough, the Belgrade authorities are now\nsending to Kosova, as colonists, the Serb refugees from\nCroatia and Bosnia. This grave provocation, under the\nguise of humanism for Serb refugees, is in reality part of\nthe old plan of the Belgrade authorities to carry out\n\u201cethnic cleansing\u201d in Kosova, which is inhabited to the\nextent of 95 per cent by Albanians, and forcefully change\nits ethnic-demographic composition.\nThe consequences of what Belgrade is doing to\nattain the \u201cGreater Serbia\u201d ambition are already common\nknowledge and have been internationally witnessed in\nBosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia. We appeal to the\ninternational community and to concerned humanitarian\norganizations not to be duped by the intentions of\nBelgrade and not to assist it to settle the Serb refugees in\nKosova \u2014 an activity that falls short of being a simple\nhumanitarian action.\nWe also call upon the international community not\nto ignore the extremely important issue of Kosova. The\nBelgrade authorities have clearly challenged General\nAssembly resolution 49/204, the resolutions of the\nCommission on Human Rights in Geneva and the\ndecisions of the Organization for Security and\nCooperation in Europe on Kosova. If Serbia is not put\nunder international pressure to refrain from its policy of\nconfrontation in Kosova, it will not be long before\nanother tragedy with unpredictable consequences\nexplodes. The Kosova Albanian leaders have miraculously\nmanaged to avoid it so far through their peaceful\nresistance, but the question immediately arises: How long\nwill they be able to do so?\nThe Republic of Albania holds that the United\nNations, the major Powers and NATO should anticipate\nand take adequate measures in order to prevent a conflict\nin Kosova: demilitarize its territory; protect human and\n24\n\n\nnational rights of Albanians there; put an end to ethnic\ncleansing and Serb colonization; reopen the institutions of\nKosova; create a climate of dialogue between Albanians\nand Serbs in Kosova, and between Pristina and Belgrade;\nopen and continue dialogue in the presence of a third party.\nAlbania is of the view, and insists, that the Kosova\nissue be included in the agenda for discussion and solution\nof the problem of the former Yugoslavia. In the meantime,\nthe lifting of sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro\nshould be subject to the strict condition that there should be\na complete and lasting solution of the Kosova issue. There\nis more than one problem to tackle and solve in Kosova;\nthey all need to be addressed properly and not overlooked.\nWhen we see today the progress in solving the\nconstitutional status of the entities in Bosnia, which we\nhope will be just and equitable and will satisfy all parties,\nwe have reason to hope and believe that the international\ncommunity will proceed in the right direction to solve the\nquestion of Kosova as well. The world is right in thinking\nthat, in so doing, we are respecting one of the fundamental\nprinciples of the Charter, especially the right of peoples to\nself-determination. The application of double standards will\nundoubtedly generate future conflicts.\nIn order for the Balkans to be an area of peace,\nstability and prosperity, it is necessary to bring war to an\nend, to bring the perpetrators of the Bosnian tragedy before\nthe Court and to punish them, to demilitarize over-armed\nStates and areas, to reconstruct what was damaged by war,\nto settle the Kosova issue and to thaw the already frozen\nbilateral relations. Internal democratization of all States, the\ncreation of the democratic space where Albanians live in\nthe Balkans, as repeatedly stated by the President of the\nRepublic, Sali Berisha, constitute a most positive response\nto any international initiative for peace and stability in the\nBalkans. Furthermore, transition to broad programmes of\ninter-Balkan and Euro-Balkan cooperation is also an\nabsolute requirement for development and for full\nintegration of the Balkans into developed and civilized\nEurope.\nIn the coming December, Albania will celebrate the\nfortieth anniversary of its membership in the United\nNations. Over all these years the Republic of Albania has\ndemonstrated its commitment to the purposes and principles\nof the Charter. While the region is living through a\nprofound and complex crisis, Albania is testifying that it is\na factor of peace and stability. It has never provoked\nconflicts or tensions between States and has repeatedly\nasserted its firm stand against the forceful alteration of\ninternationally recognized borders. This is demonstrated\nfirst in its policy towards its neighbours.\nI am glad to declare that bilateral relations with\nGreece have improved following a period of tension last\nyear. Dialogue and good will, which Albania has always\nfavoured, have prevailed, and today the two countries are\ntaking concrete steps in the direction of extending,\ndeepening and speeding up cooperation in fields of\nmutual benefit.\nIt is worth mentioning here that we are glad to see\nthat the international community, in general, recognize the\ngreat improvement in the rights of the Greek minority in\nAlbania in the last three years. The Albanian\nGovernment has consistently demonstrated its willingness\nto ensure full respect for human rights and fundamental\nfreedom for all the citizens, including members of the\nGreek minority, and its commitment to do so. We have\nalways emphasized that the Greek minority in Albania\nconstitutes a bridge of friendship and we are glad that this\nis not our view alone. There is no political reason\nwhatsoever that could hinder this since the realization of\nrights stems from our political will and from the very\nessence of Albanian society.\nAs to the right of education in one\u2019s mother tongue,\nin addition to the measures already taken by the\nGovernment to apply international standards and fulfil its\ninternational commitments, such as the Copenhagen\nDeclaration and Programme of Action, the national\nlegislation on education, in particular the law on private\nschools \u2014 which entered into force a few months ago \u2014\nhas resolved this question.\nAlbania maintains good relations with the former\nYugoslav Republic of Macedonia and supports the full\nintegration of this Republic into international institutions.\nHowever, we encourage it to take concrete steps to\nimprove the situation of the Albanians there and to ensure\nfull respect for their human and national rights, including\nthe right to education in their mother tongue. This is all\nthe more so because of our conviction that equality\nbetween citizens of any nationality leads to the integration\nof that country and that integration is to the benefit of all\nthe citizens of the former Yugoslav Republic of\nMacedonia and of stability in the region.\nAlbania does not hold a prejudiced view in its\nrelations with Serbia and Montenegro, either. However, it\nshould be said that their improvement is dependent on the\nrenunciation of violence against and suppression of the\n25\n\n\nAlbanians in Kosova. Though Italy is across the sea, my\ncountry has considered, and considers, Italy a neighbouring\ncountry of great importance for bilateral relations and for\nthe developments in the Balkans and the Mediterranean.\nOur relations with this country are built on an ancient\ntradition and are characterized by very positive\ndevelopments in all fields.\nAlbania attaches great importance to the work with a\nview to the reform of the Security Council. Albania is the\nonly country from the Eastern European Group, except the\nnewly created countries in the region, that has never served\nin the Security Council in its course of 40 years\u2019\nmembership in the Organization. We believe that the\nMember States, by giving Albania the first chance to sit in\nthe Security Council, will offer encouragement and support\nto the good will of the small States for active participation\nin multilateral cooperation in the service of international\npeace and security, and will show that it will not take long\nfor our fruitful discussions on the reform of the Security\nCouncil to be implemented. I would like to assure you that\nthe election of Albania to the Security Council will be a\ncontribution to peace and security in the troubled region of\nthe Balkans as well.\nIn conclusion, I would like to express Albania\u2019s\nsupport for the United Nations, its desire to strengthen the\nOrganization and its role in safeguarding international peace\nand promoting and supporting democracy, development and\nwell-being.\n"

        "file_text": "I bring with me the warmest\ngreetings and good wishes of His Majesty King Mswati III,\nHer Majesty the Indlovukazi, the Government and the\npeople of the Kingdom of Swaziland, to all our friends and\nfellow Members of the United Nations.\nSwaziland extends its congratulations to Mr. Freitas do\nAmaral on his election to the presidency of this historic\nfiftieth session of the General Assembly, and commends his\npredecessor, His Excellency Mr. Amara Essy, for his\nleadership and direction as President of the General\nAssembly at its forty-ninth session. The Kingdom of\nSwaziland would also like to take this opportunity to\nexpress its deep appreciation to our distinguished Secretary-\nGeneral, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for his relentless\nefforts in directing the affairs of our vast Organization, and\nwhose skill and diplomacy have contributed so much to our\nachievements over the past twelve months.\nEach year since 1945 the General Assembly has\nprovided us with a chance to reflect on our achievements,\nas well as on our failures over the preceding twelve\nmonths; the goals we have met and others which, for a\nvariety reasons, have been missed. This process of self-\nassessment is an essential element of any organization;\nand for the United Nations there is a special significance\nto our deliberations this year as we mark fifty years of its\nexistence.\nPerhaps the most important development of the last\nfive decades has been the emergence of a new world\norder, in both political and economic terms, brought about\nby the transformation of many parts of the world through\nnew-found freedom and independence from both colonial\ndomination and oppressive ideologies.\nHopes continue to be raised that this new world\norder would result in a strengthened commitment to\nachieve common development objectives on a truly global\nbasis. Never before have the nations of the world been\ngiven this opportunity to work together, with collective\nresponsibility, towards achieving real global security \u2014\nsocial, economic and political \u2014 for all our peoples.\nThere have undoubtedly been many encouraging\nsigns that we are taking our responsibilities towards one\nanother seriously, but we remain a long way behind in\nrealizing the ambitions of those ideals on which the\nUnited Nations was established.\n\n\nThe foundations of our Organization were built on the\nruins of a world torn apart by war. \\\"Never again\\\" was the\ncry of all mankind, and our structures and principles were\nfocused on the equal development of all nations, and on the\nprevention of the occurrences of such destruction ever\nagain.\nAnd yet, with all the commitment and promises, it\nseems that only very recently have we seen any progress\ntowards global peace in this century. Certainly, the end of\nthe cold war did not bring the world-wide stability\nenvisaged by all of us at that time. Events such as the Gulf\nWar, the tragedy in the former Yugoslavia and the genocide\nin Rwanda have shaken our belief that human beings could\never live peacefully, side by side, with one another.\nRecent developments have shown, however, that there\nis a new mood abroad \u2014 one that is based on a spirit of\nreconciliation and a desire for peace that gives us all reason\nfor hope that real progress towards lasting global stability\nmay be possible after all. Swaziland recognizes the role of\nthe United Nations in bringing about this new climate of\npromise, and our Organization deserves great credit in its\ncontinuing commitment to this noble aim.\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland joins the rest of the\nresponsible world in welcoming the recent signing of the\nagreement with a view to the extension of autonomy to the\nPalestinian people in the West Bank. This latest agreement\nconfirms the commitment of the Israeli and Palestinian\npeoples to a lasting settlement of the problem that has hung\nlike a dark cloud over the Middle East for so long. We\ncongratulate all who have been involved in the process\nleading to the agreement, but most of all, we applaud the\nspirit of reconciliation of the leaders and both peoples and\ntheir commitment to peace. We appeal to all in the Middle\nEast region to embrace the same spirit so that future\ngenerations will never have to experience the instability and\nuncertainty of the past.\nThere are encouraging signs, too, evident in recent\ndevelopments with regard to the situation in Bosnia and\nHerzegovina. Last month the world witnessed the first steps\ntowards the prospect of a settlement in the Balkans. The\nKingdom of Swaziland prays that the momentum will\ncontinue until a solution may be found that is acceptable to\nall in that troubled area. Swaziland welcomes the recent\ninitiative leading to the signing of an agreement in\nWashington and agrees that the first priority, now, must be\nto ensure a lasting cease-fire and to create an atmosphere\nin which the people who have suffered so much in recent\nyears may at last begin to bring some order into their\nbroken lives.\nThe past twelve months have seen major and\nwelcome progress in a number of troubled areas on our\nown continent of Africa, while other regrettable situations\nhave surfaced to threaten the stability of the continent as\na whole.\nClearly, the commitment of all African countries to\nthe establishment by the Organization of African Unity of\na mechanism for the prevention, management and\nresolution of conflicts is central to Africa\u2019s efforts in\naccepting responsibility for its own problems. Swaziland\nstrongly supports this initiative and joins its brother\nAfrican States in calling for the support of the United\nNations in this important enterprise.\nSwaziland has been especially heartened by the\ndevelopments towards a lasting settlement in Angola,\nengineered to a large degree by the efforts of our United\nNations Special Envoy. The signing of the Lusaka peace\naccord has brought real hope that the two sides to the\nconflict are now committed to peace and that the Angolan\npeople will now be given the chance to make a new start\nin a country that has the potential to play such a vital role\nin the development of the subregion as a whole. The\nKingdom of Swaziland stands ready to support and to\nencourage the development of Angola and its people.\nSwaziland commends the efforts made by the\ninternational community and the neighbouring countries\nof Rwanda and Burundi in bringing about an atmosphere\nof relative calm to the two countries after a time of great\nsuffering and hardship.\nOf particular note has been the role of those\ncountries playing host to so many refugees from the\nconflicts in the area. Swaziland knows full well \u2014 and\nwith recent firsthand experience \u2014 the problems\nassociated with such a task. It is an obligation to one\u2019s\nfellow human beings to offer refuge in times of conflict,\nbut however willing a country may be to welcome\nrefugees from conflict and strife, the strain on the host\ncountry\u2019s resources may be too great for them to cope\nwith alone, and outside help is absolutely critical. The\nrole of the United Nations High Commissioner for\nRefugees is essential in this regard, and we commend the\nwork of that Office wherever it is needed.\nIn the course of the 50 years of its operation, our\nOrganization has learnt many valuable lessons, including\n2\n\n\nthe realization that we must adapt to changing\ncircumstances and to the varying needs of all our Members.\nThe challenges facing us have grown and spread into areas\non a scale perhaps not imagined by our founders \u2014\nchallenges such as international security and peace-keeping,\nthe promotion of justice and democracy, and the fight\nagainst economic and social inequalities among the\nMembers of our family of nations.\nAnd as the roles of the United Nations expand and\ndevelop, so should our capacity to undertake them. Reform\nand adaptability are the key imperatives for us as we\napproach the new millennium, and in this spirit, we\nwelcome the new agendas for peace and development\nwhich have been initiated under the guidance of our\nSecretary-General.\nThese initiatives, which are at the heart of what we are\ntrying to achieve here, create particular obligations for all\nour Members and for the Organization itself: we all have a\nresponsibility to demonstrate real commitment towards the\nprinciples we all have accepted. Thus, our calls for\nextended United Nations peace-keeping must be supported\nby full and timely contributions to the relevant budget by\nall countries, and by a commitment to global peace, which\nhas clearly been lacking in many areas of the world.\nThis commitment embraces the issue that has posed\npossibly the greatest threat to global security in the second\nhalf of this century: that of containing the spread of nuclear\nweapons and, ultimately, achieving a nuclear-weapon-free\nworld.\nIn this context, Swaziland enthusiastically supported,\nearlier this year, the application to extend indefinitely the\nTreaty on nuclear non-proliferation, and we look forward to\na successful conclusion to the negotiations on a\ncomprehensive test-ban treaty.\nSwaziland is confident that the Secretariat of the\nUnited Nations, under the wise and able leadership of His\nExcellency the Secretary-General, is all too aware of its\nown responsibilities to adapt and reform elements of the\nOrganization\u2019s structures, in line with the wishes of its\nMembers and with regard to achieving efficiency,\nadaptability and full representation of the global community\nin order to meet its requirements.\nCertainly, we all must feel represented in the key\ndecision-making bodies of the Organization, and Swaziland\ntherefore supports the proposals aimed, in the first place, at\nmaking the Security Council a more credible body by\nintroducing wider representation among the permanent\nmembers.\nThe principle of full representation within the United\nNations is an extension of the founding principle of\nuniversality \u2014 to ensure, as much as possible, that all\npeoples of the world feel that they are represented in the\none truly global Organization with the resources and\ninfluence to effect developments for the good of mankind.\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland continues to have a\nstrong and happy partnership with a country whose people\nbelieve that they are denied the opportunity to make their\ncontribution to the rest of the world through the agencies\nof our Organization, and who maintain that they are\nexcluded from the processes of international\ndecision-making, to which they have a right to contribute.\nThe Republic of China and its 21 million people have\nshown themselves to be committed to global peace and\ndevelopment, and ready to share with the rest of the\nworld their knowledge, expertise and resources.\nIn the fiftieth year of the existence of United\nNations, and as we celebrate the historic signing of our\nCharter, it is surely fitting that we live up to our\nfounders\u2019 belief that the credibility of our Organization is\ndependent on the principle that all mankind is represented\nhere. The declaration by a people that it believes itself to\nbe denied representation is surely incentive enough for us\nto at least consider the case, whatever the outcome. The\nRepublic of China, as one of the original signatories,\nbelieves that its appeal deserves to be heard. Swaziland\ntherefore encourages the growing support for the\nestablishment of an ad hoc committee to look into the\nissue of the renewal of membership of the United Nations\nfor the Republic of China.\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland has welcomed the far-\nsighted Agenda for Development, including the Africa-\nspecific development initiatives for the 1990s, which\ncontain the Organization\u2019s operational priorities in the\narea of economic and social development, and aims to\nensure sustainable growth for our economies. As we\napproach the mid-term review of the continent\u2019s\ndevelopment plan, it is clear that we still lag far behind\nthe other regions of the world in terms of achieving our\ndevelopment targets.\nSwaziland has been conscientious in attending the\nrecent round of important United Nations summit\nconferences, which have focused on key social and\neconomic development issues, including those on the\n3\n\n\nenvironment and development, on population and\ndevelopment, and this year\u2019s social summit and Conference\non Women. In each case, we have committed ourselves to\nthe plans of action and are doing our best to implement the\nrecommendations.\nA side effect of these meetings was that once again\nthey highlighted our continent\u2019s limitations. While the\ncountries of Africa recognize our responsibilities to our\nown people, it is clear that our resources, technical\nknowledge and all-round expertise do not yet allow us to\nprogress as fast as we would like. Undoubtedly, we will\ncontinue to require the support and understanding of the\ndeveloped world if we are ever to rid ourselves of\ndependency on outside assistance, and, certainly, the United\nNations has a major role to play in the process.\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland has not been standing still\nin its own efforts to promote economic measures aimed at\nimproving the living standards of its people. As is our\ncustom, we have consulted directly with the entire nation to\ngive the Swazi people themselves the opportunity to\ndetermine priorities for their economic and social\ndevelopment. The focus of our people\u2019s concerns has been\non much of what has been discussed at the recent United\nNations conferences, and there is a direct parallel between\nthe recommendations of the various Summits and those of\nour own consultation process. The value of this national\nexercise, in a United Nations context, is that it confirms\nsupport for what the Organization is doing at the level of\nthose who matter most.\nIncluded among the issues raised in our national\neconomic exercise were concern over the continuing\ndrought and the realization that any plans we may have to\nimprove our economic performance will still depend to a\nlarge extent on the inconsistencies of nature, unless we can\noffset the effects of poor rainfall by large capital projects\nto harness our water resources.\nAn increase in cross-border illegal traffic in drugs and\nweapons continues to present a threat to our socio-economic\nstability, and as a sign of our commitment to overcome this\ngrowing danger the Kingdom of Swaziland and the\nRepublic of South Africa recently signed a joint agreement\nto work together to combat cross-border crime. It is clear,\nhowever, that what is needed is international support to\novercome what is certainly an international menace.\nThe Swazi nation has confirmed the importance of\nincreasing environmental awareness amongst our people,\nand the need to protect our natural heritage is recognized as\na priority target. Land usage and agricultural\ndiversification are important elements of this vital issue\nand we will need to acquire technical support to achieve\nimprovement.\nAnother key element of the nation\u2019s concerns is\ncentred on the role of women. Swazi women are\nidentified as the backbone of the economy and it has been\nrecommended that steps be taken to bring the legal rights\nof our women onto an equal basis with those of our men.\nOnce more, the traditions and culture of our\nKingdom have been reaffirmed as the main contributing\ncause of our stability and peace. Our national identity is\nimportant to us \u2014 it is, after all, what makes us\nunique \u2014 and Swaziland feels strongly that there should\nbe recognition of and respect for each country\u2019s\ndistinctiveness in the way we each approach an issue and\nin the solutions we find to our own problems.\nAs the world\u2019s leaders gather here later this month\nto reaffirm our collective commitment to our founding\nCharter, let our fiftieth anniversary celebration also signal\na new start for our Organization, a new beginning in\nwhich we will address the challenges to global security\nand development with a fresh sense of equal\nresponsibility and duty and with new structures in place\nto achieve our united goal of improving the world we live\nin for all our peoples. The Kingdom of Swaziland\nconfirms its own commitment to our founding Charter\nand declares its pride in the Organization in which the\nhopes of all mankind are placed. May God bless these\nproceedings with the success they deserve.\n"

        "file_text": "I must begin my statement by echoing the words of\nprevious speakers who have congratulated Mr. Diogo\nFreitas do Amaral on his election by acclamation to the\npresidency of the fiftieth session of the General Assembly.\nOn my own behalf and on behalf of the delegation of\nMadagascar, which I have the honour to head, I have\npleasure in saying that we rely greatly on his experience\nand wisdom in ensuring that our work will be crowned with\nsuccess at the conclusion of our debates. Whilst assuring\nhim of the cooperation and support of my delegation, I\nwould also like to congratulate the other officers of the\nAssembly.\nIt gives me particular pleasure to pay tribute to our\ncolleague, His Excellency Mr. Amara Essy, Mr. Freitas do\nAmaral\u2019s distinguished predecessor, for the enthusiasm and\ndynamism he demonstrated in the service of the General\nAssembly, which under his presidency carried out its\nmandate well and always to the satisfaction of countries\nlike my own.\nLastly, may I express our appreciation for the efforts\nmade by the Secretariat to ensure the efficient organization\nof our work, under the competent leadership of the\nSecretary-General, Mr. Boutros-Boutros Ghali.\nSince our current session coincides with the\ncommemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the United\nNations Charter, it goes without saying that, as the\nSecretary-General stressed in his report on the work of the\nOrganization, it is an occasion not only to take stock of the\nfirst half-century of our Organization and to prepare for the\nsecond, but also to seek ways to keep up the momentum of\nthe first years of the decade in world affairs.\nAfter the collapse of the Berlin Wall, a true symbol of\nthe cold war, history has witnessed a series of events that\nstrengthen confidence in the principles and agreements\nenshrined in the Charter: the independence of Namibia; the\nformation of the first democratic multiracial Government in\nSouth Africa; the holding of democratic elections marking\nthe end of a long period of civil strife in Mozambique and\none-party rule in Malawi; the promising steps taken by\nseveral southern African countries towards reconstruction;\nthe process of reconciliation in the Middle East, recently\nadded to by the agreement \u2014 welcomed by Madagascar,\nalong with all other peace-loving nations \u2014 extending\nautonomy in the West Bank; and, lastly, certain\nencouraging signs with regard to the situation in the\nformer Yugoslavia.\nParadoxically, however, the end of the era of\nideological confrontations, while accelerating the\nintegration of world society, has also promoted an\nincrease in conflicts, sources of outbursts of violence and\nsavagery, resulting not only from conflicts between States,\nbut also, unfortunately, from ethnic, civil, religious and\nother deep-rooted causes within a collapsing State or\nStates. This trend, one of the most marked of the post-\nwar period, seems to be growing, in the context of an\ninternational community that is powerless, disarmed and,\nabove all, disillusioned.\nAs regards Africa, to which Madagascar belongs, I\nrefer in this regard to the genocide in Rwanda, whose\nimpact is still felt by international public opinion; the\ncontinuation of civil war in Liberia, in Sudan and Angola;\nand the spiral of violence and violations of human rights\nin Gambia, one of the oldest democracies in West Africa,\nfollowing a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat.\nOther conflicts still continue in Europe and\nelsewhere.\nAt the risk of offending some, I must say that most,\nif not all, of these hotbeds are fuelled in particular by\nsales of illicit weapons \u2014 I should rather, say \u201cauthorized\nsales of weapons\u201d. Their proliferation shows the\nineffectiveness of the relevant international conventions\nand of the measures enacted by the international\ncommunity. They also run counter to the efforts made to\nreduce worldwide expenditures on armaments since 1987\nin order to obtain the peace dividend.\nInternational public opinion was also deeply shocked\nby the coup d\u2019\u00e9tat carried out by mercenaries against the\nIslamic Federal Republic of the Comoros. Madagascar\nstrongly condemned that putsch, and congratulates France\non the happy outcome of Operation Azalea to re-establish\ninstitutional legality in the Comoros.\nThe disillusionment that I have described,\ndisillusionment bordering on hopelessness, has other\naspects which are even more threatening to the world\u2019s\nsecurity. Indeed, both in the North and in the South we\n11\n\n\nare witnessing an upsurge of intolerance, of xenophobia \u2014\nin brief, of fear or the rejection of difference, of all\ndifferences. These feelings are exacerbated by individual\nand collective frustrations born of poverty, of\nmarginalization and of social injustice. This picture is\ncomplemented by environmental degradation, a sluggish\neconomy, the depletion of natural resources, the\ndisintegration of the social fabric, the spread of drug use,\ninternational terrorism, pandemics, natural disasters,\nunemployment and famine. To sum up, there is a whole\nrange of global threats which are no longer confined within\nnational borders.\nIt would be a truism to assert that solving these\nproblems calls for us to be farsighted, to step back so as to\nget a global view and go beyond the outdated approach of\nresolving the challenges facing us case by case. That is why\nMadagascar must support all the efforts to implement the\nglobalizing structural approach in the Agenda for Peace.\nHowever, we must recognize that any initiatives in this\nfield will be in vain if there continue to be contradictions\nbetween the diplomacy of States and the diplomacy of the\nUnited Nations, because it is quite obvious that the future\nof today\u2019s societies lies within a space that is broadening to\nencompass the dimensions of the universe.\nThis fundamental refocusing must be the purpose of a\nrational reorganization of our organs and institutions, which,\ngiven the social, political and economic conditions\nprevailing when they were established, now have\nlimitations, gaps and shortcomings when it comes to\nresponding to the expectations of today\u2019s world.\nIn Madagascar\u2019s view, what is needed is, first, to\nenlarge the Security Council on the basis of equitable\ngeographical distribution in order to ensure the\ndemocratization of international relations. Secondly, the\nGeneral Assembly must be given greater means, and\nespecially more powers, to put an end to the old clich\u00e9 that\nthis organ is merely a forum for rhetoric and orotund\nspeechmaking. Thirdly, as indicated in \u201cAn Agenda for\nPeace,\u201d there must be a considerable strengthening of the\nmechanisms for the pacific settlement of disputes set forth\nin Chapter VI of the Charter, which would seem in practice\nto have become the poor relation of Chapter VII, with its\nauthorization of the use of force as a last resort. Indeed, in\nthis connection, I would make so bold as to say that any\nand all reform of the United Nations must also entail more\ncareful attention to the provisions of Chapter VII.\nThis strengthening should include giving first\npriority in United Nations bodies to the prevention of\nviolence by developing a policy and strategy centred on\ndevelopment. There, the General Assembly could play a\nmore important role, in conjunction with the Security\nCouncil, by, for example, in the framework of\nre-establishing peace, strengthening the role of United\nNations forces used as buffers in international, ethnic or\ncivil conflicts. Paragraph 7 of Article 2 of the Charter\nexpressly excludes any intervention in matters which are\nessentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any State.\nThe settlement of national conflicts, which falls within the\ncompetence of the United Nations and which still requires\nthe support of the country concerned, must be viewed as\nthe carrying out of efforts to establish democracy and the\nrule of law and to inculcate a spirit of tolerance and non-\nviolence.\nThere is also the question of strengthening regional\nstructures for the peaceful settlement of disputes, such as\nthose that already exist within the United Nations, the\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU) and the\nNon-Aligned Movement. Lastly, there is the question of\nstrengthening regional cooperation in the sphere of\ndisarmament so as to block the uncontrolled movements\nof weapons and the proliferation of weapons of mass\ndestruction.\nIt is in this spirit that Madagascar supported the\nindefinite extension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation\nof Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and is about to ratify various\ninternational conventions, such as the Convention on the\nProhibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling\nand Use of Chemical Weapons and on Their Destruction\nand the Convention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the\nUse of Certain Conventional Weapons.\nIn the economic and social sphere, there is no need\nto stress that world development also presents a scenario\nof contrasts and disparities, whereas there had been\nreason to hope that the post-cold-war period would see a\nde facto mobilization of the international community in\nsupport of development. Even worse, the outlook is far\nfrom encouraging. Poverty and hardship have become\nendemic in the so-called fourth world \u2014 the \u201cstorm\nzones\u201d, to use an expression borrowed from the jargon of\ntoday\u2019s experts \u2014 which is also prey to natural disasters\nin addition to its internal problems, resulting from\npolitical instability and imbalanced economies. The\nbalance of payments continues to show a deficit because\nof the crushing burden of external debt and the\nfluctuations in the prices of raw materials, accompanied\n12\n\n\nby \u2014 to cap it all \u2014 a stagnation and even a decline in\ndevelopment assistance.\nWe are also witnessing various forms of protectionism\nin the countries of the North, while the countries of the\nSouth are being urged to liberalize trade. The result is\nincreased marginalization of the poor countries, which are\nderiving absolutely no benefit from the globalization of the\nworld economy, and increased social disparities both\nbetween and within nations. That adverse trend is leading\nto the formation of an international social apartheid.\nIn the United Nations, the establishment of the\nEconomic and Social Council embodied the poor countries\u2019\nhopes for recovery, but it has become clear that its\nadministrative machinery is still cumbersome and unsuited\nto its task. It has gradually become paralysed by the\nmultiplication of its organs, without any real follow-up or\ncontrol, and its high operating cost. At last July\u2019s session of\nthe Council in Geneva, emphasis was put on the need to\ngive it greater vigour by strengthening its competencies and\npowers.\nIf development is today recognized as a human right,\nMadagascar believes that that it is largely thanks to the\nUnited Nations, which has advanced the notion of\ninterdependence between economic development,\ndemocracy and respect for human rights. Therefore, one of\nthe United Nations primary duties is to create and\nstrengthen the institutional structure needed to implement\nthe norms it has identified for the promotion of\ndevelopment. In that connection, Madagascar will\nparticipate with attention and interest in the General\nAssembly\u2019s debate on An Agenda for Development.\nSimilarly, we shall follow with interest the\nimplementation of the proposals contained in the\nCommuniqu\u00e9 of the G-7 Summit held last June in Halifax,\nproposals designed to promote sustainable development and\nbetter share the fruits of growth. We welcome the G-7\u2019s\nexpress offer to cooperate in formulating a new approach\nto international cooperation and in defining the contribution\nexpected of the United Nations system, which is seeking\nthrough a series of world conferences \u2014 recently in\nBeijing, previously in Rio, Copenhagen and Vienna, and\nnext year in Istanbul \u2014 to engage, beyond national borders,\nin combined, effective action against poverty,\nunemployment and social disintegration. Those conferences\nare part of the attempts to renew and improve United\nNations methodologies and strategies in the sphere of\ncooperation for development.\nI cannot fail to refer to the beneficial activities in\nMadagascar coordinated by the United Nations\nDevelopment Programme and carried out through the\nUnited Nations system of operational activities and\nespecially by the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund. Nor\nmust I forget the United Nations Educational, Scientific\nand Cultural Organization and the United Nations\nPopulation Fund, whose mid-term review of the third\ncountry programme with Madagascar was completed at\nthe end of August.\nIn the same context we welcome the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s initiative on a steering committee to prepare\nspecific short-term and medium-term projects for the\ndevelopment of Africa in such priority areas as food\nsecurity, the strengthening of institutions, the development\nof the private sector, desertification and social\ndevelopment.\nThe viability and survival of our planet depend,\nbeyond cooperation, on our ability to adapt to the new\nrealities and constraints we face. As we approach 1996,\ndeclared by the General Assembly as the International\nYear for the Eradication of Poverty, my delegation\nwanted today briefly to outline some of the proposals my\ncountry is presenting to contribute to making the dreams\nof the founding fathers of the Charter come true, although\nwe know full well that our proposals are incomplete and\nthat even an improved and ideal United Nations would be\nunable on its own to solve all the problems before it.\nThe building of a better world, to which we all\naspire, remains dependent on establishing international\nrelations based on the principle of cooperation and\nsolidarity and on respect for the principles and norms that\ngovern international relations.\nIn that connection, let me conclude by noting a great\nstep forward in international relations: on the occasion of\nthe fortieth anniversary of the Organization, speakers in\nthis Hall stressed the concept of the balance of forces in\ngeneral and of strategic nuclear parity in particular, while\ntoday, 10 years later, we all recognize that security and\npeace cannot exist without cooperation and solidarity, and\nin the absence of all violence.\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me to begin by\ncongratulating the President on his election at this historic\nfiftieth session of the General Assembly. On behalf of the\nEstonian people, I wish him all the best this year.\nFifty years ago this body met for the first time in an\neffort to unite the community of nations to avoid a\nrepetition of the carnage we saw in the Second World War.\nFor my country, that war finally ended just last year, with\nthe withdrawal of foreign troops from our territory. I am\nhappy to note that tomorrow the final remnant of\noccupation, in the form of the former Soviet\nnuclear-submarine training facility at Paldiski, will be\nturned over to Estonian authorities by Russian civilian\ndismantling specialists. I take this opportunity to\nacknowledge Estonia\u2019s satisfaction with the Russian\nFederation\u2019s having fulfilled its commitment in this\nregard, as mandated by the agreement signed by Russia\nand Estonia on 30 July 1994.\nTurning to the work of the United Nations, the\ndeclarations and decisions produced by recent\ninternational conferences must be integrated into the work\nof the United Nations as a whole. Estonia places\nparticular importance upon the implementation of Agenda\n21 and the Vienna Declaration. We welcome the\nextension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\nNuclear Weapons and look forward to a successful\nconclusion of negotiations regarding a universal and\nverifiable comprehensive test-ban treaty. The importance\nof these and other recently concluded international\nagreements must be underscored through implementation.\nThere are a number of ways through which the\nUnited Nations can improve its performance. One of the\nmost extensive ways in which Member States relate to the\nUnited Nations system is by way of the activities of\nvarious United Nations agencies and programmes. For\nthis reason, reform of the Economic and Social Council\nis crucial and should be addressed in earnest. Member\nStates should have greater opportunities to ensure that\nUnited Nations resources are used in an effective and\nefficient manner. I am referring not to a need for the\nmicromanagement of agencies, programmes and projects,\nbut, rather, to participation in agency, programme and\nproject activities.\nI would like to single out and commend the work of\nthe Economic Commission for Europe (ECE) and other\nregional commissions. The ECE has worked diligently to\nprovide practical and needed support for the integration of\ncountries with diverse histories into a cohesive regional\nwhole. As part of continuing United Nations reform,\nEstonia once again urges greater cooperation between the\nECE and the United Nations Development Programme.\nAny discussion of United Nations reform must\ninclude the composition and functioning of the Security\nCouncil. Estonia welcomes the report of the Open-ended\nWorking Group on Security Council reform, which,\namong other practical suggestions, calls for developing\n31\n\n\ngreater transparency and the inclusion of more Member\nStates in decision making. Within the context of continuing\ndebate over Security Council reform, we reiterate our\nsupport for an expanded and more effective Security\nCouncil.\nIn the 40 years from 1948 to 1988, the United Nations\ndeployed 13 peace-keeping operations. In the seven years\nfrom 1988 to the present, 16 operations were begun, of\nwhich a significant number still continue. There are many\nsystemic reasons for such a dramatic increase in peace-\nkeeping operations, and the issues of both peace-keeping\nand peacemaking call for further detailed examination.\nRegional peace-keeping efforts that are conducted under the\nauspices of the United Nations must remain under stringent\nUnited Nations control.\nThe Security Council, in turn, must carefully define\nand monitor any mandates granted to regional efforts and\nmust resist attempts by groups of States or individual\ncountries to wrest authority for such actions. Only in this\nway can the United Nations ensure compliance with the\nprinciples of multilateralism and impartiality in order to\nconduct peace-keeping operations that are not only\neffective, but also politically neutral.\nEstonia is proud to be taking part in peace-keeping\nefforts. Through generous support, especially that of the\nDanish Government, Estonian peace-keepers, for the first\ntime ever, took part in United Nations peace-keeping\noperations. Having participated in the United Nations\nProtection Force (UNPROFOR), and now the United\nNations Confidence Restoration Operation in Croatia\n(UNCRO), we look forward to expanding our role in\nUnited Nations peace-keeping activities.\nI am gratified to support the working arrangement\nbetween the United Nations and the North Atlantic Treaty\nOrganization (NATO) in the former Yugoslavia. Estonia\nregards the United Nations-mandated NATO air strikes in\nrecent weeks in Bosnia as an unfortunate but necessary\nmeans of bringing about an end to the fighting which is still\ntaking place there. Recent cooperation between the United\nNations and NATO shows that despite the inherent\ndifficulties in supporting peace in the former Yugoslavia,\ndifferences can be overcome and a joint approach to peace-\nkeeping can be agreed upon. We view this cooperation as\na harbinger of greater effectiveness in future United Nations\npeace-keeping efforts.\nAn area to which Estonia attaches particular\nimportance is the work of the High Commissioner for\nHuman Rights, Mr. Jos\u00e9 Ayala Lasso, and the Centre for\nHuman Rights in Geneva. In keeping with its open-door\npolicy towards the work of human rights groups, Estonia\nwelcomes and supports the work done by the High\nCommissioner for Human Rights and the Centre for\nHuman Rights. We believe that information about the\nwork of the Commissioner and the Centre should be made\navailable to a wider audience through more frequent\npublication of the results of investigations. This would\nhelp ensure that the efforts of partisan political concerns\nthat tend to rely on inaccurate information will be\ncountered by factual, impartial reporting of the sort that\nMr. Ayala Lasso and the Centre provide.\nDuring this United Nations fiftieth anniversary year,\nit is important for every Member State to affirm its\nfinancial commitment to the United Nations. Estonia, for\nits part, supports recent changes to the methodology used\nto calculate assessments, changes which have led to\nreduced distortions and affirmation of capacity to pay as\nthe primary, transparent and universally applied criteria\nby which assessments are calculated. Agreed upon regular\nbudget assessments and peacekeeping dues are collective\nresponsibilities for the functioning of the United Nations,\nand should be put ahead of individual partisan interests.\nWe face new challenges on this, the fiftieth\nanniversary of the United Nations. I wish all of us the\nbest in meeting those challenges, so that the next 50 years\nmay be even more constructive than the last.\n"

        "file_text": "Please accept my\ncongratulations, Sir, on your election as President of the\nGeneral Assembly at its fiftieth session. This attests to\nyour excellent qualities, which will undoubtedly\ncontribute to the successful discussion of all the items on\nthe agenda.\nI would like to take this opportunity to express\nspecial appreciation to the Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros\nBoutros-Ghali, for his great contribution to the solution of\ninternational problems of the world community and his\nefficient management aimed at the establishment of new\nrelations between nations in the twenty-first century.\nWe have to note that this anniversary session of the\nGeneral Assembly is taking place at a time of increased\ntension and continued armed conflicts in different parts of\nthe globe. One of the most dangerous and complicated is\nthe Bosnian conflict. Events in Bosnia defy\nstraightforward interpretation. At the same time, the\nreadiness recently displayed by the parties in conflict to\nsettle existing problems on the basis of adherence to the\nprinciples of State sovereignty inspires optimism and hope\nthat long-awaited peace will be established in the Balkans.\nIn Kazakstan\u2019s opinion one of the most important\nconditions for achieving peace is that respective countries\nin the territory of the former Yugoslavia continue to exist\nas sovereign States within the borders recognized by the\nworld community.\nWe highly appreciate the role of the United Nations\npeace-keeping forces, which in differing situations have\ndone their best to contain conflicts and alleviate the\nconsequences of hostilities for the civilian population. We\nhave no doubt that the Organization has to exercise all its\nauthority in such situations. The world community should\nprovide more effective assistance to the United Nations so\nthat it can use its peace-keeping forces in areas of conflict\nin a more efficient and timely manner.\nCreation of regional and global structures designed\nto promote long-lasting peace is an important aspect of\ninternational security. The balance of forces, upset after\n24\n\n\nthe end of the cold war, should be restored not through the\nestablishment of new military and political alliances but\nthrough international treaties and agreements promoting\nsecurity and stability and through the establishment and use\nof effective mechanisms of preventive diplomacy.\nWe view as quite successful the activities of the\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe\n(OSCE), whose sphere of responsibility includes not only\nEurope but Central Asia as well. A high degree of\nefficiency in security matters concerning the Asian and\nPacific region is being displayed by the Association of\nSouth-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) forum.\nKazakstan, for its part, continues its work towards the\nconvening of a conference on interaction and confidence-\nbuilding measures in Asia. The forum\u2019s mandate is being\ndrawn up by the Special Working Group. We believe that\nall the countries of the Asian continent, despite their\nheterogeneity, have an equal interest in durable peace and\nstability, which is an important guarantee for their\nprogressive movement towards economic prosperity and\ninternal stability. Taking this opportunity, I urge all Asian\ncountries to contribute to the realization of this idea,\nexpressed by President Nazarbayev from the rostrum of this\nlofty Organization at the forty-seventh session of the\nGeneral Assembly.\nWe firmly believe that no matter how strong and\neffective the United Nations may be, no matter how\ncomprehensive its activities are, security and peace should\nbe the backbone of the policy of all countries, irrespective\nof their capabilities and regional affiliation. We see that in\nthe new geopolitical reality more emphasis is being placed\non meeting the various needs of the individual. There is a\ngeneral understanding that quick solutions of security and\nstability issues cannot and should not take the place of a\nlong-term strategy of sustainable development. In other\nwords, in today\u2019s world there is an emerging tendency\ntowards a gradual transition from national security to\nhuman security.\nThe Republic of Kazakstan, which used to be a\nde facto nuclear-weapon State and now is a nuclear-free\nState, is making its contribution to these global\ntransformations. The elimination of all existing nuclear\nwarheads in Kazakstan\u2019s territory and of the last nuclear\ncharge at the already-closed Semipalatinsk nuclear-test site\nhas been a highly important step in the fulfilment of\nKazakstan\u2019s international obligations.\nKazakstan is a consistent advocate of a moratorium\non nuclear tests and of a comprehensive test-ban treaty,\nwhich should be concluded as soon as possible but not\nlater than next year.\nAddressing the United Nations Conference on\nDisarmament in June 1995 in Geneva, Kazakstan\u2019s\nPresident reaffirmed its commitment to the consistent\npolicy of the strengthening of international security in its\nnew interpretation. The President of Kazakstan stressed\nthat various needs of the individual must be met. Indeed,\nthe success of the disarmament process is measured today\nnot only by the percentage of warheads and delivery\nsystems cut but also by the increase in the production of\ngoods for the people.\nIn the light of the outcome of the Copenhagen\nSummit, emerging models of human development should\ninclude new concepts for solving educational,\nemployment, environmental and health-care problems.\nUrgent and effective measures are needed to address a\ndangerous growth in unemployment \u2014 an especially\npressing problem for the economies in transition. We\nbelieve that these countries can legitimately expect from\nthe United Nations the adoption of special measures\npromoting their sustainable development. The priority that\nthis matter should be given by the United Nations can be\nexplained by a number of factors.\nIndeed, modern geo-economic trends reflect the fact\nthat in the near future world economic centres in North\nAmerica, South-East Asia and Europe will emerge or be\nstrengthened. The stability and effectiveness of these\ncentres cannot be imagined without their involvement in\ntrade and economic relations with the countries of the\nCommonwealth of Independent States, which, even taken\nseparately, represent significant economic and political\nentities capable of filling existing gaps in relations\nbetween Europe and Asia, North and South. It is relevant,\nfirst of all, in the case of Kazakstan \u2014 a major Central\nAsian State.\nSpeaking of the need to adapt the United Nations\nsystem to the new geo-political realities, we think that the\npotential of the countries of Central Asia should be taken\ninto account. Their capabilities in the formulation of the\nstrategies of sustainable development and peace-making\nare becoming stronger. Close attention should be paid to\nthe impetus for cooperation with the United Nations, in\nthe interest of a secure world, that is being served by\nthese countries.\n25\n\n\nIn this context, I would like to draw attention to\nPresident Nazarbayev\u2019s initiative regarding the\nestablishment, under the auspices of the United Nations, of\na unit of the armed forces of three Central Asian\nrepublics \u2014 Kazakstan, Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan. In our\nopinion, this would contribute to the strengthening of\nsecurity and peace in Central Asia \u2014 a region which also\nhas its areas of conflict.\nIn the opinion of Kazakstan, priority attention in\ncooperation between the United Nations and the economies\nin transition should be paid to the protection of the\nenvironment, which is one of the five main dimensions of\ndevelopment. In the Central Asian region, the ecological\nthreat is one of the most dangerous threats to human\nsecurity.\nWe think that the world community should pay special\nattention to the tragedy of the Aral Sea region. According\nto the World Bank, in the next 25 years, the efforts to\nrestore an ecological balance in the region will require $50\nbillion. Such a project is not feasible without financial\nassistance from international organizations. Thus, we are\ninterested in the search for new international sources of\nfinancing, and support the idea of devising a system of\ninternational taxes on arms transfers and transactions,\ninvolving currency flows, to achieve global human,\nincluding ecological, security.\nI would like to say a few words about United Nations\nreforms. The position of Kazakstan on this issue is as\nfollows. Reforms are necessary, but they should be carried\nout with the utmost care, in order to avoid upsetting the\nbalance of the whole system of international relations. The\nCharter of the United Nations should largely remain as the\nbasis and the reference point for the work of the\nOrganization, to which there is no alternative in the modern\nworld.\nMajor changes that have taken place in the world since\nthe creation of the United Nations should be reflected in the\ncomposition of the Security Council. Kazakstan believes\nthat the number of Council members, including the number\nof permanent members, could, in principle, be increased.\nWe welcome measures taken by the Secretary-General\nto reduce expenses related to the activities of the\nSecretariat. It is important, in our opinion, that such an\nessential body as the International Court of Justice should\nalso be adapted to present-day requirements. The idea of\nhaving important decisions adopted in an economic security\ncouncil appears to be worthy of attention, considering the\nneed, in the view of many countries, to reorganize and\nrevitalize the Economic and Social Council.\nDebates on fundamental United Nations\ndocuments \u2014 the reports by the United Nations\nSecretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, \u201cAn Agenda for\nPeace\u201d and \u201cAn Agenda for Development\u201d \u2014 reveal the\nneed for a more detailed analysis of ways to develop\nsociety by meeting the social, economic, political and\ncultural needs of the individual. We are especially aware\nof this now as we celebrate, under the auspices of\nUNESCO, the 150th anniversary of Abai, a great Kazak\npoet, educator and philosopher, who devoted his life to\nthe mutual spiritual and cultural enrichment of nations.\nThe desire to jointly solve the issues of \u201cpeace and\ndevelopment\u201d also lies at the heart of our proposal to set\nup a United Nations commission for central Asia \u2014 a\njoint body of the Economic Commission for Europe\n(ECE) and the Economic and Social Commission for Asia\nand the Pacific (ESCAP). This idea was initially proposed\nby the President of the Republic of Kazakstan, Mr. N.\nNazarbaev, at the Summit of the member States of the\nEconomic Cooperation Organization in 1993 in Istanbul.\nThe common nature of the social, economic and political\nobjectives of the countries in the region, on the threshold\nof the twenty-first century, determines the need to\nestablish regional mechanisms for their attainment and to\ncreate appropriate structures. The progress achieved by\nthe countries of Central Asia in this regard is reflected by\nthe rather effective activities of the OECD, as well as\nthose of the economic union between Kazakstan,\nKyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan.\nSpeaking about the importance of this problem for\nthe Central Asian States, I would like to note that,\njudging by past experience, the efforts of two important\nregional Commissions \u2014 ESCAP and ECE \u2014 are not\nadequately coordinated with regard to this group of\ncountries. As a result, the republics of Central Asia are\nnot sufficiently involved in their programmes.\nAs the United Nations Organization approaches its\nfiftieth anniversary, it has great accomplishments to its\ncredit in peacemaking and in the strengthening of\ninternational security. As a well-known Japanese writer\nonce said: only life filled with a workaday routine might\nbe worse and more dreadful than a war. Least of all\nwould we like to see the United Nations as a structure\nwhich mechanically services the demands of mankind on\na day-by-day basis. In other words, we do not want to see\nthe\n26\n\n\nUnited Nations as a rigid structure, insensitive to the\nprofound changes of our rapidly changing times. The world\ncontinues to pin its hopes on the United Nations as a\nconcentrated source of wisdom, justice and responsiveness\nto the sufferings of mankind. The world appeals to the\nUnited Nations to rise above immediate plans and\nprogrammes in order to appreciate fully the mosaic of\nmodern international relations in all their variety and\ndiversity. And we firmly believe that the United Nations\nshould adequately respond to the aspirations of all peoples\nyearning for peace and tranquillity, aspirations born out of\ntheir very existence.\n"

        "file_text": "Let me begin by\ncongratulating Mr. Freitas do Amaral of Portugal on his\nelection to the presidency of this fiftieth session of the\nGeneral Assembly. I am confident that under his wise\nleadership we shall come to a successful conclusion of this\nhistoric session.\nMy Spanish colleague, Minister Javier Solana, has\nalready spoken on behalf of the European Union. I fully\nassociate Finland with his statement.\nFifty years ago the founders of the United Nations\nestablished the maintenance of international peace and\nsecurity as the primary purpose of their new Organization.\nThey also undertook to take effective collective measures\nto that end. Fifty years later the condition of the world is\ndramatically different, but the United Nations is as\nindispensable now as it was then. Its role under Chapter VII\nof the Charter continues to be a vital bulwark of world\nsecurity, but its mission of peace now ranges much wider:\nthe United Nations focuses on prevention of conflicts, it\nsustains development, it seeks to ensure the human rights\nand dignity of every individual.\nThe world needs a strong United Nations. Certainly\nthe small, the weak and the underprivileged among us need\nthe United Nations the most. But the United Nations, in\nturn, needs the full support of all its Member States.\nIt is intolerable that while all of us here will once\nagain reaffirm our faith in the United Nations, the\nOrganization is once more experiencing extreme financial\ndifficulties. In this context I should like to draw the\nattention of the Assembly to a statement adopted\nyesterday by the Foreign Ministers of the Nordic\ncountries \u2014 Denmark, Iceland, Norway, Sweden and\nFinland \u2014 on the financial situation of the United\nNations. The text of this statement will be made available\nlater.\nWe all agree that the United Nations needs to\nstreamline its work, set clear priorities and cut out\nactivities that have become obsolete. Yet the main reason\nfor the difficulties is that the majority of the Member\nStates, permanent members of the Security Council\namong them, do not pay their assessed contributions on\ntime, in full or without conditions.\nAs a consequence, those who pay on time, in full\nand without conditions \u2014 such as Finland \u2014 are in fact\npenalized for their behaviour. It is high time for all\nMember States to acknowledge that to pay one\u2019s dues is\nnot an option, but an obligation, and that this obligation\nmust be fulfilled, and fulfilled punctually. When payments\nare not made on time, it is normal to charge interest. This\nshould be done also in the United Nations.\nIt is also clear that the present scale of assessments\nneeds to be revised rapidly to take into account the real\ncapacity to pay of each Member State. Finland is\nprepared to support adjustments in cases where the pains\nof transition, natural disasters or other circumstances truly\nbeyond the control of the Government concerned justify\nsuch exceptional treatment. On the other hand, upward\nadjustments should be the rule when economic\ndevelopment justifies them.\nA strong United Nations needs an effective Security\nCouncil, capable of acting on behalf of the entire\nmembership. Finland is pleased that the Security Council\nhas assumed its role under the Charter after the paralysis\nof the cold-war years. We also welcome the steps the\nCouncil has taken to improve its working methods and\nthe transparency of its deliberations.\nTo remain effective in the long run, the Security\nCouncil must be representative. There can be no\neffectiveness without legitimacy. Legitimacy grows from\na true reflection of the increase in United Nations\nmembership as well as from a frank recognition of\nchanging realities. Finland therefore supports an increase\nin Council membership by five to eight new members.\n16\n\n\nThe groundwork for the reform of the Council has\nbeen laid after two years of intensive debate in the Working\nGroup of the General Assembly. Now it is time to move\nfrom discussion to true negotiation between Member States.\nA strong United Nations does not mean that our\nOrganization should do what we, as Member States, should\nin the first instance do ourselves. Under the Charter,\nMember States themselves have an obligation to seek\npeaceful solutions to disputes and to make every effort to\nprevent conflicts in advance. The United Nations assists,\nbut cannot replace, the Member States, nor should it be\nexpected to do so.\nThe permanence of, and unfailing respect for,\nuniversal norms is the basis of human security, whether in\nrelations between nations or within the nations themselves.\nThe historic decision by the parties to the Nuclear\nNon-Proliferation Treaty to make that Treaty permanent\nmeant that a cornerstone of international security was kept\nin place and that the prospect of the eventual elimination of\nnuclear weapons became more attainable. The next step\nshould be the conclusion of a comprehensive nuclear-test-\nban treaty by the summer of 1996. The negotiations in\nGeneva are proceeding well. Under these circumstances,\nany testing is therefore a cause for concern. Finland has\nexpressed its disapproval of the recent tests by France and\nChina.\n\nThe breakthrough achieved in the Middle East peace\nprocess two years ago will be followed by a new important\nagreement, to be signed this week. I should like to\ncongratulate the negotiators on their courage and\npersistence. The international community should continue\nto support the reconstruction that peace has made possible.\nFinland is encouraged by the recent turn towards a\npeaceful solution in the former Yugoslavia. The\ninternational community has shown resolve in defending\nSarajevo from persistent and cruel attacks on innocent\ncivilians. The international community must show equal\nresolve once the peace agreement is reached. It must help\nto maintain peace on the ground and to reconstruct what\nhas been shattered by war. But, above all, it is necessary\nthat all parties to the conflict now finally commit\nthemselves to peace.\nSome of the lessons from the conflicts in former\nYugoslavia and elsewhere are clear. The capacity of the\nUnited Nations and the international community to\ncoordinate an international response is still inadequate and\nnot integrated enough, as so many speakers before me\nhave already mentioned here. The United Nations bears\nthe main responsibility to prevent, to react rapidly to and\nto manage often very complex emergencies. It is the\ncentral actor in peace-keeping operations. We must not\nallow the lack of financial resources and organizational\ndifficulties to stand in the way.\nA continuum of ideas based on a broad concept of\nsecurity \u2014 from respect for the rule of law and human\nrights to support for sustainable economic and social\ndevelopment \u2014 is already available in the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s twin Agendas for Peace and for Development.\nIt is now for the Member States to put the best of those\nideas into practice. Finland, together with its European\nUnion partners, will do its share.\nTrue international security begins with the security\nof the individual, sometimes in relation to his or her own\nGovernment. Violations of human rights, including\nwomen\u2019s rights, are not justifiable on any grounds. There\nare no cultural exceptions to universal human rights.\nThe importance of mechanisms for the effective\nprotection of human rights is now widely recognized. This\nis manifested, inter alia, in the efforts to establish\nsystematic and organized judicial inquiry into, and\npenalties against, violations of international humanitarian\nlaw and human rights. Finland supports the early\nestablishment of a permanent international criminal court.\nIn addition to judicial mechanisms open mainly to\nStates, the question of the right of individuals to rely on\ninternational human rights instruments is worthy of\nserious study and development. The very positive\nexperiences gained during the 45 years that the European\nCourt of Human Rights of the Council of Europe has\nbeen functioning illustrate the merits of this approach to\nhuman rights. I can speak to that.\nThe Beijing Conference and other recent United\nNations Conferences \u2014 Vienna, Cairo, Copenhagen \u2014\nneed active and integrated follow-up throughout the\nUnited Nations system. The platforms are there. They\nhave established beyond doubt that sustainable human\ndevelopment and human security can be realized only\nthrough the empowerment of individuals and a strong\ncivic society under law. In the international follow-up of\nthe Beijing Conference, the roles of the General\nAssembly and of the Economic and Social Council are\n17\n\n\ncrucial, not only for the efficient implementation of the\nPlatform for Action, but also for strengthening the\nOrganization in the social and economic fields. At the same\ntime, action at the grass-roots level \u2014 not new bureaucratic\nsuperstructures \u2014 is what is now required.\nThe follow-up to the Rio Conference offers some\nencouragement. Environmental concerns are now part of\nmainstream thinking on development. As a major forestry\nnation, Finland wants in particular to make sure that\nprogress on forest issues is made in a solid and balanced\nmanner and on a global scale.\nThe past five decades have demonstrated to the world\nthat the United Nations is a vital centre for harmonizing\nactions for the common good. The future will bring new\nchallenges. Let us provide the United Nations with the\npolitical support and the financial means that it desperately\nneeds to serve us for the future.\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me to begin by\nextending my warmest congratulations to the President on\nhis assumption of his functions at this remarkable session\nof the United Nations General Assembly in its fiftieth\nyear. It is without a doubt a fitting recognition of his rich\npersonal experience and of his outstanding contribution to\nthe world community.\nI should like to address words of deep appreciation\nto the Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for\nhis dedicated efforts aimed at creating a more secure,\npeaceful and coherent world for future generations but,\nabove all, for the close attention, constant concern and\npersonal compassion that he has demonstrated with regard\nto the fate of my homeland.\nOn behalf of the Head of State, Mr. Eduard\nShevardnadze, and the people of the Republic of Georgia,\nI should like to express our gratitude to all Member States\nfor their support of Georgia in one of the most dramatic\nmoments of its long history. I should like to assure the\ninternational community that despite a very difficult\npolitical landscape, which of late has included savage acts\nof political terrorism, the Georgian nation continues to\nstrive towards its goal of democracy and stability.\nI have been fortunate enough to have had the honour\nof addressing this unique gathering on previous occasions,\nand have always found that, although some of the\nproblems facing our individual countries and our\ncommunity as a whole persist from year to year, the\nunique nature of this world body provides an incentive to\nlook at problems in a more optimistic light and to seek\n18\n\n\nnew and innovative solutions. This holds especially true in\nthis anniversary year.\nThis Hall has witnessed different times and events,\nsome of them full of tension and stress, when the world\nwas teetering on the brink of catastrophe. One can say\nwithout exaggeration that the history of mankind has been\nwritten within these walls for the last 50 years.\nFortunately, the tense cold-war confrontation has\nsubsided, clearing the way for the forming of mechanisms\nof cooperation and partnership. These mechanisms need\ntime to mature and prove their vitality \u2014 but time is a\nluxury that few can afford in our day.\nThis fledgling process is also hampered by a variety\nof other factors. Foremost among these factors is the\nexistence of a number of countries that are, at the same\ntime, struggling to make ends meet and to reform their\nimpoverished economies. This creates a very difficult\neconomic and social situation, which, in turn, leads to\npolitical instability, ethnic or civil conflict and, in the final\nanalysis, to additional threats to regional peace, making the\nproblems of individual countries a matter of concern to the\nentire world. For Georgia, this most difficult factor is\nfurther complicated by the country\u2019s detachment from the\nglobal opportunities of commerce, technology, investment\nand information.\nNo developing country \u2014 and Georgia is undoubtedly\namong them \u2014 has the means to pull itself out of its\ncurrent difficulties by its own bootstraps. And if left to their\nown devices, these countries will inevitably follow the same\nscenario and become additional \u201cbleeding wounds\u201d on the\nbody of the world.\nThe international community is providing significant\nassistance to Georgia and to the other new independent\nStates, for which we are very grateful. I should like to\nmake special mention of the additional funds allocated\nrecently for development and of the extensive activities of\nthe United Nations Development Programme in the\ncountries of the Commonwealth of Independent States.\nThis problem is of a greater magnitude, however, and\nits solution, we believe, lies in devising a comprehensive\nplan for the economic and social development of a number\nof fledgling States, involving vigorous actions on the part\nof the international community and a considerable\nexpansion of the role of the United Nations in promoting\ndevelopment and in the allocation of additional possibilities\nto support the countries transiting to a market economy.\nOne specific option could be to elaborate general\nprogrammes of development for individual countries.\nThese programmes would be targeted at the main spheres\nof the economy, based on a thorough assessment of\nindividual needs, assets and possibilities. They would set\nthe dates, define the sources of financing, and integrate\ninternational assistance and the efforts of national\nGovernments. The programmes would include the\nactivities of the United Nations and of national and\ninternational non-governmental organizations in each\nspecific country. Such a general programme of a\ncoordinating nature would enable us to clearly identify\npriorities, set goals and effectively harness the untapped\nreserves of each nation. It would also make much more\neffective use of international assistance and goodwill,\nwhich, we all understand, are not infinite.\nThe creation and implementation of such\nprogrammes would have a very important additional\nbenefit: by helping to create the basis for a sound,\ngrowing economy, they would simultaneously be\neliminating the breeding ground for internal wars and\nconflicts in a manner much more effective than any\npeace-keeping operation.\nThe cruel and merciless flame of war raging on the\nterritory of the former Yugoslavia is a vivid example of\nthe discrepancy between the realities of our world today\nand the means that international organizations have at\ntheir disposal. Death, unbearable suffering and misery for\ntens of thousands of people are the price of this\ndiscrepancy.\nWhile the attention of the entire world is drawn to\nextinguishing the fire in the Balkans, the territory of the\nformer Soviet Union has become the scene of events no\nless dramatic and equally threatening to international\nsecurity. Many of them bear an uncanny resemblance to\nthe Balkans in their train of events and in their destructive\npotential for regional and international stability.\nA timely and just resolution of even one of these\nconflicts would provide a brilliant example and a strong\nmotivation for settling the other ones.\nIn the past era \u2014 and I use this word on purpose,\nsince we have witnessed a veritable change of eras \u2014\nGeorgia was often referred to as a laboratory of bold\nexperiments. Though Georgia hardly has time for\nexperimenting, this trend continues to this day with an\nunprecedented case. I am referring to the joint activities\nof United Nations military observers and the\n19\n\n\nCommonwealth of Independent States peace-keeping forces\nin the Abkhazia region of Georgia. So far, this novel\napproach \u2014 or experiment, one could say \u2014 has yielded\nprecious few results. Logically, this would prompt us to\nsearch for new forms and methods, but it should not at all\nexclude a more effective use of the existing and tested\npossibilities.\nThe interminable plight of Abkhazia and of the\n300,000 displaced persons scattered throughout Georgia\ncontinues to weigh heavily on the entire country and\nconstitutes another major factor in Georgia\u2019s inability to\nengage fully in the process of consolidating, rebuilding and\nmoving the nation forward.\nA fair settlement of the conflict in Abkhazia is made\nup of two equally important aspects: the unconditional\nreturn of the displaced persons to their homes and the\ndefinition of the political status of Abkhazia within a\nunified Georgia. This is not somebody\u2019s wish, it is not even\nsolely a matter of principle; this is a fact of life, and one\nthat will be implemented, sooner or later.\nDespite the bitter experience of repeated treachery, the\nGeorgian Government has never attempted, or threatened to\nresort to military force in order to solve this problem. We\nhave always been committed to the peaceful and negotiated\nresolution of the conflict. It is extremely difficult, however,\nto carry on peaceful negotiations with a party that resorts to\nblatant \u201cethnic cleansing\u201d and genocide as a means of\nconsolidating its ill-gotten gains.\nMoreover, the Abkhaz side has recently gone so far as\nto practically stall the negotiating process by demonstrating\nmore than their usual intransigence. It is obvious that the\nseparatist regime is determined to make no compromises,\nand prefers to maintain the status quo in the zone of\nconflict. Each round of negotiations has proved that the\nAbkhazian separatists seek to win time, while pretending\nthat they are committed to a negotiated settlement of the\nconflict.\nThe separatist leadership is impatiently awaiting\nparliamentary and presidential elections in Russia. They\nattach great importance to the results, assuming that they\nwill bring about a revision of policy priorities there towards\na more pro-Abkhaz orientation.\nSuch is the nature of \u201caggressive separatism\u201d, which\npursues its dark schemes with little regard for law,\ninternational public opinion, or elementary norms of human\ndecency.\n\u201cAggressive separatism\u201d is a relatively new\nphenomenon which emerged on the ruins of the\ncommunist system and is being nurtured by various\npolitical forces. The peculiarity of \u201cAbkhaz separatism\u201d\nlies in its seeming usefulness for the larger political aims\nof these forces. This fact makes it possible for a minority\nof the population of an autonomous republic to drive out\nthe majority indigenous population of the land by force.\nThis aspect of \u201caggressive separatism\u201d, making it a\ntool in larger political schemes, has international\nramifications and represents a danger for world security\nas a whole.\nThe special role and possibilities of Russia in\nbringing about the resolution of the Abkhazian conflict\nare recognized by all, not least by relevant United Nations\ndocuments. Some recent developments encourage us to\nhope that Russia may finally decide to use this potential\nin order to bring about a comprehensive settlement of this\nproblem.\nThe international community has applied much effort\nto promoting a peaceful, fair solution to the conflict in\nAbkhazia. In the past two years the Security Council\nalone has adopted 13 resolutions on Abkhazia. One\nhundred and thirty six United Nations military observers\nare situated in the conflict zone. The Secretary-General\u2019s\nSpecial Envoy has undertaken numerous trips to the area\nand has consulted repeatedly with all the parties.\nIn December 1994 the Organization for Security and\nCooperation in Europe (OCSE) adopted a Declaration at\nits Budapest summit in which the participating States\nexpressed their deep concern over \u201cethnic cleansing\u201d,\n\u201cmassive deportation of the population\u201d and \u201cnumerous\ndeaths of innocent civilians\u201d, having included these\nspecific terms in the declaration.\nAdd to this several declarations and statements\nadopted at CIS summits in Almaty and Minsk, which\ndenounce any form of separatism. Member States of the\nCIS assumed the obligation not to support in any form or\nmanner separatist movements and regimes on the\nterritories of other countries, and not to establish political,\neconomic and other relations with them. Neither would\nthey provide their territory and communications facilities\nfor use by separatists, nor render them economic,\nfinancial, military or any other kind of assistance.\nAt the CIS summit in Minsk the mandate of the\npeace-keeping forces in Georgia was expanded to include\n20\n\n\nwider rights in order to facilitate the orderly return of\ndisplaced persons and protect vitally important structures.\nThe mere enumeration of all these measures and\nactivities would seem to indicate that sufficient political and\nlegal foundation has been created to finally resolve this\nfestering crisis. However, the displaced persons are still\nwaiting to return to their homes, there continue to be no\nguarantees of a secure life and normal living conditions,\nand the separatist leaders in Abkhazia persist in their aim\nof turning Abkhazia into a land uninhabited by Georgians.\nShould we regard all the above-mentioned resolutions,\ndecisions and statements as futile efforts that carry little\nbeyond moral support? Or consider that the adoption of\nSecurity Council resolutions and their implementation are\ntwo separate and unconnected acts?\nI recall an emotional intervention by the Permanent\nRepresentative of the Czech Republic, Ambassador\nKovanda, at one of the Security Council meetings, in which\nhe suggested that the time had finally come to \u201ccall a spade\na spade\u201d. As I have mentioned, this was done in the OSCE\nDeclaration in Budapest last year, but this has yet to appear\nin any United Nations document on the situation in\nGeorgia.\nAlso, the process of enforcing the implementation of\nthe provisions of adopted documents is slack and, with very\nfew exceptions, brings no results. I realize that I am\ntouching on some sore points in United Nations activities,\nbut the lack of movement on the Abkhazian conflict\ncompels us to present the undisguised truth and begin the\ntransformation from words to deeds.\nIn this regard, I should like to present some\nsuggestions which, we believe, could contribute to the\neffectiveness of both the words and of the actions of the\nUnited Nations.\nIn our view, the resolutions emanating from the United\nNations, as well as from other international organizations,\nmust clearly assign personal responsibility to individual\npersons, organizations or regimes, guilty of disrupting the\nprocess of the peaceful resolution of conflicts. They should\nclearly state that these actions will inevitably entail\nadequate punitive measures.\nFirst among them should be an introduction of severe\neconomic and other sanctions according to Articles 41 and\n42 of Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations. The\nspecific form of sanctions intended for the territories under\nthe control of criminals should also be defined clearly at\nthe outset, as well as the fact that the population of these\nterritories will be entitled to receive only humanitarian aid\nunder strict international control. The case of Abkhazia is\na relevant example. The Georgian Government has\ninformation indicating that weapons and heavy armaments\nare being stockpiled in some areas of the territory under\nthe control of the United Nations Observer Mission and\nthe CIS peace-keepers. The systematic commuting of\nships between Abkhazian ports and regional States with\nthe intention of supplying criminal gangs, the free\nmovement of foreign nationals and the illegal operation of\ncommercial entities cannot be tolerated either.\nSecondly, during its history, the United Nations has\nnot been energetic enough in taking compulsory measures\nagainst violators of international peace and stability. In a\nrecent document devoted to the fiftieth anniversary of the\nUnited Nations, the Secretary-General describes such an\napproach as desirable in principle and enumerates the\npositive and negative aspects of entrusting this task to the\nMember States. Much room exists also with regard to the\npossibility of achieving the same objective by regional\norganizations, especially at a time when the coordination\nof action between international organizations has acquired\nmore and more importance. Cooperation between the\nUnited Nations Observer Mission in Georgia and the CIS\npeace-keeping force, as an example, could benefit from\nsome additional elements.\nWith regard to this, I would like to point out that the\nestablishment of a permanent representation of the CIS at\nUnited Nations Headquarters, headed by a dynamic and\nexperienced diplomat, would be highly beneficial and\ndesirable.\nThirdly, we consider the establishment and operation\nof the international criminal court a priority. The United\nNations would be contributing greatly to promoting\ninternational law and justice and the court could quickly\ndevelop into a potent tool of preventive diplomacy, which\nin itself would be a major factor reinforcing international\nstability.\nMore often than not we are reduced to dealing with\nthe effect, rather than the cause, of events. In other\nwords, we put much less stock in United Nations\npreventive diplomacy than is prudent or practical. In the\ncase of the Abkhazian conflict, this point, naturally, has\nno practical significance any longer, but conclusions can\nbe drawn from it that would be relevant for the future.\nPreventive diplomacy must have real mechanisms and\n21\n\n\nlevers which would enable the international community to\nimpose its will, rather than expose the futility of its\ninitiatives.\nIn my intervention at the meeting of the Security\nCouncil on 12 May 1995, I requested an expansion of the\nfunctions of the United Nations observers in order to\naccelerate the repatriation of refugees. We felt that it was\nimportant to register and control the breaches of human\nrights. This would deter lawbreakers and keep the\ninternational community better informed about the situation\nin the region. Since military observers would be\ninappropriate for this type of specialized work, we\nsuggested the establishment of a small team of competent\nprofessionals working alongside the observers to undertake\nthis mission. The Government of the Republic of Georgia\nwelcomed the decision to establish such a human rights\nmonitoring mission in Abkhazia, Republic of Georgia, as\nwell as its objectives, as presented in the\nSecretary-General\u2019s report of 7 August 1995.\nI should like to take this opportunity also to convey\nour satisfaction with the decision of the Secretary-General\nto appoint a deputy to his Special Envoy, who would be\nresident in Georgia and would thus provide a continuous\npresence at a senior political level.\nI have another suggestion of a more administrative\nnature. I know that I am expressing the opinion of a\nnumber of newly independent States in requesting that some\nmechanism be found to allow the hiring of representatives\nof these States by organizations and programmes of the\nUnited Nations system \u2014 primarily, the United Nations\nDevelopment Programme and the United Nations Children\u2019s\nFund, as well as others. The problem lies in the fact that\nmost programmes and organizations have instituted a hiring\nfreeze, which came into effect before the newly\nindependent States became independent. So, in reality, this\nhiring freeze, as necessary and as useful as it may be from\nthe point of view of internal administration, represents for\nour States a roadblock to the normal representation of its\ncitizens. We would be very grateful if such a mechanism\ncould be found.\nThree years have passed since the Head of State of the\nRepublic of Georgia, Mr. Eduard Shevardnadze, laid out a\nset of very sensitive points at the forty-seventh session of\nthe General Assembly. The creation of a global monitoring\nsystem for the early prevention of potential conflicts; the\nestablishment of special units of Blue Helmets, after the\nexample of Interpol teams, in order to control and combat\nthe flow of conventional weapons; and the establishment of\na rapid reaction force were among the proposals. The\nproblems that prompted him to make these suggestions\nhave, unfortunately, grown more acute today and need to\nbe urgently addressed. We are aware of the many\ndifficulties in implementing some of these measures, not\nleast the financial difficulty, but the costs inevitably grow\nastronomically when problems are left to fester.\nRecently a forum was held in Tbilisi under the\nauspices of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and\nCultural Organization, entitled \u201cSolidarity Against\nIntolerance, For Dialogue Between Cultures\u201d. It was held\nin the framework of the Year for Tolerance declared by\nthe United Nations. The main aim of the forum was to\nfind ways out of the situation in which the countries\ninfected by the virus of intolerance had found themselves.\nIt is symbolic that Georgia, a country known historically\nfor its tolerance, hosted the forum. I am sure that\neveryone shares the opinion expressed in Tbilisi, that\n\u201cwe cannot afford to overlook intolerance, since\nindifference and complacency equal complicity\u201d.\nThe contribution of the United Nations to the\nprocess of maintaining international peace and stability is\nenormous. And yet numerous open wounds remain in the\nworld. Conventional wisdom would hold the United\nNations solely responsible for not being able to close\nthem. There are, however, deeper reasons for this.\nAt the root of the problem of the United Nations\nineffectiveness, we see the current situation in the world.\nThe system of coordinates into which the United Nations\nwas born 50 years ago has been drastically and\nprecipitously altered by the rapid disintegration of the\nbipolar world and the emergence of new\ninterrelationships, new problems and new threats to world\nsecurity, as well as to the security of individual Member\nStates. In this situation it is all of us Member States,\nexpressing the collective will of the United Nations, that\nneed to determine what kind of United Nations we would\nlike to see at the turn of the century and, indeed, in the\nnext 50 years, and what means we would be prepared to\nprovide to the United Nations in order for it to be\neffective in the new situation.\nAs the representative of one of the many nations\ncaught up in the vortex of these changes, I am confident\nthat I express the opinion of all Georgians when I say that\nmy country looks upon the United Nations both with\ndisappointment, for the failure to contribute meaningfully\nto resolving some of our most burning problems, but also\n22\n\n\nwith hope and optimism that the United Nations will finally\nbring itself into conformity with the changes in the world\nand find the resolve and the means to impose its will and\ninternational law.\nThis hope is based on the fact that the United Nations\nis at its half-century mark and regards this not only as a\ntime for celebration and commemoration, but, more\nimportantly, as a time for stock-taking and mapping out its\nfuture activities, in order to be able to rise to the challenges\nof the next 50 years and of the twenty-first century.\n"

        "file_text": "At the outset, in addressing this distinguished Assembly, I\nshould like to express to you, Mr. President, our sincere\ncongratulations on your election to conduct the proceedings\nof this fiftieth session of the General Assembly. We are\nassured that with your qualities as a statesman and your\ndiplomatic skills, we shall achieve very constructive results\nfor the well-being of the international community,\nespecially at this most important time when we are\ncommemorating the fiftieth year of the existence of the\nUnited Nations.\nWe should also like to congratulate His Excellency,\nMr. Amara Essy, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of\nC\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, for the excellent work that he carried out\nas President of the General Assembly at its forty-ninth\nsession.\nIt is both a timely moment and a pleasure to\nhighlight the extraordinary and indefatigable performance\nof the Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, at\nthe helm of the United Nations. He has demonstrated\noutstanding leadership, dynamism and innovative skill in\nimproving and strengthening the Organization\u2019s capacity\nfor action in fulfilment of the provisions of the Charter\nand of efforts to find solutions for the diverse and\ncomplex situations which have faced the Organization.\nWe would like to reaffirm our special gratitude to\nthe Secretary-General for his ongoing support in the\nprocess of consolidating and strengthening democracy in\nEl Salvador.\nThe current session of the General Assembly is\nparticularly important in the historical development of the\nUnited Nations, not only because we are celebrating the\nfiftieth anniversary of the creation of an exceptional\ninstitution of universal scope, which was established to\nanalyse, debate and seek solutions to problems of\ncommon concern to mankind, but also because current\ncircumstances lend themselves to reflection regarding the\nfuture of our Organization.\n\n\nIndeed, we have at this time a unique opportunity to\nreaffirm our commitment and our political will to\nstrengthen the role of the Organization, to enhance its\neffectiveness in achieving the ideals on which it was\nfounded, to bring to fruition the aspirations of our peoples,\nand to preserve the right of future generations to live in\npeace, progress and freedom.\nUndeniably, this is a year for reflection, one which\nwill enable us to assess carefully a half-century of\ndevelopment and experience acquired in addressing global\nissues through joint efforts and collective measures on a\nmultilateral basis, taking into account not only the\nachievements but also the set-backs, with a view to further\nperfecting this human endeavour.\nThe work of the United Nations, as a part of the\ninternational system established in the wake of the Second\nWorld War, reflected the antagonistic nature of international\nrelations during the cold-war period, which generated\ntension and insecurity for nations, unleashing an unbridled\narms race and the threat of a nuclear conflict between the\nsuper-Powers. This was no doubt a key factor in shaping,\nand limiting, the work of the Organization.\nAs we make our assessment, we must acknowledge\nthat since 1945, despite the existence of the cold war, the\nUnited Nations has achieved much, inter alia, in the\nfollowing spheres: fulfilling its mission to establish and\nmaintain international peace and security, containing local\nconflicts in various regions from spreading and at the same\ntime creating a safety valve for East-West tensions, which\nprevented a political and ideological conflict from\ndegenerating into a widespread confrontation or into nuclear\nwarfare.\nAnother achievement, in accordance with the Charter,\nwas the decolonization process by which many Asian and\nAfrican countries, and some on the American continent,\ngained independence and joined the community of nations,\nthus enriching the Organization by their experience and\ncontributions.\nIn this regard, the United Nations has also helped to\nfoster international cooperation. To this end, an institutional\ninfrastructure was developed to promote economic and\nsocial development for our peoples through the\nestablishment of a new international economic order, one\nthat would generate more favourable conditions and\nopportunities for the developing countries to make progress,\nthus setting in motion a process of evening out the major\nimbalances between North and South.\nWhile these efforts contributed to improving social\nconditions in the poorest countries and in countries that\nhad recently gained independence, certain perceptions and\nattitudes led to a development crisis in the 1980s,\ncurtailing the activities of the United Nations system in\nthe least developed countries.\nTurning to the realm of human rights, considerable\nprogress was made, beginning with the signing of the\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights on 10 December\n1948 and the adoption of a host of international\ninstruments, declarations, plans of action and institutional\nmachinery for the promotion and monitoring of\ninternational commitments on the part of States. These\ninclude the promotion of the development of women, the\nrights of children, the handicapped, minority groups,\nindigenous peoples and migrant workers, and, in\nparticular, a commitment to the struggle to eliminate\nracial discrimination in South Africa, which culminated in\n1994 with the establishment of a democratic and\nmultiracial system in that country.\nIn the field of international law, outstanding progress\nwas made in the drawing up and codification of\ninternational standards, in particular those conducive to\nfriendly relations among peoples and to the peaceful\nresolution of conflicts.\nThe thoroughgoing changes in the world order that\nled to the end of the cold war are giving rise to the\nexpectation of more favourable conditions for the\npromotion of peace, cooperation and international\nsecurity. None the less, reality has shown that these\naspirations have not been met and that, on the contrary,\nchanges in the international system created conditions that\nhave unleashed forces that had long been held in check,\ngiving rise to new conflicts and rivalries, not only as a\nresult of resurgent nationalism but also as a cause of\nserious ethnic, religious, social and cultural differences\nwhich have jeopardized peace and international security.\nIn this context, we are convinced that at the present\ntime finding solutions to age-old and new challenges is\nbeyond the capacity of any one State or group of States.\nThis has generated new requirements in the global\npolitical area, requiring to resort more and more\nfrequently to combined efforts and action. The very\ndynamics and requirements of this process have in turn\nincreased the tasks and responsibilities that fall to the\nUnited Nations.\n2\n\n\nFor this reason we must provide unwavering support\nto the efforts of the United Nations to fulfil its role, not\nonly in the political sphere but also in the economic and\nsocial areas, particularly through innovations and new\nperceptions in peace-keeping and the promotion of\ndevelopment.\nRegarding efforts at global peace-keeping, it is\nimportant to note the new dimension of these peace-keeping\noperations, whose action transcends the military aspects,\nmoving into multidisciplinary activities that include\npolitical, economic, social and humanitarian endeavours.\nAs regards development, we welcome the fact that\nmore attention has been paid to economic, social and\nenvironmental issues, with an understanding that their\nsolution requires coming to grips with, and attempting to\nfind solutions to, the causes of tensions, instability and\nconflicts with greater political will. As such tensions can go\nbeyond the very borders of nation States, we must lend our\nsupport to an integrated approach, for only in this way can\nwe consolidate peace, security and democracy, both\nnationally and internationally.\nProof of the will to improve the well-being of nations\nand assist in their progress can be seen in the major summit\nconferences that have been held, as well as in the\nformulation of the Secretary-General\u2019s development\nprogramme. These efforts serve as examples of a new\nglobal vision to achieve a consensus on policies and\nstrategies to promote sustainable human development. None\nthe less, we cannot but be concerned at the statements made\nby the donor community regarding the drying up of funds\nfor development. This is certainly against the general\nexpectation of support for the development of our peoples.\nToday, the United Nations has different, and more\ncomplex, responsibilities than those it had in a bipolar\nworld. Although the purposes and principles that inspired\nthe United Nations at its inception still remain valid, none\nthe less political situations and the complexity and\nmagnitude of the challenges we face require clear and\ninnovative responses.\nIn the face of these challenges we must be both\ndetermined and prudent, resolved to be advocates of\nchange, learning from positive experiences and willing to\nreplace those outmoded practices that impede the smooth\nfunctioning of the Organization.\nWe believe that the modernization of the United\nNations should be carried out through a comprehensive\nprocess of an integrated nature which would reflect a\nconsensus deriving from the common interests and shared\nresponsibilities of the international community.\nIn this respect, we believe that there should be a\nmore dynamic, better-coordinated relationship between the\nGeneral Assembly, the Security Council and the\nEconomic and Social Council, one which requires, as the\nSecretary-General himself stated, \u201cthe determination and\nthe full commitment of all Member States\u201d. The\nindustrialized countries bear a special responsibility in this\ntask, given that with their capabilities and resources they\ncan provide the Organization with a broad and assured\nfinancial base which will make it possible to enhance its\neffectiveness in every sphere.\nIn this connection, we urge the Heads of State and\nGovernment of the seven industrialized Powers to put into\npractice the statement of intention they made at the\ntwenty-first Economic Summit, held in Halifax, Canada,\nin June 1995. We call on those countries, along with\nothers, to implement a new strategy for international\ncooperation in order to rise to the challenges of the\ntwenty-first century.\nThe reform of the Security Council falls within the\nprocess of change in the Organization. We support the\nidea that the Council should adjust to the new\ninternational structure, not only regarding the number of\nits members but also regarding its methods and\nprocedures of decision-making.\nThe Government of El Salvador supports an increase\nin the membership of the Security Council on a rational\nbasis which will make its more truly representative and,\nas a result, afford greater opportunities for participation\nby all Member States, without in any way undermining\nthe efficient implementation of the tasks assigned to this\nimportant body by the Charter.\nFurthermore, we support all those nations which\naspire with legitimate right to becoming Members of the\nUnited Nations and invoke the principle of universality\nenshrined in the Charter of the Organization, without\ntaking into consideration ideological aspects or the\ninterests of States which carry greater political weight in\nthe concert of nations. In this respect we share the views\nexpressed by you, Mr. President, when in your opening\naddress to this session of the General Assembly you said\nthat\n3\n\n\n\u201call States that are not yet Members should seek to be\nadmitted in the near future\u201d (Official Records of the\nGeneral Assembly, Fiftieth Session, Plenary Meetings,\n1st meeting, p.22)\nI should now like to refer to some specific issues that\nare of particular importance in the international political\narena.\nWith respect to nuclear disarmament we support full\ncompliance with the commitments contained in the Treaty\non the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), which\nwas extended indefinitely last May. We are convinced that\nthis constitutes a major step towards the strengthening of\nthe control system for nuclear non-proliferation and the\ntotal elimination of nuclear weapons.\nWe are fully convinced that preventive diplomacy in\nits various manifestations is the appropriate instrument for\ndeterrence and the limitation of potential conflicts. In this\nrespect we concur with the statement by the Secretary-\nGeneral in his latest report presented to the General\nAssembly that\n\u201cit is ... better to prevent conflicts ... than to undertake\nmajor politico-military efforts to resolve conflicts once\nthey have broken out\u201d. (A/50/l, para. 585)\nWe support his efforts to enable the United Nations to carry\nout a constructive and timely role so as to avoid or mitigate\nthe destructive effects of crises.\nI should now like to express a regional point of view\nand note with satisfaction that Central America has moved\nfrom an era of confrontation to one of cooperation. We are\nnow embarking on a stage of constructive achievements\nwhich has enabled us to move forward in our quest to\nconsolidate a region of peace, freedom, democracy and\ndevelopment. This new stage results from our having\nassumed our historical responsibility with determination,\ngiven the legitimate aspirations of our peoples, who\nclamored for peace and the democratization of our societies.\nWith the assistance and solidarity of the United Nations and\nthe international community we are achieving these\nobjectives, which will be completed when the process under\nway in Guatemala concludes with a firm and lasting peace\nagreement, which has the decisive support of our\nGovernments.\nNow that we have made significant headway in the\npolitical sphere we are focusing our efforts on the social\nsphere as an indispensable ingredient, in the conviction that\npeace, democracy and development are essential\ncomponents for the flourishing of our society.\nGiven this undeniable reality, the Central American\nPresidents have been meeting together to exchange ideas\nand experiences so that jointly, with a sense of solidarity\nand coordination, we can rise to meet the ever-more-\ncomplex challenges that face us as a result of the process\nof political, economic, social and environmental\nglobalization which characterizes the new world order. An\nexample of this was the signing of the Treaty on Central\nAmerican social integration, which took place at the\npresidential summit held at the beginning of this year in\nthe city of San Salvador.\nMoreover, we are pleased to inform the Assembly\nthat in the past 12 months we have held meetings at the\nhighest level in Guacimo, Costa Rica; in Masaya,\nNicaragua; in Tegucigalpa, Honduras; and in San\nSalvador, the capital of my own country, during which we\nadopted critical decisions for the future of our peoples.\nWe defined our priorities in a new regional agenda which\nwas given concrete expression by the signing of the\nalliance for sustainable development. This embodies both\na strategy and a coordination of interests and\nresponsibilities with legal harmonization and emphasis on\ninvestment in the social sphere, as we recognize that\nhuman beings are the pivotal point and the principal\nsubject of development.\nThe breadth and magnitude of the objectives spelled\nout in the new strategy for development exceed the\ncapacities and resources of our countries, and we believe\nthat the international community can contribute\ngenerously towards bringing these strategies to fruition.\nIn this context we ascribe particular importance to\nthe strengthening of the newly revamped Central\nAmerican Integration System (SICA) which has assumed\nas one of its main responsibilities the promotion and\nimplementation of the new Central American agenda.\nMay we urge the Assembly to extend the observer status\nwe have applied for to this new organization, SICA.\nWe can affirm that Central America has now entered\na new era in its history characterized by ongoing\ncooperation among our countries, as reflected in our\nefforts to create the conditions which will overcome the\nobstacles which have done such damage to the cause of\nintegration, so that we can move forward steadfastly\ntowards the unification of Central America.\n4\n\n\nIn this connection we are particularly pleased at the\nrecent progress made during the binational Honduras/El\nSalvador Commission meeting with a view to complying\nwith the border demarcation arrangements guaranteeing the\nrights of the inhabitants of the border zones on both sides\nsimultaneously.\nIn the specific case of my own country we can give a\ncategorical assurance that in the three years since the\nsigning of the peace agreements, El Salvador has moved\nforward in a constructive way. The commitment of the\nGovernment is firm and unswerving in its determination to\nharness the requisite strength to build a new country, a\nmodern, democratic El Salvador, in which all the sectors of\nSalvadorian society will participate without discrimination.\nAfter more than a year at the helm I am pleased to\nstate that my Government is fulfilling the promises\ncontained in the inaugural address which I delivered to the\nSalvadorian people on 1 June 1994. We have been duly\nfollowing up the peace agreements conceived by the entire\nnation as a commitment and as an essential prerequisite for\nmoving forward without any possibility of backsliding as\nwe build a peaceful society.\nDuring the period of transition from war to peace and\nnational reconstruction we have devoted ourselves to\nconsolidating the pacification process in the conviction that\nthat is a task that must be shared in a responsible manner\namong the entire population. That task involves not only\nfinding a solution to the immediate problems created by 12\nyears of armed confrontation, but in addition, providing a\ncomprehensive response to domestic problems, for only\nthus can we guarantee that the process will be irreversible\nand capable of meeting future challenges in a society of\nstability and peace.\nConcerning pending commitments under the Peace\nAgreements, we acknowledge realistically and in a\nconstructive spirit that there have been problems, and hence\ndelays, in complying with some of those provisions as a\nresult of the highly complex nature of the process. Those\ndifficulties have been overcome through dialogue and\nconsensus among the sectors responsible for\nimplementation. This has enabled us, with the assistance of\nthe United Nations Observer Mission in El Salvador, to\nalter the established time-tables and to agree on a work\nprogramme for the definitive completion of those\ncommitments.\nWe can affirm that we are complying in a responsible\nmanner with the implementation of the Agreements, but if\nfor logistical reasons some components were still to be\npending on 31 October next, given that our determination\nto comply with those commitments remains steadfast we\nwould request the Secretary-General to extend the residual\nUnited Nations Mission in El Salvador.\nOur responsibility as a Government goes beyond\ncompliance with the Peace Agreements, for we must\nprovide a comprehensive response to our national\nproblems. Hence, with an awareness that lack of\nopportunity in our society leads to frustration and despair,\ncreating tensions and conflicts that jeopardize the peace\nprocess, we have made additional efforts to implement an\nambitious economic plan to develop our society, taking as\nour goals the betterment of human welfare, the systematic\nalleviation of poverty, and priority attention to health and\neducation, in addition to promoting productive\nemployment and generally meeting the basic needs of the\npopulation, especially its most vulnerable sectors that\nhave traditionally been denied the fruits of economic and\nsocial progress.\nWe are pleased to report that our Government has\nassigned the highest priority to the maintenance of\nmacroeconomic stability through the implementation of a\nconsistent and coherent set of monetary, exchange-rate\nand fiscal policies. This has enabled us to achieve specific\neconomic targets, namely, the maintenance of a stable\nexchange rate, the reining in of inflation, the elimination\nof our fiscal deficit and the reduction of public\nexpenditure, which has been redirected to social\ninvestment and basic infrastructure.\nOur Government is fully convinced that if we are to\nenjoy sustained medium- and long-term growth it must be\nbased on an efficient and competitive productive sector,\nboth domestically and internationally, and to that end we\nhave adopted the requisite economic policy measures.\nAmong these I would mention in particular the\nprogramme to reduce tariffs on the import of capital\ngoods, inputs and raw materials; support for further\ndevelopment of the Central American Common Market;\nthe creation of instruments to facilitate and provide\nguarantees to foreign investors; decisive support for\nprogrammes to enhance the competitiveness of the\ndomestic production base; the promotion of small and\nmicro enterprises; the development of intensive job-\ntraining programmes; and the implementation of our\nnational environment strategy as a component of\nsustainable development in El Salvador.\n5\n\n\nTo achieve those objectives the entire population of\nmy country is striving to overcome resentment and\nantagonisms between different social sectors and thereby\nhelping to foster the conditions for national stability with a\nview to consolidating peace, strengthening democracy and\nsecuring economic and social progress.\nThe successful example of El Salvador clearly\ndemonstrates that a Member State of the Organization,\nacting in good faith, with transparency and political will,\ncan overcome situations of severe conflict, principally\nthrough the efforts of its own population but also with the\ntimely assistance of the international community.\nToday, following this exceptional effort to achieve\npeace \u2014 an effort that is, indeed, still under way \u2014 El\nSalvador is a country that has learned major historical\nlesson. Foremost among them is the knowledge that within\nour national community we share a common destiny and\nthat within the international community all major\nundertakings are shared. Learning from those truths, the\nchallenge facing us all is to build a more human world for\nthe benefit of present and future generations.\n"

        "file_text": " Let me begin by congratulating\nyou, Sir, on your unanimous election as President of the\nGeneral Assembly at its fiftieth session. Our confidence in\nyour stewardship is further strengthened by your\ndistinguished career at home and, indeed, your\nunderstanding of international affairs. I should therefore like\nto assure you of my delegation\u2019s full support and\ncooperation as you carry out your important mandate.\nI should also like to pay tribute to your illustrious\npredecessor, His Excellency Mr. Amara Essy, for a job well\ndone. Indeed, he has honoured his country and, by\nextension, the entire African continent by succeeding in\ngiving the presidency of the General Assembly a new\nimage.\nAs for the Secretary-General of the Organization,\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, we can hardly thank him\nenough for his work, including the excellent arrangements\nmade for this session, which takes on particular importance\nthis year. The Secretary-General deserves commendation for\nall his commitment to development, social justice and\ninternational peace and security \u2014 objectives on the basis\nof which this Organization was founded.\nHaving said that, I should like to take this opportunity\nto welcome the one-hundred-eighty-fifth Member of the\nUnited Nations. Palau\u2019s recent admission is a true reflection\nof the universality of the Organization.\nIt is regrettable, though, that it has not been possible\nto discuss the readmission of the Republic of China on\nTaiwan on the basis of the same principle. Considering its\npopulation of 21 million and the fact that it is one of the\nworld\u2019s leading economies, my delegation sincerely\nbelieves that the Republic of China on Taiwan, readmitted\nas a full Member, would make significant contributions to\nthe work of the United Nations. It is hoped that such a\nmove would also facilitate the process of reunification.\nAbout the same time last year we informed this\nAssembly of the establishment of an Armed Forces\nProvisional Ruling Council and a new Government in the\nGambia, under the chairmanship of His Excellency\nCaptain Yahya A. J. J. Jammeh, following the military\ntakeover on 22 July 1994. The factors that compelled the\nArmy to take over the reins of power have already been\nexplained in sufficient detail. Prominent among the\nreasons was rampant corruption.\nIn this regard, let me inform the Assembly that the\nvarious commissions of inquiry established to probe the\nactivities of the former regime have so far made shocking\nrevelations about the degree of corruption and\nmismanagement that was the order of the day in the\nGambia during the last 30 years. The most devastating\nrevelation of all has been made by the Crude Oil\nCommission, which uncovered the embezzlement of\nmillions of dollars meant to finance development projects\nin the country.\nEqually breathtaking are the findings of the\nCommission concerning Government Departments and\nline Ministries. The work of the Public Assets and\nProperties Recovery Commission, also chaired by a\nSuperior Court Judge, is progressing steadily. Here again\nwhat has been unfolding leaves no reasonable doubt that\nthere was widespread abuse of public office under the\nprevious regime.\nMeanwhile, the Commission of Inquiry into Land\nAdministration is currently examining the evidence that it\nhas been gathering since its creation, and it will submit its\nreport soon. By all accounts, the findings so far of the\nCommission of Inquiry into the Financial Activities of\nPublic Corporations are also earth-moving.\nStrenuous efforts are being made to recover\neverything stolen. But the important thing is the lesson\ndrawn from all these Commissions, which, basically, is\nthat public office is essentially for the service of one\u2019s\ncountry, and not to be used as a vehicle for self-\nenrichment. Even members of the general public are now\nmore responsive to their tax obligations, as evidenced by\nthe record tax collections since the setting up of the\nCommissions to which I have referred. More important,\n11\nGeneral Assembly 22nd plenary meeting\nFiftieth session 13 October 1995\nthe principles of accountability, transparency and probity in\npublic life are gradually taking root in Gambian society.\nAll these facts speak for themselves, and we now\nunderstand why the Gambia is poorer today than it was at\nthe time of independence. The country\u2019s meagre resources,\nwhich should have been utilized for development purposes,\nwere grossly mismanaged \u2014 to say the least. This is why\nnot a single hospital or high school had been built after 30\nyears of independence. It was deliberate policy to keep our\npeople ignorant and, therefore, no serious attempt was made\nto build a television station or, at least, to improve the\nnational radio station so that it could be heard all over the\ncountry.\nCan this, in all honesty, be called democracy? And, to\nperpetuate themselves in power, the authorities of the\nformer regime brought in truck-loads of foreigners to vote\nfor them during elections. In the absence of an independent\nelectoral commission it was easy for them to indulge in\nsuch malpractice.\nThe Armed Forces Provisional Ruling Council\nGovernment has since adopted a Programme of\nRectification and Timetable for Transition to Democratic\nConstitutional Rule by July 1996. Mindful, however, of the\nfact that democracy and development are inextricably\nlinked, we have also drawn up a development agenda\nfocusing mainly on the social sectors. The two programmes,\ncontained in one document, were formally submitted to our\ntraditional partners-in-development for assistance. To our\ngreat surprise, however, and despite all the hullabaloo over\nthe need to speed up the democratization process, very little\nor no assistance at all was forthcoming to complement our\nnational efforts.\nDespite the fact that the Timetable was reduced from\nfour years to two years after nationwide consultation, the\nEuropean Union and its allies still maintain sanctions\nagainst the Government. None of the efforts made to\nimplement the various activities in the transition\nProgramme have been acknowledged by them. I am\nreferring to the Constitutional Review Commission, the\nCivic Education Programme, and the Electoral Law Review\nCommittee. Our traditional partners in development all\nreneged on their promises. This unfounded scepticism has\nnot deterred us from forging ahead with our plans to build\na new society. That is why we have decided to finance the\noperations of some of these activities to demonstrate our\ncommitment to the transition Programme.\n\nAs a serious-minded Government we cannot abdicate\nour responsibility, or our duty, towards our people. It is\nfor that reason that two high schools and three junior\nsecondary schools are being built. They should be ready\nwithin the next few weeks.\nPlans are also well under way to build at least a\nthird referral hospital. In addition to the building of\nschools our national education policy is currently under\nreview with the aim of making education more accessible\nto all, notably to girls, and tailored to suit our national\ndevelopment objectives. Recently, too, we have embarked\non the building of a university. All these efforts clearly\ndemonstrate once more the importance attached to the\ndevelopment of human resources. This, we are convinced,\nwill rescue our people from the darkness of ignorance,\nilliteracy and deprivation.\nIn the area of infrastructural development, not only\nare roads being built, but His Excellency the Chairman of\nthe Armed Forces Provisional Ruling Council and Head\nof State recently laid the foundation-stone for the new\nBanjul International Airport complex. In fact, work has\ncommenced on this project, which is on a turn-key basis.\nAs agriculture is the backbone of the economy, the\nArmed Forces Provisional Ruling Council Government is\ngiving this sector all the attention that it deserves. That is\nin line with our thinking that a nation that cannot feed\nitself can hardly be called independent. A hungry nation\ncannot concentrate on nation-building. Besides, food is\nused as a weapon.\nIt is said that the youth of today are the future\nleaders of tomorrow. Guided by this adage and the\nprinciple of good citizenry, the Armed Forces Provisional\nRuling Council has introduced a National Youth Service\nScheme, the basic purpose of which is to inculcate\ndiscipline and to reorient the thinking of Gambian youth\ntowards nation-building while harnessing their potential\nfor future adult life. The first group of volunteers will be\nsworn in in the new year.\nIt may be said without fear of contradiction that\nGambians have now become more aware of their rights\nand duties and that for the first time in many years they\nface the future with renewed hope and confidence. On\nthat fateful Friday of 22 July 1994, His Excellency the\nChairman of the Armed Forces Provisional Ruling\n12\nGeneral Assembly 22nd plenary meeting\nFiftieth session 13 October 1995\nCouncil, Captain Yahya A. J. J. Jammeh, woke a nation\nthat had been slumbering for 30 years with a new vision to\ntransform the Gambia into a highly developed model\ncountry. In this way the Government will have bequeathed\nto the present and future generations a legacy worthy of all\nthe sacrifices that are being made today.\nHistory teaches us that once in a while at some point\nin a country\u2019s history a visionary leader will emerge with\na mission to transform that society for the better. We in the\nGambia are fortunate that in the hour of need, His\nExcellency Captain Yahya A. J. J. Jammeh, a soldier with\na difference, took centre stage, and now provides the\nquality of leadership commensurate with the challenges of\nthe times. Since the advent of the Armed Forces Provisional\nRuling Council to power under Chairman Jammeh\u2019s\nguidance we have learned within a short period of time\nwhat effective leadership means, and have come to the\nconclusion that there is no gainsaying that a leadership with\nvision always has the nation\u2019s interests at heart.\nSimilarly, at the international level when the world\u2019s\nleadership is characterized by statesmen with a vision, the\ncollective interests of mankind always have primacy over\nother considerations emanating from narrow-minded\nnationalism. As great minds think alike, and as a bitter\nlesson had been learned from two world wars, the need was\nfelt to create the United Nations. It is interesting to note\nthat in the Preamble to the Charter we do not find the usual\nphrases that appear in other international legal instruments,\nsuch as \u201cWe the contracting parties\u201d but instead we have\nthe words\n\u201cWe the peoples of the United Nations\u201d.\nThe concept of international solidarity and the unity of the\nhuman race immediately come into play with the expressed\ndetermination not only\n\u201cto save succeeding generations from the scourge of\nwar\u201d\nbut also\n\u201cto employ international machinery for the promotion\nof the economic and social advancement of all\npeoples\u201d.\nIt is in this spirit that my delegation views the World\nSummit for Social Development held in Copenhagen last\nMarch as a significant turning-point in the international\ncommunity\u2019s persistent efforts to improve the quality of life\nof peoples all over the world. The Summit, including the\nnon-governmental organizations forum, facilitated a\nbroader exchange of views by the international\ncommunity on social development issues, with emphasis\non poverty alleviation, the generation of employment, and\nhealth care.\nThe adoption of the Copenhagen Declaration on\nSocial Development and Programme of Action conveys\nour collective concern over the world\u2019s social ills and\nindeed the commitment to a concerted effort to find\nviable solutions to these problems.\nOf particular relevance to my delegation are the\ncommitments made by the said forum concerning the\nsocio-economic development of Africa, and of the least-\ndeveloped countries in particular, and the provision of the\nnecessary financial and other resources. These\ncommitments should serve as the basis for Africa\u2019s\nsustained economic and social development.\nThe political will and resources necessary for the\neffective implementation of the Programme of Action of\nthe World Summit for Social Development should be\ndemonstrated not only in the full application of the 20/20\ninitiative but also the channelling of substantial\ntechnological, scientific and other resources aimed at\nachieving our objectives.\nThe Fourth World Conference on Women held in\nBeijing, which has just ended, highlighted gender equality\nand gender needs, including the participation of women\nin the economic and political decision-making process, the\nelimination of all forms of discrimination and violence\nagainst women, adequate recognition and support of the\ncontribution of women to the management of natural\nresources and the safeguarding of the environment.\nIndeed, as ably stated by the Secretary-General of the\nUnited Nations:\n\u201cThe empowerment of women is the empowerment\nof all humanity!\u201d (Press Release SG/SM/5732)\nThe Platform for Action, which focuses on the role\nof women in development, should provide important\nguidelines for realizing the goals that we have set. In the\nGambia, women have been playing an indispensable role\nin national development. Today 4 out of 14 Ministers are\nwomen, responsible for important sectors such as health\nand social welfare, education, youth and sports, and\ntourism and culture. Our participation in the World\nConference with our First Lady as Head of Delegation\n13\nGeneral Assembly 22nd plenary meeting\nFiftieth session 13 October 1995\nwas inspired by the Government\u2019s commitment to women\u2019s\nissues, including gender equality and the encouragement of\nwomen to participate in national development.\nIt goes without saying that women and children\nconstitute the most vulnerable group in society, and we will\nnot be doing justice to our children if we do not renew the\ncommitments made during the World Summit for Children\nand acknowledge the preponderant role played by the\nUnited Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) in mapping out\nstrategies for the greater welfare of children all over the\nworld. We in the Gambia have made considerable progress\nin the implementation of the mid-term decade goals,\nnotably in the area of the Expanded Programme on\nImmunization.\nAt this juncture, my delegation would like to pay\ntribute to the memory of the late James P. Grant, the\nformer Executive Director of UNICEF, for his outstanding\nperformance in increasing international public awareness of\nthe plight of children and his total dedication to the cause\nof children the world over. It is our fervent hope that the\nnew Executive Director will build on the achievements of\nher predecessor.\nAn issue related to the question of women and\nchildren is population and development. It will be recalled\nthat at the International Conference on Population and\nDevelopment, held in Cairo in September 1994, far-\nreaching decisions were taken, as outlined in the\nProgramme of Action that was adopted. What is important\nhere is that what should be done at the national level should\nbe complemented by a concerted international effort, as\nagreed in Cairo.\nThe interrelationship between population and the\nenvironment cannot be overemphasized. In fact, in the\nProgramme of Action adopted at the International\nConference on Population and Development, it is stated that\n\u201cPressure on the environment may result from\nrapid population growth, distribution and migration,\nespecially in ecologically vulnerable ecosystems.\nUrbanization and policies that do not recognize the\nneed for rural development also create environmental\nproblems.\u201d (A/CONF.171/13/Rev.1, annex, chapter III,\nsection C, para. 3.26)\nIn this regard, it is gratifying to note that following the\nUnited Nations Conference on Environment and\nDevelopment, held in Rio de Janeiro in June 1992, it has\nbeen possible, under Agenda 21, to successfully conclude\nthe Convention to Combat Desertification in those\nCountries Experiencing Serious Drought and/or\nDesertification, Particularly in Africa.\nIn the same vein, we are mindful of the needs of our\npeoples for better living standards and improvement of\nthe rural and urban environment through the provision of\nadequate shelter and sustainable human settlements. My\ndelegation therefore anxiously looks forward to the\nSecond United Nations Conference on Human Settlements\n(Habitat II), to be held in Istanbul, Turkey, in June next\nyear.\nAll these world conferences on various issues of\nconcern to the international community should be seen as\nour collective endeavour to give concrete expression to\nthe pledge enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations\n\u201cto promote social progress and better standards of\nlife in larger freedom\u201d.\nIn pursuit of these objectives, we should also be\nstrengthened in our resolve, as also stated in the Charter,\n\u201cto reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in\nthe dignity and worth of the human person, in the\nequal rights of men and women and of nations large\nand small\u201d.\nThis leads me to recall the World Conference on\nHuman Rights, held in Vienna a few years ago. We in the\nGambia have always maintained that human rights should\nnot be viewed only from the narrow perspective of civil\nand political rights, but also from the perspective of the\nright to development. In the Gambia, over the last 30\nyears, we have had the experience of elections being held\nat regular intervals, but we all know that it was only a\nfacade.\nThere is no point in overemphasizing civil and\npolitical rights in a developing country at the expense of\nmore pressing needs in other areas, such as health,\neducation and agriculture. Before people can think of\ncasting a vote they first of all want to make sure that they\nhave enough food to eat, can send their children to school\nand have access to health care. In any case, let there be\nno illusion about this, for democracy cannot flourish\nunder conditions of abject poverty.\nThe greatest threat to international peace and\nsecurity today is the ever widening gap between rich and\npoor. And since we live in a world of interdependence,\n14\nGeneral Assembly 22nd plenary meeting\nFiftieth session 13 October 1995\nthe North-South dialogue that has been dormant for so long\nneeds to be revived urgently to put the emphasis on the\neconomic development of third world countries.\nIt is true that the world economic situation has\nregistered notable improvements in the economies both of\nindustrialized and of some developing countries. It is to be\nnoted, however, that the various growth rates in different\ndeveloping countries reflect their limitations and lack of\nadequate incentives and resources.\nThe conclusion of the Uruguay Round is expected to\ngenerate an increase in merchandise trade of 12 per cent by\nthe year 2005. As far as developing countries are\nconcerned, however, any benefits to be derived from this\nagreement would depend largely on their accessibility to\nmarkets through the removal, of course, of tariff as well as\nnon-tariff barriers.\nIt is feared, though, that in the case of sub-Saharan\nAfrica any gains from the Uruguay Round will be seriously\nlimited by the low proportion of manufactured goods in its\nexports. The case is even more serious for least developed\ncountries.\nThe Economic and Social Council\u2019s high-level meeting\non the development of Africa within the context of the\nreview of the United Nations New Agenda for the\nDevelopment of Africa in the l990s, held from 4 to 6 July\n1995 in Geneva, was indeed very timely. None the less, the\nmapping out of all these strategies for development will\nhave little meaning unless they are matched by the\nnecessary resources to achieve the desired results, especially\nwhen the resources generated through structural adjustment\nare paradoxically diverted to service our debts. And we\nknow that it is indeed an excruciating burden.\nAll these issues have been adequately addressed in the\nUnited Nations Agenda for Development. In the Agenda for\nPeace, however, there is still the need for greater efforts to\nfind solutions to the various protracted conflicts around the\nworld. There have been a lot of criticisms and reservations\npertaining to peace-keeping operations \u2014 notably with\nregard to the huge costs involved \u2014 but peace is priceless.\nWhat has happened to the peace dividend, anyway,\nwhich was talked about so much during previous sessions\nof the General Assembly? The head of the Australian\ndelegation made some interesting proposals regarding the\nfinancing of peace-keeping operations. There is a lot of\nsense and merit to what he said, and we should be doing\njustice to ourselves if these proposals were considered\nseriously. We must never relent in our collective\nendeavour to find lasting solutions to all the conflicts\nbesetting the international community, whether in\nSomalia, Rwanda, Burundi or Afghanistan, to name a\nfew.\nIn our subregion, we welcome the signing of the\nPeace Agreement by all the warring factions in the\nLiberian civil war and the establishment of Council of\nState to oversee the transition to a democratic, freely\nelected civilian Government. It is our fervent hope that\nthe cease-fire will hold so that the people of Liberia will\nonce again live in the environment of peace and stability\nthat has been denied them for so long. Let me take this\nopportunity to commend the Economic Community of\nWest African States (ECOWAS) for its timely initiative\nand persistent endeavour to finally put together this\nimportant peace package. This clearly demonstrates that\nregional arrangements, as stipulated in Chapter VIII of the\nCharter of the United Nations, could play a preponderant\nrole in conflict resolution.\nWe have been following with great attention the\nprogress made in the Middle East peace process, and my\ndelegation would like to take this opportunity to\ncongratulate both Israel and the Palestine Liberation\nOrganization (PLO) on these achievements and to\nencourage them to maintain the same commitment in the\nquest for a just and lasting peace.\nWith regard to the situation in Bosnia and\nHerzegovina, my delegation notes with cautious optimism\nthe recent peace deal between the parties concerned. It\nwould not have been possible, however to bring the Serb\naggressors to the negotiating table without the limited use\nof force against them.\nThe situation in Jammu and Kashmir has also been\nof concern to my delegation. We therefore urge all the\nparties to the conflict to try to resolve this long-running\ndispute through dialogue.\nWe in the Gambia have always maintained that we\nwill never condone the use of force by a bigger Power to\nimpose its will on a smaller country. I am referring to the\nlingering problems resulting from the Iraqi invasion of\nKuwait, such as the question of prisoners of war, payment\nof reparations and, indeed, the return to Kuwait of all\nproperties taken away during the invasion. In short, Iraq\nshould comply with all Security Council resolutions.\n15\nGeneral Assembly 22nd plenary meeting\nFiftieth session 13 October 1995\nMeanwhile, though, ways and means should be found to\nease the suffering of the innocent Iraqi civilian populations.\nFifty years is a relatively short period in the life of an\ninternational organization such as the United Nations, but\nit has been a period full of important and eventful activities,\nwith successes and setbacks.\nFor 50 years now the United Nations has been\nworking for global development and the maintenance of\ninternational peace and security. Its Charter has become the\nlegal and moral foundation of international relations.\nThrough the United Nations we have witnessed the\nproclamation of the Universal Declaration of Human\nRights, the enactment of the Convention on the Law of the\nSea, the holding of global conferences on the environment,\ndevelopment, population, children, women, and soon, on\nhuman settlements.\nThe United Nations should be commended primarily\nfor the broader role it played during the cold-war period\nand for championing the concerns and interests of\ndeveloping countries. It has always provided a platform\nwhere big and small nations meet and discuss issues of\ncommon concern.\nAt this juncture, when we are celebrating the golden\njubilee of the United Nations, my delegation believes that\nthe time could not be more propitious to lift the economic\nblockade against Cuba. This dynamic island nation has\nmade remarkable progress in the area of medicine and\ngenetic engineering, achievements that Cuba would share\nwith the rest of the international community.\nAs a small developing country confronted with unique\nchallenges, the Gambia is keen to ensure that the ongoing\nreforms aimed at restructuring and revitalizing the United\nNations remain on course. The strengthening of the role of\nthe General Assembly and the office of its President as well\nas the improvement in the performance of the Secretariat\nshould be commended. Any reform of the United Nations\nsystem should emphasize the need for more coordination\nbetween agencies and the development of new procedures\nfor the accelerated implementation of programmes and\nactivities.\nThe challenges facing the United Nations today will\ncontinue well into the twenty-first century. In this\nconnection it is imperative to restructure the composition of\nthe Security Council as soon as possible to reflect the\nrealities of today and in that restructuring Africa\u2019s interest\nmust be taken into account. In other words, Africa must\nbe represented permanently on the Security Council.\nLet me conclude by renewing the Gambia\u2019s\ncommitment to the ideals of the United Nations. The\nOrganization is far from being perfect, but, at the same\ntime, we do recognize that it is indispensable, for it is the\nrepository of the hopes and aspirations of mankind.\n"

        "file_text": "Please accept my warm\ncongratulations, Sir, on your election as President of the\nGeneral Assembly at its fiftieth session. At the same time,\nI wish to thank your predecessor, Ambassador Essy, for\nhis successful work.\nThe United Nations 50 years on \u2014 that makes this\nsession of the General Assembly an event of extra-special\nsignificance. The people of the world have high\nexpectations. We must take stock, but in so doing we\nmust, above all, look to the future.\nThe representatives of 50 nations who assembled in\nSan Francisco in the year 1945 were intended to be, as\nPresident Truman put it, \u201cthe architects of a better world\u201d.\nWhat has become of their blue-print?\nToday the family of nations has 185 members.\nMillions of people all over the world owe their lives, their\nfreedom and their health, their jobs and their homes, to\nthe United Nations and its specialized agencies.\nDecolonization has been completed, apartheid has been\novercome, and respect for human rights is no longer an\ninternal affair. In the field of disarmament a historic\nbreakthrough has been achieved: in May of this year the\nproliferation of nuclear weapons was halted. That\nconstitutes a big step towards making the world safe for\nmankind.\nAll these are considerable achievements which many\ncritics of the United Nations have overlooked in this\njubilee year, achievements on which you, in particular,\nMr. Secretary-General, and your staff are to be\ncongratulated. Indeed, the United Nations, in spite of\nsome unjustified criticism, can take pride in what it has\ndone for the cause of peace, freedom and human dignity.\nEspecially worthy of our gratitude and appreciation\nare the more than 68,000 United Nations troops currently\n4\n\n\nserving on missions in all regions of the world. When\nservicemen from Asia, Africa or Latin America attend to\nthe basic needs of refugees in Europe, in the former\nYugoslavia, and keep the beleaguered people from starving,\nthen that is, I believe, a marvellous indication that the \u201cone\nworld\u201d is a reality. Lest we forget: nearly 5,000 of those\ntroops, the Blue Helmets, have been killed or wounded in\nthe line of duty. The Convention on the Safety of United\nNations and Associated Personnel must be put into effect as\nsoon as possible. This we owe to all those who serve the\nUnited Nations.\nAs we recap the events of the past year, we also have\nto consider the huge problems now confronting the world\nOrganization. The ability to safeguard peace: that is the\nworld\u2019s main criterion when judging the United Nations.\nAnd here we have reached a critical point.\nSomalia, Rwanda and Bosnia: these countries stand for\ndisappointment and setbacks as well. However, I should\nlike to make it very clear that in such cases the culprit is\nquickly found, too quickly. Nothing is more convenient\nthan to point to the alleged inefficiency of the United\nNations. And nothing could be further from the truth.\nWhen it has not been possible to help people, when\nUnited Nations troops have been humiliated in the former\nYugoslavia, it has in nearly every instance not been the\nfault of the United Nations. The problems have lain in its\nunsatisfactory mandate, in the lack of political will on the\npart of Member States, and, unfortunately, in the shortage\nof funds. It is we, the Members, who cause the difficulties.\nFollowing the holding of United Nations troops as\nhostages, the atrocities in Zepa and Srebrenica, and the\nterrible second bloodbath in Sarajevo\u2019s market place, the\ncommunity of nations has demonstrated that there is a limit\nto the amount of brutality and contempt for international\nlaw it will tolerate. And there has to be a limit.\nThe resolve of the United Nations and the North\nAtlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) has paid off \u2014 not\nonly for the people of Sarajevo, who for three years have\nbeen starving and freezing and kept under constant fire, but\nalso for the peace process.\nYesterday, here in New York, the parties to the\nconflict had another meeting with the Contact Group, of\nwhich Germany is a member. Another step forward was\nachieved on the constitutional issue following the result\nachieved in Geneva, and I believe this step to be a decisive\none. For the first time since the conflict began there is a\nrealistic prospect of a negotiated peace settlement.\nBut I should like to warn against being over-\neuphoric. A lot has still to be done. We shall have to put\none stone on top of another stone in order to finish this\nbuilding. This time none of the participants should leave\nthe conference table until an agreement has been\nreached \u2014 a peaceful agreement at the negotiating table,\nand not an agreement on the basis of military actions.\nAnyone who continues to prefer bloodshed, to prefer\nmilitary actions, will be taking a great responsibility upon\nhimself.\nFrom the beginning, Germany has played an active\npart in these efforts. We have never taken sides, nor did\nwe ever want to take sides, against one party; rather, we\nhave always taken up the cause of the victims, those who\nhave been tormented and driven from their homes.\nTo date, the German Government\u2019s humanitarian aid\nin the region amounts to more than 1 billion Deutsche\nmarks. And I should like to stress strongly that we have\nno double standards, nor should we have double\nstandards. In the short time since August, we have\nprovided more than 6 million marks to help Serbian\nrefugees from Krajina.\nMy country has contributed in various ways to all\npeace-keeping operations. By sending medical personnel\nto Split and deploying Tornado fighters for the first\ntime \u2014 fighters which we have made available in\nPiacenze, Italy \u2014 in a United Nations peace-keeping\nmission, we have also shown that we do not merely talk\nabout taking on more responsibility, but that we act to do\nso.\nWe will also meet our responsibility when it comes\nto implementing the terms of a peace settlement \u2014 and\nI hope that this settlement will come soon. The\nreconstruction of Bosnia\u2019s economy requires a genuinely\ninternational cooperative effort, an effort on the part of\nthe international community. The European Union \u2014 and\nGermany, of course, as a member of the European\nUnion \u2014 will play its part.\nWhat lessons can and must we learn from what has\nhappened in Somalia, Rwanda and Bosnia?\nFirst, the United Nations must confine itself to doing\nwhat is feasible. Its resources are obviously being strained\nbeyond the limit. It cannot take on every responsibility. It\n5\n\n\ncannot solve all the problems that the world is confronted\nwith.\nSecondly, the extent and duration of the commitment\nof the United Nations must be more precise, the political\nand military objectives must be clearly defined, and there\nmust be a realistic and, above all, coherent mandate.\nThirdly, if the world Organization is going to\nintervene, then it must act consistently and resolutely. There\nmust be no repetition of what happened in Rwanda or Zepa\nor Srebrenica.\nFourthly, cooperation between the United Nations and\nother organizations such as NATO must from the outset be\nplanned in such a way that maximum speed and, above all,\nefficiency are assured.\nFifthly, we believe that the regional organizations must\nplay a larger role than they have done so far. Not every\nproblem must go straight to the United Nations. In Europe,\nfor instance, and in other places of the world too, the\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe\n(OSCE) could assume much greater responsibility.\nHowever, we have to enable it to do so.\nStill, let there be no illusions. Peace-keeping is not just\na fair-weather exercise. Such missions will always be apt to\ncreate problems for the world Organization.\nAnd, in view of the hundreds of thousands of lives\nthat have been saved in Somalia and Bosnia, who can argue\nwith an easy conscience that the United Nations should not\nhave intervened? And many of these people have already\nbeen forgotten. What is required here is an increased peace-\nkeeping capacity \u2014 constructive help, not destructive\ncriticism.\nAnd to those who over and over again have called into\nquestion the actions of the United Nations and its peace-\nkeeping operations, I would like to address the following\nquestion: Is there an alternative? Who could take the place\nof the United Nations? Indeed, Europe has not been able to\ncope with this tragedy in its own house as well as we all\nhoped it would.\nBut nor should we forget the European Union\u2019s\nachievements in the former Yugoslavia. It paved the way\nfor the Contact Group\u2019s ongoing peace efforts.\nTo my mind, the conflict in the former Yugoslavia\nemphasizes how important and right it was for Western\nEurope to embark on a new course after the Second\nWorld War, a course that was directed against nationalism\nand against the use of force. For four decades, as a result\nof the East-West conflict, not all European nations were\nable to follow that route of the European Community,\ntoday\u2019s European Union.\nThe European Union is now striving to correct that\nterrible aberration and bridge the gulfs that separate it\nfrom Central and Eastern Europe. The goal is one Europe,\na Europe in which the old big-Power politics and\nhegemonic aspirations can never again take root.\nThat Europe must have a legitimate place for Russia,\nbut for Ukraine as well. The European house does not\nconsist solely of the European Union: it has many rooms.\nNeither of these two nations, Russia or Ukraine, should\nbe left outside. To our Russian and Ukrainian partners\nand friends I say: Europe needs your contribution and it\ndoes so also in bringing peace to the former Yugoslavia.\nHere their new partnership with the European Union and\nNATO must \u2014 and, I add, will \u2014 prove its value.\nMany feared that when the East-West confrontation\ndisappeared Europe would focus exclusively on its own\naffairs. That has not been the case. The European Union\nis intensifying its political, economic and cultural\ncooperation with the other regions of the world.\nIn Asia, Africa and Latin America it is already a\nmodel for peace, prosperity and regional integration. In\nthe United Nations the European Union is the principal\npartner for dialogue with the developing countries.\nThe European Union and Germany have been\nparticularly active in promoting peace and economic\nrecovery in the Middle East. The recent agreement on the\nWest Bank worked out by Yassir Arafat and Shimon\nPeres is another important milestone on the road to lasting\npeace in that region. I congratulate both sides on their\ncourage and on their far-sightedness. The United States is\nplaying a major part in this process in this region. We are\ngrateful to them for that. Egypt has rendered an important\ncontribution as an intermediary.\nIncreasing the peace-keeping capacity of the United\nNations also involves reforming the Security Council.\nThere is now a global consensus, I believe, that this is\nnecessary.\nThe first steps towards reform have already been\ntaken. More changes have been made to the Council\u2019s\n6\n\n\nmethods of work and more transparency achieved in the\npast two years than in the whole of the previous four\ndecades.\nLike many other Member States, Germany considers\nthat the Council should have more permanent and non-\npermanent members. The nations of Asia, Africa and Latin\nAmerica need wider representation and I think we owe it to\nthem. They have deserved it. The same applies to several\ncountries with an important global role.\nGermany, with the support of many Member States,\nhas announced its interest in permanent membership of the\nSecurity Council. Our willingness to assume greater\nresponsibility, also within this framework, is for us the\nlogical and consistent extension of our commitment to the\nUnited Nations. This commitment is consistent with the\nfundamental principle of our foreign policy, which is to\ngive priority to multilateral cooperation. We have abided by\nthat principle in pursuing European integration, and we\nbelieve that that same principle would help us play a useful\nrole in the Security Council.\nThe world finds itself faced with many new conflicts\nand challenges. It is crucial that in dealing with them we\nshould focus our efforts more than we have done so far on\nconflict prevention. A political solution must remain the\nfirst option. That requires wider use of human rights\nobservers, improvements in the United Nations early\nwarning system, the promotion of democratization and the\nobservation of election processes, as successfully done\nrecently in Mozambique.\nWe have provided a list of experienced intermediaries\nfor the tasks of preventive diplomacy. The example of\nMacedonia shows what the preventive deployment of\nUnited Nations Blue Helmets can achieve. I am very happy\nabout the agreement that has been achieved between Greece\nand Macedonia on this extremely important issue.\nPreventing fire can save countless lives and in any case it\nis cheaper than putting fires out. On my recent visit to\nRwanda I was deeply shocked, in the truest sense of the\nword, by the atrocities that have been perpetrated there by\nhuman beings on other human beings. If the United Nations\nhad intervened at an early stage and resolutely, many lives\ncould have been saved.\nGermany has set up a substantial emergency aid\nprogramme for Rwanda. We are trying in particular to do\nsomething about the awful prison conditions. I myself\nvisited prisons, in Kigali for example, and I must tell you\nthat I have never seen anything like that in all my life.\nUrgent remedies are needed here to ensure that one\ninjustice is not followed by another. I travelled to Burundi\ntoo, and I returned deeply saddened and concerned. We\nmust not make the same mistakes in Burundi.\nDisarmament, arms control and confidence-\nbuilding \u2014 these are some of the main components of\nconflict prevention. In recent years we have made the\nkind of progress that no one would have believed possible\nat the height of the arms race 15 years ago. The task of\nbuttressing this breakthrough and building on the\nachievements has acquired great political significance.\nA few weeks ago we commemorated the fiftieth\nanniversary of the first atomic bomb explosions over\nHiroshima and Nagasaki. Nuclear weapons must never,\nnever, be used again. They must be eliminated\ncompletely, as required by article VI of the Treaty on the\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. That aim was\nreaffirmed by the nuclear Powers at the New York\nConference extending the Treaty.\nNever has the door to a ban on every kind of\nnuclear-test explosion been wider open than today. We\nmust now direct all our efforts to the achievement of this\ngoal. The Geneva negotiations must produce such a\ncomprehensive ban by the autumn of 1996 at the latest.\nAnti-personnel mines, too, are \u201cweapons of mass\ndestruction\u201d. Day in, day out, they are taking a terrible\ntoll on human life, and many of the victims are women\nand, above all, innocent children. If any kind of weapon\nmust be outlawed, then this one should be.\nEliminating this scourge is a task of the highest\npriority, particularly in Nicaragua, Angola, Mozambique,\nAfghanistan, Georgia and Cambodia. Germany, together\nwith its European partners, will continue the initiative in\nthis direction during this session of the General\nAssembly.\nAt the First Review Conference of the Convention\non certain conventional weapons, which opened in Vienna\nthe day before yesterday, tougher export restrictions will\nhave to be agreed on and a strict ban imposed on the use\nof anti-personnel mines.\nI appeal to all Members of the United Nations: In\nthe name of humanity, accede to the Convention on\ncertain conventional weapons as quickly as possible.\n7\n\n\nThere are good reasons why the work of the United\nNations began with the Universal Declaration of Human\nRights. The United Nations is more than a mere gathering\nof sovereign States. It is based on the common belief in the\ndignity and worth of every human being, and it is my view\nthat this must remain the focal point of all political activity.\nUniversal Children\u2019s Day, celebrated a week ago,\nreminded us of the awful fate to which these, the weakest\nmembers of society, are often exposed. The United Nations\nChildren\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) therefore needs the support of\nevery one of us.\nThe task of helping those people all over the world\nwho have been persecuted and deprived of their rights must\nremain at the top of the political agenda. Pressure from the\ninternational community, the media, non-governmental\norganizations and private citizens must be maintained.\nThose who torture people and who treat human rights with\ncontempt should not be able to sleep peacefully. To this\nend, the High Commissioner\u2019s position will have to be\nstrengthened and the Centre for Human Rights better\nequipped. People who commit war crimes must know that\nthey will be prosecuted under international criminal law.\nHence, Germany strongly urges the establishment of a\npermanent international court of justice.\nBut above all, stronger measures to protect minorities\nare called for. \u201cEthnic cleansing\u201d is no basis for peaceful\ncoexistence, either in Europe or anywhere else.\nMore than 27 million people are today on the move.\nThis is one of the most dramatic events of our time. The\ncause is not only hunger and distress, but, in most cases,\nunfortunately, ethnic and religious fanaticism. Diversity of\nculture and tradition is one of the world\u2019s greatest assets,\nand no one should seek to impose a particular model of\nsociety on others.\nThe fact that there exists a core of human rights which\neveryone has to respect is quite a different matter. This was\nreaffirmed at the Vienna Conference and should not be\nchallenged by anyone.\nToday the dialogue of cultures is central to the quest\nfor peace. I have invited leading representatives of the\nIslamic world to come to Germany in November to\nparticipate in such a dialogue. My feeling is that we have\nto learn to understand each other better. I have also urged\nthat the Bosnia Contact Group closely coordinate its efforts\nwith the Islamic Contact Group.\nIn Germany, two and a half million Muslims are\nliving harmoniously with the local community. In my\nview, it is extremely important that we should develop\ncooperation and mutual trust at the international level as\nwell, and I am speaking as the German Foreign Minister.\nIslam cannot be equated with terrorism or\nfundamentalism. No new enemy stereotypes must be\nallowed to develop. I think that we should be happy that\nwe have been able to do away with the old ones.\nPeace and development are inseparable. Any reform\nof the United Nations worthy of that name should\ntherefore encompass economic and social matters as well.\nThis fiftieth anniversary is a unique opportunity to create\na modern framework for a new development in\npartnership. Work on the Agenda for Development must\ntherefore be completed as soon as possible.\nApart from improving and simplifying the finance\nregime for United Nations development activities, the\nchief concern is to coordinate and efficiently implement\nthe results of the world conferences on the environment,\nsocial problems, population growth and women \u2014\nespecially the Conference on Women that has just ended\nin Beijing.\nThese are the main interrelated issues of our time as\nwe pursue the goal of peace. The planet Earth must\nremain habitable for future generations as well. Progress\nis possible only through equal and fair partnership\nbetween North and South. Germany will continue to exert\nevery effort to this end.\nNone of this can be done unless we can come to\ngrips with the biggest crisis confronting the United\nNations: that of its financial situation. There is no reason\nto deny that it has assumed dramatic proportions; one has\nto be quite frank about this. This crisis can be overcome\nonly if all contributors, and especially the main ones,\nmeet their obligations punctually. Germany is the third\nlargest contributor to the United Nations, and we pay our\nbills. We cannot allow a situation to continue where those\nwho pay their contributions on time are also burdened\nwith the arrears of wealthier Members. Unless decisive\naction is taken very soon, whole areas of activity could\ngrind to a halt.\nI very much welcome the confirmation by the\nAmerican Secretary of State that the United States stands\nby the obligations arising from its membership. The\nUnited Nations needs an America that fulfils its\n8\n\n\nleadership role, just as the United States needs a world\nOrganization capable of, and willing to undertake, reform.\nHow can we overcome this financial crisis? First, we\nmust restore the balance between the budgets for peace-\nkeeping operations and the regular budget of the United\nNations. We cannot allow resources for such operations to\nbe used up to the point of depletion while at the same time\nfunds for urgent programmes of economic or social\ndevelopment are either non-existent or have to be cut back.\nSecondly, it is time we found a scale of assessments\nthat reflects Members\u2019 actual ability to pay. You,\nMr. Secretary-General, have made great efforts to\nrationalize the Organization\u2019s work, to ensure budgetary\ndiscipline and to reduce staff. I appeal to all Member States\nto give Under-Secretary-General Paschke the support he\nneeds for his difficult job.\nThe United Nations is indispensable to the task of\nmaintaining global order and as a forum and instrument for\ninternational cooperation, today no less than in the era after\nthe Second World War. No other organization has the same\nability to focus the interests and energies of the world\u2019s\nnations, which we believe is necessary.\nThe United Nations is not \u201cthe others\u201d, but us, the\nMembers. And this Organization is only as strong and as\nunited as we, its Members, make it.\nHence my appeal today to the Assembly: let us stop\nour constant vacillation between euphoria and\ndisappointment regarding the United Nations. Let us stop\napportioning blame, which leads nowhere. Let us rather\nmerge vision and pragmatism, solidarity and responsibility\nfor our own actions into a rational and realistic international\npartnership under the aegis of the United Nations. Let us\ngive this world Organization more clout and make it more\nefficient and economical. Yes, we will have to slim down\nthe United Nations. It has to save money. Let us do these\nthings in a constructive spirit, together with, and on behalf\nof, the United Nations. Let us give the United Nations what\nit needs \u2014 including paying our dues.\nThat is what the world community expects of us now,\nand rightly so. That is the task facing the family of nations\non the threshold of the new millennium. If the reforms fail,\nthere will be only losers.\n\u201cHope is the pillar of the world\u201d, they say in South\nAfrica. Fifty years ago, such a pillar of hope for mankind\nwas erected in San Francisco. Let us do everything to\nensure that this pillar will continue to support the hopes\nof mankind in the next 50 years as well. Germany will\ncontinue to play its part.\n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of my Government I congratulate\nMr. Freitas do Amaral of Portugal on his election to the\npresidency of the General Assembly at its fiftieth session,\na crucial time in the history of the Organization. I should\nlike at the outset to express our full readiness to make a\nmajor contribution to the success of the deliberations under\nhis leadership.\nI should also like to express our appreciation and\ngratitude to Minister Amara Essy of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire for his\nexcellent performance as President of the General Assembly\nat its forty-ninth session.\nThe peoples of the world believed that the end of the\ncold war would bring peace and prosperity \u2014 and they are\nstill waiting. Indeed the changes that have taken place in\ninternational relations have not been accompanied by\nchanges of a similar magnitude in the relations between the\nindustrialized North and the impoverished South. On the\ncontrary, the situation of developing countries, far from\nhaving improved, is deteriorating further. The international\ntrade system does not meet the expectations that there\nwould be access to markets and transparency in the rules of\nthe game. Poverty has not been reduced, social\ndevelopment is at a standstill, the scientific and\ntechnological development of the South continues to lag\nand the external debt problem is still a heavy burden on our\neconomies.\nIt is our duty now to realize the dream of those who\nwrote the San Francisco Charter \u2014 something that has been\npostponed for 50 years by a cold war and dozens of\nregional conflicts and overshadowed by the grief of the\nvictims of armed conflicts.\nThe period of transition through which the\ninternational system is passing should not lead us to accept\nso-called unilateral solutions to problems that are global in\nnature nor to permit the emergence of a new era of\nintervention in matters that lie within the domestic\njurisdiction of States. There is an imperative need to\nconcert policies and coordinate strategies to face\ninternational problems and to foster constructive links\nbetween North and South.\nThe United Nations, which was a stage for the cold\nwar, must now cooperate in eradicating poverty, in\nmaking sustainable human development viable, in\nguaranteeing equality of rights between men and women\nand in giving full effect to human rights \u2014 in other\nwords, it must work on behalf of human beings \u2014 all\nhuman beings \u2014 without distinction of any kind\nwhatsoever. The United Nations has the responsibility to\nstrive to make the hopes and expectations that arose at the\nend of the cold war a reality and not the source of new\nfrustrations.\nThe current situation requires a modern United\nNations attuned to the new times, a pluralistic and\ndemocratic Organization that will be an instrument for the\npromotion of a world order that can make the right to\ndevelopment a reality and achieve peace. The building of\na new international system to replace the hegemonic,\nweapons-based and unilateral practices of the past is a\ngoal towards which we must work from within this\nOrganization.\nThe international system we aspire to create is one\ncompatible with interdependence and autonomy, with the\nstrengthening of the international organization and with\nfull respect for the sovereign equality of States, one\ncompatible with economic development and devoted to\nthe significant improvement of the living conditions of the\npoorest segments of the population.\nIt is indispensable to forge a new economic model\nthat can satisfy the needs of our people, one characterized\nby social justice and equity, efficiency and\ncompetitiveness. At the same time, we are convinced that\ngenuine and representative democracy, free from foreign\ninterference, must be the key element in preserving peace\nand observing the basic principles of respect for the\nfundamental rights of the human person and of economic\nand social development.\nFor the preservation of peace, security and\ninternational stability it is indispensable that the nuclear-\nweapon States act responsibly and immediately\ndiscontinue nuclear testing. In this regard, we deplore the\nrecent nuclear tests that have been carried out,\nnotwithstanding the opposition of the international\ncommunity to that practice.\nNext month the Eleventh Summit Meeting of the\nmembers of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries will\ntake place in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia. My country\nlooks forward to the attendance of leaders of developing\n32\n\n\nnations and is prepared to shoulder the creative challenge\nof presiding over the Movement for the next three years.\nIn recent decades, under the leadership of His\nExcellency President Soeharto of Indonesia, the Non-\nAligned Movement adopted a new course, one in tune with\ncurrent reality, abandoning the confrontational context in\nfavour of cooperation as the central focus of its action. We\nshall continue to pursue that task with enthusiasm.\nWith the same determination with which it succeeded\nin its struggle against colonialism, the non-aligned countries\nmust now face the challenge of eradicating poverty and\nclosing the vast gap between rich and poor and between\ndeveloped and developing countries.\nIn the twenty-first century non-alignment will mean a\ncommitment to peace and to the well-being and progress of\nour peoples, as well as action against poverty and\nmarginalization. It will also entail a commitment to\ncooperation in dealing with global problems and a struggle\nfor participation and against unilateralism and imposition.\nIn facing the next century, non-alignment must\nparticipate actively in the reform of international\ninstitutions, including the United Nations and the Bretton\nWoods institutions. Non-alignment must also promote the\nneeded changes in the structures of cooperation and the\ndynamic modalities by which developed countries and\ninternational institutions provide resources for the\nimplementation of projects and programmes of South-South\ncooperation.\nOne of the global problems that calls for an effective\nmultilateral strategy headed by the United Nations is that of\nillegal drugs. This is not an issue that can be dealt with by\na single country or small group of nations. This is a\ntransnational crime of vast proportions, overwhelming\ndimensions and the greatest perils. It is a crime without\nnationality.\nWe Colombians have suffered more than anyone from\nthe devastating effects of this problem. We have suffered\ndeath and corruption as a consequence of the huge profits\nto be derived from this illegal activity. We find it\nsurprising, therefore, to note that the international\ncommunity is not fully aware of the real nature and\ndimensions of the problem of illicit drugs.\nWe are dealing with an illegal economic activity with\ndimensions that have been compared with those of the oil\nindustry. It is seven or eight times greater than the gross\nnational product of a nation like Colombia; it operates in\ndozens of countries and entails a number of linked\nactivities, including money laundering and the deviation\nof chemical precursors. Such linked activities generally\ntake place in developed countries and are as important as\nthe growing of coca leaves or their transformation into\ncocaine.\nMany studies indicate an increase in the\nconsumption of illegal drugs in industrialized countries as\nwell as an increase in new markets throughout the world.\nWorld statistics demonstrate that deaths from drug abuse\nhave trebled since 1988 and that an increase of 1000 per\ncent has been observed in medical emergencies due to\ncocaine overdose between 1978 and 1993.\nMy country has battled, with more success than any\nother, against the producers of and traffickers in illegal\ndrugs. Colombia eradicated marihuana crops in the 1970s,\ndestroyed the Medell\u00edn Cartel in the 1980s and dismantled\nthe Cali Cartel in the 1990s.\nColombia is responsible for more than 50 per cent of\nthe poppy crops eradicated worldwide and for the\nconfiscation of more than a quarter of the total amount of\ncocaine and cocaine base seized globally.\nThe eradication of illegal crops in Colombia must be\naccompanied by similar efforts to bring about the\neradication of marihuana crops in other countries,\nincluding in some industrialized countries in the North.\nDuring the first year of President Ernesto Samper\u2019s\nAdministration, the anti-drug cartel policy has produced\nresults that no prior administration in Colombia, or in any\nother nation, has been able to achieve.\nThanks to Colombia\u2019s success, the world now has a\nhistoric opportunity to defeat drug trafficking once and\nfor all. Yet this opportunity could be missed if adequate\nmeasures are not immediately adopted to combat money\nlaundering, the deviation of precursor chemicals and\npermissive consumption.\nMy country has proposed creating a special unit of\nthe Economic and Social Council to oversee measures of\ninternational cooperation, the adoption of an inter-\nAmerican convention against money laundering and the\nconvening in 1997 of an international conference to\nevaluate the results of the Vienna Convention and to\nmake the necessary adjustments to it.\n33\n\n\nThere is still time for the international community to\nface up to its responsibility to bring about the final defeat\nof this international scourge.\n\n"

        "file_text": "Let me first convey to you, Sir, my delegation\u2019s and my\nown congratulations on your election as President of the\nGeneral Assembly. Your appointment to preside over the\nAssembly at such an important session constitutes a\nrecognition not only of your personal abilities but also of\nthe important international role that Portugal plays on the\ninternational stage.\nAs we commemorate half a century of the existence\nof the United Nations, we do so with renewed hopes for\nthe purposes and principles of the Organization, and we\nwish to reaffirm our country\u2019s commitment to it.\nThe major processes taking place in the modern\nworld have transcended national borders and taken strong\nroot in the multilateral sphere. Like never before in the\nhistory of humankind, the solution of the problems of the\npeace and security of States and the people inhabiting\nthem, as well as the protection of the individual, his\nwelfare and his environment, depend more on collective\ndecisions and action than on any one country. Our\nmultilateral system may still have major defects and\nshortcomings, but there is no replacement that has the\npolitical legitimacy of the United Nations to take up the\nchallenges facing us as we approach a new millennium.\nHence, it is important, during this session of the\nAssembly, to engage in a broad debate on the functioning\nof our system, in order both to adapt its objectives to the\nnew realities and to introduce far-reaching changes in the\nstructures of the Organization, which were designed to\nmeet the challenges of a post-war world that no longer\nexists.\nMy country aspires to occupy a seat in the Security\nCouncil as a non-permanent member in 1996 and 1997.\nFrom this rostrum I wish to express our gratitude for the\nunanimous endorsement we have received from the Latin\nAmerican and Caribbean Group, as well as for the\nsupport to be provided by other countries of the United\nNations in the election, which is to be conducted at this\nsession of the General Assembly.\nChile is in a position to assume this responsibility\nand contribute to the search for the consensuses required\nto strengthen the Organization and make its decisions\nreally effective. We shall do so on the basis of our\n17\n\n\nprinciples of international policy, seeking always to reflect\nthe views and interests of the region we wish to represent.\nWe believe that the primary objective of a security\npolicy is to reduce the insecurity of the international\ncommunity as a whole, of its Member States and of\nindividuals, families and the communities in which they\nlive. Helping to reduce these insecurities is the main task of\nthe United Nations.\nWe are experiencing the combined effects of the\nending of the cold war and of the process of increasing\nglobalization. Both have positive consequences in the\neconomic and political spheres, but at the same time they\nface us with new situations and uncertainties.\nThe fear of the nuclear destruction that might have\nresulted from the world-wide ideological confrontation\nbetween the major Powers has disappeared, and the Treaty\non the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), to\nwhich Chile is now a party, has been indefinitely extended.\nNevertheless, the nuclear Powers and those aspiring to\nthat status still do not acknowledge that the very existence\nof nuclear weapons capable of destroying mankind is a\nsource of insecurity for us all. To believe that nuclear\nweapons confer greater security on the State that possesses\nthem is an illusion. What they produce is profound unease\nin other nations and in the population of the nuclear-\nweapon State itself in the face of the possibility that the\nweapons, in an escalation of folly, might end up being\nused.\nThe renewal of nuclear tests by certain Powers \u2014\nprecisely at a time when, in the wake of the recent\nConference on the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\nNuclear Weapons, there should have been a moratorium on\nsuch tests so that a definitive test-ban treaty could be\nprepared \u2014 shows insensitivity in this regard. Nevertheless,\nChina and France, countries for which we profess respect\nand friendship, have opted to continue such tests. We\ncondemn their attitude, and we see this as a clear setback\nfor the cause of disarmament and non-proliferation of\nnuclear weapons, which we all claim to share.\nFor Chile, France\u2019s decision to renew its nuclear tests\non Mururoa Atoll, in the Pacific Ocean, is of particular\nconcern. As a Pacific country and a member of the Asia-\nPacific Economic Cooperation Council (APEC), has\ncategorically condemned those tests, and President Frei has\nmade our opinion known to President Chirac.\nWe are concerned lest the South Pacific region, in\nwhich Chile has vital interests, should become a zone in\nwhich it is regarded as legitimate to engage in activities\nthat are unthinkable in other parts of the world. We wish\nto state clearly our willingness to work together with\nother States of the region to prevent the proliferation,\nemplacement, transit or testing of nuclear weapons and\nother radioactive materials in that region and throughout\nthe world.\nOn the other hand, we appreciate the positive\nattitude of those nuclear Powers that have declared and\nmaintained unilateral moratoriums. Chile, along with other\ncountries, believes that the General Assembly should take\na stand on this issue in order to promote an immediate\nmoratorium on all nuclear tests, as proposed by the Heads\nof State of the Rio Group and the States parties to the\nTreaties of Tlatelolco and Rarotonga at their recent\nmeeting.\nThe end of the cold war has given rise to a genuine\nideological decolonization that has opened the way for\ngreater freedom and democracy in various regions of the\nworld. Nevertheless, the hope that this change would lead\nto a more peaceful world has been thwarted. The new\nworld disorder has encouraged the development of ethnic,\nreligious, cultural or simply group differences. The former\nYugoslavia, Rwanda and Somalia remind us that hatred\nthat still festers in various parts of our world.\nPeople rightly look to the United Nations to bring its\npolitical and moral weight to bear in helping prevent such\natrocities. Consent to barbarism in any part of the world\nweakens the moral fibre of all human beings. That is one\nof the great lessons of the cold war; after the overthrow\nof fascism, the world also had an opportunity to expand\ndemocracy and freedom.\nNevertheless, the systematic abuse of human rights\nwhich tactical allies were allowed to engage in, and which\nalso characterized the Soviet Union and its areas of\ninfluence, reduced the ethical quality of the world\ninherited after the ending of the cold war. What alarms us\ntoday was just yesterday promoted or consented to for\n\u201creasons of State\u201d.\nThus, the promotion of human rights, freedom and\ndemocracy cannot be seen as unwarranted interference in\nother people\u2019s affairs. There cannot be political, cultural,\nethnic or religious reasons for trampling on human\ndignity. This is the core of the emerging international\n18\n\n\nhumanitarian law which Chile regards as a cornerstone of\nthe world order for the twenty-first century.\nIn addition, the need to promote the security of the\nindividual has recently acquired particular prominence. The\nmain factors that today affect such security are\nunemployment, hunger, poverty, marginalization, crime and\ndiscrimination on grounds of class, sex, religion, culture or\nethnic origin. People are demanding to be included in a\nprocess of development which affords opportunity, and\nasking that shared progress should ensure increased equality\nfor all. Societies today are aware that social polarization is\nbecoming their main source of uncertainty.\nThe world economy also recognizes this fact. As\nPresident Eduardo Frei has said:\n\u201cWe know today that there can be no stable\ninvestment in unstable societies, and that economic\nprosperity cannot prosper amidst human insecurity. On\nthe contrary, it is becoming increasingly apparent that\none of the main sources of growth and development\nfor the future is, in all countries, the incorporation of\ntoday\u2019s marginalized people into the worldwide\nproduction system that is coming into being.\u201d\nHeads of State and Government from all parts of the\nworld ratified these views at the World Summit for Social\nDevelopment, when they stated:\n\u201cWe acknowledge that the people of the world\nhave shown in different ways an urgent need to\naddress profound social problems, especially poverty,\nunemployment and social exclusion, that affect every\ncountry. It is our task to attack both their underlying\nand structural causes and their distressing\nconsequences in order to reduce uncertainty and\ninsecurity in the life of people.\u201d (A/CONF.166/9,\nannex I to resolution 1, para. 2)\nThe same problems stemming from the processes of\nglobalization and internationalization have led to the\nemergence of a new set of problems relating to security.\nThese include the corrosive influence of drug production\nand consumption, and the corrupting effect of the\nmovements of vast amounts of money that this traffic\ninvolves; the degradation of the environment, from its\nglobal impact on the ozone layer to its local effect on the\nhealth of children and the elderly; the large international\nmigrations resulting from insecurity in the countries of\norigin; the expansion of international terrorism; and the\nincrease in transmissible diseases such as AIDS.\nOne immediate conclusion emerges: there is no\nsubstitute for the multilateral system to tackle this\ninterrelated set of problems. The areas for purely national\naction are shrinking, while the need for international\nagreements and understandings is growing on a daily\nbasis.\nAnother important conclusion is that to deal with\nthis multifaceted constellation of problems, we need to\nmake use of the United Nations system as a whole. If we\nwant to resolve the problems of security, as they are\nexperienced by people and as we have described them\nhere, not only the Security Council, but also the General\nAssembly, the Economic and Social Council and the\nspecialized programmes and agencies have a vital role to\nplay. We must give them greater responsibilities in\nrelation to these issues.\nIn this context, I wish to outline a number of general\nprinciples by which our activity in the Security Council\nwill be guided. We shall:\nFirst, focus on preventive diplomacy and on peaceful\nsettlement of disputes in accordance with Chapter VI\nin order to reduce to the minimum the use of force,\nin accordance with Chapter VII of the Charter.\nSecondly, promote confidence-building measures and\nregional solutions based on the capacity for action of\ncountries in the region; the regional option can be\neffective, as the case of Latin America is\ndemonstrating, and should precede and complement\nrecourse to the Security Council.\nThirdly, always maintain a special concern for the\nvictims of the conflicts dealt with by the Council,\nencouraging the fullest use of humanitarian law.\nFourthly, protect, in cases where sanctions have to\nbe applied, the interests and needs of the most\ndisadvantaged sectors of society; we do not believe\nin unilateral sanctions or in sanctions that ultimately\nhit only the weakest.\nFifthly, promote greater transparency in the\nprocedures and decisions of the Council, so that the\nother States Members of the United Nations, civil\nsociety and public opinion at large can exercise\ndemocratic oversight over its actions; the more\nwidely the complexities of the issues it deals with\nare known and understood, the greater the support\nfor its work will be.\n19\n\n\nSixthly, monitor the growing cost of peace-keeping\noperations with a view to rationalizing use of the\navailable resources and making them more efficient.\nWe believe that one of the essential tasks for the\nUnited Nations in striving to attain the goal of increasing\nglobal stability is to promote the progressive establishment\nin various parts of the world of regional zones of peace and\ncooperation that is, geographical areas, defined by the\nparticipants themselves, in which are applied agreed rules\nfor coexistence and the strengthening of peace and security.\nThe United Nations has already declared the Indian\nOcean and the South Atlantic to be zones of peace. The\nsame objective has been pursued by the Treaties of\nTlatelolco and Rarotonga in relation to nuclear weapons in\nLatin America and the Caribbean and in the South Pacific.\nWe need to draw the main lessons from the benefits and\nlimitations of the experience they afford.\nIt is important to stress that the ending of the cold war\nleaves the concept of a zone of peace devoid of any\nideological implication and makes it possible to\nacknowledge its practical usefulness. The Government of\nChile considers that many regions, including ours, are in a\nposition to follow this example. We intend to request the\nSecretary-General to engage in consultations with the\nGovernments of United Nations Member States regarding\nthe interest in and possibilities of promoting zones of peace\nin various regions of the world and to report thereon to the\nGeneral Assembly next year.\nIf we wish to make an effective response to the\nchallenges we face, we need to improve the\nrepresentativeness and efficiency of our Organization. This\nAssembly will also have to discuss important aspects\nrelating to the reform of the system in these two directions.\nChile shares the view of many other countries\nregarding the need to restructure the Security Council to\nmake it more representative. That entails bringing in as new\npermanent members countries which over the past 50 years\nhave acquired much greater weight than they had when the\nSecond World War ended.\nThe new realities of the international system have not\naffected only the developed world. Other regions have\nincreased their influence in a world which \u2014 although\n\u201cglobalized\u201d \u2014 is still extremely diverse.\nWhile maintaining its capacity for rapid\ndecision-making, which implies a small number of\nmembers, the Security Council needs to be expanded to\ntake all these factors into account. That will mean making\nthe present categories of membership more flexible, while\nalways maintaining geographical balance.\nOf course, we agree with all the countries of Latin\nAmerica and the Caribbean that any expansion of the\nCouncil should provide for an increase in the\nrepresentation of our region, which in recent decades has\nacquired a greater international presence and has shown\nitself always ready to undertake responsibilities in the\nstrengthening of international security.\nNevertheless, the reform needed in the United\nNations goes far beyond the Security Council. Important\nreforms also remain to be carried out in the economic and\nsocial sphere, through which it will be possible to\npromote greater efficiency in the discharge of the major\ntasks of eliminating poverty, protecting the most\ndisadvantaged social groups, creating employment,\nprotecting the environment and strengthening free trade.\nIn these and other areas, we also expect important\ninitiatives from this Assembly.\nFinally, the financial situation of the United Nations\nhas been a cause of concern to us all. This situation is\nlargely due to the many additional tasks the Organization\nhas had to take on in recent times. But we share the idea\nthat, rather than endlessly increasing contributions, it is\nimportant to take up the urgent task of rationalizing\nexpenditure and setting adequate priorities for our\nactivities. We greatly value the initiatives the Secretary-\nGeneral has been taking in this direction, and we assure\nhim of our full support in his efforts to adapt our\nOrganization to the new realities.\nOver the past 10 years, Latin America has\nundergone far-reaching structural changes in the direction\nof democracy, respect for human rights and economic\nreform. Now we are also making an effort to attack the\nmajor problems of poverty and inequality that blight us,\nand to eliminate once and for all the scourges of drug\ntrafficking and corruption.\nChile, as an integral part of the community of Latin\nAmerica and the Caribbean, is a country of social peace\nand continuing development. Our economy has\nexperienced sustained growth rates and our country is\ndetermined to consolidate the democratic process and\nattain justice and social equity.\n20\n\n\nAs a country that is open to the world, we have\nexpressed our readiness to assume in full the international\nresponsibilities incumbent on us in the common task of\nbringing about peace, security and development. We are\nconvinced that this Organization, which we helped to found\nfifty years ago, will continue to be the main multilateral\nvehicle for our proposals, our contributions and our dreams.\n"

        "file_text": "It is with great pleasure that\nI join previous speakers in congratulating Mr. Diogo\nFreitas do Amaral on his election to the presidency of the\nGeneral Assembly at its fiftieth session. It is a great\nhonour and a great challenge to be serving in that\ncapacity at a time when the United Nations is marking its\nfirst 50 years of existence, and when people are hoping\nfor a better world \u2014 as Mr. do Amaral noted in his\nstatement last week \u2014 through peace, freedom, justice,\neducation, health and development.\nFifty years ago, the United Nations was formed to\nbring all nations of the world together to work for peace\nand development based on the principles of justice,\nhuman dignity and the well-being of all people. The\nUnited Nations aim of promoting international\ncooperation is still alive half a century later, although it\nis facing more challenges than ever before.\nLithuania itself is facing, and meeting, new\nchallenges. In the less than six years since the\nreestablishment of independence, Lithuania has enshrined\n24\n\n\ndemocratic values in its constitution, established the rule of\nlaw, promoted human rights and implemented free-market\neconomic reforms. Our foreign policy is based on respect\nfor international law, national sovereignty, human rights and\npeaceful coexistence among nations \u2014 especially our most\nimmediate neighbours. The best testimony to our good-\nneighbourly relations is provided by the treaties we have\nconcluded with all neighbouring States; they were a result\nof hard work and compromise. It is our view that they\nconstitute a major contribution to the security of the region\nand of the entire world.\nOur other foreign-policy goals are also clearly defined.\nLithuania is striving for full integration into European\npolitical, economic and collective-security structures. As an\nassociate member of the European Union, our ultimate goal\nis full membership in the Union. Membership in the North\nAtlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and in the Western\nEuropean Union (WEU) is also a high priority. We look\nforward to continuing our cooperation with and our active\nparticipation in regional organizations such as the\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe\n(OSCE) and the Council of Europe.\nThe United Nations is facing new challenges today. A\nhalf-century later it is not only proper to assess the\nOrganization\u2019s performance, but also necessary to prepare\nit for the new demands and problems resulting from the\ndramatic changes that have come about since the end of the\ncold war. The number and importance of the challenges that\nface the United Nations call for reforms. The United\nNations is expected to solve many problems, such as armed\nconflicts, human rights violations, the poverty gap and\nhumanitarian crises. The problems presented by conflicts\nsuch as those in the former Yugoslavia, Afghanistan,\nLiberia, Rwanda, Burundi and Somalia are in many ways\nunprecedented. The United Nations is expected to provide\ndevelopment assistance and emergency relief to refugees. It\nis expected to promote democracy and to safeguard the\nhealth and rights of women and children. The United\nNations is expected to play a leading role in solving\nenvironmental and population problems and in securing\nsustainable development. It is expected to prevent the\nspread of weapons of mass destruction.\nIf the United Nations is to live up to these\nexpectations, Member States will have to provide it with\nthe necessary means to do so. For this reason, Lithuania\nattaches importance to the efforts aimed at the\nrevitalization, strengthening and reform of the United\nNations system, and will follow with interest the initiatives\ndirected towards that goal. Good management in the\nSecretariat is an important tool in achieving that goal.\nBetter productivity and increased cost-effectiveness, as\nwell as accountability and responsibility, can make a\ndifference in creating a more mission-driven and result-\noriented Organization. Energies and resources within the\nUnited Nations system need to be utilized in a more\neffective and coordinated manner if the Organization is to\nmeet the challenges that lie ahead.\nLikewise, there is a need for integrated policies to\naddress these global problems, which too often are treated\nas separate questions. In that regard, we see a close\nconnection between \u201cAn Agenda for Peace\u201d and \u201cAn\nAgenda for Development\u201d, and are in full agreement that\nthe quest for peace and security should not divert\nattention from other fundamental objectives of the\nOrganization, especially in the fields of economic and\nsocial development.\nAnother priority for a revitalized United Nations is\nreform of the Security Council. Lithuania supports\ncontinued discussion on the transparency of the work of\nthe Security Council. Recent informal arrangements to\nimprove consultation on peace-keeping between the\nSecretariat, the Security Council and troop contributors\nshould be further developed. The Security Council must\nbe more representative of the greatly expanded\nmembership of the United Nations, and it has to take into\naccount the interests of small States and of all regions,\nincluding those of Central and Eastern Europe. We\nbelieve that an increase in the overall membership of the\nCouncil is needed and that an increase in the permanent\nmembership should reflect current geopolitical realities. In\nthis context, Lithuania supports an increase in the number\nof permanent members of the Security Council with new\nmembers to come from among countries that make an\nexceptional contribution to the activities of the United\nNations. This would significantly strengthen the authority\nand capability of the United Nations as a whole. It goes\nwithout saying that reform of the Security Council should\nnot decrease its effectiveness or its efficient functioning.\nThe tremendous increase in and complexity of\npeace-keeping operations in recent years clearly signals\nthe need for change. We cannot ignore the financial\nconsequences of this increase. The budget for peace-\nkeeping operations currently amounts to approximately\n$3.6 billion. We must strengthen preventive diplomacy in\norder to avoid overextending our capabilities in the area\nof peace-keeping. Nevertheless, Lithuania will continue to\nplay its part in peace-keeping, as it is already doing in the\nUnited Nations Confidence Restoration Operation in\n25\n\n\nCroatia (UNCRO); it stands ready to do more. The third\nplatoon of Lithuanian peace-keepers is now serving in\nCroatia within the Danish battalion. We are actively\nparticipating in the NATO Partnership for Peace\nprogramme and are moving forward on the formation and\ntraining of a Baltic peace-keeping battalion.\nLithuania also welcomes the growing interaction\nbetween the United Nations and regional organizations,\nsuch as the OSCE and NATO, in the field of peace-keeping\noperations. This approach enables regional organizations to\nshare the common burden of peace-keeping functions and\nto contribute, together with the United Nations, to the\nmaintenance of peace and security. OSCE missions are\nactively promoting peaceful political solutions to regional\ncrises in Chechnya, Georgia, Nagorny-Karabakh, Tajikistan\nand elsewhere.\nAlthough Lithuania believes that European countries\nshould try to solve their own problems in the framework of\nthe OSCE before turning to the United Nations, we hope\nthat cooperation between the OSCE and the United Nations\nwill be strengthened in areas of common concern,\nparticularly on issues concerning stability and security in\nthe OSCE area. Further work needs to be done in\ndeveloping a standard set of principles for peace-keeping\nactivities undertaken by individual States or third parties.\nAny strategy for preventing armed conflicts should\ninvolve disarmament and non-proliferation objectives. The\neasy availability of arms contributes to the scale of\nsuffering in conflict situations as well as to the outbreak of\nconflict itself. Lithuania wholeheartedly supported the\nindefinite and unconditional extension of the Treaty on the\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), because it\nviews the Treaty as a crucial instrument for preventing the\nspread of nuclear weapons and for reducing existing stocks.\nWe recognize that, although the threat posed by\nnuclear weapons is of prime concern, the ongoing use of\nconventional weapons is equally dangerous. There is a need\nfor States to exercise greater responsibility and restraint in\ntheir arms transfers. The United Nations Register of\nConventional Arms has led to greater transparency, but a\ncode of conduct for conventional arms transfers could set\nout common principles to be observed in this area.\nDrug trafficking and associated international crime are\nanother growing threat to the security and well-being of\nnations and peoples. We give our full support to the United\nNations International Drug Control Programme, which has\nthe responsibility of leading the global fight against this\nscourge. In view of the continuous and growing rise in\ndrug-related problems throughout the world, including in\nour region, we encourage closer cooperation in this area.\nThe situation in Rwanda and in former Yugoslavia\nis uppermost in our minds, as are other armed conflicts\ncloser to home, which have resulted in bloodshed and\nsystematic violations of human rights. Racial and ethnic\nhatred have led to particularly inhumane behaviour. These\nhorrible lessons must never be forgotten; nor should these\ncrimes against humanity go unpunished. This is why we\nare in favour of strengthening mechanisms to monitor and\nprotect human rights by fully implementing the mandate\nof the United Nations High Commissioner for Human\nRights, and by strengthening the Centre for Human\nRights. In order to avoid duplication, we encourage\nfurther coordination of United Nations human rights\nactivities with regional bodies carrying out similar\nmandates.\nLithuania also feels that the mandate for peace-\nkeeping operations could include a human rights\ncomponent with clearly established reporting and\nverification procedures. When terrible crimes are\ncommitted and when human rights are systematically\nviolated despite all efforts, Lithuania believes that those\nresponsible, including the actual perpetrators, should be\nprosecuted. We thus support moves to establish a\npermanent international criminal court which would have\njurisdiction over serious crimes of international concern,\nwherever they occur.\nLithuania places great importance on the work of the\nUnited Nations Development Programme (UNDP) as the\nprincipal funding agency and coordinator of United\nNations technical and development assistance. Since the\nestablishment of the UNDP office in Vilnius in 1992, my\nGovernment, with support from UNDP, has launched\nprogrammes in such priority sectors as democratization\nand the development of civil society, public\nadministration reform and the social impact of transition.\nWe are especially grateful for UNDP assistance in the\npreparation of our 1995 national development report.\nMy Government reaffirms the need for the full\nintegration of countries with economies in transition into\nthe world economy and for continued United Nations\nsupport in achieving that goal. We see the concept of\ntransition as a temporary one, which at this point in time\nidentifies the special needs and immediate concerns of\n26\n\n\ncountries undergoing fundamental political, economic and\nsocial transformation. We hope that these needs and\nconcerns will be reflected in \u201cAn Agenda for\nDevelopment\u201d. Lithuania recognizes the fine work done by\nthe Economic Commission for Europe in diagnosing the\nproblems of transitional economies and in preparing useful\nrecommendations.\nI also wish to take this opportunity to acknowledge the\nwork of the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) in\nmy country. UNICEF has provided much-appreciated\ntechnical and advisory services on meeting global objectives\nfor the welfare of children.\nRecent major international conferences in Rio de\nJaneiro, Cairo, Copenhagen and Beijing have addressed\nimportant strategies and goals for development. Coordinated\nfollow-up and implementation of the recommendations of\nthese conferences will require not only the commitment of\nGovernments, but greater coordination in United Nations\noperational activities and improved coherence in\nprogrammes.\nFully recognizing and supporting the obligation of all\nMember States to pay their contributions in full and on\ntime, Lithuania also believes in the principle of sovereign\nequality, that is the equal rights of all Member States. In\nour case, those rights were violated by the assignment in\n1992 of inequitable assessment rates to the Baltic States\nand the countries of the Commonwealth of Independent\nStates (CIS), which were above the capacity of those States\nto pay. We have participated in the work of the high-level\nworking group on the financial situation of the United\nNations and have followed the work of the working group\non the principle of capacity to pay. We welcome the partial\nimprovement in our rates of assessment due to the 50 per\ncent phasing out of the scheme of limits for 1995-1997.\nNext month the Lithuanian Committee for the Fiftieth\nAnniversary of the United Nations will commemorate this\nanniversary with an impressive programme. Emphasis is\nbeing placed on youth education, the main themes on the\nagenda of the United Nations and the achievements of the\nOrganization over the past five decades. We must, however,\nremind ourselves of what the United Nations has not yet\nachieved. Let us hope that those unattained goals will\ninspire us to move forward with the same vision and\ncommitment as the founders of the United Nations did 50\nyears ago.\n"

        "file_text": "It is a great pleasure to see\nMr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral presiding over the important\nproceedings of the fiftieth session of the General Assembly.\nWe are confident that under his guidance this session will\nbe a great success.\nThe fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations gives\nus a reason and an opportunity to reflect on the state of\nthe United Nations and on the question of its ability to\nadjust to a changing world. This is especially necessary\nin our times. We have witnessed in the short span of the\nlast few years a variety of changes which have affirmed\nthe global nature of all the basic issues facing mankind.\nAn array of United Nations conferences and summits\nhas strengthened our common awareness of the global\nnature of environmental and development issues,\nincluding those related to social development. The world-\nwide tendency towards democracy and the freedom of the\nindividual has strengthened the world-wide cause of\nhuman rights. The notion of our common security is\nbeing redefined and globalized. It now contains not only\nmilitary and political, but also economic, social and\nenvironmental components.\nThis session of the General Assembly began less\nthan two weeks after the conclusion of the Fourth World\nConference on Women. That conference amply\ndemonstrated the depth and the global nature of the\nchanges that are at hand. The equality of women and the\nrealization of the human rights of women are now among\nthe priority issues on the international agenda.\nThe United Nations has highlighted the sensitivity of\nthe organized international community to the crucial\nissues facing the world and the Organization\u2019s ability to\nprovide a framework for articulating the main objectives\nand commitments. It has also demonstrated the ability to\n\n\nformulate principal policy objectives. On the other hand,\nhowever, the United Nations has yet to prove its ability to\norganize effective international cooperation for the\nrealization of voluntary, agreed objectives and\ncommitments. This is a more difficult task, and much is left\nto be desired in our fulfilment of it.\nFurthermore, it is in this context that the question of\nreform of the United Nations system arises. Reforms are\nneeded to respond to profound changes in international\nrelations and should be much more far-reaching and\ncarefully focused than is currently the case. So, for\nexample, reforms in the economic and social domains\nshould duly take into account the transformation of the\nworld economy and the ever growing importance of market\nforces, private-initiative entrepreneurship and free trade. In\nthese circumstances there is no place for the creation of\nunnecessary supra-State structures. What is needed,\nhowever, is carefully targeted operational cooperation for\ndevelopment and high-level dialogue capable of assisting\nMember States to formulate the most effective economic\nand social policies.\nThe functional commissions of the Economic and\nSocial Council should become places where decision\nmakers both from Governments and from non-governmental\nsectors meet and devise specific strategies. New schemes of\ncooperation among governmental and non-governmental\nsectors are needed, not least to develop appropriate models\nfor financing the relevant priorities in the fields of\nenvironment and social development.\nCareful thinking and responsible action are necessary\nfor the strengthening of international peace and security.\nEach of the diverse priorities in this domain will require\nserious efforts if satisfactory solutions are to be possible.\nHowever, there are also fears that the will to reach them\nhas not yet been mobilized.\nAnother priority area of United Nations action for the\nstrengthening of international peace and security concerns\nthe necessary reform of the principal United Nations body\nin this field, the Security Council. An awareness of the\nneed to strengthen the representative character and the\neffectiveness of the Security Council through expansion of\nits membership is now generally shared. Slovenia is among\nthose Members of the United Nations which support the\nidea of appropriate expansion of the number of both\npermanent and non-permanent seats on the Security\nCouncil. This is the majority view now. Furthermore, we\nbelieve that in order to reflect adequately the political and\neconomic realities of our time it is important that Germany\nand Japan should become permanent members of the\nSecurity Council.\nIn the framework of the proposed reform, we should\nask ourselves what the future role of the United Nations\nought to be. After the fall of the Berlin Wall, after the\ndisappearance of the communist bloc, there is a new\nsituation in the world. The process is basically positive,\nbut in the first years after the big change there are still\nmany questions to be answered. The world must find new\nstability, a new balance. The danger of regional conflicts\nand wars has increased. The international community did\nnot find adequate responses to specific situations, such as\nthose in Somalia and Bosnia and Herzegovina.\nBut we cannot simply say that international\ninstitutions, including the United Nations, were inefficient\nin dealing with these situations. The humanitarian\nendeavour and contribution were significant. Many\nremarkable efforts were put into solutions \u2014 efforts by\nindividuals and by institutions. But it remains clear that\nthe world must find answers to the new challenges.\nThe situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina is a very\ngood example. It is an important case in itself, but it is\nalso a very important precedent to be considered in the\nfuture. The response of the world to the situation in the\nformer Yugoslavia was slow. Preventive diplomacy failed\nin this case, as in many other crises, as a result of the\nnormal behaviour of the majority of politicians, who\nusually give priority to domestic situations and problems.\nBut in the case of Bosnia and Herzegovina there is\nanother very important dimension of the problem: a\nsolution or the absence of a solution will influence the\nfuture.\nHow will the post-cold-war world develop? Will\nthere be efficient international coordination, mainly within\nthe United Nations, to take care of such problems and\ncrises? Or shall we go back to the old division of the\nworld and of Europe: the division, in interest spheres,\namong classic Powers \u2014 the traditional interest spheres\nof the most important countries?\nIt is obvious that in the case of Bosnia and\nHerzegovina there was some mix of the two approaches.\nThere was an international effort in the framework of the\nUnited Nations, and there were differences among some\npower States with different opinions about the situation.\nBosnia and Herzegovina is where the First World War\nstarted, when the old European Powers tried to expand\ntheir interest zones. The former Yugoslavia was at the\n2\n\n\ncrossroads of many interests and is where so many horrors\nand killings took place during the Second World War. And\nthere are some signs that the international community has\nnot yet completely overcome such historical divisions and\ninfluences.\nOn the other hand, we cannot say that this historical\napproach prevailed in tackling the situation in Bosnia and\nHerzegovina. There was also strong international action in\nthe name of the universal order and universal values, in the\nname of the protection of human rights, in the name of the\nprotection of the rights of all nations. It is very encouraging\nthat we recently witnessed really serious activity, a very\nserious peace plan. Diplomatic activity combined with the\nnecessary military action has for the first time provided a\nrealistic chance to stop the war and the killing in Bosnia\nand Herzegovina and to establish a durable peace and the\nprospect of stability in the region.\nIf these activities succeed, they will be an extremely\nimportant model for the future, for further development of\ninternational coordination in the framework of the United\nNations. If the international community is able to solve\nsuch an extremely difficult case as that of Bosnia and\nHerzegovina we shall all be encouraged to direct new\nenergy and efforts towards establishing global instruments\nand activities to prevent and to solve future crises. The\ninternational community will strengthen its institutions in\nsupport of universal values and rights.\nIf it fails in this case the situation will be just the\nopposite. The road will be open to anarchy, chaos and\nregional wars, to the rule of the stronger, to the old\npractices of spheres of interest, and the world will not find\na way out of the post-cold-war situation. Instability will\nincrease, and the chances of regional and global wars will\nbe greater.\nSo we are at a very important moment in history and\nin the functioning of the United Nations. If the fiftieth\nanniversary of the United Nations is celebrated with success\nin finally solving the crisis in the former Yugoslavia, this\nwill be the best reward for everybody who, over the past 50\nyears, has sacrificed his time, his energy or even his life for\nthe establishment of a world of freedom, stability and\ninternational cooperation.\nOf course, there are many problems to be solved in\nthe future. The United Nations will have to develop\nefficient instruments of preventive diplomacy and means of\nhandling crises if they occur anyway and of defining the\ncriteria as to when and how to intervene. As is very evident\nfrom the case of Bosnia and Herzegovina, it is not always\neasy to achieve a unanimous definition of \u201cthe bad guys\u201d\nin the world order or to agree upon action against them.\nBut there are human rights criteria, and there are\nuniversal values that were developed in the world over\nthe centuries, and especially during recent decades. These\nhave to be respected and implemented.\nLuckily, Slovenia was out of the Yugoslav crisis at\na very early stage and established its independence four\nyears ago. Now we have a very prosperous State with\ngood democratic performance and very good economic\ndevelopment. Slovenia is considered one of the best\ncountries, if not the best country, in transition to the\nmarket and democratic system. We are also prepared to\nmake our contribution to building the international\ninstitutions and the coordination that will lead to greater\nstability in the world. We see our future as being in\ninternational institutions like the North Atlantic Treaty\nOrganization (NATO) and the European Union. We look\nupon such bodies not only as economic or defence\ninstitutions but also as institutions that should ensure\ngreater stability in the world, greater democracy and the\ndevelopment of universal principles of individual and\ncollective human rights.\nBut we can see that the way is not easy. Even in our\nown neighbourhood we face some remnants of the past.\nThis is just one further reason for our insistence on\nrespect by everybody, and not just by the smaller and the\nweaker countries, for principle in international relations,\ndemocracy and universal values. This is the only\nguarantee of international peace and stability. Clearly, if\nwe start to correct the past and the present on the basis of\nsome historical tendencies of domination, there will be no\nway of securing the future stability of the world. The\nsolution lies only in overcoming such practices and\nattitudes and in establishing international cooperation,\npeace and stability on the basis of respect for each other\nand for universal human rights.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, on this important occasion, allow me to\nextend the congratulations of the people and Government\nof Peru upon your distinguished and well-deserved\nelection to preside over the work of the fiftieth session of\nthe General Assembly. We are confident that your broad\nexperience and ability will make Portugal\u2019s presidency a\nhigh-water mark in this exceptional anniversary marking\nhalf a century of the United Nations Organization.\nPeru, like all the nations gathered here, is facing a\ntime of awesome changes in social, political and\neconomic practices and in international equilibria as this\ncentury draws to a close. Those changes have altered our\nvision of the world and introduced positive elements of\ncardinal importance, but have also left questions and\nshadows that cause the greatest concern. Moreover, the\nshared approaches that have characterized these last few\nyears do not in themselves resolve many of the\nsubstantive problems of the international system, such as\nthose pertaining to collective security, economic and\nsocial development and the defence of the perennial\nvalues that guarantee a worthy and peaceful life for\npeoples and individuals.\nDuring the space of a decade my country\nexperienced the worst social, political and economic crisis\nin its 174 years of history as an independent nation. A\npainful and futile internal conflict, brought on by\nintransigence and ideological utopianism, added to the\nwaste of public resources and Governments overwhelmed\nby the nation\u2019s problems, led Peru into a deep internal\ncrisis with grave international consequences. Over the last\n10\n\n\nfive years, the Government of President Alberto Fujimori\nhas succeeded in overcoming the internal confrontation,\nrestoring a healthy and vigorous economic order and re-\nestablishing Peru\u2019s international ties. In this context, it is\nvery important to stress that we have set forth on the way\nto turning external difficulties into patterns of normalcy and\nthe potential consolidation of our relations with\nneighbouring countries, with which we wish above all to\ncultivate cooperation.\nAll of us here are aware that threats to international\npeace and security arise from the deterioration of the social,\neconomic and institutional fabric of States, and that their\nworst effects, such as internal armed conflicts, drug\ntrafficking, corruption and the inevitable sequel of those\nills, poverty, are the seed-bed in which international\nconflicts tend to germinate. And all sensible people also\nknow that the antidote to those ills is to be found in the\npermanent values common to all of mankind\u2019s great\ncivilizations, the values that should guide the effective\neffort of the international community to overcome those\nacute evils.\nWe have left behind the international system\ndominated by the cold war between the super-Powers and\nthe absurd faith in philosophical and political determinism.\nIf we wish to build a world of justice and peace, we must\ndispense with the rhetorical exercises to which we became\naccustomed during that fortunately bygone era. We need\nobjective points of reference for the international system\nthat will avoid unilateral interpretations or interpretations\nthat disregard the principles in force to bring about civilized\ncoexistence among nations. And this requires us to refute\nthe cynical idea that the values of the international system\ndo not exist, or that they are entirely subordinate to\nrelations of force between nations.\nAll of this implies taking initiatives to enhance and\ndefend objective principles of international law, as the only\npossible foundation for the present international system. We\nsee with great concern how ethnic, geographical and\nutopian myths and revisionisms are becoming a boundless\nsource of suffering for millions of men and women in our\ntime, gravely disturbing fragile international balances.\nThe struggle of the Cold War undermined the legal\nprinciples concerning avoidance of the use of force, respect\nfor international treaties and the principle of\nnon-intervention. Today, we have a duty to look upon\ninternational law with a new gaze; we must understand that,\nalthough international law does not in itself resolve the\nworld\u2019s problems, it will make this world safer and more\nhabitable, and ensure that its points of reference are more\nstable. We have before us the intellectual challenge of\nclarifying the content of the central rules of international\nlaw in order to strengthen their legitimacy, and we also\nhave the obligation to improve the effectiveness of\ninternational law, in both bilateral and multilateral\nrelations.\nAt the same time, we must not overlook the fact that\nthe security and development of nations rests, today more\nthan ever, upon respect for the social and intellectual\nfeatures that are peculiar to each culture, unquestionably\nfalling within a universal conception based on respect for\nindividual freedoms. We must resist attempts to impose\nuniform \u201cmodels\u201d that prejudge and discriminate between\nthe world\u2019s varying cultural forms. We must seek unity in\ndiversity and must not accept conditionalities that are\noften advanced by groups foreign to the democratic\nrepresentation of States, whose effects upon our cultures\nare negative.\nThere are those who argue that, having overcome the\nideological conflict that divided the world for 45 years,\nwe are now entering into a conflict of civilizations as the\nlast phase in the evolution of the modern world\u2019s\nconflicts. Without accepting the determinism implicit in\nthat view, we cannot fail to observe that a lack of respect\nfor the cultural diversity of the human species could\nindeed become a source of profound disputes.\nThere has also been talk of the vanishing sovereignty\nof States as a fait accompli, and it is claimed that this\nwould legitimize asymmetrical intervention by some\nnations in the lives of other nations. The word\n\u201csovereignty\u201d evokes armies, ships and cannons and has\nan ominous ring to it. However, if we take an objective\nview of the matter, we cannot affirm that this is so. In its\nessence, sovereignty is above all plenary legal and\npolitical competence within a constitutional order. If we\nare today actively seeking integration in many regions of\nthe world and if States, through various multilateral\ntreaties, are diminishing their jurisdiction over certain\naspects of their economic and social life, that is taking\nplace because States, in the exercise of that plenary\ncompetence known as sovereignty, are voluntarily\ndelegating the exercise of specific jurisdictions to an\ninternational organization for the greater good of a\nparticular international space. In so doing, States do not\nderogate from their constitutions nor do they lose their\ncapacity to conclude international treaties as they see fit\nor to legislate on countless other matters. And so we\nbelieve that those who are seeking new legal and political\n11\n\n\ndefinitions of sovereignty should take care to respect its\nessence, which is nothing other than respect for the\nconstitutional independence of the various countries of the\nworld.\nPeru opted for a republican and democratic regime\nbased on a division of powers and officials elected by free\nand universal suffrage. Its government is a limited\ngovernment that leaves broad areas of social, political and\neconomic life open to the free choice of its citizens.\nHowever, this limited Government is not a minimal State\nwithout social functions, for it has active responsibilities\nand an important agenda to pursue in order to free the\npoorest citizens from a culture of dependency and integrate\nthem fully into the life of the country. Peru seeks to\nharmonize transmission of the valuable cultural traditions of\nits people with the imperative needs of an open regionalism\nand the defence of a coherent, legitimate and just\ninternational order.\nBasing itself upon those principles and aspirations,\nPeru welcomes the thinking that is taking place during this\nfiftieth anniversary of the United Nations and believes that\nthe Organization should give serious thought to its future\nand to the course which international society is taking, so\nas to achieve a more complete vision encompassing\ndifferent international realities based upon mutual respect\nand fairness among Member States. We must take into\naccount the new regional realities and seek machinery that\nis functional, economical and efficient, not hampered by\nsecondary issues or limited to powerlessly denouncing the\ncontradictions of the international system, in order to ensure\nthat the United Nations can be faithful to the purposes and\nprinciples that inspired its creation.\nWe believe that we must discard the pragmatism that\nstyles itself realism and defend the fundamental principles\nof a balanced and just international order. Peruvians believe\nin defending the perennial values of mankind, individual\nfreedoms, international law as an objective benchmark for\ninternational order, respect for the world\u2019s cultures and the\nconstitutional independence of all the world\u2019s nations. With\nthese beliefs, we pledge ourselves anew to the renewal of\nthe international system.\n"

        "file_text": "Let me, at the outset,\ncongratulate His Excellency Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral\non his unanimous election as President of the fiftieth\nsession of the General Assembly. His wide diplomatic\nexperience and intellectual abilities reinforce our confidence\nin his stewardship. I wish him success in the heavy task\nbefore us.\nI also pay tribute to his predecessor, His Excellency\nMr. Amara Essy, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of C\u00f4te\nd\u2019Ivoire, who ably presided over the forty-ninth session\nof the General Assembly.\nWe commend the Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros\nBoutros-Ghali, for the untiring and visionary manner in\nwhich he is managing the affairs of the Organization.\nKenya is fully committed to the ideals of this\nOrganization. Indeed, Kenya\u2019s motto, \u201cHarambee\u201d which\nmeans \u201cpull together\u201d, and the national philosophy of\npeace, love and unity, are fitting expressions of what the\nUnited Nations and the Kenyan people aspire to. Kenya\nhas always championed the principles of democracy and\nthe pursuit of socio-economic development to enhance the\nliving standards of the people.\nUnder the leadership of His Excellency President\nDaniel T. Arap Moi, Kenya has undertaken far-reaching\npolitical and economic reforms, whose benefits we are\nbeginning to see. Our economy is now totally liberalized\nin keeping with our tradition of providing an environment\nconducive to enterprise development. Our democratic\ninstitutions have developed the necessary flexibility to\ncope with the new situations and to ensure continuity of\nthe political stability which the country has enjoyed since\nindependence.\nWe have observed a systematic campaign to\ndenigrate African countries. It is as though there were an\nagenda to bring them into international disrepute. We\nreject these destructive approaches designed to promote\ndivisive elements and to manipulate domestic public\nopinion with a view to pitting people against their own\nGovernments. Kenya also condemns in the strongest\nterms the tendency in certain sectors of the international\npress to present the image of African countries in terms\nof tribal superiority or inferiority, to inflame ethnic\nconflicts and to depict the continent as replete with\ncorruption and catastrophes. Africa deserves credit for its\narduous struggle against external domination. We are\ndetermined to create cohesive and prosperous States after\nmany years of destructive colonial policies of divide and\nrule, which constituted gross violations of human rights.\n11\n\n\nI wish to assure the Assembly that the Government\nand the people of Kenya are determined despite the odds to\ncontinue the struggle to forge national unity and to\naccelerate socio-economic development. Our commitment,\nwhich I underscore, to the principles of democracy, good\ngovernance, the protection and promotion of human rights\nand the rule of law remains firm.\nIt is against that background that I wish now to\naddress some of the issues on the agenda of the General\nAssembly. In the time since its inception, the United\nNations has evolved into a truly global organization, as\nenvisaged in the Charter. Its membership has grown from\n50 at its inception to 185 today. Its activities have ranged\nfrom decolonization, the codification of international law,\ndisarmament and conflict resolution to global humanitarian\nactivities and international economic cooperation. The\nachievements in these areas are, indeed, self-evident. The\ndemands on the Organization have, however, exerted\nmaximum pressure on its ability to cope. Hence the need\nfor the Organization to be revitalized at this opportune time.\nFive years after the end of the cold war the\ninternational community still faces a number of conflicts,\nwhich are of great concern as they continue to undermine\ninternational peace and security. These conflicts have posed\nserious challenges owing primarily to complexities\nassociated with their internal character. We nevertheless\nappreciate the flexibility with which the United Nations is\ndealing with these conflicts and the commendable successes\nwhich have been achieved in resolving a good number of\nthem. These achievements include the resolution of the\nconflicts in Namibia, Cambodia, Mozambique, El Salvador\nand Haiti. Success becomes even more pronounced when\nwe consider the extent to which the United Nations has\neffectively mobilized international humanitarian assistance\nin virtually all conflict areas, through the Office of the\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and other\nUnited Nations agencies.\nAt the forty-seventh session the General Assembly\nmandated the Secretary-General to pursue preventive\ndiplomacy and to strengthen the Secretariat\u2019s capacity to\ncope with situations likely to endanger international peace\nand security. To that end, the Secretary-General\u2019s initiatives\n\u201cAn Agenda for Peace\u201d and the subsequent Supplement to\nthat document have made a significant contribution to this\nimportant subject. I wish to record Kenya\u2019s appreciation to\nthe Secretary-General for his personal efforts and initiatives\nin search of lasting international peace and security. We\nlook forward to the results of the work of the informal\nworking groups that have been set up to consider in\ngreater depth the various elements contained in the Agenda.\nWe note the recent initiatives taken with a view to\nstrengthening the role of regional organizations in conflict\nresolution and conflict management. Kenya, however,\nwishes to reiterate that the thrust of the contributions of\nregional organizations and arrangements should be\ntargeted towards preventive diplomacy and peacemaking.\nWe submit that peace-keeping and peace enforcement\nshould remain the primary responsibility of the United\nNations. These responsibilities are enshrined in the\nCharter and cannot be transferred to regional\norganizations. We encourage closer cooperation in this\nregard between the Organization of African Unity (OAU)\nand the United Nations on the basis of the Charter and\nthe agreement on cooperation between the two\norganizations.\nWith regard to regional conflicts, Kenya welcomes\nthe important steps towards long-lasting peace that we\nhave recently witnessed in the southern part of Africa.\nFollowing the positive resolution of the conflict in\nMozambique, recent developments in Angola give us high\nexpectations for a durable solution of the protracted\nconflict in that sisterly country.\nAt a time when the world is championing the cause\nof peace, democracy and human rights, it is totally\nunacceptable that a band of mercenaries should overthrow\nthe Government of the Comoros and hold the President\nand Government officials captive. Kenya condemns this\nact in the strongest terms possible and calls on the\nSecurity Council to take necessary measures to rectify the\nsituation.\nWith respect to Liberia, we welcome the recent\nsigning of an agreement by all the warring parties, in\nwhich they have committed themselves to a programme\nfor the restoration of democracy to culminate in general\nelections in a year\u2019s time. The Economic Community of\nWest African States (ECOWAS) should be congratulated\nfor the efforts and sacrifices it has made in the search for\na lasting solution to the Liberian conflict. United Nations\ninvolvement in the resolution of the Liberia conflict,\nwhich has been minimal so far despite the magnitude of\nthe problem, should be enhanced. It is, therefore,\nimportant that the United Nations should enhance its\nsupport to the peace efforts in Liberia to ensure that the\nmomentum for peace is sustained.\n12\n\n\nIn the Middle East, the process towards durable peace\nachieved another important milestone with last week\u2019s\nsigning of a further agreement between Prime Minister\nYitzhak Rabin of Israel and Chairman Yasser Arafat of the\nPalestine Liberation Organization (PLO), extending\nPalestinian self-rule over the West Bank. We commend the\nvision and courage of these leaders and encourage them and\nother leaders in the region to broaden the peace process.\nThe situation in Somalia continues to be a matter of\ngreat concern to Kenya. As long as the situation in Somalia\nremains unstable, the countries of the region, and in\nparticular my own, will continue to experience problems\nassociated with the influx of refugees and with a lack of\nsecurity in the border region. While we commend\nhumanitarian efforts in Somalia, we are deeply concerned\nthat there has been no tangible progress in national and\npolitical reconciliation in that country. We call on the\nfactional leaders to put the interests of the Somali people\nfirst and to be cognizant of the fact that a lasting solution\nto the Somali problem lies with the Somali people and their\nleaders.\nThe conflict in the former Yugoslavia poses one of the\ngreatest challenges to the capacity of the United Nations to\nfacilitate the search for durable peace. We appreciate all the\ndiplomatic initiatives which have been undertaken to bring\nabout a negotiated settlement, and we encourage all the\nparties to intensify their efforts for lasting peace. I wish to\npay tribute to all United Nations military, civilian and\nhumanitarian personnel for the sacrifices they have made to\nadvance the cause of peace in that region. Kenya has made\na significant contribution to peace-keeping operations in the\nformer Yugoslavia, having contributed one battalion as well\nas military observers and civilian police over the last four\nyears.\nWe welcome the establishment of the International\nCommission of Inquiry to investigate the assassination of\nthe former Head of State and senior Government officials\nand the subsequent massacres of civilians in Burundi. We\nwould also welcome the establishment by the Security\nCouncil of a commission to oversee compliance with arms\nembargos against groups and individuals undermining peace\nand security in the Central African region.\nKenya stresses the importance of reconciliation and\ntolerance and appeals to the international community to\ncontinue to assist the countries of the Great Lakes region to\ndeal with the root causes of the problems that have\nbedevilled them for many years, as well as with their\nreconstruction efforts. In particular, the security of\npopulations and the resettlement of refugees must be\nadequately and comprehensively addressed.\nThe results of the Review and Extension Conference\nof the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\nNuclear Weapons, held in May this year, constitute a\nsignificant contribution to the realization of a nuclear-free\nworld. The commitments and the security assurances\nmade by the nuclear-weapon States to the non-nuclear-\nweapon States should strengthen the resolve of the\ninternational community towards the total elimination of\nnuclear weapons. It is therefore necessary that these\ncommitments be translated into binding international legal\ninstruments.\nKenya looks forward to the conclusion, by 1996, of\nthe comprehensive nuclear test-ban treaty. We join the\ninternational community in reiterating the call for strict\nobservance of the moratorium on nuclear testing pending\nthe conclusion of that treaty.\nThe world economy as a whole continues to show\nmodest growth, with the highest performance being\nexperienced in South-East Asia. However, many\neconomies in the African region are still sluggish,\nalthough there are signs of recovery. The continent\nremains highly vulnerable to adverse international\neconomic policies, as well as natural calamities, owing to\nits limited capacity to respond.\nKenya and many other African countries have\nundertaken major political and economic reforms despite\nthe enormous short-term adverse effects on the vulnerable\nsocial groups, particularly in regard to the escalating costs\nof, for instance, education, health and housing. These\nefforts, however, have been hampered by the decline in\nboth bilateral and multilateral financial support, resulting\nin limited prospects for economic growth. In this regard,\nwe urge the international community to provide adequate\nresources to support these reforms.\nAs the United Nations celebrates its fiftieth\nanniversary it is imperative that development support be\naccorded the priority that it obviously deserves. The\ninternational commitment relating to the fulfilment of the\nagreed target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product\nshould be given the necessary impetus to reverse the\ndeclining trend. Kenya appeals to the industrialized\ncountries to meet the official development assistance\ntarget and to provide new and additional resources to\nfinance the programmes adopted by the various United\nNations Conferences.\n13\n\n\nDebt-servicing obligations should not become an\nobstacle to efforts aimed at the creation of employment, the\nreduction of poverty and social integration. While we\nwelcome the various measures taken by the international\ncommunity, on bilateral and multilateral bases, to mitigate\nthe debt burden, it is evident that these measures have\nachieved only limited results. Kenya believes that a lasting\nsolution to the debt burden is a bold initiative for a more\neffective reduction, or cancellation, of both the bilateral and\nthe multilateral debt of the heavily indebted low-income\ncountries, particularly in Africa.\nWhile the liberalization of world trade, in the context\nof the World Trade Organization, is expected to benefit the\ninternational community, there are strong indications that\nthe results may not benefit all regions. The opening of the\nAfrican market to external competition has already put\nserious strain on the fragile industrial sector of these\ncountries. Furthermore, the phasing out of the preferential\ntrade arrangements extended to African and other\ndeveloping countries poses a serious threat to their\ntraditional markets. African countries therefore need support\nif they are to diversify their economies.\nIt is pertinent that \u201cAn Agenda for Development\u201d\nshould embrace all the programmes to which the\ninternational community has already committed, or will\ncommit, itself in the various international conferences,\nincluding the Rio Conference on Environment and\nDevelopment, the Cairo Conference on Population and\nDevelopment, the Copenhagen Summit for Social\nDevelopment, the Fourth World Conference on Women and\nthe forthcoming United Nations Conference on Human\nSettlements (HABITAT II), to be held in Istanbul, Turkey.\nIt is also important that HABITAT II come up with a\nconcrete plan of action that will give HABITAT, as the\nUnited Nations agency responsible for human settlements,\nan enhanced mandate, with an effective capacity to assist\nMember States, particularly developing countries, to deal\nwith the increased problems of human settlements and thus\nenable them to have adequate shelter \u2014 one of the\nfundamental human rights.\nIt is imperative that the Agenda accord the highest\npriority to the development of national and regional\ncapacities. It should also be people-centred, with the\nemphasis on human-resources development, the application\nof science and technology and the expansion of\nemployment and income-generating opportunities.\nAt the global level, the United Nations Economic\nand Social Council should not only assume effective\ncoordination of the international policies and activities of\nthe specialized agencies but also ensure the mobilization\nof resources for operational activities which are critical\nfor the realization of socio-economic development.\nThe fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations\nprovides a great opportunity for the international\ncommunity to focus constructively on the measures that\nshould be taken to revitalize the Organization on the basis\nof the experience gained and the challenges ahead. Kenya\nis of the view that the Organization has proved its\neffectiveness and flexibility in dealing with complex and\nwide-ranging international issues. The United Nations,\ntherefore, does not require radical transformation but,\nrather, the strengthening and modification of its structures\nand organs to enhance its effectiveness and\nresponsiveness to new priorities and strategies.\nIt is vital that the Organization continue to cater\nadequately for both international peace and security and\ncooperation for development, in accordance with the\nCharter. Revitalization of the United Nations entails not\nonly the need to streamline the administrative structures\nof the Organization but also the need to ensure that it is\nprovided with adequate resources, on a regular and\nassured basis, to enable it to execute the mandates\nentrusted to it by the Member States.\nThe report of the ad hoc Open-ended Working\nGroup on reform of the Security Council has highlighted\nthe pertinent areas requiring reform. There is consensus\non the need to expand the membership of the Council.\nKenya urges greater flexibility in the positions taken so\nthat agreement can be reached on the number and\ndistribution of the additional seats on the basis of\nequitable geographical distribution for all categories. This\ncould be achieved through expansion of the membership\nto include more countries from the regions that are\ncurrently underrepresented and by effecting periodic\nreviews of the permanent membership to take account of\nthe evolving realities of the world situation.\nWith regard to the question of financing, we are\nconcerned that the operations of the Organization have\nbeen greatly hampered by the failure of many Member\nStates to honour their budgetary obligations in full and on\ntime. Irrespective of the outcome of the reform process,\nthe timely payment of United Nations apportionments will\ncontinue to be of crucial importance to the financial\nsoundness of the Organization. The financing of the\n14\n\n\nOrganization is a collective responsibility of all the Member\nStates. Unilateral actions relating to budgetary contributions\nare therefore inconsistent with the provisions of the Charter.\nIt is only through necessary and thorough assessment of the\nindividual countries\u2019 capacity to pay that the scale of\nassessments can be adjusted.\nAs the United Nations continues to introduce measures\nto ensure the reduction of waste and to deal with the\nfinancial crisis, it is imperative that the Organization ensure\nthe maximum and rational use of the existing facilities. All\nmeetings and conferences under the auspices of United\nNations bodies should, to the extent possible, be held in\nNairobi \u2014 the only United Nations Centre in the whole of\nthe developing world.\nWe are, indeed, concerned about the very low\nutilization rate of the conference facilities in Nairobi\npointed out by the Secretary-General in his report on United\nNations Conference Services. In this regard, Kenya wishes\nto see the United Nations make full use of the facilities\navailable at the United Nations Centre in Gigiri, the\nheadquarters of the United Nations Environment\nProgramme (UNEP) and the United Nations Centre for\nHuman Settlements (HABITAT).\nKenya has offered to host in Nairobi the secretariat for\nthe Convention on Biological Diversity in order to make it\npossible to utilize the expertise and capacity which UNEP\nhas developed over the years. We look forward to the\nsupport of the international community in this regard.\nLet us not lose the opportunity offered by the fiftieth\nanniversary of the United Nations to renew our resolve to\nmake the Organization fulfil the aspirations of peace, hope\nand stability that inspired the founding fathers of this\nOrganization. As we move into the next millennium, we\nmust endeavour to make this world a better place to live in.\nKenya will play its part as necessary.\n"

        "file_text": "First of all, I wish to\nextend to Mr. Freitas do Amaral and his glorious country,\nPortugal, my delegation\u2019s heartfelt congratulations on his\nelection to the presidency of the fiftieth session of the\nUnited Nations General Assembly. I am certain that his\nleadership talent and experiences will enable us to meet the\nserious challenges that we face in today\u2019s quickly changing\nworld. I wish to assure him of our full cooperation.\nOn behalf of the Kingdom of Cambodia, I would like\nto join the heads of delegation who have preceded me in\nthe pleasant task of expressing thanks and admiration to the\nPresident of the forty-ninth session of the General\nAssembly, Mr. Amara Essy of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, for the\ntremendous contribution he made over the course of a\nproductive and historic year.\nThe Kingdom of Cambodia wishes also to thank the\nSecretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for his\nstrong and effective work, which has been so instrumental\nin the success of this Organization. We are all aware of the\nSecretary-General\u2019s great achievement in his handling of\nCambodia\u2019s problem. My country is very proud of him.\nCambodia now enjoys peace, freedom and democracy\nthanks to the representatives of all the Member States, who\nhave contributed so much in this peace process with us.\nCambodia wishes to pay special tribute to the courage of\nthe United Nations peace-keepers who died for peace and\nfreedom on Cambodian soil alongside thousands of other\ncompatriots.\nThe Royal Government of Cambodia is working in\nclose cooperation with the Special Representative of the\nSecretary-General in Cambodia, the Honourable Benny\nWidyono. His presence is of the utmost importance to\nCambodia. He performs his duty with excellence and is\nhighly commended by the Government and the people of\nCambodia.\nThe Kingdom of Cambodia appreciated the work of\nthe Honourable Justice Michael Kirby, the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s Special Representative for Human Rights in\nCambodia. Through close cooperation and regular\nconsultations with him, and the United Nations Centre for\nHuman Rights, steps are being taken to improve the\nhuman rights situation in the country. Cambodia,\nhowever, continues to support the presence and the work\nof the United Nations Centre for Human Rights. It is\nmaking valuable contributions to and recommendations\nfor the improvement of the overall situation in Cambodia.\nIt is with great honour and pride that I address this\nfiftieth session of the General Assembly, for the first\ntime, as the representative of the Kingdom of Cambodia.\nThe Royal Government today, under the leadership of\nboth the First Prime Minister, His Royal Highness Prince\nNorodom Ranariddh, and the Second Prime Minister,\nSamdech Hun Sen, is now more than two years old. It\nwas the result of a democratic election organized and\nsupervised by the United Nations. It is a product of the\nmultilateral efforts of the United Nations with the close\ncooperation of the Cambodian people, under the wise\nguidance and leadership of His Majesty King Norodom\nSihanouk Varman.\nThrough the determination of the Cambodian people,\nthe Kingdom of Cambodia today has emerged from a\nlong period of destruction and war, with many challenges\nand opportunities to build a better future. In the past two\nyears, the Royal Government has made important\nprogress and achieved some of the most important work\nin nation-building, peace-building and economic\ndevelopment.\nAfter the United Nations-sponsored election in May\n1993 the two main political parties combined their efforts\nand formed a coalition Government, which has shown\nitself to be able to work closely in an efficient manner.\nThese achievements were only possible with the support\nand assistance of the international community.\nWith peace-building, Cambodia has further\nconsolidated sustainable peace, security and stability,\nwhich are the necessary conditions for economic\ndevelopment and nation-building. We have been dealing\nwith the task of reforming the military, the police and the\n11\n\n\nadministration for some time now, in order to improve the\npublic sectors so that they can serve the needs and interests\nof the Cambodian people and the private sector. At the\nsame time, the Royal Government and the National\nAssembly are working very closely together to make\nCambodia a State based on the rule of law. Cambodia is\nnow concentrating more effort, time, energy and funds on\nnation-building and economic development. In this respect,\nCambodia is a nation in the making.\nOn the economic front, Cambodia is working closely\nwith international financial institutions, particularly the\nWorld Bank, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the\nAsian Development Bank and the Caisse Fran\u00e7aise pour le\nDeveloppement to ensure that the process of rehabilitation\nand transition to a market economy is well under way.\nDespite some difficulties during the period immediately\nfollowing the elections, progress in economic development\nthus far is very encouraging. According to the latest report\nfrom the IMF, dated 15 September 1995,\n\u201cThe improved financial discipline has led to an\nincreasingly stable economic environment, as is\nevident in the stability of the exchange rate after the\nwide fluctuations of previous years.\u201d\n\nFor the period from 1995 to 1997 the Kingdom of\nCambodia is targeting a 7 per cent growth rate. The\ninflation rate was brought down from 200 per cent for the\nperiod before the election to 31 per cent in 1993 and to 18\nper cent in 1994. An inflation rate of below 10 per cent has\nbeen projected for 1995. These improvements are linked to\nthe pursuit of structural reforms in the financial sector, civil\nservice, military and public enterprises. It is important to\nnote here that a privatization law was adopted in December\n1994, and private investments approved and formalized by\nthe Council for the Development of Cambodia from August\n1994 to May 1995 are estimated at $2.5 billion, compared\nto $621 million of private investment approved during the\n1991 to 1993 period.\nThe Royal Government is pleased to inform you, Sir,\nand the Assembly that the National Programme to\nRehabilitate and Develop Cambodia has made great\nprogress in articulating the Government\u2019s overall and\nsectoral policies and programmes.\nThe United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)\nFirst Country Programme for Cambodia for 1994-1995 has\nhelped establish three important priorities: first,\nmodernizing and restructuring the country; secondly,\npoverty alleviation and sustainable management of the\nenvironment; and, thirdly, natural resources.\nIn this regard, Cambodia wishes to thank the\nSecretary-General for his appeal for the implementation\nof the Programme of Action for the Least Developed\nCountries for the 1990s, especially for the five main\nobjectives: first, the lifting of the debt burden; secondly,\na greater flow of finance to the least developed countries\n(LDCs); thirdly, a more favourable trade environment for\nthe LDCs; fourthly, encouragement for partnership in\nLDCs; and, fifthly, a proper infrastructure within LDCs.\nThe economic and financial situation in Cambodia is\nevolving positively, and the performance criteria\nsubscribed to by the Government with international\norganizations have been achieved. While these are good\nsigns for improving the economic situation in Cambodia,\npoverty is still a major problem, particularly in rural\nareas, where development is moving at a slower pace.\nRural development has been hampered in some parts of\nthe country by the continuing problem of landmines. With\ninternational and bilateral assistance, the Cambodian Mine\nAction Centre is working towards making Cambodia a\nlandmine-free country. It will take time, effort and\nsupport from the international community to accomplish\nthat task.\nThis year the Kingdom of Cambodia has officially\nacceded to the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation in South-\nEast Asia. It has become an observer member in the\nAssociation of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) and is\nnow a member of the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF).\nCambodia is actively engaged in improving and\nexpanding ties with all countries throughout the world.\nSince 1993, with its open door policy and the policy of\npositive engagement, Cambodia has rejoined the\ncommunity of nations and is working closely with others\nto promote world peace and international security. So far\nthe Kingdom of Cambodia has established diplomatic\nrelations with 87 countries from all continents.\nCambodia has also taken steps towards full\nintegration into ASEAN. As an observer member of\nASEAN, Cambodia may participate in important ASEAN\nmeetings. In December this year Cambodia will for the\nfirst time participate in the ASEAN Summit in Bangkok,\nThailand. Cambodia welcomed Vietnam\u2019s full\nmembership of ASEAN, Lao aspirations to become a full\nmember by 1997 and Myanmar\u2019s accession to the Treaty\nof Amity and Cooperation in South-East Asia, to become\n12\n\n\nan observer, and looks to the day when all the countries of\nSouth-East Asia form an ASEAN-10. At the same time,\nCambodia welcomes the recent positive trends in the\ncontinuing development and growth of the Asia-Pacific\nEconomic Cooperation (APEC). While sustainable\neconomic development and growth are crucial for us all, it\nis important that development works to further enhance\npeace and stability for the whole world. The long-term\nsolution being widespread economic development,\nCambodia wishes to assure the Assembly of its support for\nthe newly created World Trade Organization.\nI turn to the question of world peace and international\nsecurity. Cambodia is very concerned about the situation in\nAfghanistan. We support a peaceful settlement of the\nconflicts in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Somalia.\nContinuing war in these countries will have serious\nrepercussions on international security.\nCambodia warmly welcomed the major agreement\nconcluded between Israel and the Palestinians on Sunday,\n24 September 1995. We support and encourage the\ncontinuing efforts of the Israeli and Palestinian people to\nbuild peace, freedom and harmony between them.\nCambodia is very happy to see that Mrs. Aung San\nSuu Kyi, leader of the National League for Democracy of\nMyanmar, was freed last July by the State Law and Order\nRestoration Council. We welcome this latest move by\nMyanmar.\nWe note with great concern the role of the United\nNations peace-keepers. Ten years ago they numbered only\n4,000, but now, as new conflicts pop up like mushrooms,\ntheir number has risen to over 70,000. A new situation has\nalso emerged wherein the credibility of the peace-keepers\nis constantly being challenged. We must find a mechanism\nto strengthen the role of the peace-keepers and give them\nbetter support and protection against the evil forces that are\nout to weaken and destroy them. It is in this context that\nwe applaud the new role assigned to the peace-keepers in\nBosnia and Herzegovina. We pray for the success of the\npeace talks, led by the distinguished American diplomat\nRichard Holbrooke, between Croatia, Bosnia and\nHerzegovina and the Bosnian Serbs.\nThe subject of the United Nations Conference on\nWomen, held in Beijing this year, was very timely. Since\nthe formation of the Provisional Government in June 1993,\nCambodia has been conscious of the rights of women.\nCambodia now has in the Government a National\nSecretariat for Women\u2019s Affairs, which promotes greater\nrecognition of the roles of women in society. The Royal\nGovernment sent a delegation of women, headed by Her\nRoyal Highness Princess Marie Norodom Ranariddh, to\nBeijing.\nWith regard to nuclear testing, as a Party to the\nNuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), Cambodia\nstrongly supports a ban on all nuclear testing around the\nworld. As we have just concluded the 1995 Review and\nExtension Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, nuclear tests\nanywhere, whether atmospheric or underground, are of\nmajor concern for all of us in terms of the health, safety\nand well-being of humankind. The Kingdom of Cambodia\nnotes with satisfaction that progress is being made on the\ncomprehensive test-ban treaty, and we applaud the\nagreement that has been reached on the mandate with\nregard to the production of fissile materials for weapons.\nWe are very happy to see the encouraging sign from the\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in\naugmenting application of the NPT\u2019s safeguards\nprovisions.\nAs one of the founding members of the Non-Aligned\nMovement, Cambodia looks forward with great\nenthusiasm to participating in the ninth Summit\nConference of Heads of State or Government of\nNon-Aligned Countries, to be held this year in Cartagena\nde Indias, Colombia.\nWe applaud the professional skill and chairmanship\nof His Excellency President Soeharto of the Republic of\nIndonesia during the last three years, as leader of the\nNon-Aligned Movement.\nCambodia is very happy to welcome the next\nChairman of our Movement, His Excellency President\nErnesto Samper, President of the Republic of Colombia.\nMy delegation wishes to assure him that he will receive\nthe fullest cooperation from Cambodia. We are convinced\nthat he will, in a very spirited way, keep our Movement\nin the international agenda spotlight.\nAs we celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of this\nimportant Organization, an Organization that we should\nall be proud of, Cambodia calls for the strengthening and\nenhancement of the role of the United Nations, and urges\nthat we move towards global peace-building and harmony.\nRemember that our Organization was built on the very\nidea of preventing and ending all conflicts and sufferings,\nand remember also that this same idea was made possible\n13\n\n\nin the case of Cambodia. Cambodia, I am very proud to\nsay, is one of the success stories of our Organization.\n"

        "file_text": "It gives me great pleasure\nto congratulate His Excellency Mr. Freitas do Amaral on\nhis election to the presidency of the United Nations\nGeneral Assembly on this momentous occasion of its\nfiftieth anniversary. Aware of the strenuous task that this\nAssembly has to perform, I remain confident of his\ncompetence to guide our work to satisfactory conclusions.\nIt is also my privilege and honour to pay a tribute to\nthe President of the forty-ninth session of the General\nAssembly of the United Nations, His Excellency\nMr. Amara Essy of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire for the skilful manner\nin which he discharged the onerous responsibilities of the\npresidency of the forty-ninth session of the General\nAssembly.\nI would also like to convey my country\u2019s deep\nappreciation to the Secretary-General for displaying\nexceptional capability and a capacity to meet the daunting\nchallenges and obstacles to his noble mission, and for his\never-readiness to work selflessly not only to retain the\ncredibility and the validity of the United Nations but also\nto make this Organization stand tall in this rapidly\nchanging world. My delegation sincerely wishes him\nevery success in his unenviable task.\nThe United Nations is celebrating the fiftieth\nanniversary of its founding, and many of us are\nadvocating the need for reforming and restructuring this\nOrganization. There is no doubt in our minds that the\nworld is passing through an era of dramatic change\naffecting the map of international political relations and\nchanging the balance of economic and trade relations, a\nreason which would naturally justify this call. But we\nshould not ignore the fact that this Organization has\nsucceeded in preventing a third world war \u2014 and the\ngreatest fear 50 years ago was that such a war would\noccur.\nFurthermore, this Organization has effectively freed\nthe world from the evils of colonialism and racial\ndiscrimination. It has also helped in establishing a regime\nof international cooperation based on the principles of\nequality and respect for the rule of law. If not for the\nnoble role that the United Nations has played in many\n5\n\n\nareas of human activity, we would not have harvested the\nprogress we enjoy today in the fields of disarmament,\ncontainment of the proliferation of nuclear weapons,\npromotion of human rights, and many important issues such\nas those related to environment and the welfare of refugees,\nchildren, youth and women.\nOf course there have been failures and set-backs.\nMany a time we have come across situations which have\nmade us suspect the credibility of the Organization and the\neffectiveness of its decisions.\nBut the fact remains that the United Nations has\nserved and is continuing to serve humanity \u2014 individuals,\npeoples and the world community as a whole \u2014 with\nprofound dignity and with a sense of purpose, guided by\nthe noble principles of the Charter. And if we are talking\nabout reforming or restructuring this Organization, then our\nconcentration should first be focused on the realities of\ntoday in order to transpose our collective efforts to\nstrengthen international cooperation for the achievement of\nour common objectives in full accord with the principles\nenshrined in the United Nations Charter.\nMoreover, the reforming and restructuring not only\nshould be focused on the concept of international peace and\nsecurity, but also should be extended to include the entire\nspectrum of the economic and social development of the\nhuman race. In other words, the effect of reform should\nreach all areas of United Nations activities, including those\ninvolving the maintenance of international peace and\nsecurity, the achievement of equitable economic\ndevelopment, the revitalization of the international\neconomic order, the protection of the global environment,\nthe combating of terrorism and drug trafficking, the\nprotection of human rights, and the promotion of\ndemocratic values and legal order within and among\nnations.\nI would like to take this opportunity to extend my\ncompliments to the specialized agencies of the United\nNations for their efforts to achieve economic growth and\nsustainable development. The Rio Conference on\nEnvironment, the Population Conference in Cairo, the\nCopenhagen Social Summit, and the recently concluded\nWorld Conference on Women, in Beijing, have taken us a\nlong way in this regard.\nHowever it is regrettable to note that, in spite of the\nencouraging signs, the overall picture of development is not\noptimistic. The global Official Development Assistance\n(ODA) today is at its lowest level in 21 years. As a least\ndeveloped island State, my Government is of the view\nthat there is an urgently felt need to reverse this situation\nradically. A first step will be for all industrialized\ncountries to live up to the targets specified by the United\nNations. If we work in the spirit of collective\nresponsibility and match our efforts with the concerns of\nthe real people in the real world, I am confident that\nsuccess will be achieved.\nAs far as the principal organs of the United Nations\nare concerned, Maldives believes that the General\nAssembly should continue to play its central role as the\nglobal council which has the competence and capacity for\ntaking collective decisions and reaching consensus on\nimportant matters related to international peace and\nsecurity, development, and international cooperation in\ngeneral.\nMeanwhile, the role and functions of the Security\nCouncil should be strengthened and improved upon in a\nway consistent with the realities of the present time,\nwhich obviously are significantly different from the\ngeopolitical conditions which prevailed 50 years ago.\nHowever, the Maldives is of the view that if a major\nrestructuring exercise is to be carried out it should be a\nresult-oriented one, which would strengthen the authority\nof the Council and increase its ability to implement its\ndecisions rather than simply increasing the number of\nmembers of the Council on a selective basis. Even if we\ngo along with the emerging consensus that the\nmembership of the Council should be increased, my\ncountry strongly feels that careful consideration should be\ngiven in the process to ensuring that the Council remains\na representative body for all regions and groups of\nnations, including, of course, the developing countries and\nsmall States that share the responsibilities for maintaining\npeace and security in the world with the more developed\nand the larger Member States of the United Nations. The\nmain criteria should be, we believe, the capability of the\nMember States to fulfil their obligations and commitments\ntowards the United Nations and its principles, and their\nrespect for and adherence to international covenants.\nFifty years ago membership of this Organization\ncomprised only a few countries. They had the privilege of\nhaving a say in world affairs. They created this body to\nsafeguard not only their own interests but also the\ninterests of future generations of the entire world.\nThe vast majority of Member States that are\nrepresented here today, including small States like my\nown country, Maldives, had been deprived of their\n6\n\n\nfreedom in one form or other. It was the principles on\nwhich this Organization was founded that helped shape the\nevents which eventually led to the restoration of the\nlegitimate rights of deprived peoples on all continents\nacross the globe.\nNow, ours is a community of nations that share the\nsame values and depend on each other in achieving our\ncommon and individual interests. Among the Member\nStates of the United Nations there is a large number of\nsmall States which are actively interacting with other\nMember States, not because they merely need the\ncooperation of the others for their survival and existence,\nbut because they actually are inseparable parts of this large,\ninterdependent world.\nWhat the United Nations is trying to do is to promote\npeace and justice, eliminate racial and religious prejudices\nand set up universal standards for aspects of our lives\nwhich affect our dignity as equal human beings. Small\nStates are participating in this endeavour with the same\nconviction that the larger countries have. Therefore, it is\nmore than reasonable that small States should be given the\nopportunity to play their role in decision-making and\ncarrying forward the torch of our common mission.\nAs I first mentioned, the reform of the United Nations\nmust be comprehensive and should include the three main\norgans, the specialized agencies, and all aspects of the\nUnited Nations work and activities; a reform which would\nchange the United Nations truly in to a \u201cmission-oriented\nand results-oriented\u201d Organization, to use the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s description. Therefore, my delegation feels that\nit is important to maintain effective coordination between\nthe open-ended working groups which are already being\nestablished, and that we should, by all means, avoid\nproducing a partial package of improvement.\nAs the world anticipates seeing a revitalized United\nNations, we should pause to review the current world\nsituation.\nIn this context, it is with great disappointment that we\nsee that the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina remains as\ncritical as ever. We are still witnessing the destruction of\nlife and property, the violation of human rights and the\ndefiance of Security Council resolutions by the Bosnian\nSerb leadership. The continuing deterioration of the\nsituation has led many of us to doubt the applicability of\nthe arms embargo. Many of us, furthermore, fear the\nconsequences of partitioning Bosnia and Herzegovina on\nthe basis of the ethnic composition of this independent\nState. We urge the international community to exert its\ninfluence on the Bosnian Serbs to accept the settlement\nnow being proposed, which we are confident will result\nin a comprehensive and viable solution to this tragic\nepisode. Meanwhile, we wish to express our deep\nappreciation to the countries that are contributing bravely\nto the efforts of the United Nations Protection Force\nunder extremely difficult conditions.\nThe situation in the Middle East seems to be\nimproving through the peace process. The United Nations\nhas continuously supported the rights of the Palestinian\npeople to self-determination and independence. The recent\naccords, which enable the Palestinian people to exercise\na degree of self-rule, are certainly a good basis for the\nrealization of this objective. While appreciating the\nimportant role played by the sponsors of the recent\ninitiative, we feel that the United Nations should continue\nto give support to the people of Palestine and to enhance,\nby all available means, the fulfilment of their legitimate\nrights.\nThe recent events that took place in the Islamic\nFederal Republic of the Comoros demonstrate once again\nthe vulnerability of small States to terrorism and the\nactivities of mercenaries, which threaten not only the\nsecurity and stability of small States, but also democratic\ninstitutions and the lawful existence of Governments. This\ntime the victim was again a small island State in the\nIndian Ocean. But we have seen that acts of terrorism\nsimilar to this one \u2014 which took many innocent lives \u2014\nare occurring rather frequently in many parts of the\nworld. Recalling General Assembly resolution 49/31, on\nthe Protection and Security of Small States, my\nGovernment calls upon the international community to\ntake all necessary steps to prevent mercenaries from\ncarrying out their criminal acts.\nGiant steps have been taken towards universal\ndisarmament. During the Conference earlier this year at\nwhich the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) was discussed\nMaldives supported the Treaty\u2019s indefinite extension, with\nthe firm conviction that it plays a central role in\ncontaining the danger of the proliferation of nuclear\nweapons. Treaties have been concluded on chemical and\nother weapons of mass destruction. It is our fervent hope\nthat the comprehensive test-ban treaty will be signed\nbefore the end of 1996. In the meantime, it is most\nimportant at this juncture that all States refrain from\ntesting nuclear devices, and those which aspire to\nachieving nuclear-weapon capabilities should refrain from\ndeveloping them. Instead, efforts must be made to\n7\n\n\ndismantle all existing nuclear weapons and free the world\nfrom this dreadful menace. Further, the countries of each\nregion should agree to establish nuclear-weapon-free zones,\nthus striving collectively towards a nuclear-weapon-free\nworld. Furthermore, my Government believes that the\ncourse of universal disarmament will translate into an\nincrease in available resources that can be used for urgently\nneeded humanitarian and social development needs.\nAs mankind awaits the dawn of the twenty-first\ncentury with great expectations for peace and justice and\nfor the emergence of a United Nations that will carry\nforward the noble mission for which it was created, we, the\nGovernment and the people of the Maldives, renew our\ncommitment to the principles of the Charter of the United\nNations and pledge that we will do whatever is possible, in\ncooperation with other Member States, to uphold these\nprinciples and work towards a better future.\nMy delegation wishes to extend its felicitations to all\nStates Members of this Organization on this occasion of its\nfiftieth anniversary and to congratulate this world body on\nits tremendous achievements.\n"

Is\nthis peace? Is this the new world? Is this the new order\nto which we committed ourselves 50 years ago? Half a\ncentury after the end of that devastating world war are\nnations really united?\nUntil a short while ago many of us believed that we\nhad finally distanced ourselves from the danger of world\nwar and that some long-standing confrontations were\nbeginning to be resolved through dialogue and\nnegotiation. However, the threats of a world cataclysm\nhave grown over decades of regional and local conflicts,\nstirred up by a wide range of motives involving\n24\n\n\ngeopolitical, economic and trading disputes as well as\nethnic and religious conflicts.\nEurope, the veteran of two world wars, which thought\nit was protected by a number of post-war agreements, is\nnow the arena for a number of confrontations in all corners\nof that continent. In the Balkans, concentration camps,\nwhich we believed had died with Hitler, have once again\nmade an appearance.\nTerrorism, originally fomented by certain powerful\ndeveloped countries, has now turned against those very\ncountries with a lash like the tail of the serpent and now, in\norder to combat that scourge, they are spending the same\nmillions they had invested earlier in perpetrating it.\nDrug trafficking is also terrorizing the major cities, but\nwhat promotes that scourge is not the cultivation of certain\ntypes of vegetation in the underdeveloped world, but\ntolerance of drug consumption and covert protection for its\nproduction and trade in order to make a profit in those very\ncities.\nExtremism, xenophobia, racism and discrimination on\nthe basis of national origin, creed or gender are\nproliferating once again, together with the spectre of\nfascism, which seems to have arisen from the tomb.\nGlobalization, an all-inclusive term conceived in the\ninterests of the major transnational corporations, is now\ndevouring national entities, sovereignty and independence\nbeyond any limit or reason, bringing in its wake a global\ninvasion of destitution, population growth, mass migration\nand environmental degradation, which cannot be avoided by\neven the most powerful of this world.\nAt the same time, ideological differences, the\nimposition of measures, isolation and selfish actions of all\nkinds continue to torpedo our new efforts to integrate into\nassociations, such as the Association of South-East Asian\nNations (ASEAN) and the recently established Association\nof Caribbean States (ACS).\nAn exclusive kind of panamericanism in this\nhemisphere is sabotaging the aspirations of the community\nof Ibero-American and Caribbean nations to strengthen their\nforums of regional concerted actions and to seek consensus\nto meet their common needs. The country that has arrogated\nto itself supreme leadership in this area as a manifest\ndestiny has, as it did two centuries ago, been conspiring to\nabort any regional or international association of peoples\nthat does not fit in with its narrow national interests.\nAsia and Africa, which achieved decolonization, are\nnow laboratories in which societies with age-old cultures\nand a strong tribal heritage are being afflicted with new\nliberal and Western models that are totally alien to their\nnational characteristics.\nFifty years on, despite all its efforts, the United\nNations has not been able to eliminate hunger, poverty,\nthe millions of children dying of diseases that are curable\nand entire peoples who are longing for a simple glass of\ndrinking water.\nThe virtual reality in which we are told we live\ntoday cannot conceal the nuclear weapons which, as has\nbeen asserted, may destroy the planet three times over, as\nif once were not enough. Nor will the illusion of the\nfuture created in the opulent cities so rich in show-\nwindows and neon lights save the world from the waste\nthat is being emptied into the oceans, the contamination\nof the atmosphere, and the destruction of ecosystems and\nspecies, including the human race.\nSuch news is rarely seen on television in the\ncivilized countries where we are constantly told about\nmarvellous detergents; but how can one cleanse the world\nof the horrors of war and destitution with such\ndetergents?\nLight and shadow, but above all more shadow than\nlight, seems to be the mood of this General Assembly on\nthe eve of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations.\nIn preparing itself, Cuba has noted with concern the often\ngraceless and vulgar way in which highly developed\ncountries are trying to take advantage of this opportunity\nto define new economic, legal and political bases for the\nworld. These bases run counter to the true objectives of\npeace, development, equality and justice, as well as of the\npreservation and needed restoration of the cardinal\nprinciples of the Charter.\nIn the complex debates of the last few months many\ntributes have been paid to the argument of limited\nsovereignty, humanitarian intervention and preventive\ndiplomacy, all set forth in \u201cAn Agenda for Peace\u201d in the\nimplementation of which the United Nations is wasting\ntwo thirds of its budget.\nThose discussions have not been free from brushes\nwith fashionable neo-liberal ideas that equate development\nwith assistance and set up chains of conditionalities\ndisguised as the same good intentions with which the road\nto hell is paved.\n25\n\n\nFrom the bipolar world of the East-West conflict we\nhave moved to the unipolarism of the most powerful, and\nonly the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries and the\nGroup of 77 have managed to survive, although some have\ntried to do away with them, silence them or reeducate them,\nas if the problems of the third world were dependent solely\non disputes between the great Powers and their post-war\nallies.\nTo the calls by the vast majority of the world for the\npreservation of sovereign equality, territorial integrity and\nnon-interference in the internal affairs of States, which are\nthe bases of international law, we have been given answers\nthat seek to destroy those principles for the benefit of a\nfew. Whenever reason raises its head, an attempt is made\nto trample on the third world\u2019s right to development by\nimposing mechanisms in which the factor of domination is\ninherent, something this Organization was established\nprecisely to combat.\nAll the efforts and time we have spent here to\nestablish a new, more just and more equitable economic\norder have been doomed to failure by the intransigence of\nthe rich, which has made the gap between rich and poor a\ngulf that is ever-more unspannable.\nA great wave of privatization has done away with\nnational structures and is jeopardizing the important but\nfragile social achievements of mankind in its development.\nStreets, parks, cities and even prisons are being\nprivatized, and under this influence it would appear that we\nare now approaching the privatization of law and of world\npower, and the United Nations itself is unable to escape\nfrom this, for some believe that the bulk of Member States\nhave little or nothing to say in deciding their own destinies.\nLet us agree on this: the world has changed. We can\nrepeat it. It is true. But how has it changed?\nNotwithstanding the impressive achievements of the\nhuman race we are forced to live at the same time with\nunspeakable suffering that mocks all material and spiritual\nprogress in which we might feel some pride as we approach\nthe new century.\nThe \u201ccivilizatory\u201d crisis began in the richest and most\npowerful part of the planet and is now spreading to\ninternational agencies and into this lofty arena.\nThe countries of the South cannot desire or continue\nto support the notion that the North should constantly\nimpose conditions upon it. The countries of the North\nmust listen to our views as well as alter their own\npatterns of development.\nAlthough it is fashionable to include the issue of\nhuman development in the agendas of international\ndiscussions, it has been relegated to second place by post-\nmodern technocracies. There are those who celebrate the\nfall of the Berlin Wall and the breakdown of the\nEuropean socialist world without realizing that no new\nworld has yet been constructed to replace them and that,\non the contrary, many other new walls are growing up\naround us.\nFrom the centres of world power refined and subtle\nforms of a new colonization are being imposed as part of\nnational policies and national-security strategies \u2014 in\nother words, of extraterritorial domination.\nCuba knows this by heart. The ridiculous charitable\ngestures, the crumbs fallen from the table, the alms, all go\nhand in hand with the cultural and ideological invasion\nthat corrodes peoples from within and neutralizes them as\nactors on history\u2019s stage.\nThe new ark of the post-modern saviours is\npredestined to divide humanity into the auto-elect and the\nexcluded. Solidarity, the symbol of love among human\nbeings and the essential attribute of mankind\u2019s salvation\nin every age, is now an endangered species.\nLike the model the leadership is seeking to erect on\nthe basis of brutal selfishness, the third world seems\ncondemned to become bogged down in debates on\nconfrontation and cooperation and to abandon the best of\nthe human spirit, which is precisely this solidarity.\nAnd this very Organization which combated\ncolonialism and apartheid with such solidarity has also\nbeen changed into a kind of supranational mechanism far\nremoved from its intergovernmental design.\nIs there solidarity in the secret contacts and covert\nunderstandings that precede the decisions taken by the\nOrganization, which is manipulated in the interests of\ncertain Powers?\nCan we regard as solidarity the further invasions to\neradicate famine, safeguard peace, restore democracy and\nsupport so-called good governments?\n26\n\n\nCan there be solidarity in a Security Council without\ntransparency and anti-democratic in its workings, which no\nlonger fulfils the principles of the Charter or exceeds them\nand refuses to abolish the veto power and renounce\npermanent membership?\nWhat kind of solidarity do we mean when that body,\nthe Security Council, resists even the alternative of sharing\nits obsolete power fairly with other nations that better\nrepresent this world?\nIn international law we must in no way accept as valid\nthe life-style of those who proclaim as a national\nphilosophy that they have no friends or interests \u2014 unless\nwe wish to bring on mass suicide for the planet.\nAnd if we are to avoid suicide, we must definitively\nsupport the conclusion of treaties that will completely ban\natomic weapons, their technological monopoly and peaceful\nand simulated explosions and declare a total moratorium on\ntesting until the practice is completely banned. Such treaties\nmust be acceded to by all nuclear Powers without any\nexception.\nFor the third consecutive year I have come here\nmandated by Cuba to address this Assembly and to\ndenounce what has already been denounced, to condemn\nwhat has already been condemned, and to reiterate the call\nof the overwhelming majority of the community of nations.\nOn the very threshold of the twenty-first century the\ncriminal economic, trade and financial blockade which the\nUnited States has imposed against my country for 36 years\ncontinues. We have survived the attempt to eliminate us,\nwhich has been mocked by the tenacious resistance of my\npeople.\nAfter years of crisis, the Cuban economy experienced\na 7 per cent growth in the past year while the budget deficit\nwas reduced by almost half. Inflation, measured by the\ninformal exchange market, was reduced by more than 80\nper cent, and at the end of the first half of 1995 the\neconomy had grown by 2 per cent.\nSignificant economic measures made those results\npossible, and yet the traditional attention our Government\ngives to education, health, employment and social security\nhas never diminished.\nAll this has been possible because since 1959 we have\nzealously and resolutely defended the commitment made to\nthe fathers of our nation to keep it free and sovereign, 90\nmiles distant from that great Power that has always\nregarded us as part of its backyard, as some sort of annex\nto its own territory.\nIt has been possible because in this world obsessed\nto its very soul with buying and selling \u2014 while of\ncourse deriving profit from the process \u2014 we have\nmaintained and demonstrated that one can live with an\nethics based on principles, on national unity, on justice,\non respect for human dignity, equity, morality and loyalty,\nand no one \u2014 absolutely no one \u2014 has the right to\nquestion this.\nIt has also been possible because we have kept faith\nwith the Charter that we signed 50 years ago, with its\ncommitment to respect and require respect for our\nsovereignty, our national independence and our self-\ndetermination, while not allowing interference of any kind\nin our internal affairs.\nThere is more. These results have been possible\nbecause, free from the commitments of the past, and with\nthe experience of having depended economically on other\ncountries, we have with great sacrifice undertaken the\ntask of building our economic independence.\nIt would be ungrateful of me if, in speaking of the\nincredible achievements of the Cuban people, I made no\nreference to the millions who have stood by us during\nthese difficult years: the dozens of countries and\nGovernments that did not break off relations with Cuba,\nthose that strengthened their relations and those that found\nthe courage to enter into such relations for the first time\nin the face of unspeakable pressure and threats.\nIt is precisely now, when trade and foreign\ninvestment are beginning to energize the Cuban economy,\nthat a campaign has been launched in the United States\nCongress to approve a bill that would mock and run\ncounter to the wishes of the majority of nations and harm\nfree trade and all civilized forms of relations between\npeoples and Governments.\nCertain extremist sectors in this country are trying to\ndelay a lasting solution to the conflict between these two\ncountries for many years and to abort the migration\nagreements signed by both Governments last year.\nOnly two days ago the House of Representatives\ntook the first step towards this crime in approving that\nbill which, among other absurdities, proposes an\n27\n\n\ninternational blockade against Cuba, which is really directed\nagainst the whole of humanity.\nThis is no surprise to us because, apart from gestures\nfrom the many friends that we have in this great nation,\nthose who have directed its destiny over the last 36 years\nhave brought us nothing good. However, we trust that there\nare still honest people who, even without being friends of\nthe Cuban Government, may have the basic common sense\nto know which side is in the right.\nThere is also time to stay the hands of those in the\nSenate and the Executive Branch who wish to stab in the\nback the future of any attempt at a rapprochement between\nCuba and the United States and add new tensions to\ninternational relations that are already difficult.\nFaced with a world that accepts diversity and\ndifferences, that does not turn to us with aggression or\nisolate or discriminate against us, this North American\nposition is automatically blocked in time and in existence,\nand is isolated in its attitude towards Cuba in this\nAssembly.\nMy country does not question anybody\u2019s right to the\ntype of government they desire. We urge no one to imitate\nour model. But neither can we accept that anyone should\nimpose a different one on us. We affirm this in the strong\nbelief that the democratic, economic and social justice\nprocess initiated in Cuba in 1959 has followed an honest\npath; it has demonstrated its viability, its strength and its\ncapacity to face the challenges of these times and respond\nto them.\nWe firmly believe in the authenticity and the popular\nsupport underpinning our revolution and our socialism \u2014\na socialism as Cuban as our palm trees. We defend our\nright to life and to our own voice, because in the world of\npluralism that we aspire to, plurality and diversity among\nnations must be respected.\nIn this Assembly there are documents circulating that\nprove what I say, as well as vulgar threats and attempts at\nblackmail against those who are exercising such freedoms,\nnot only because they are ethical in taking the right side in\na matter of international interest, but because they have\nlinks with Havana.\nDiplomacy and politics these days cannot be practised\nby threatening families that wish to be reunited, or\nbusinessmen, members of Congress or politicians who have\nto resort to bodyguards for their own protection.\nWhat can we expect the next century to offer us if\nthis trial imposed on Cuba by a world Power succeeds?\nWe need something more than the reiteration of the\ncondemnation of the blockade in this Assembly. Cuba is\nfully entitled to call for action that would put an end to\nthis madness, because any Member State may be the next\nvictim in the future.\nIt is high time now to put an end to a conflict which\nhad its origins more than two centuries ago \u2014 before\nsocialism emerged, and long before the East-West conflict\nand the triumph of the Cuban revolution.\nCuba has managed to succeed thanks to solidarity.\nIn its name, we hope that the issue of human rights may\ncease to be used as political manoeuvring in a way that\nstains the honour of many decent countries. Alongside the\nlying and pathetic chronicles of human rights violations\nin Cuba, the world must recognize that there has been no\nlack of love, no lack of sacrifice in the salvation of\nmillions of women and children who, because our trade\nwas blockaded, did not have enough food to eat.\nThe often heroic and painful efforts to secure\nmedicine for the sick, insulin for diabetics, aminofilin for\nasthmatics and pacemakers for those with heart conditions\nmust be recognized and acknowledged, because the\nproviders of those medicines and the experts concerned\nwere warned off, boycotted or proscribed by the Treasury\nDepartment of the United States.\nThe world must know that the right to life is deeply\njeopardized in Cuba, and that my country is living,\nworking, loving and every day renewing its hopes of a\nbetter world in spite of that.\nIf truth were better valued on the market, the world\nwould correctly identify the most striking victims of the\nhuman rights violations in Cuba: the vulgar servants of a\nforeign Power from which they receive encouragement\nand resources to conspire against the very land in which\nthey were born to promote the annexationist aspirations of\nour powerful neighbour.\nMoreover, honest people throughout the world can\ndiscern among the members of the Cuban community in\nthis country a growing majority who have begun to\ndefend the sovereignty of Cuba, to claim the rights that\nhave also been denied them and works with all our\nsupport and all our respect to normalize relations with\ntheir homeland.\n28\n\n\nThe world cannot be deceived all the time, least of all\nthe noble and hard-working people of the United States,\nwho daily call out for solidarity with Cuba. Without the\nblockade, Cuba would more clearly demonstrate its\nunsuspected reserves of talent and energy and the material\nand spiritual quality of our lives would be improved. That\nwould enable us to give our modest support much more\nfreely to the cultural and scientific advancement of all\nmankind and of the United States as well.\nIt is incredible that in the so-called land of the free,\ntourists and businessmen are able to travel and invest freely\nall around the world except to one destination and in one\nmarket, which is increasingly attractive and is located only\n90 miles from its own shores.\nThe people of the United States, whose economy,\npolitics, dignity, laws and human rights have also been\nprofoundly damaged, must prevent this seed sown for more\nthan 30 years from becoming a genuine source of national\nshame, as was its war against Viet Nam.\nLet it be clearly understood: Cuba desires normal\nrelations with the United States, provided that a natural\nfeeling of good-neighbourliness, respect and equality\nprevails between the two countries. But Cuba will never\ngive way to threats and will survive at all costs whatever\nhappens, because it is capable of escaping from crises, but\ncannot shake off the dishonour of living on its knees. It\nwill not do that. Cuba will continue with its forward\nmovement to change and develop. Our economy, although\nsubject to the blockade, will grow and will provide for\nand meet the most pressing needs of our people. The\npowerful infrastructure that we have built up over three\ndecades with what some have called the subsidy that\nCuba has wasted well befits a people whose high level of\neducation and culture and a stable land of peace and\norder. All of this is sustained by the broadest popular\nconsultation and consent and a democratic consensus\nenjoyed by few Governments.\nThe changes which Cuba has made and will continue\nto make in its own way apply not only to our economy,\nbut to our political system, civil society and institutions,\nin order to make our democracy increasingly genuine and\nparticipative. These changes fall squarely within our\nsovereign prerogative. They have not been made to please\nanyone outside, especially those who have so altered\nthemselves as to be unrecognizable.\nDay by day, minute by minute, Cuba is striving to\nimprove itself, to adapt and survive in this global jungle,\nwhere more than ever before survival of the fittest is the\nrule. The lion may be able to devour the deer, but he has\na hard time swallowing the hedgehog.\nFor this reason, the United Nations must also change\nand become more democratic, to become the genuine\nvehicle for development and peace which humanity needs\nif it is to survive. It must become a forum for dialogue\nand concord where the principle of the sovereign equality\nof States is the keystone and foundation.\nMany have spoken, and will continue to speak this\nyear, of celebrating the merits and work of the United\nNations, which no one can deny. On behalf of my\ncountry, I prefer today to commemorate rather than\ncelebrate and to call on this Assembly, 50 years after its\nfounding, to veto irrationality and vote unanimously for\nthe future of mankind.\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me first to\ncongratulate Mr. Freitas do Amaral on his election as the\nPresident of the fiftieth session of the General Assembly.\nMy Government is convinced that the wealth of his\nexperience and abilities will prove vital at this crucial\ncrossroads as we search for new and innovative\nmechanisms and structures to enhance the effectiveness of\nour Organization to meet the challenges of the coming\ncentury.\nAllow me also to pay tribute to his predecessor,\nHis Excellency Mr. Amara Essy, the Minister for Foreign\nAffairs of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, for the ability and commitment\nthat he showed in presiding over the forty-ninth session\nof the General Assembly.\nWe further wish to express our profound\nappreciation of the Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros\nBoutros-Ghali, and to commend him for his untiring\nefforts to ensure the effectiveness of our Organization.\nThe multifaceted challenges that our global\ncommunity will continue to face in the period ahead, and\nthe opportunities that exist \u2014 more than at any time in\nthe past \u2014 to promote equity and justice in a more\nharmonious world will require a thorough review of\n16\n\n\nparadigms, methods and institutions that have functioned\nfor the past 50 years. Indeed, different realities from those\nnow prevailing inspired the founding of the United Nations\nin 1945 and shaped its operational mechanisms in the\nsubsequent decades. The situation now is very much\nchanged, if not altogether new.\nThe membership of the Organization itself has\nundergone phenomenal change to increase almost fourfold.\nMoreover, while the threat of a major international\nconfrontation has receded with the end of the cold war, a\nhost of other problems, including an upsurge in inter-State\nconflicts, international terrorism, growing poverty and\nmarginalization of vast segments of humanity in the\ndeveloping countries as well as within affluent societies, are\ncoming to the fore. It is apparent that these problems and\nrealities will require novel theoretical and institutional\napproaches.\nIt is in this context that my Government welcomes the\ndebates that have been provoked by the recommendations\nof the independent working committee and other interested\nparties on the future of the United Nations. Let me further\nunderline that, as one of the new Member countries of the\nUnited Nations, we are gratified to rejoin the world\ncommunity of States and impart our views on its future,\nespecially as we have had the added advantage of gauging\nits operations from without for most of the past 50 years.\nWe share the view of many Member States on the\nimperative of restructuring the decision-making bodies of\nthe United Nations \u2014 particularly the Security Council, in\na manner that ensures adequate representation of its diverse\ncomponents and interests. The process of restructuring\nshould not, moreover, consist of mere enlargement through\nthe inclusion of a number of potential candidates as\npermanent members through some selection criteria of\nfinancial and economic clout, population size and other\nsimilar factors. As we all agree, the issue is more profound\nand transcends a simple numbers game. We hold that\nserious thought must be given to devising a suitable\narrangement that guarantees the proper representation of our\nglobal community in its rich diversity and that is amenable\nto periodic adjustments to accommodate inevitable changes\nin a dynamic world.\nIn the same vein, we welcome the emerging consensus\nover rationalizing the development agencies and institutions\nof the United Nations by eliminating overlapping functions\nand mandates, and integrating these institutions into more\npowerful and authoritative bodies. The numerous platforms\nunanimously adopted at the international Summits in Rio,\nCairo, Copenhagen and Beijing, aimed at environmental\npreservation, the reduction and elimination of poverty,\nand the empowerment of women, cannot be realized\nwithout the concerted efforts of these enhanced\ninstitutions. The new drive towards their increased\nintegration is therefore both appropriate and timely.\nNone of these ideals can come to fruition without\nthe essential prerequisite of peace. Representing a nation\nand people that have suffered the agonies of war and\nconflict for almost the entire lifetime of this Organization,\nmy Government cannot underrate the efforts and priorities\nthat the United Nations must accord to the prevention and\nresolution of conflicts. Past failures and inadequacies can\nonly reinforce the collective resolve of our global\ncommunity to check forces of aggression and\ndestabilization and not to let down wronged parties.\nAnd yet we cannot hide our disappointment at the\nindecision and wavering we see over sending clear signals\nto defuse potential time-bombs and conflicts that are\nbrewing. The age-old folly of arming belligerent and\naggressor States in pursuit of narrow commercial and\nother mundane interests continues unabated. This\nanomalous left-over of the cold-war years must surely be\nrectified, as it is the first step that we must take in our\nquest for global peace and as we devise elaborate\nmechanisms for conflict prevention, management and\nresolution.\nIf I have dwelt somewhat at length on what we\naspire to see in the invigorated Organization in the\ndecades to come, this is due to my sincere belief that the\ntone we set here collectively will have far greater\ninfluence in shaping the future of our planet than the\nisolated measures and endeavours we undertake in our\nindividual countries.\nAllow me now, to briefly touch on issues of direct\nimportance to my country and our subregion. After three\ndecades of agonizing war, my Government is today fully\nengaged in healing the wounds of war, rehabilitating a\ndevastated country and institutionalizing the rule of law.\nThe constitution-drafting process, hinged on popular\nparticipation in all its phases, is progressing at a\nsatisfactory pace and according to the schedule envisaged.\nWe are also doing our utmost to contribute, together\nwith our sisterly partners, to the creation of a climate\nconducive to subregional cooperation and collective\nsecurity on our part of the continent, which has seen\nmuch turmoil and commotion in the past. The precarious\n17\n\n\nsituation in Somalia and the problems posed by the\ndestabilizing policies pursued by the National Islamic Front\n(NIF) regime in the Sudan only indicate the enormity of the\ntasks, which need persistent and concerted efforts by all\nregional and international actors concerned.\nThe recent document signed in regard to the\nimplementation of the second phase of the peace\nagreement between the Palestinian and Israeli parties can\nonly inspire confidence in all of us that this long-drawn-\nout conflict is heading towards a satisfactory resolution at\nlong last. We trust that these measures will contribute\ntowards a comprehensive settlement of the conflict in the\nMiddle East.\nIn conclusion, I wish to restate our firm belief and\nhopes that our Organization will find the insight and inner\nstrength to reinvigorate itself to meet the challenges of the\nnext century. I can only reiterate my Government\u2019s firm\ncommitment to play its small and modest part to advance\nthe ideals that bind us together.\n"

We come here to\nstate our convictions and to announce our commitments. In\nour address in 1987, I stated on behalf of the State of\nIsrael:\n\u201cWe have found President Mubarak of Egypt to\nbe a builder of a better life for his people and of\nbridges for a comprehensive peace in the region.\u201d\n(Official Records of the General Assembly, Forty-\nsecond Session, Plenary Meetings, 17th meeting,\np. 23-25)\nToday, under the leadership of President Mubarak,\nEgypt is becoming a centre for regional development on the\nway to hosting the first regional bank of development.\nIn the same address, we stated:\n\u201cAn international conference is the door to direct\nnegotiations. Once convened it should lead\nimmediately to face-to-face bilateral negotiations.\u201d\n(Ibid., p. 26)\nOn 30 October, 1991, the Madrid Conference took place.\nIn 1992, again we declared:\n\u201cThe opportunity to select, through democratic\npolitical elections, the Palestinian administrative\ncouncil will enable the Palestinian people to exercise\na double measure of freedom: the freedom to govern\ntheir own lives and to do so ... democratically.\u201d\n(Ibid., Forty-seventh Session, Plenary Meetings,\n20th meeting, p. 48)\nLast week, we achieved what we promised.\nLastly, in 1993, we declared again from this rostrum:\n\u201cGeographically speaking, we live side by side\nwith the Jordanian Kingdom, and what is so obvious\ngeographically must become clear politically [so\nthat] we can offer the people of both sides of the\nriver full peace, that the Dead Sea can become a\nspring of new life.\u201d (Ibid., Forty-eighth Session,\nPlenary Meetings, 6th meeting, p. 22)\nIn October 1994, just one year later, Jordan and Israel\nsigned a peace treaty.\nLast year, we said here:\n\u201cAll countries of the Middle East face a choice:\nto remain politically divided and economically\nstagnant or to become economically advanced and\npolitically just.\n\u201c... We shall try to establish instruments for\ndevelopment: a regional bank, channels for private\ninvestment and a framework for regional planning.\u201d\n(Ibid., Forty-ninth Session, Plenary Meetings,\n10th meeting, p. 16)\nIn October 1994, the first Middle East-North African\neconomic summit was held in Casablanca under the\nsplendid presidency of His Majesty King Hassan II. At\nthe end of this month, a second summit will be held in\nAmman under the auspices of His Majesty King Hussein.\nAt the end of November, the first ground-breaking Euro-\nMediterranean conference will be held in Barcelona.\nThree years, five promises: all of them fulfilled. I\nwould like to use this occasion to turn to the Syrians and\nto turn to the Lebanese and ask them to stop hesitating,\nto stop wandering. They have to look at this record and\ncome in and follow up. The President of Syria has said\nthat from experience he has learned that only through\nmilitary negotiations and making security the major\nagenda item can one achieve peace. Sorry: Experience has\n4\n\n\nshown that through negotiation on all levels, embracing all\nissues without timidity, without fatigue, we can achieve\npeace. If leaders meet and are not successful at the first\nmeeting, they will have another meeting. How can it be\nwrong for them to work day and night, ceaselessly, with\nnew ideas and new approaches? They are not wasting the\nleaders\u2019 time; they are wasting the time of the people \u2014\ntheir fortunes, their happiness, opportunities for the younger\ngeneration.\nWe also tell all the countries of the Middle East, not\nthat we want to have a new Middle East, but that we want\nthe Middle East to join in a new age \u2014 for the good of\ntheir people, not for the good of Israel. Israel is in good\nshape because we are no longer living in a world where\nthere are empires of power and colonies of poverty. Poverty\nand oppression are home-made, not imposed by others. The\nchoice is before every country to become free and\nprosperous and democratic, like so many nations have done\nin a relatively short time in Asia, Latin America and in\nsome countries of Africa. It is their choice, their\nopportunity not just to build a different world but to\nintroduce the new world to their own people.\nFor us, the United States is not an empire of power.\nWe are not afraid of the United States. For us, the United\nStates is an empire of peace. We need the United States.\nFor us, Russia is going through a process of change. Russia\nwill remain great but will become something different. For\nus, we welcome the European contribution to other\ncountries east and south of them and the convening of the\nBarcelona conference to offer the Mediterranean peoples\nfunds and experience to build a new life. We are glad that\nJapan is expanding its economic horizons and understanding\nand contributing so that other nations can do so. And we\nhope that other well-to-do countries in the Middle East,\nincluding Arab countries, will help the needy parts of our\nown region.\nMay I say that in my best judgement the greatest\ndanger is a combination of high technology and deep\nhatred, of modern instruments and feudalistic views, and\nthe greatest hope for all of us is a double effort to respect\nhuman values and modern education.\nIsrael itself is in good shape. We are strong militarily:\nI do not deny it. We have an excellent economy \u2014 an\neconomy of brains, not of material resources. We have\nabsorbed a very large immigration of white and black Jews,\nwhite Jews from Russia and black Jews from Ethiopia, and\nnobody can understand what put Israel in such a relatively\ngood position.\nWhat brought this about is, first of all, the return to\nthe moral choice. By the end of this year \u2014 at the latest\nat the beginning of next year \u2014 not one Palestinian will\nremain under our control. For the first time in the history\nof the Palestinian people, they are educating their children\nwithout intervention by us or anybody else. Nobody\nforces us to do so. We are not weak. We are not poor.\nWe are not under pressure. We have had to take serious\nrisks because terror still continues. The Arab boycott is\nstill intact.\nIn our own country there is strong opposition to\nwhat we are doing. We have had to spend a great part of\nour budget to make peace \u2014 and yet, despite all this, we\ndecided to make a moral choice: not to dominate another\npeople. We stated in this Assembly that that was our\nintention. Now we have done it and even politically, as\ndifficult as it may be at home \u2014 because, as a party, we\nmay win historically but we may also lose politically \u2014\nbut then, winning peace is in our eyes more important\nthan winning elections. Why should you be elected if you\ndo not use the mandate of the people to change the course\nof your history in a reasoned, moral way?\nWe believe that the strength of ethical judgement is\nas important as military exercises or triumphs. We gave\nup land and produced instead an economy of brains.\nToday Israel is making out of its brains more than some\nother countries in our vicinity are making out of oil.\nAnd what we actually expect from the Palestinians\nis for them to become democratic, to be prosperous, to\nfight violence and terror, and we are giving our\nneighbours a simple message: What we can do,\neverybody can do.\nFor many years there was a legend that only the\nNorth, which is white and wealthy and permanent, is a\nsuccess story, whereas the South is condemned to\nbackwardness, to poverty, to lagging behind. What has\nhappened in Asia, where the most vibrant economic\nendeavours are taking place today, and what is happening\nin Latin America show that the economy has nothing to\ndo with geographical location or the colour of the skin.\nMake the right choice: serve your people and create a\nnew future.\nWhat we are offering to anyone who is interested is\nour experience \u2014 open, in a comradely way. We do not\nwant to dominate anybody and certainly not anybody\u2019s\neconomy. We did not give up the domination of people\nto gain domination of markets. And we are suggesting to\n5\n\n\nour neighbours \u2014 and we are happy that they have\naccepted \u2014 is that the new frontiers \u2014 say, between\nJordan and Israel \u2014 will not be frontiers of mines and\nhostile fences, but an occasion for joint ventures.\nThe whole rift of Africa, the whole valley which is a\ndesert that separates the Jordanians and us will become,\nwith God\u2019s help, a source for work, for development. We\nwill build hotels and schools and desalination plants and\nparks, and people will be free to move from one side to the\nother, competing without hating, cooperating without\ndominating.\nWe want to do the same about the dividing line\nbetween us and the Palestinians: we want to build alongside\nthe line on the West Bank and Gaza eight industrial parks\nso that the Palestinians will not have to cross the border\nand go through Israel\u2019s checkpoints: instead, work will\ncome to them, and together we shall invest and together we\nshall develop.\nA better economy is the best guarantee of peace.\nActually, there cannot be economic cooperation without\npolitical understanding. Recently, while we were negotiating\nwe created three zones of security sensibility on the West\nBank \u2014 zone A, zone B and zone C. Then we turned to\nwater and electricity and we asked the water and the\ncurrent to submit to our political wisdom, but the electricity\nand the water people said that they did not distinguish\nbetween A, B and C. Water flows according to nature and\nnot according to artificial agreements, and electric current\ndoes not stop at A or B or C. They serve everybody.\nToday in the Middle East as elsewhere, the distinction\nis no longer ideological or religious or national. There is\njust one distinction between an old, poor, backward\neconomy and a new age where economies are based on\ntechnology and science and where the natural resource is\nschools for the children and not the mines of the Gulf.\nEverybody can postpone the choice but nobody can escape\nit.\nOur aim is to have peace so as to serve our people; to\nhave education so as to equip our children to take\nadvantage of the new age, to be equal to others and to\ncompete with other children. It cannot remain a peace\nbetween leaders: it must become a peace for the people,\nnow and in the future.\nI started by showing what has happened in three or\nfour short years. It is a revolution. It is a beginning. We\nshould not stop in the middle. Let everybody pray to the\nLord in the language he is used to. Let everybody respect\nhis own tradition, his own heritage. Let everybody respect\nthe special experience of a people, of a nation. But let all\nof us give up unnecessary hatred, untold suspicion. Let us\ngive up barricading ourselves behind old dogmas and\nterrible prejudices. Let us help the people and the future.\nThen the 50 years of the United Nations will offer not\njust 50 years without war but the coming 50 years with\npeace and prosperity.\n"

        "file_text": "As we\ncommemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations,\nit is indeed an honour for me to address this distinguished\nAssembly. I take pride in conveying to it fraternal and\ncordial greetings from the new Labour Government and the\npeople of Saint Kitts and Nevis.\nThe United Nations has made noticeable progress\nand important strides during the past five decades through\nsheer determination, assiduity and the unrelenting faith of\nits Members. This is faith in an Organization that has\nbeen able to balance the interests of the weak with those\nof the strong, faith in our collective will to preserve\ndemocracy, promote peace and improve the quality of life\nfor all our peoples. The occasion of the convening of this\nhistoric session of the United Nations General Assembly\nprovides an important impetus to galvanize our\nGovernments to reaffirm our commitment to the causes of\nworld peace, international security and development. This\nfaith represents the very essence of what we celebrate not\nonly this year, but every year as well.\nFifty years ago a few men of great courage and\nvision cast aside national differences to come together to\nplant new seeds of hope in a future that would one day\nbear fruit for humankind to enjoy. The historic legacy of\ncooperation and partnership that triumphed over\nindividualism should burn like an eternal flame in our\nminds, serving to remind us all that peace, one of the\nmost precious of commodities, is not ours to squander,\nbut merely on loan to us. We have a solemn\nresponsibility to pass it on to future generations. The\nGovernment of Saint Kitts and Nevis salutes those\nvisionaries of half a century ago and thanks them for the\nrich legacy bequeathed to us all.\nI wish to join other delegations in expressing\nwarmest congratulations and good wishes to you, Sir, our\nnew President, elected to preside over the Assembly in\nthis landmark year in the history of the United Nations.\n\n\nThe Government of Saint Kitts and Nevis wishes to assure\nyou, Mr. President, of its continued cooperation and\nsupport. We are confident that your presidency will be\nmarked by adroit leadership, which will ensure a successful\noutcome to these deliberations.\nOn behalf of my Government, I am pleased to express\ngratitude to the outgoing president, His Excellency\nMr. Amara Essy of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, for his diligence and able\nguidance in a year characterized by varying degrees of\npolitical turmoil and other serious challenges.\nI salute the Secretary-General, His Excellency\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for his tenacious leadership, his\ngoodwill, and his diplomatic skills par excellence, which\nhave been tested with great frequency since he took office\na few years ago. My Government congratulates the\nSecretary-General on the outstanding manner in which he\nhas carried out the mandates of the Organization with\nregard to peace-keeping and humanitarian efforts. As our\nnations continue to work together to build a better future\nfor our peoples, I wish to assure him of my Government\u2019s\ncontinued cooperation, support and goodwill.\nAs regards human rights, my Government is of the\nview that, as an international fraternity of nations, we find\nit incumbent on us all to remember that every single human\nbeing has an inalienable right to freedom, to the pursuit of\nhappiness and to a better standard of life.\nThe sanctity of human life is not negotiable; it is\nparamount. My Government remains steadfast in its own\nefforts, and supports those of the United Nations to protect\nand preserve human rights.\nI now call attention to the question of representative\ndemocracy. The Government of Saint Kitts and Nevis\nwarmly welcomes the unprecedented pace of democratic\nreforms taking place around the world. However, we are\nconcerned with the growing complexities of recurrent\nproblems and the emergence of new and more complicated\nones which still pose serious threats to world peace and\ninternational security.\nConsequently, my delegation commends the resolve of\nthe United Nations and its willing leadership to steer\nMember States along a steady and purposeful course\nthrough the turbulent seas of political upheavals.\nIt is encouraging to see that, despite obvious problems,\ndemocracy continues to spring up in the far-flung corners\nof the world. This should propel us to channel our\ncollective energies into ensuring that those peoples still\nyearning for a taste of freedom will one day come to\nexperience the triumph of democracy.\nThe Caribbean breathed a sigh of relief when the\nhorrid spectre of dictatorship was removed from the\nHaitian landscape. Finally, the people of Haiti can begin\nto harvest the rewards of peace as they proceed to build\na lasting and viable democracy.\nAt present the Caribbean and Latin America enjoy\na period of relative peace and the rule of law. We wish\nfor this to continue infinitely. It is certainly not my\nintention to be the harbinger of doom. However, we\ncannot afford to take this situation for granted, because\nhistory bears frightening and credible witness to the fact\nthat political instability and poverty in areas where\ndemocracy is fragile, tend to form a treacherous alliance.\nDemocracy as a mere concept, without the requisite\nsupport of infrastructural development and institution-\nbuilding, cannot survive. In order for democracy to\nremain viable in countries which are unaccustomed to it\nand/or which suffer from high or increasing levels of\npoverty, democracy should be buttressed with the\nappropriate support systems.\nMy Government firmly believes that the United\nNations is a people\u2019s Organization. Therefore, we the\nMembers should impress upon the poor masses, which are\noften easily led and misled, that democracy works, that it\ncan work for them, and that eventually, if given a chance,\nit will deliver the political and material benefits they\nrequire to improve their lives.\nI wish to state here clearly that my Government is\nnot appealing for hand-outs. On the contrary, we appeal\nfor a reliable hand of genuine cooperation and\npartnership. Because our countries share a common world\ncommunity, with common concerns and interests, we\nshould become our brother\u2019s keeper. Failure to work\ntogether effectively means that we foreclose the\npossibility of learning from the past, and at the same\ntime, we shall be burning the bridges to the future, built\nwith selfless courage by our predecessors.\nIt appears that whenever we succeed in solving one\nmajor problem another more complicated one is foisted\nupon us. The post-cold-war world has given way to the\nre-emergence of agonizing, old ethnic tensions, worsening\nlevels of poverty and widening economic inequalities\nwhich, together, continue to force their way to the top of\n2\n\n\nthe international agenda. These new challenges require\ninnovative and collective strategies. They require\npartnership.\nThe prevalence and the length of the conflict in the\nformer Yugoslavia seem to elude attempts at an effective\nand lasting solution. None the less, we support the\ninternational efforts to find a diplomatic resolution of this\nconflict.\nTherefore, my Government welcomes the timely\ninitiatives of the United States Government, which we\nconsider to be crucial in laying the groundwork for future\nprogress in ending the war. Also, we wish to compliment\nefforts by the United Nations and the North Atlantic Treaty\nOrganization to broker a lasting peace in the former\nYugoslavia.\nThe Government of Saint Kitts and Nevis strongly\ncondemns the outrageous and cowardly acts of genocide,\n\u201cethnic cleansing\u201d and indiscriminate killing of the innocent\nand helpless, on all sides in this brutal conflict. It is my\nGovernment\u2019s sincerest hope that the persons found to be\nresponsible for these atrocities will be brought to justice.\nI wish now to turn to another volatile region, the\nMiddle East, which has for a long time been one of the\nlingering trouble spots in world affairs.\nTimes are changing, and in the interest of peace some\nGovernments in the region have begun to respond to these\nchanges by taking appropriate steps to reconcile their\ndifferences and to ensure that their peoples can live\ntogether in peace. The Government of Saint Kitts and Nevis\napplauds the initiatives of the Government of Israel and the\nPalestine Liberation Organization to rescue peace from the\nclutches of terrorism and violence. This augurs well for\npeace not only in the disputed territories but also\nthroughout the Middle East. Further, we urge nations in the\nregion to respect Israel\u2019s right to exist and to follow the\nlead of the recent accord reached between the Governments\nof Israel and the Kingdom of Jordan.\nWe hope that other countries in the region will heed\nthe call of peace and use diplomacy in the pursuit of their\nobjectives. Also, we urge all Governments to declare war\non terrorism and to make a commitment to its eradication,\nwherever it may lurk. My Government is unambiguous in\nits belief that an act of terror against any man, anywhere,\nis an act of terror against all mankind, everywhere.\nThe Government of Saint Kitts and Nevis welcomes\nthe decision taken last year by the Iraqi Government to\nrecognize the State of Kuwait. Kuwait\u2019s territorial\nintegrity and sovereignty must be maintained. We also\ncall on the Government of Iraq to comply with all United\nNations resolutions and to release all Kuwaiti nationals\ndetained illegally in Iraq.\nThe Government of Saint Kitts and Nevis is\nconvinced that the United Nations is about people.\nConsequently, we expect this Organization to advance the\ncauses of all our peoples. To achieve this, however,\nMember Governments must fulfil their obligations to the\nOrganization so that it can function more effectively. At\nthe same time, the United Nations has to accept that it is\naccountable to its vast membership. Also, Member\nGovernments and the Organization should seek to\nreconcile this critical relationship and work more closely\nin the future to devise new approaches to problem-\nsolving, development and security. The time has come for\nus to change the way we do business. Our Government is\nin favour of the reform of the Security Council to reflect\nthe current configuration of world affairs.\nI should like to focus the Assembly\u2019s attention on\nthe question of membership. As we all are well aware,\none of the fundamental principles of this Organization is\nthat of universality of membership. My Government\nperceives the United Nations as a people\u2019s organization;\ntherefore, we believe that Member States will appreciate\nthe need to consider the timely readmittance of the\nRepublic of China on Taiwan to this body. The\nGovernment of Saint Kitts and Nevis maintains that that\ncountry\u2019s 21 million inhabitants have the right to be\nappropriately represented in this Organization. Taiwan\ncontinues to comply with international law and has taken\ndue steps to ensure the democratization of its politics and\nrespect for and protection of human rights.\nI now wish to refer to the important subjects of,\nfirst, the vulnerability of small island States and,\nsecondly, sustainable development. Although these issues\nare not new, my Government remains convinced that the\ninternational community cannot afford to forget them. We\ncommend the United Nations for hosting a Conference\nlast year in Barbados to address these crucial issues.\nHowever, we need to go further. This will require\npartnership, cooperation and resolve from both developing\nand developed nations.\nMany small island nations are painfully aware of the\npotential dangers that environmental degradation holds for\n3\n\n\nsmall island States like Saint Kitts and Nevis. Some of\nthese dangers are: rising sea levels, coastal erosion, sea\npollution and natural disasters. These problems are easily\ncompounded, because small island States with limited\nresources, such as those in the Caribbean, lack the financial\nand technological capabilities to deal with them.\nThe environmental vulnerability of small island States\nis intricately interwoven with our economic dependency and\nopenness to external forces. My delegation therefore\nappeals to the international financial community to review\nits policies on concessional lending to small island States.\nStatistics can be quite misleading. The tendency to\njudge a country and its people\u2019s development based on\nfigures such as per capita income quite easily distort the\nobjective reality of our situation.\nJust last month, for example, Saint Kitts and Nevis\nwas ravaged by two hurricanes. Unfortunately, the passage\nof the first was sufficient to disrupt seriously the daily lives\nof my people, to destroy the physical infrastructure, and to\nundermine severely the economic life of both islands. My\ncountry\u2019s main export crop, sugar, was almost completely\nwiped out, and prospects for the 1996 sugar harvest are\ndiscouraging. Further, my country\u2019s main hospital suffered\nextensive damage, placing the health of the people of Saint\nKitts and Nevis at great risk. I take this opportunity to\nthank the international community for the quick response in\nproviding emergency relief to the people of Saint Kitts and\nNevis.\nThis, first and foremost, is the reality of small island\nStates. It is this reality \u2014 not cold statistics \u2014 that should\ninform world policies towards them.\nReturning to the subject of the environment, my\ndelegation puts forward the view that, to a large extent, our\nislands have inherited problems that are not always of our\nown making. This is not meant to lay blame. On the\ncontrary, we wish to suggest that all countries take\nappropriate measures to reduce the possibility of\nenvironmental degradation and that those in a position to\nhelp in environmental protection lend assistance to those\nunable to do so.\nMy delegation makes a fervent appeal to the\ndeveloped world not to link the granting of development\nassistance to guarantees of environmental protection from\ndeveloping countries. Instead, we propose a much closer\nand more constructive working relationship aimed at\ncreating more meaningful, long-term strategies to solve\nenvironmental problems.\nThe Government of Saint Kitts and Nevis\nvehemently condemns attempts by some countries to use\nthe waterways of the Caribbean as a transshipment lane\nfor their toxic and hazardous wastes. Clearly, this region\nsuffers from a high vulnerability index. We therefore\ncannot afford any increase in this index.\nWe call on countries responsible to find safer and\nmore appropriate means of dealing with their toxic and\nhazardous waste.\nSaint Kitts and Nevis categorically supports the\nindefinite, unconditional extension of the Treaty on the\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and we\nanxiously await the successful conclusion of negotiations\non a comprehensive test-ban treaty. Also, we urge all\nnations to impose a ban on nuclear tests.\nWith regard to women in development, we applaud\nthe convening of the Fourth World Conference on\nWomen in Beijing to examine issues affecting women\nthroughout the world. We appeal to Member States to go\nbeyond the conference halls and to make genuine efforts\nto promote the interests of women. The protection of\nhuman rights and the pursuit of sustainable development\ncannot be viewed as distinct from the development of\nwomen and their rights. They must go hand in hand.\nWomen play a central and critical role in the process\nof development. Their contributions should be recognized\nand rewarded appropriately. My Government is\ncommitted to further legislation to eliminate gender\ndiscrimination and to institute policies that address the\ninequalities that women face.\nWe also have a duty to protect the lives of our\nchildren and to ensure that we provide them with\nadequate protection for their individual growth and future\nprosperity. We hold their future in trust, and we therefore\nhave a sacred responsibility to them, as well as to future\ngenerations.\nThe Government of Saint Kitts and Nevis strongly\ncondemns any form of discrimination and violence against\nwomen and children. We urge all Governments to wage\nwar on the barbarism of child prostitution, infanticide and\nabortion on discovery that the foetus is female. The right\nto life is fundamental, universal and sacred.\n4\n\n\nIn conclusion, the catalogue of problems confronting\nour nations bears ample testimony to the tremendous tasks\nahead of us. Our countries share common goals such as the\npursuit of peace, world security, and better standards of\nliving for all our peoples.\nOur predecessors have sown the seeds, and today we\ncelebrate their legacy. My Government is convinced that we\ncan achieve our individual goals by working collectively.\nAnd indeed we can. I know we can. Most importantly, we\nowe it to those who elected us, as well as to those who will\nfollow.\nAs we, the peoples of the world, celebrate our past\nachievements, let us resolve to achieve even greater\nsuccesses in the years ahead.\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me first to\ncongratulate His Excellency Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral,\nand Portugal, on his election to lead the General\nAssembly through this important fiftieth session. I should\nalso like to record Singapore\u2019s appreciation to his\ndistinguished predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Amara\nEssy of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire. I also take this opportunity to\nthank our Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali,\nfor his continuing dedication to the purposes of the\nUnited Nations.\nIn recent years the United Nations has had much to\ndo with peace-keeping and human rights. They are\nimportant matters, but the United Nations is not just about\npeace-keeping or human rights. International economic\ncooperation is one of the important purposes of the\nUnited Nations as defined by our Charter. Poverty breeds\nconflict, but abject poverty makes a mockery of all civil\nliberties.\nOur Secretary-General\u2019s Agenda for Development\nshould give cause for all of us to reflect on the United\nNations role in the world economy. Of the five decades\nof the existence of the United Nations, four have been\ndedicated to development. Vast sums have been\nexpended, but with what result?\nSpecialized agencies like the United Nations\nChildren\u2019s Fund (UNICEF), the World Health\nOrganization (WHO), the United Nations Population Fund\n(UNFPA) and the United Nations Development\n21\n\n\nProgramme (UNDP) do not hit the headlines, but are the\nmost successful institutions in the United Nations system.\nThey make quiet, unglamorous, but no-less-valuable\ncontributions to human dignity and international order than\ndo the Blue Helmets or the High Commissioner for Human\nRights.\nUnfortunately, however, there is a limit to what the\nspecialized agencies can do to help uplift the individual\nnational economies. The latest United Nations World\nEconomic and Social Survey announces the good news that\nthe global economy has reached the cruising speed of 3 per\ncent growth. But for many countries this news is somewhat\nabstract and irrelevant to their day-to-day concerns.\nThat same report speaks delicately of distinctions\nbetween robust, vulnerable and weak developing economies.\nThis polite language only masks the continuing reality of\ndegradation, poverty, misery, disease and death.\nTen years ago the United Nations Conference on\nTrade and Development (UNCTAD) officially classified 36\nMember States as least developed. Five years ago this\nnumber had risen to 42, and as of August this year there\nwere 48 least developed countries. All forecasts project an\neven more skewed distribution of global income. The\nmarginalization of more than a quarter of the membership\nof the United Nations in the world economy must surely be\nrecognized as a serious problem. Those Members cannot be\nshunted aside indefinitely without provoking a major\nbreakdown of international order.\nYet today key development institutions are under\nattack. Indeed, the very role of the United Nations in the\nglobal economy risks marginalization.\nWhy is this so? First, lack of a consensus on a post-\ncold-war strategic rationale for development is one\nimportant factor. Secondly, the endemic tension between\nthe United Nations and the Bretton Woods institutions, a\ncontest for power and control, is another factor. Thirdly, the\nfailure of Member States, especially major contributors, to\npay their dues in full and on time has created severe\nbudgetary pressures on the United Nations to cut back\ndevelopment programmes.\nThese, however, are only partial explanations. The key\nfactor is the failure of the United Nations to respond to the\ncentral economic phenomenon of our time: the globalization\nof the international economy and the emergence of what\nhas been termed a borderless world.\nFor better or for worse, sovereign nation-States will\nbe around for a long time to come. Governments are and\nwill continue to be key players in the world economy. But\na model of sovereign States, interacting only at the\nmargins of their existence, no longer adequately describes\nthe contemporary world economy. Modern technology and\ncommunications have led to money, trade and investments\nflashing across borders in ways that Governments cannot\ncontrol. This is redefining the very notions of resources,\nwealth and value.\nTherefore, we have to cope with a globalized\ninternational economy in which national actions are no\nlonger adequate or effective, but in which, at the same\ntime, Governments and States still cannot be disregarded.\nEurope, the Americas and the Asia-Pacific region have\nresponded in different ways, such as with the European\nUnion (EU), the North American Free Trade Agreement\n(NAFTA) and, in a looser form, the Asia-Pacific\nEconomic Cooperation (APEC). Africa is also looking at\nits own regional economic groupings. These experiments\nrepresent some of the most significant developments in\ncontemporary international relations. They may define a\npost-cold-war structure for international order in the next\ncentury.\nThe United Nations, like its individual Members, is\nstruggling to comprehend and catch up with the\nimplications of a globalized international economy. But\nthe United Nations has been more sluggish to respond\nthan many of its Members.\nWhen we speak of regionalization in the United\nNations, we are referring primarily to the regional\ncommissions, which, however, are entirely divorced from\nthe important regional economic groupings. This is a\nsymptom of a wider problem.\nAt a time when most significant developments in the\nworld economy are taking place outside the United\nNations, one can legitimately ask what the role of the\nUnited Nations is in the new world economy. There is a\ndanger that it will play no role at all unless it urgently\ntakes stock of its current approach to economic issues.\nSaving the United Nations from being relegated to\nirrelevance requires an attitudinal shift that cuts across\nboth North and South. Member States from both the\nNorth and the South must accept a new discipline. We\nmust forsake ideology for pragmatism and posturing for\npracticality in order to concentrate on a more focused and\ncompact economic agenda. This will give the United\n22\n\n\nNations the tools it needs to cope with the new kind of\nglobal economy that is emerging.\nThe United Nations must emphasize its strengths, not\nits weaknesses. It is not the best forum to negotiate\nspecialized and technical matters. Neither is the United\nNations an executive body for matters of trade or finance;\nthat role properly belongs to the Bretton Woods institutions\nand the World Trade Organization. The strengths of the\nUnited Nations are political, which is a plus because the\nnew world economy demands political as well as technical\nresponses.\nThe new globalized economy has sharply focused\ndevelopment issues that policy makers and theoreticians\nhave grappled with for decades. The strictly economic\ndebate over appropriate development strategies is over.\nOpting out is clearly not an option. It will only accelerate\nthe pace of marginalization. However, it has become\nequally clear that the magic of the market is not enough.\nOnly the United Nations can meet the two resulting\npolitical challenges. They are, first, coping with the political\nconsequences of rapid but uneven economic growth and,\nsecondly, helping the least developed to build the\ninstitutions that will allow them to plug into the globalized\neconomy. Let me elaborate.\nFirst, the process of rapid growth in some countries\nhas caused political tensions between the successful\ndeveloping countries and the mature Western economies.\nThe latter have continued to grow, but more slowly and\nwithout significant increases in employment or\nimprovements in real living standards.\nJob creation and job protection will certainly be high\non the agendas of political leaders throughout the\nindustrialized world for at least the next decade. There has\nbeen a concerted and sometimes very vocal effort to link\neconomic issues to workers\u2019 rights, human rights, social\nconditions and environmental standards. Developing\ncountries view this as bad faith, feeling that the\nindustrialized countries are using any pretext to hobble and\nhandicap the developing world.\nThe critical issue is not really the rights and wrongs of\nthe case. It is managing shifts in relative positions of\npower. A way has to be found to contain the inevitable\nstrains and stresses between the old rich and the newly\naffluent economies. Continuing tensions are debilitating and\nwill slow growth for everyone.\nThe goal is to shape an international order that will\nboth optimize conditions for growth and facilitate the\nrescue of the least developed countries. There will be\nlittle attention paid to their needs if there is constant\njostling and tension between the successful developing\ncountries and the mature economies.\nThere is therefore a need for overarching\nframeworks that can help manage relations between the\nsuccessful developing countries and the mature\neconomies. There is a need to impose a global coherence\nand discipline on the emerging international system built\naround regional economic groupings. This is not a\nfunction that can be performed by the Bretton Woods\ninstitutions or even the World Trade Organization. After\nall, the first reaction of Europe and the United States to\nthe conclusion of the Uruguay Round was more assertive\nunilateralism.\nTo play a role in forging such frameworks, the\nUnited Nations must find the political will to reach\ngenuine consensus \u2014 not just on paper \u2014 on a realistic\nglobal economic agenda. But this will require self-\ndiscipline.\nWhen one reads the action plans and agendas of\nmany United Nations economic bodies, it is sometimes a\ndepressing exercise in political archaeology. Layer upon\nlayer of issues, some dating back to the 1960s and the\n1970s, are added with every passing session of the\nGeneral Assembly and conference. Their relevance to\ncontemporary problems is dubious.\nWhat is very puzzling is that, in reality, most\nMember States have in actual national practice long since\ndiscarded the attitudes and policies which are still\nfaithfully placed on the United Nations agenda and\nsolemnly debated and discussed in an archaic annual\nritual. United Nations economic bodies must therefore\neschew the temptation to pretend to micro-manage\ninternational economic affairs by delving into the nitty-\ngritty of issues they sometimes imperfectly comprehend.\nBut I do not advocate a completely laissez-faire\napproach. A globalized economy urgently demands\nmanagement precisely because it is rapidly moving\nbeyond the control of even the most powerful. But it\nrequires different management techniques. The day of the\nhegemonic manager of the international economic system\nis passing. In the new world economy, international order\ncan be assured only by the development of rule-based\nmultilateral regimes that define broad parameters for\n23\n\n\neconomic forces that are not susceptible to micro-\nmanagement. So the United Nations is the only universal\ninternational Organization with a Charter that gives it a\nmandate to range across the spectrum of issues that require\nattention. If the United Nations can find the political will\nand self-discipline, it will be potentially well placed, in our\nview, to develop a genuine consensus on an agenda for\nsuch regimes.\nRule-based multilateral regimes are not just in the\ninterest of small and weak States. The predictability and\nstability they confer benefits all of us. It will be\nincreasingly uncomfortable and difficult for even the\nstrongest to assert themselves unilaterally in a globalized\neconomy where business, finance, trade and industry cannot\nalways be neatly categorized along national lines. A blow\naimed at an opponent\u2019s chin may end up bruising one\u2019s\nown shoulder. If the United Nations can develop consensus\non an agenda, its relationship with the Bretton Woods\ninstitutions and the World Trade Organization will naturally\nfall into place. It will clearly be their responsibility to flesh\nout and implement the global regimes on an agenda agreed\nto by the United Nations. But these institutions are correct\nto resist if, as is now all too often the case, the agenda is\nimpractical and delves too deeply into matters of detail.\nSecondly, the new globalized international economy\nhas challenged the belief that developing countries could\ngrow simply by relaxing controls and privatizing. This is a\nnecessary but insufficient condition. In all of the most\nsuccessful developing countries, good, strong and stable\ngovernment has always played a key role. The World\nBank\u2019s 1993 report entitled \u201cThe East Asian Miracle\u201d\nreveals that the miracle was not so much a miracle after all.\nThe secret was getting the macroeconomic fundamentals\nright. But that has been known for decades. Yet there has\nbeen no growth in much of the world. The difference was\npublic policy. Developing countries that try to follow the\nEast Asian model often fail, not because they do not know\nwhat the correct economic policies are, but because they\nlack the political underpinnings to make such policies stick.\nIt is the government that will determine whether a country\ncan plug into the fast moving global economy, or whether\nit will be bypassed.\nTherefore, an urgent and delicate problem is how the\nUnited Nations can help the least developed to build\ngovernment and political institutions that will enable them\nto plug into the globalized economy for development,\nwithout intruding too brashly into their domestic affairs.\nArticle 2, paragraph 7, of the Charter is still the basic\ncornerstone of the United Nations. A multilateral approach\nto this sensitive question may be more acceptable than\ncrude bilateralism.\nBut to deal realistically with this issue, the United\nNations must set aside what has become a largely\ntheological debate about the relationship between\ndemocracy, development and human rights \u2014 a phrase\nwhich has become part of the accepted language of\ndevelopment debates. But it is harmful and misleading if\nit implies an inevitable or simple linear causality. Of\ncourse, these concepts may well be linked in some way.\nBut let us be clear that what we are really talking about\nis the relationship between democracy and human rights,\non the one hand, and development, on the other. In other\nwords, the causality is not linear, simple or inevitable.\nThere is no question that repression is wrong and\nunhealthy and will stifle growth. There is also ample\nempirical evidence to prove beyond any doubt that\neconomic growth requires political stability and good\ngovernment. The terms \u201cdemocracy\u201d and \u201cgood\ngovernment\u201d are often used as if they were synonyms. Of\ncourse they overlap to a degree, but they are not the same\nthing.\nSingapore\u2019s experience is that good government\nmust be erected on three interrelated pillars: political\naccountability, a long-term orientation, and social justice.\nFor long-term stability, Governments must govern with\nthe support of the governed. Governments that do not\ndeliver will not last. But this fact and the need for\nperiodic free and fair elections do not prescribe any\nparticular model of political system or ideology. So the\nclash and clamour of contending interests, street\ndemonstrations and a rambunctious and abusive press may\nmake for more exciting television for some Western\naudiences. It may even work for some countries. But\nmore often than not it contradicts the second pillar of\ngood government, which is long-term orientation. That\nrequires the ability to resist populist and sectional\npressures and, on occasion, administer bitter medicine to\novercome economic challenges. Singapore\u2019s experience\nhas convinced us that the first duty of government is to\ngovern, and also govern fairly. At times, this will require\na firm hand.\nThe third element of good government is social\njustice. There should be equal opportunities for all groups.\nIf the Government is fair to all ethnic, religious and social\ngroups, it will not be beholden to any special interest.\nThis is important in any society. It has been one of the\nreasons for Singapore\u2019s political stability and social\ncohesion. But Singapore does not hold itself up as a\n24\n\n\nmodel, although we are happy, and prepared, to share our\nexperience with anyone who may be interested. No one can\nprescribe any particular model of political development for\nany country. Indeed, when this is attempted dogmatically,\nwith only a superficial understanding of the complexities of\nspecific situations, it leads to disaster. Our basic assumption\nis a fundamentally pragmatic and pluralist one \u2014 that there\nare no models that can be applied everywhere.\nSo growth and stability are linked by a complex and\nsubtle dynamic: an unrelenting search for an equilibrium\nbetween the rights of the individual, the claims of the\ncommunity to which every individual must belong, and the\nno less urgent need for Governments to govern effectively\nand fairly. No balance between individual liberty and\ngrowth can be valid for all countries are for all time. Every\nsociety must find its own appropriate equilibrium in the\ncontext of its own historical and cultural experiences if the\ncountry is to progress.\nSingapore straddles the developed and the developing\nworlds. Our population generally enjoys a comfortable\nstandard of living, and our economy has a relatively\nsophisticated service and industrial sector, performing\nglobal roles. But Singapore also has structural\nvulnerabilities; it has resource limitations that prevent us\nfrom being fully developed as yet. Therefore, it is with a\nspecial perspective that we in Singapore observe the\nongoing debates in and about the United Nations economic\ninstitutions. Sometimes we wonder: whose interests are\nreally served by a prolonged debate, increasingly divorced\nfrom global economic reality? Is it the interest of those who\nwant to preserve these institutions, or of those who would\nprefer to relegate them to some historical dead end? I do\nnot have the answer to that question, but I raise it as one\nthat merits urgent attention. I do not think there is much\ntime left.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr.\nPresident, congratulations on your assumption of the\npresidency of this historic fiftieth session of the General\nAssembly of the United Nations. Leadership has never been\nmore critical to this Organization, and we are most grateful\nfor the able work of your predecessor, Foreign Minister\nAmara Essy of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, and of the Secretary-General,\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali.\nWe stand at the threshold of a new era, a time of great\nperil and magnificent promise. The choices that we make\nin the coming weeks and months could rejuvenate the\nUnited Nations for a new century of cooperation and\nprogress, or they could consign the world body to years of\nstagnation, decline, and irrelevance. Neither path is\ninevitable, and none of the United Nations shortcomings are\nirreparable. The choice is ours.\nThe world, like the United Nations, is in a period of\ntransition and flux. Virulent local conflicts in several\nregions are being met with global cooperation to contain the\nviolence, assist the victims and mend the political and\neconomic fabric of the shattered societies. During this past\nweek alone, patient and firm diplomacy has yielded\nencouraging results in the Middle East and the former\nYugoslavia, two areas known more for conflict than\ncompromise. In some places, however, gross violations of\nhuman rights and genocide are being committed, even as\ngreat strides are taken globally by way of strengthening\ninternational law and human rights standards, most recently\nthrough the Fourth World Conference on Women. As the\nfields of communications, trade and technology have\nexpanded to global proportions, interdependence has\nbecome a fact of life.\nIn a world of change, no institution \u2014 least of all the\nUnited Nations \u2014 can afford to stand still. The world body,\nafter all, is an experiment. Launched by leaders of vision,\nforesight, and courage at another historic turning point half\na century ago, the United Nations has steadfastly stood for\nchange through peaceful means, for cooperation over\nconflict, and for hope over despair. Today, we have been\ncalled upon to reinvent the world Organization to meet the\nchallenges of the twenty-first century, while we recommit\nourselves to its founding, and enduring, principles.\nThere is little doubt that this is a time of testing for\nthe United Nations, but really it is the Member States \u2014 all\n185 of us \u2014 that are being challenged as never before. It\nis our collective will, commitment, and inspiration \u2014 or\nlack thereof \u2014 that will determine the fate of history\u2019s\ngreatest experiment in international organization. Our\nresponsibilities begin with paying our financial obligations\nin full and on time, but they run much deeper and wider.\nThe Republic of Korea recognizes that the time has come\nfor far-reaching reform in the way the United Nations\nconducts its business and structures its programmes.\nKorea gladly joins the many other nations to make this\nhistoric General Assembly session a time of reflection,\nrecommitment, and renewal.\nNo dimension of the United Nations work has been\nmore severely or dramatically tested than its far-flung\npeace operations. All of us owe a debt of gratitude to the\nmen and women from 70 countries whose courage and\nfortitude have kept the hope of peace alive under the most\ndifficult and trying circumstances. We have asked them\nto accomplish a great deal with very little. If the United\nNations is to respond effectively to the new forms of\nconflict that threaten peace and human security in today\u2019s\nuncertain world, it is imperative that its peace operations\nbe strengthened and renovated. We appreciate the ongoing\nefforts to enhance the preventive diplomacy and rapid\nreaction capabilities of the United Nations, both within\nand outside the framework of the Organization.\nOne of the most promising avenues for bolstering\nUnited Nations capabilities is the United Nations stand-by\narrangement system, and I would encourage the broadest\npossible participation by Member States. Today, my\nGovernment reaffirms its decision to take part in the\nUnited Nations stand-by system and its willingness to\nprovide some 800 men for this effort, including an\ninfantry battalion, engineering units, medical units and\nmilitary observers.\nSince Korea\u2019s first participation in United Nations\npeace-keeping operations in Somalia in 1993, when it sent\nan engineering battalion to the United Nations Operation\nin Somalia (UNOSOM II), it has dispatched a medical\nunit to the Western Sahara and military observers to both\nthe United Nations Military Observer Group in India and\nPakistan (UNMOGIP) in Kashmir and the United Nations\nObserver Mission in Georgia (UNOMIG). I am also\npleased to inform the Assembly that next week a Korean\nbridging unit of engineers will arrive in Angola to take\npart in the United Nations Angola Verification Mission (UNAVEMIII).\nMy Government is determined to expand its\ncontributions to the peace-keeping operations of the\nUnited Nations at a level commensurate with our national\ncapacity.\n5\n\n\nAs one of the troop-contributing countries to United\nNations peace-keeping operations, we feel a great deal of\nconcern over the fact that the number of casualties among\nUnited Nations peace-keepers is sharply increasing and that\ntheir safety is frequently endangered.\nWe firmly believe that hostile acts against United\nNations personnel, such as armed attack and hostage-taking,\nare absolutely unacceptable and should not go unpunished.\nWhile we appreciate efforts for the protection of United\nNations personnel, such as the conclusion of the\nConvention on the Safety of United Nations and Associated\nPersonnel, we feel that it is the collective responsibility of\nall Member States of the United Nations to ensure the\nsafety and security of United Nations peace-keepers.\nThe challenges before the United Nations, of course,\nare hardly confined to traditional security concerns. Unrest\nin many parts of the world serves to remind us of the\neconomic, social and political roots of conflict. Uneven\npatterns of economic and social development are of\nparticular concern.\nOn the positive side, despite a slight decline in growth\nsince last year, the recent economic recovery of the\ndeveloped countries and sustained growth in a large number\nof developing countries have helped boost the global\neconomy in 1995. Economies in transition have shown\nencouraging signs of improvement. The overall economic\nsituation in Africa has also made headway, albeit slow and\nmodest.\nHowever, developing countries, particularly those in\nAfrica, require the assistance of the international\ncommunity in their developmental efforts. Fostering a\nfavourable external economic environment for them is\nessential. In this regard, my delegation believes that the\ndebate in the Economic and Social Council on the theme of\ndevelopment in Africa this year was both timely and\nappropriate.\nIn strengthening its cooperation with developing\ncountries, particularly with the least developed countries,\nmy Government places primary emphasis on human\nresources development. We are implementing a plan, which\nwas announced by President Kim Young Sam at the World\nSummit for Social Development in Copenhagen, to provide\ntechnical training for over 30,000 people from developing\ncountries, particularly from the African continent, by the\nyear 2010.\n\nWe welcome the fact that the issue of development\nis receiving renewed attention as a pre-eminent global\nconcern. My Government is actively participating in the\nWorking Group of the General Assembly on \u201cAn Agenda\nfor Development\u201d. Although the primary responsibility for\ndevelopment falls on the individual Government, we\nbelieve that national development efforts also require the\nassistance of the international community.\nIn that spirit, we vigorously support the multilateral\nefforts to realize sustainable global development. As a\nfollow-up to President Kim\u2019s announcement at the\nCopenhagen Summit of our intention to increase our\nofficial development assistance, we plan to enlarge our\nvoluntary contribution to the operational activities of the\nUnited Nations by 65 per cent next year, and will\ncontinue such efforts in the coming years.\nIn our view, the Copenhagen Social Summit was a\nmilestone, not only because it laid a sound foundation for\ninternational assistance and cooperation in the area of\nsustainable social development, but also because it charted\na clear direction for future action.\nWomen\u2019s issues have also become a key part of the\nglobal agenda. My Government welcomes the recent\ndiscussions in Beijing on the enhancement of the status of\nwomen and looks forward to the full and early\nimplementation of the plan of action adopted at the\nConference.\nThe protection and enhancement of human rights are\nan enduring task. The inalienable and basic rights of\nhuman beings must be faithfully protected and preserved.\nAs articulated in the Vienna Declaration, the primary\nresponsibility for protecting human rights should be borne\nby the respective Government. However, it should also be\nnoted that the cooperation and attention of the\ninternational community, including the United Nations,\nare paramount to the efforts in this field.\nSince the inauguration of President Kim Young Sam\nin February 1993, the Government of the Republic of\nKorea has placed an especially high priority on the\npromotion of democracy and human rights. The\nGovernment has ardently supported the democratization\nprocess and has successfully taken various reform\nmeasures to promote human rights in the country. I\nshould like to take this opportunity to express my\n6\n\n\nGovernment\u2019s deep concern over the human rights situation\nin North Korea. As my Government strongly believes that\nthe people in North Korea, as our kindred, should enjoy the\nfundamental human rights to which all of us are entitled,\nwe urge Pyongyang to respond positively to the\ninternational calls for the protection of human rights,\nespecially through opening its society.\nAn outstanding and emotional dimension of this issue\nis the division of families on the Korean Peninsula. During\nthe Korean War, in 1950 to 1953, 10 million people were\nseparated from their families. Most were never to hear from\neach other again, because even the exchange of letters was\nprohibited between the two Koreas. Even after the war,\nhundreds of South Koreans were forcibly taken to North\nKorea against their will, leaving behind families grieving\nover separation and anguished by the uncertainty of whether\nthe other members were still alive. I believe that it is high\ntime for the community of nations, particularly the United\nNations, to render its assistance and do its part for these\ndivided families so that they may at least hear from each\nother until they are finally reunited.\nTurning to the issue of disarmament, I would like to\ntake this occasion to declare, on behalf of my Government,\na one-year moratorium, which may be extended, on the\nexport of anti-personnel land-mines. We hope that our\ndecision will strengthen the international efforts to limit the\nproliferation of land-mines and to end their indiscriminate\nuse.\nConsidering the continued importance of the\nConference on Disarmament as a unique negotiating forum\nfor disarmament, my delegation welcomes the decision on\nexpansion of membership of the Conference, adopted by\nconsensus at its plenary meeting a week ago. We hope that\nthe countries of the Group of 23 that wish to participate in\nthe Conference will be given full-fledged membership at\nthe earliest possible date.\nThe Republic of Korea, as one of the original\nsignatories to the Chemical Weapons Convention in 1993,\nhas taken steps to ratify the Convention with a view to\nsupporting the international endeavours to prohibit and\neliminate all types of weapons of mass destruction. As we\nall recognize, universal adherence to the Convention is an\nessential step towards securing an effective non-\nproliferation regime in this area. The Republic of Korea\ntherefore strongly urges those countries, including the\nDPRK, which have not yet joined the Convention to do so\nas soon as possible.\nIn our efforts to curb the proliferation of nuclear\nweapons, the indefinite extension of the Non-Proliferation\nTreaty (NPT) by consensus last May was a watershed\nevent. We urge the nuclear-weapon States to fulfil their\nresponsibilities under the NPT to make the world nuclear-\nfree. In this regard, my delegation joins the call of many\nother countries for the early conclusion of a\ncomprehensive test-ban treaty, a global agreement which\nwould undoubtedly help facilitate the eventual elimination\nof nuclear weapons as envisaged in the NPT.\nIn the same spirit, it is deeply regrettable that some\ncountries with nuclear weapons are still engaged in\nnuclear testing. On behalf of the Government and people\nof the Republic of Korea, I would like to urge those\nnations with future plans for testing to cancel them\nwithout delay.\nMy delegation strongly endorses the efforts to\nstrengthen the safeguards system of the International\nAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA). We believe that the\nfuture of the NPT also depends upon cooperation between\nStates in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. In this\nregard, we believe that the legitimate demands of the non-\nnuclear States to promote the peaceful uses of nuclear\nenergy should be duly respected and that resolute\nmeasures should be taken against those States that fail to\nfulfil their obligations under the IAEA safeguards system.\nThe North Korean nuclear issue remains a\nparamount security concern for North-East Asia and the\nworld. The Republic of Korea urges North Korea once\nagain not only to comply with its NPT obligations and\nIAEA safeguards in a full and complete manner, but also\nfaithfully to implement the Geneva Agreed Framework\nbetween the United States and the DPRK of October\n1994. Furthermore, North Korea should live up to its\ncommitments and obligations under the Joint Declaration\non Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.\nMaintaining peace and stability on the Korean\nPeninsula is not just an issue affecting 70 million\nKoreans, but also a strategic issue with critical\nimplications for the North-East Asia region and the world\nat large. Accordingly, we believe that the current\narmistice agreement must be kept in force until a\npermanent peace mechanism is set in place. With a view\nto dealing with all inter-Korean issues, my Government\nearnestly hopes that the North Korean leadership will\nrespond positively to our call for inter-Korean dialogue\nand cooperation.\n7\n\n\nAs I noted at the outset, the fiftieth anniversary of the\nUnited Nations provides a unique opportunity for the\ninternational community to revitalize, strengthen and reform\nthe United Nations system. To this end, a number of\nproposals, studies and reports have been put forward. My\nGovernment is closely following the constructive\ndiscussions which have been conducted thus far in the\nworking groups of the General Assembly seeking ways to\naugment the effectiveness, efficiency and democracy of the\nOrganization.\nAs for the Security Council, we are of the view that\nin reforming it account should be taken first and foremost\nof the need for equitable geographical representation in its\nmembership and enhanced transparency and efficiency in its\nworking methods. Given the utmost importance of the issue\nand its implication for other issues, we will remain flexible\nand open-minded to various ideas and suggestions and\nmake due contributions to the process of consensus-\nbuilding. We also believe that the coordinating role of the\nEconomic and Social Council should be strengthened,\nparticularly in the area of operational activities.\nOn the financial aspect of the United Nations, it is\nalarming to note that the total amount of unpaid\nassessments is well over $3.5 billion. An effective solution\nto the current financial difficulties should be found in order\nto meet the increasing demands of the United Nations and\nto strengthen it. It is in this context that we again urge all\nMember States to pay their assessed contributions on time\nand in full.\nIn order for reform to be successful, however, it is\ncrucial to secure a broad consensus among Member States.\nWe must not forget that consolidated political will, mutual\nconfidence and a sense of common interest and benefit\namong Member States are key elements in the process of\nreform. In this spirit, reform begins at home, in\nrededicating ourselves to the community of interests and\nprinciples that serve to unite the disparate nations of the\nworld.\nIn three weeks, in this Hall, the leaders of more than\n150 nations \u2014 three times as many as met in San Francisco\na half-century ago \u2014 will reaffirm their commitment to the\nideals and purposes enshrined in the Charter of the United\nNations.\nAs the nations and peoples of the world reflect upon\nwhat the United Nations has achieved in its first half-\ncentury and what it should aspire to in the years ahead, the\nRepublic of Korea wishes to renew its determination to\nrender full and unswerving support for the revitalization\nof the world body in the years ahead. We believe in the\ncollective ability of nations to build a safer, more\nprosperous and just world, and we are committed to do\nour part.\n"

His experience and\nproven diplomatic skills will guarantee the success of this\nimportant event. I wish also to congratulate his\npredecessor, Mr. Amara Essy, for the brilliant way in\nwhich he guided the work of the Assembly at its forty-\nninth session.\nI take this special opportunity also to acknowledge\nthe extraordinary work of the Secretary-General,\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, to promote peace,\ndevelopment and understanding among peoples.\nIn conformity with the premises of the moral\nrevolution led by the President of the Republic,\nMr. Carlos Roberto Reina, today\u2019s Honduras is making a\nunique effort: to consolidate a State truly based on law;\nto fight corruption at all levels; to encourage active\nparticipation among all citizens in a framework of\nnational convergence that will define the guidelines for a\nnew country; to emphasize absolute respect for human\nrights; and, in the context of a dynamic process of\nmodernizing the State, to adopt substantive institutional\nlegal measures and changes, with a view to strengthening\nour democratic, pluralistic system of government.\nThose changes include strengthening the judicial\nbranch; placing the national police under civilian\njurisdiction; transforming our compulsory military service\ninto voluntary, educational and humanistic service;\nallocating 35 per cent of the national budget to health,\neducation and social welfare, which reflects the interest of\nthe State in combating poverty, overcoming social\nproblems and establishing a system of government\nmarked by justice, solidarity and participation; adopting\nfiscal correction measures to decrease the negative impact\nof serious long-standing macroeconomic imbalances;\nbeginning the privatization of State-owned enterprises;\nundertaking financial reform; and taking the action needed\nto attract direct foreign investment and encourage joint\ninvestment.\nThose are some of the most relevant actions taken\nby the Government of Honduras; they show that, although\nour democracy was painfully stricken by the Central\n27\n\n\nAmerican crisis of the 1980s, it has had the courage to face\nup the unique challenges of today and of tomorrow.\nToday, Central America is seeking true participation\nin the new international economic order with an agenda of\nintegration firmly based on the Alliance for the Sustainable\nDevelopment of Central America. This endeavour is rooted\nin history, tradition, solidarity and, above all, an awareness\nof the common destiny of our Central American homeland.\nIn that connection, we were pleased that last year the\nGeneral Assembly recognized\n\u201cthe importance of implemented, updated and pending\nprogrammes, and, in view of the fact that the\nresources assigned to the Special Plan of Economic\nCooperation for Central America have been used up,\nrequest[ed] the agencies of the United Nations system,\nin particular the United Nations Development\nProgramme, and international institutions to mobilize\nthe necessary resources to set in motion new national\nand regional programmes in support of the content of\nthe Declaration of Gu\u00e1cimo, the Alliance for the\nSustainable Development of Central America\nconcluded at the Managua Summit, and the\nTegucigalpa Commitments on Peace and Development\nadopted at the International Conference on Peace and\nDevelopment in Central America\u201d. (resolution 49/137,\npara. 23)\nWe were grateful for the adoption of that resolution, and\nhope that its mandate will be renewed at this session of the\nGeneral Assembly.\nIn pursuance of our efforts at integration, my country\nwill host the next summit of Central American Presidents,\nwhere the central topic will be the establishment of a\nregulatory framework for the security of individuals and\ntheir belongings, and the signing of a treaty on Central\nAmerican democratic security.\nIn our region we can no longer delay the creation of\nshort-term programmes of direct investment, industrial\nrevitalization, transformation of technology and foreign\ntrade, with the necessary support of developed countries.\nThat support can come through the alliance of States\nfriendly to the Alliance for the Sustainable Development of\nCentral America, as was the case initially with the Central\nAmerica-United States agreement (CONCAUSA).\nCentral America supports open regionalism; as set out\nin the plan of action of the Summit for the Americas, we\nbelieve that free trade is the most appropriate way to\nestablish the world\u2019s most extensive free-trade area.\nThe Central American Integration System (SICA),\nwhich resulted from our own efforts and from important\ncooperation by the international community, hopes that\nthe General Assembly will grant it the status of\npermanent observer in accordance with relevant\nprovisions of the Charter of the United Nations. That\nstatus would facilitate and broaden cooperation between\nthe United Nations system and the Central American\nIntegration System; I am grateful for the support for the\ndraft resolution that Central American countries have\njointly submitted to the Assembly for consideration.\nIt is my country\u2019s tradition always to try to solve its\ninternational conflicts by peaceful, diplomatic means. I\nam therefore pleased to announce that, in compliance with\nthe opinion of the International Court of Justice at The\nHague concerning the boundary dispute between\nHonduras and El Salvador, a binational commission has\nbeen established to resolve the humanitarian implications\nof its implementation; its work is being carried out\nparallel to that of boundary demarcation. It is the honest\nwish of the people and the Government of Honduras to\nconclude these priority tasks without delay.\nNor is Honduras indifferent to the problems of our\nsister Republics, especially those of Guatemala. We wish\nto acknowledge the achievements and commitments of the\nGovernment of that country and of the Unidad\nRevolucionaria Nacional Guatemalteca (URNG) towards\npeace. We urge them to persist in a peaceful, negotiated\nquest for a solution to their internal differences.\nMy country endorses all the principles set out in the\nSecretary-General\u2019s \u201cAn Agenda for Development\u201d,\nwhich recognizes that equitable development removes\nmany of the social and political conditions that result in\nthreats to peace. Most important, it stresses that the\nhuman being is the ultimate beneficiary of all efforts\ntowards development and international cooperation.\nClearly, \u201cAn Agenda for Development\u201d must\nencourage the implementation of agreements reached in\nthe economic and social sphere. In that context, my\ncountry has decided to endorse the principles and\nimplement the commitments set out in the Declaration\nadopted by Heads of State or Government at the World\nSummit for Social Development, held at Copenhagen,\nDenmark, in March this year. We consider that\nimplementation of the Programme of Action is urgent,\n28\n\n\nwith a view to establishing a framework for economic\ngrowth and sustainable development, and a national and\ninternational climate favourable to social development, to\nthe elimination of poverty, to increasing productive\nemployment, to reducing unemployment and to fostering\nsocial integration.\nOnly by attaining these goals can we achieve lasting\npeace and security, economic progress and the social\nemancipation of all mankind. We therefore appeal to the\ninternational community, and especially to developed\ncountries and international organizations, to fulfil their\ncommitment to transfer significant economic and\ntechnological resources to developing countries.\nSimilarly, the Government of Honduras gives high\npriority to speedy compliance with commitments and\nrecommendations made at the United Nations Conference\non Environment and Development, held at Rio de Janeiro\nin 1992. We note, however, the lack of adequate resources\nto implement the programmes and projects adopted as part\nof Agenda 21. We hope that developed countries will meet\ntheir commitments, to enable developing countries to meet\ntheir own.\nHonduras reiterates its commitment to meet the goals\nof the World Declaration and Plan of Action adopted at the\nWorld Summit for Children. My country is a signatory of\nthe Convention on the Rights of the Child, and, as part of\nits national programmes, has adopted policies aimed at\nattaining the goals set in the Plan of Action. Our\nGovernment considers that all boys and girls must enjoy\nfundamental human rights such as access to education and\nto health services. One of our priorities is to eliminate\nfamily poverty, which is a principal cause of the\nexploitation of children and infant mortality.\nThe Government of Honduras also participated in the\nFourth World Conference on Women, held at Beijing. We\nare convinced that the Declaration and Plan of Action\nadopted there will make a further contribution to women\u2019s\nparticipation in political, civil, economic, social and cultural\nlife and in sustainable development.\nThe recent conference on review and extension of the\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT)\ncame at important time in history: when the international\ncommunity is marking the end of the cold war, an event\nwhich eased international tension and strengthened\nconfidence between States. My country reiterates its\ncommitment to the principles and objectives adopted at the\nreview Conference. We remain convinced that the ultimate\ngoal is the complete elimination of nuclear weapons and\nthe adoption of a treaty on general and complete\ndisarmament under strict, effective international control.\nThe Government of Honduras attaches great\nimportance to preventive diplomacy and to the peaceful\nsettlement of international disputes. We believe it is better\nto prevent conflicts through early warning machinery and\ngood-offices diplomatic efforts than to use political and\nmilitary action to try to stop them once they have started.\nWe attach equal importance to the building and\nmaintenance of international peace and security, especially\nthrough humanitarian activities that involve the urgent\nsolution of the tragedy of thousands of persons displaced\nand uprooted from their homes and land. Hence, we\nreiterate our support for the proposals and\nrecommendations made by the Secretary-General in \u201cAn\nAgenda for Peace\u201d and in the Supplement to \u201cAn Agenda\nfor Peace\u201d.\nThe Government of Honduras considers that the\nstrengthening of peace, the fundamental objective of the\nUnited Nations, can be achieved only through complete\nrespect for the provisions of the Charter. For peace-\nkeeping operations to be successful, they must be based\non the principles of international law: non-intervention in\nthe internal affairs of States, and the non-use of force\nexcept in self-defence. Moreover, they should be\ncontrolled by the United Nations; peace-keeping\noperations and their mandates must be clearly defined.\nThey should be funded in a timely way and must above\nall have the consent of the States involved, which in turn\nmust not raise obstacles and must cooperate fully with\nthese operations.\nIn the context of the peaceful solution of\ninternational conflicts, it is vital to encourage greater\ncooperation and coordination between the United Nations\nand regional organizations. International crises can be\nresolved effectively if we strengthen the various\nmechanisms and procedures through which such\ncooperation takes place.\nWe know that the United Nations continues to face\nfinancial problems with a direct impact on peace-keeping\noperations. Hence, the current machinery for financing\nmust be reformed, taking account of the capacity of States\nto pay and ensuring that the availability of resources for\neconomic and social development is not endangered.\nIn January this year, with particular interest and in\na constructive spirit, we began participating for the first\n29\n\n\ntime in the work of the Security Council. Our participation\nis shaped by respect for sovereignty and for the principle of\nthe self-determination of peoples, and by our commitment\nto the defence and promotion of human rights and peace.\nAware of its responsibilities and within its modest\nmeans, Honduras has from the outset contributed to the\nUnited Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western\nSahara (MINURSO). We have also sent an infantry\ncontingent to help with the humanitarian activities of the\nUnited Nations Mission in Haiti (UNMIH). We are\ndetermined to continue our participation in such missions in\nsupport of peace, security and international humanitarian\nlaw.\nIn the Security Council we have given our full support\nto the Middle East peace process. We hope that the ongoing\nnegotiations will lead to the establishment of lasting peace\nin the region.\nWe are deeply saddened by the situation in Bosnia and\nHerzegovina in particular, and in neighbouring countries as\nwell. We condemn the attempts at \u201cethnic cleansing\u201d and\ngenocide against the civilian population. We therefore hope\nthat recent peace efforts in the region will bear fruit,\nespecially following the agreement reached at Geneva on\nbasic principles for the peaceful settlement of the conflict.\nProgress in Angola, Liberia and Rwanda makes us\noptimistic about peacemaking in those countries. United\nNations participation has been vital in that progress, and we\ntherefore unreservedly support it. We hope that in the end\nthese countries will achieve the reconciliation that will\nenable them to begin their tasks of national reconstruction\nand development.\nOn 26 June 1945, 50 nations, including my own, with\nhigh hopes, signed the Charter of the United Nations at San\nFrancisco. In 1995 we are full of joy at commemorating the\nfiftieth anniversary of the founding of an Organization that\nhas unquestionably served the interests of universality\nthrough its gradual expansion. This is also an apt occasion\nto ponder why all the expectations and dreams of the\nfounders have not yet been met, and to define the mission\nthe United Nations must carry out on the threshold of a\nnew millennium.\nTo address the question of the efficiency and\neffectiveness of the United Nations system with greater\ndynamism and realism, the international community has\nmade unprecedented demands for redefinition of the tasks\nof the system in the areas of international security and the\npromotion of the economic and social development of\nMembers.\nThe end of the century approaches; a new\nmillennium awaits us. We must therefore assess all that\nhas come before; make an in-depth analysis of the\nweaknesses and strengths, the successes and failures of\nthe Organization; and with realism and fairness set an\nagenda for the future that will topple injustice,\nexterminate poverty and throttle warlike tendencies and\nthat will bolster the foundations of a truly unified,\nhumanistic and fair world order.\nIt is painful to see the weakening of the high\nexpectations created by the collapse of bipolar relations.\nThere have been no substantive changes in the behaviour\nof highly developed countries towards the less developed\nareas of the planet. We note with concern a wish to\nreplace the old order with a new, ominous bipolar world:\na world of countries that enjoy plenty, and of countries\nthat are enmired in poverty and destitution. We must not\npermit this fatal design to be carried out. Let us show that\nwe can still imagine and create a different, prosperous\nworld that will include us all.\nLet us hope that the new millennium will see the\nmiracle of international coexistence based on peace,\nbrotherhood and universal well-being. Otherwise, there\nwill be no further chance to see the light of hope for a\nbetter future; to use the words of the Honduran poet\nRoberto Sosa, we will live forever in \u201ca world divided for\nall\u201d.\n"

        "file_text": "I extend to Mr. Freitas do Amaral my warm\ncongratulations on his election as President of this jubilee\nfiftieth session of the General Assembly. At the same time\nI wish to express appreciation to his predecessor,\nMr. Amara Essy, for his very successful work.\nOn 3 October 1995, in a cowardly terrorist act, an\nattempt was made on the life of the President of the\nRepublic of Macedonia, Kiro Gligorov. This assassination\nattempt was a deliberate political act intended to destabilize\nmy country. It was carried out, not insignificantly, at a time\nwhen the centuries-old dream of the Macedonian people for\ntheir own State and for an equal role in the international\ncommunity had come true. Furthermore, it happened at the\nvery time when the resolution of the situation in the\nBalkans was in sight and when all of our neighbours and\nthe world had come to accept the fact that the Republic of\nMacedonia was a reality, and a factor of peace and\nstability.\nThe attempt to assassinate President Gligorov is an\nattack against the independent and peace-loving position\nof Macedonia. It is directed against life in peace and\nagainst the well-being of all our citizens. This terrorist act\nhas been strongly condemned and decisively rejected by\nall of my countrymen, as well as by the international\ncommunity.\nThe efforts of the United Nations against\nterrorism \u2014 a criminal phenomenon \u2014 must continue\nwith a strong determination to wipe this scourge out\ncompletely. We should all fight unabatedly against the\nforces of darkness and the power-hungry demagogues\nwho are the main source and generator of criminal\nterrorist activities.\nThe attempt to assassinate my President on\n3 October 1995 shall not, under any circumstances, divert\nus in our pursuit of democracy, reforms, and the\ndevelopment of good-neighbourly relations with all of our\nneighbours, in brief, our efforts to transform our country\ninto a modern European State.\nI wish to take this opportunity to express to the\nPresident of the General Assembly, the Secretary-General\nand all delegations in this body our sincere gratitude for\ntheir sympathy and solidarity and for their wishes for the\nspeedy recovery of my President.\nAs our Organization approaches the next 50 years,\nas we approach the twenty-first century, it is timely to\nacknowledge and pay tribute to the great achievements of\nthe United Nations in bringing about a better and safer\nworld and to stress the need to work together to improve\nour Organization and prepare for the challenges of the\nfuture.\nThroughout the past 50 years, the United Nations has\nbeen the right place in which to build better\nunderstanding among nations, the right place in which to\naddress some of the basic problems and needs of\nhumanity and the right place in which to coordinate\nactions towards a brighter future for mankind. The United\nNations assisted in achieving peace in many regions of\nthe world; it succeeded in preventing many conflicts; it\nhelped in decolonization; it delivered humanitarian\nassistance; it succeeded in minimizing the nuclear threat\nand in building bridges over many gulfs between\ncountries all over the world.\nIn the past few years, very important decisions have\nbeen adopted at many United Nations conferences, such\n14\n\n\nas the Earth Summit in Rio, the World Conference on\nHuman Rights in Vienna, the International Conference on\nPopulation and Development in Cairo, the World Summit\nfor Social Development in Copenhagen, the Fourth World\nConference on Women in Beijing, the 1995 Review and\nExtension Conference of the States Parties to the Treaty on\nthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons in New York\nand the discussions on land-mines at the Conference on\nDisarmament in Geneva. We must work to implement the\ndecisions made at these conferences. We must work on\nfinalizing the comprehensive nuclear test-ban treaty, and on\nfurthering the disarmament process. At the same time, we\nmust also begin working towards finding solutions to, and\npreventing, the new problems and challenges that we are\nfacing in this ever-changing world. Rapid technological\nprogress brings new hope for a better future but also puts\ndangerous power into the hands of some of the worst\nenemies of our civilization. We have to design new\nmechanisms that will enable us to face these new\nchallenges and enable the United Nations to achieve new\nsuccesses in the next 50 years.\nOn the basis of the experience of the past 50 years, we\nwill have to examine the functioning of the United Nations\nsystem as a whole, to restructure some of its parts, and to\nassign new tasks to some of the others for the purpose of\nachieving the efficiency of the Organization as a whole.\nThe United Nations must have as its vision a world that is\nmore stable, politically and economically. The recent\nagreement between Israel and Palestine gives hope for\nlasting peace in the Middle East. We strongly support the\nSecretary-General\u2019s Agenda for Development and hope that,\nat this session, we will carry out this most important\nundertaking successfully.\nEconomic development is necessary for political and\nsocial stability. For many countries access to markets and\nthe question of finances for development are of essential\nimportance. We must also ensure that the United Nations\nshall continue to be financially viable. Each Member of the\nUnited Nations, however large or small, has an obligation\nto do its share. We must also discuss the possible\nimprovement of the work of the Security Council. To this\nend, my delegation fully supports the inclusion of Germany\nand Japan as permanent members of the Security Council.\nAt this session of the General Assembly, I can assure\nthe President of the General Assembly that he will have the\nfull support of the Macedonian delegation in bringing to a\nsuccessful conclusion the many important issues we have\non the agenda. I would like to take this opportunity to\nthank this General Assembly for giving us the important\nduty of presiding over the Second Committee. We attach\nparticular significance to the economic issues that will be\ndiscussed there.\nThe Republic of Macedonia, despite difficult\nconditions, achieved its independence peacefully, without\nthe use of force and with respect for all international\nnorms. In a region so burdened by tragic wars, a region\nwith violations of human rights, with a high degree of\ninstability, we have pursued the path of our independence\nwith a strong commitment to resolve all of our problems\nand conflicts peacefully, through dialogue, with good will,\nwith readiness for cooperation with all of our neighbours\nand with all international organizations.\nWe are determined to contribute, within the\nframework of our capabilities, to the overcoming of all of\nthe divisions and conflicts in the Balkans inherited from\nthe past and to pursue the integration of our country into\nEurope as soon as possible, with respect for all of the\nEuropean norms and standards of relations between\ncountries as the only means to avoid repeating the tragic\nincidents of this region.\nOne of the basic principles of our foreign policy is\nthat of equidistance in our relations with our neighbours,\na readiness to establish equally good relations with all of\nour neighbours, based on mutual respect, the inviolability\nof borders, non-interference in the internal affairs of other\ncountries, and non-use of force.\nRecently in this building, under the auspices of the\nUnited Nations, through the mediation of Cyrus Vance,\nSpecial Envoy of the Secretary-General, Boutros\nBoutros-Ghali, and Matthew Nimetz, Special Envoy of\nPresident Clinton, my country, the Republic of\nMacedonia, reached an accord with the Republic of\nGreece which regulates many aspects of relations between\nthe two countries, and creates a basis for good-\nneighbourly cooperation. We believe that this accord will\ncontribute to increased stability in the Balkans and will\nhave a positive influence on the future development of\nevents in the region. We believe this accord is a good\nillustration of the positive role of the international\ncommunity, and especially of the United Nations, in\npursuing peaceful solutions in relations between States,\nbased on the principles of the Charter of the United\nNations.\nThe Republic of Macedonia, during its four years of\nindependence, has faced many challenges. The economy\nof the whole region was deeply disturbed by the war to\n15\n\n\nthe north of us. As a result of the United Nations sanctions\nagainst Serbia and Montenegro, the usual route to our\ntraditional markets in Europe was cut off. The losses caused\nto our economy by the sanctions amount to over $4 billion.\nSince February 1994, we have also been under a unilateral\ntrade embargo from the south. In the same period, we have\nundertaken a thorough transformation of our economy,\nturning it into a market-oriented economy, with all of the\ndifficulties and risks that this transition brings. Despite all\nof this, we have succeeded in maintaining a high level of\npolitical, social and economic stability. We have built new\ndemocratic institutions with provisions for full protection of\nhuman rights and a political system in which all national\nminorities are recognized and enjoy full participation. We\ncannot claim that we have solved all of our problems.\nHowever, we have built the right mechanisms for solving\nthem.\nA great deal of attention has been given during this\nsession of the General Assembly to United Nations peace-\nkeeping operations. The enormous efforts of the United\nNations in many peace-keeping operations have had varied\nresults. Some of them have been more successful than\nothers. Allow me to say a few words about the United\nNations peace-keeping operation in the Republic of\nMacedonia, the United Nations Preventive Deployment\nForce (UNPREDEP). It is a very successful operation and\nis fully achieving its goals. It has contributed tremendously\nto peace and stability in the southern Balkans and has built\nconfidence among the people of the Republic of Macedonia\nin international organizations. This operation proves that\npreventive deployment is the most effective channel for\nUnited Nations peace-keeping efforts. This operation is the\nbest example that results can be achieved even with a\nsmall, almost symbolic deployment of United Nations\npeace-keepers, if it is done at the right time and with a\nclear mandate. The full support the people of the Republic\nof Macedonia are giving this operation shows that the right\ndecision was made by the Security Council when this\npeace-keeping operation was approved. This has been a\nvery successful operation, and we hope it will serve as a\nmodel for many future activities of the United Nations; if\nso, I am confident that the same positive results will be\nachieved.\nThese days there is new hope that peace in Bosnia can\nbe achieved. This tragic war has resulted in huge numbers\nof victims, a large-scale humanitarian catastrophe and\nmassive destruction. We hope that the efforts of the\ninternational community will result in a solution which will\nrespect the basic principles of the modern world. Bosnia\nshould be preserved as an independent State within its\ninternationally recognized borders. Provision must be\nmade for full respect of human rights, and repetition of\natrocities and war crimes must never be allowed.\nWe believe that as soon as peace is achieved it will\nbe necessary to start the process of the reduction of arms\nin the Balkans, to start the process of a Balkan d\u00e9tente.\nThis year the General Assembly, under item 81 of\nits agenda, will consider the report of the Secretary-\nGeneral on the development of good-neighbourly relations\namong Balkan States, prepared on the basis of resolution\n48/84 B, adopted at its forty-eighth session on the\nproposal of the Macedonian delegation. It is expected that\nspecial attention will be paid to measures and preventive\nactivities aimed at the creation of a stable zone of peace\nand cooperation in the Balkans by the year 2000.\nThe only way to achieve long-term peace and\nstability in the whole Balkan region is through the full\nintegration of all the Balkan countries into Europe, with\nfull respect for European standards and norms. The\nindependence, territorial integrity and inviolability of the\nborders of all Balkan countries must be respected.\nProblems of national minorities that have been at the root\nof many conflicts in the Balkans throughout its history\nshould be addressed. All national minorities should be\nrecognized and their basic human rights fully respected.\nIt is our duty to work for peace and the democratic\ndevelopment of the whole Balkan region now, and not to\nleave burdens of the past to future generations.\nJust as we must work for the stabilization of the\nBalkan region as a whole, we must also recognize the\nuniqueness of each of the countries of the region. The\nproblems are not identical, and therefore the solutions\ncannot be identical. There are a lot of discussions about\nthe problems of former Yugoslavia. It is very important\nto understand that there is no such entity as former\nYugoslavia\u201d. There are a number of new countries in this\narea, each with their own set of problems and prospects,\nand there is no way to find a unified solution for these\nproblems. Each country must be treated individually.\nThe hope and desire for a better world were the\nfoundations for the United Nations 50 years ago. At this\nsession of the General Assembly, it is our duty to lay the\ngroundwork for the role of the United Nations in the\ntwenty-first century. We should all work together towards\na safer world and to reduce the fears and threats of the\nfuture as much as possible.\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me on behalf of the\nUgandan delegation to convey our warm greetings to\nMr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral on the occasion of his\nelection to the presidency of the fiftieth session of the\nGeneral Assembly. His election does great honour to his\ncountry, Portugal, with which Uganda enjoys very cordial\nrelations. We are confident that Mr. Freitas do Amaral will\nguide the Assembly\u2019s deliberations to a successful\nconclusion.\nAllow me also to pay special tribute to His Excellency\nMr. Amara Essy, Foreign Minister of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, for the\nskilful manner in which he presided over the work of the\nforty-ninth session of the General Assembly.\nI salute the Secretary-General, His Excellency\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for his tireless efforts in the\nservice of our Organization.\nFifty years ago, in the aftermath of the Second\nWorld War, with its destructive nationalism, economic\nand social depression and the attendant social dislocation,\nthe United Nations was established. It was founded by\nmen and women who were determined to save succeeding\ngenerations from the scourge of war. They created the\nUnited Nations as the only universal international\norganization that would exist to cope with global\nproblems and ensure that the international community\nenjoyed peace and prosperity. The United Nations Charter\nand the Universal Declaration of Human Rights provided\nthe bedrock for a new system of rights and obligations for\nthe promotion of international peace and security.\nThe new order, organized on the basis of universality\nand sovereign equality, was intended to encompass all\nnations, large and small, strong and weak, in order to\npromote the well-being of all peoples. The United Nations\nthus emerged as a beacon of hope out of the ruins and\ndarkness of the Second World War. Today this vision\nremains as valid as it was 50 years ago. It is for that\nreason that we reaffirm our confidence in the\nOrganization and its global mandate.\nIn the five decades of the existence of the United\nNations, the world has witnessed remarkable changes. The\ncommunications revolution and the globalization of the\nworld economy have transformed the world into a global\nvillage and have increased interdependence among\nnations. The cold war, which dominated the post-War era,\nended, with the favourable dramatic transformation of\nEast-West relations. Over 100 States which were colonial\n\n\ndependencies in 1945 achieved independence. We also\nwitnessed the birth of a free, non-racial and democratic\nSouth Africa and the elimination of the obnoxious system\nof apartheid.\nWhile the end of the cold war has reduced tension\nbetween the major Powers and has facilitated the resolution\nof a number of regional conflicts, we continue to witness\nthe proliferation of intra-State conflicts. These are new\nchallenges which call for more innovative approaches and\nwhich underscore the continuing relevance of the United\nNations.\nWe believe that the United Nations should address in\na concrete and decisive manner the issue of socio-economic\ndevelopment, without which peace and security cannot be\nsustained. The United Nations and the international\ncommunity have to renew their resolve to eradicate poverty\nand deprivation. This spectre of poverty and deprivation is\nrampant in Africa and in the least developed countries. We\nshould act collectively and decisively to change this\nsituation. The fiftieth anniversary celebrations are a fitting\noccasion to make this solemn commitment.\nIt is no coincidence that our region, Africa, which is\nthe least developed in the world, is also the most affected\nby strife and conflict. In order to put an end to this we need\nto foster a comprehensive approach which addresses the\nroot causes of these conflicts and consolidates and\nguarantees durable peace and security. To this end, we\nmust, first of all, boost our capacity to anticipate and\nprevent conflicts before they occur, through preventive\ndiplomacy. Secondly, we should be prepared to respond\nswiftly to emergency situations. And lastly, we must\nconsolidate the peace by putting in place recovery and\nrehabilitation programmes in order to create the economic\nconditions for peace and stability.\nIn addition to this, there should be increased\nrecognition of the role of the affected regions in the\nformulation of appropriate responses. It is for this reason\nthat we consider the establishment of the Organization of\nAfrican Unity mechanism for conflict prevention,\nmanagement and resolution a timely and appropriate\ninitiative. The Organization of African Unity decision to put\nin place a Central Organ for that mechanism was an equally\npositive development. We appeal to the international\ncommunity to render the requisite financial and technical\nsupport to complement Africa\u2019s efforts to make these\ninstitutions work.\nWe salute the return of peace to Cambodia, Haiti,\nMozambique and Angola, and we are encouraged by the\npositive developments in Liberia, Bosnia and Herzegovina\nand the Middle East. We commend the steps being taken\nby the Government in Rwanda to restore normalcy and\nnational reconciliation, and we call for expeditious and\nfull activation of the International Tribunal for Rwanda.\nWe believe that it is possible to contain the situation\nin Burundi and avoid the replication of the genocide that\nwas perpetrated in Rwanda last year. We continue to be\nconcerned about the situation in Somalia and call for\nreconciliation among the parties to the conflict there.\nAs regards Western Sahara, we urge all parties to\nexercise the statesmanship necessary to prepare the way\nfor a just and durable solution. In order to consolidate and\ngive hope to all these troubled parts of the world the\ninternational community must render all necessary\nsupport. We in Uganda will continue to contribute to\nconflict resolution, peacemaking and peace-keeping,\nwithin our capabilities.\nThe threat posed by the proliferation of weapons of\nmass destruction remains a matter of grave concern to this\nOrganization. We welcome the conclusion of the Review\nand Extension Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on\nthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). This\nshould strengthen the non-proliferation regime. If that is\nto be fully realized, it should be complemented by the\nentry into force of the Convention on the Prohibition of\nthe Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of\nChemical Weapons and on Their Destruction. It is\ndeplorable that, in spite of the indefinite extension of the\nNPT, some countries have continued to carry out nuclear\ntests. This goes against the letter and the spirit of the\nunderstanding on the indefinite extension of the\nnon-proliferation Treaty.\nWe note the progress made so far in the negotiations\non a comprehensive test-ban Treaty, and we urge its early\nconclusion. We welcome various regional initiatives\naimed at establishing nuclear-weapon-free zones and we\nsupport the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone\nin Africa as a contribution to global disarmament efforts.\nIn both its domestic and its foreign policy, Uganda\naccords high priority to the observance of human rights.\nWe have entrenched in the new Constitution a human\nrights commission as an institutional framework for the\ndevelopment and observance of human rights. We wish\n\n\nto express our appreciation to all countries and institutions\nthat have supported us in our efforts to develop and\nstrengthen human-rights monitoring and enforcement\ncapabilities.\nWe have just completed the process of establishing a\nConstitution, aimed at consolidating the rule of law. The\nnew Constitution was enacted on 22 September 1995 by a\ndemocratically elected Constituent Assembly and is due to\nbe promulgated shortly. The Constitution paves the way to\nthe holding of general and presidential elections, which are\nscheduled for early next year. This will enhance the\nempowerment of the people to take charge of their own\ngovernance and their own destiny.\nThe Government has made efforts to empower our\npeople, especially women, young people and other\nvulnerable groups. Within the framework of the bottom-up\nResistance Council system, the population has been\nmobilized and provided with modest capital \u2014\nentandikwa \u2014 as part of our national endeavour to create\nproductive and income-generating opportunities in order to\nimprove the earning capacity of the family and, thus,\nimprove the living conditions of the people.\nAs we celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the United\nNations, we should reaffirm our commitment to the primacy\nof the democratic principle at all levels, including that of\nthe United Nations. It is in this context that Uganda\nsupports restructuring of the Security Council to make it\nmore transparent and democratic in its decision-making, and\nmore representative of the increased membership of the\nUnited Nations.\nIn the same vein, we urge that the Bretton Woods\ninstitutions take into account the problems, concerns and\naspirations of developing countries in the formulation and\ndesign of policies and programmes in order to respond to\ntheir social and economic needs.\nMany developing countries continue to be adversely\naffected by the uneven and inequitable trends in the global\neconomy. These trends have widened further the gap\nbetween the rich and the poor countries. The socio-\neconomic situation in Africa is critical and continues to\ndeteriorate. It is characterized by a weak physical and\ninstitutional infrastructure, underdeveloped human\nresources, epidemics and disease, lack of adequate shelter,\npoverty and deprivation. All these factors undermine peace\nand stability, and this, in turn, hampers growth and\ndevelopment.\nWe have undertaken bold economic and political\nreforms in Uganda with a view to creating an\nenvironment conducive to the consolidation of social and\neconomic progress. These reforms have been\ncharacterized by the attainment of basic macro-economic\nstability and the enhancement of democracy and the rule\nof law, and they have stimulated reasonable economic\ngrowth and social progress. In spite of these modest\nachievements our countries continue to depend heavily on\nthe export of primary commodities, which do not attract\nfair prices in international markets. There has also been\na steady decline in the availability of both domestic and\nexternal resources for development. To compound the\nsituation, most of our countries are saddled with heavy\ndebts, the servicing of which is no longer sustainable.\nAll these and other factors have contributed to the\nmarginalization of Africa and have made it difficult for\nthe continent to benefit from the positive impulses of\nglobalization and the liberalization of world trade. These\nissues were reviewed at the high-level segment of the\nEconomic and Social Council, which addressed the theme\nof African development and implementation of the United\nNations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in\nthe 1990s, and in the ongoing discussion here at the\nUnited Nations about the mid-term review of the Global\nProgramme of Action for the Least Developed Countries\nfor the 1990s.\nThe two meetings agreed that the United Nations\nNew Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s\nand the global Programme of Action for the Least\nDeveloped Countries for the 1990s remained largely\nunimplemented. We should seize the opportunity provided\nby the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations to decide\non concrete actions that will give hope to the peoples of\nAfrica and of the least developed countries.\nThe stagnation and decline in official development\nassistance (ODA) are disturbing. We are equally\nconcerned at the wavering commitment towards the\neleventh replenishment of the international development\nassistance fund. We urge our development partners to\nfulfil the internationally agreed obligations with regard to\nofficial development assistance. This would be a fitting\nand tangible show of solidarity with Africa and, indeed,\nthe least developed countries.\nOur external indebtedness and debt-servicing\nobligations have reached unsustainable levels. We\ntherefore call for an urgent once-and-for-all development-\noriented initiative on all types of debts, which could\n3\n\n\ninclude the following: first, an enhancement of the Naples\nterms and an improvement in its accessibility; and,\nsecondly, a significant initiative on multilateral debts,\nincluding a softening of the financing terms of International\nMonetary Fund (IMF) loans to make it IDA-comparable.\nThese initiatives could be achieved through the sale of IMF\ngold stocks and by creating an appropriate debt-relief\nfacility. We believe these actions will release much-needed\nresources, which are currently going into the debt-servicing\nof development activities, including the eradication of\npoverty.\nAt the moment Africa accounts for a meagre\n2.4 per cent of world merchandise trade. In the context of\nthe Uruguay Round agreements, it is estimated that the\ncontinent could lose up to $2.6 billion annually in the\ncourse of the initial years of the implementation of the\nagreement. By contrast, global trade will be boosted by\n$500 billion annually. The legitimate concerns of Africa\nand the least developed countries have been identified and\nspecific measures to address them have been recommended\nby both the Ministerial Decision of Marrakesh and the\nUnited Nations Conference on Trade and Development\n(UNCTAD). For Africa to benefit from the liberalization of\nworld trade, these measures, including capacity-building,\ncompensation, enhanced-market-access provisions and\nfinancial assistance towards institutional and economic\ntransformation, must be implemented fully and without\ndelay.\nTo assist in the follow-up and implementation of the\nUruguay Round agreements, two institutions are significant\nand must be strengthened and supported \u2014 UNCTAD as\nthe institution with a specific focus on trade and\ndevelopment issues, especially as they relate to developing\ncountries; and the United Nations Industrial Development\nOrganization (UNIDO) because of its role in the promotion\nof industrialization.\nWe note the ongoing discussions under the open-ended\nad hoc Working Group of the General Assembly on an\nAgenda for Development. It is our hope that this process\nwill generate specific measures and commitments to address\nthe specific problems of developing countries. We also\nhope that it will help to forge consensus on development\nwhich takes into account, and builds on, the commitments\nand programmes of action already agreed on in the series\nof United Nations conferences that have been held since\n1990.\nUganda is concerned about the serious problem posed\nby the rapid growth and spread of water hyacinth on Lake\nVictoria and other lakes and rivers in the Nile valley.\nThis has adversely affected the ecological balance of our\nwaters and the livelihood of our populations, who depend\non fishing as a means of survival. Besides, the hyacinth\nis threatening to choke the Owen Falls Dam \u2014 our only\nmajor source of hydroelectric power. It has disrupted our\nwater transportation system, which is very important for\na land-locked country such as Uganda. We make an\nurgent appeal to the international community to extend\nsupport to enable us to address the problem of water\nhyacinth.\nWe consider South-South cooperation to be an\nimportant aspect of development cooperation. The sharing\nand pooling of information, knowledge, markets and\nresources are some of the ways in which developing\ncountries can promote their growth and development. To\nthis end we are active participants in all arrangements for\ncooperation in our subregion and support the\nestablishment of the African Economic Community. We\nbelieve that these arrangements and the institutions\nestablished to promote them, such as the South Centre,\nshould be supported by the international community.\nThe United Nations has over the years provided a\nforum for intensive dialogue on all issues. Through a\nseries of global conferences, it has helped to forge\ninternational consensus on global problems \u2014 issues such\nas the environment, population, the status of women,\nhuman rights, development, and many more. Its\nspecialized agencies have made an invaluable contribution\nin their respective spheres of activity and have provided\nhumanitarian and development assistance to many parts of\nthe world. In recent years, despite drastic limitations on\npersonnel and resources, the United Nations has\nresponded to the dramatic rise in the demand for peace-\nkeeping and other emergency operations throughout the\nworld. These are laudable accomplishments, which should\nstrengthen our resolve and our confidence in support of\nthe Organization.\nAs we stand in the twilight of the twentieth century\nand approach the dawn of the new millennium, we should\nuse the occasion provided by the fiftieth anniversary of\nthe United Nations to strengthen the Organization. We\nshould demonstrate our dedication to the Organization and\nits component parts by providing it with the resources\nnecessary for the accomplishment of its immense\nmandate. Our challenge is to bequeath to succeeding\ngenerations a democratic, transparent and more effective\nUnited Nations.\n4\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "It\ngives me great pleasure to extend to the President, and to\nhis friendly country, Portugal, our congratulations on his\nelection as President of the General Assembly for this\nhistoric session, which crowns 50 years of international\nwork under the banner of the United Nations in the service\nof humanity, individuals and peoples.\nI should also like to express our profound appreciation\nto His Excellency Mr. Amara Essy, Minister for Foreign\nAffairs of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, for his wise conduct of the work\nof the forty-ninth session and for his valuable efforts in the\npreparatory work for the celebration of the fiftieth\nanniversary.\nWe now live in an age wherein the international map\nof political relations is being redrawn, side by side with the\nreshaping of the scales of economic relations and, probably,\nthe essence of existing social and cultural systems. The\nuniversal nature of issues and the similarity of the problems\nfacing our contemporary societies have become the\nprincipal feature of our world. Consequently, the only way\nto deal with such issues and problems is to promote and\nrationalize international cooperation, since the majority of\nthe problems we face today cannot be dealt with\nunilaterally at a time when the fluctuations of financial\nmarkets, the transactions of transnational corporations and\nthe impact of information networks and communication\nsatellites all transcend the national boundaries of States. We\ncannot hope to succeed in dealing with problems against\nsuch a complex backdrop without international and\ncollective action in the interests of the entire human race.\nIn this, we see a very significant role for the United\nNations in formulating the modern concepts needed in\ndealing with problems in such a difficult and complex era.\nAlthough the ending of the cold war did remove\ntremendous obstacles that, for so long, had adversely\naffected efforts of international cooperation in all fields,\nthis, in itself, has not been conducive to the spontaneous\nemergence of a new international order based on legality,\njustice, and democracy, that is capable of maintaining\npeace and bringing prosperity to peoples. This requires a\nconsensual vision of what the content and rules of such a\nnew international order should be. It also requires the\ndissipation of the growing fears that many countries now\nharbour as a result of the tendency to entrench policies of\ndouble standards, to look for some ideological or\nintellectual foe to demonize and to make a target for\ncriticism, international mobilization and techniques of\nsubjugation.\nThis can be seen clearly in the performance of the\nSecurity Council and in its hesitant posture when it comes\nto facing up to certain situations, probably because of the\nlack of the necessary political will, or to the fact that that\nwill falls hostage to conflicting attitudes. Again, this may\nbe due to the fact that we, as an international community,\nare still unable to develop a concept of a system of\ncollective security that would be in consonance with the\nprovisions of the United Nations Charter.\nIn this connection, let us call to mind the tragedies\nof ethnic genocide perpetrated against the people of\nBosnia and Herzegovina. Having done this, let us call to\nmind the ability, the inability or the ambivalence\ndemonstrated in reacting to those international crimes and\nthe adverse impact they have had on the credibility of the\nworld order, of which the United Nations continues to be\na principal cornerstone. We need to pause and review the\ncollective-security system and how we can improve it.\nWe must also consider the need for a parallel economic-\nand social-security system in the light of the global trend\ntowards market economies and in the light also of the\nachievements made in the General Agreement on Tariffs\nand Trade (GATT) and the related problems in the\ndeveloping world, which constitutes the overwhelming\nmajority of the human race.\nIt is no longer possible to face up to the challenges\nof tomorrow with the methods of yesterday, especially\nthat the concept of security is no longer limited to\nterritories or national boundaries at a time when most\narmed conflicts take place within such national\nboundaries, and when the lack of economic and social\ndevelopment has become a universally grave problem. It\nfollows from this that the challenge which now faces the\ninternational community represented by the United\nNations has to do with the extent of the Organization\u2019s\nability to address such new issues, with the degree of its\nsuccess in forging an international and democratic\nconsensus in that regard, and with the presence or\nabsence of the political will to enable the United Nations\nto perform its role through the provision of the resources\nit must have in order for it to do so.\nThe United Nations has made an outstanding\ncontribution towards the promotion of international\nawareness of issues which stand as milestones in the\nhistory of the twentieth century, prominent among which\n5\n\n\nare decolonization, the eradication of apartheid and dealing\nwith the issues of economic and social development and\nhuman rights. Such concepts have now become the very\nfoundations of civilized international behaviour.\nHaving said this, we must say that what the future\nrequires is a new universal social contract as I called for in\nmy statement before the General Assembly at the forty-\nseventh session, in commenting on the Secretary-General\u2019s\n\u201cAgenda for Peace\u201d submitted in 1992. A series of\ninternational conferences on children, on the environment,\non human rights, on population, on social development and\non women have provided the international community with\na wealth of programmes of action and ideas which could\nprovide solid basis for drawing up the universal social\ncontract we propose in order for our work to lead to\ndevelopment, security and peace.\nWhether the United Nations is able to forge such\nconsensus, will depend on its ability to close the credibility\ngap from which it has suffered over the past few years. No\namount of administrative reform or restructuring, however\ngreat, would enable it to rise to the demands of this new\nera unless such reform is accompanied by the mobilization\nof the political will to support the United Nations and to\nuphold its credibility together with a process of conceptual\nreform that should be inspired by the ideals and objectives\nof the Charter and should aim at formulating a modern\nprogramme of action that responds to the realities, issues\nand challenges of today\u2019s world.\nIn order for the United Nations to lead international\naction in such directions, it must enjoy financial stability.\nSuch stability cannot be achieved without our collective\ncommitment to pay in full our assessed contributions to the\nOrganization\u2019s budget. Egypt hopes that the Member States\nshall seize the opportunity of the celebration of the fiftieth\nanniversary of the founding of the Organization, truly a\nhistoric occasion, by issuing a declaration committing all\nMembers, and especially all the States permanent members\nof the Security Council, to pay all assessed contributions\nand all arrears before the end of the year, to underscore our\ncollective and genuine support for the Organization.\nThe General Assembly has achieved a great deal over\nthe past 50 years in the political, economic, social and\nenvironmental fields and has contributed to the\nestablishment of principles of international conduct in the\nspheres of democracy, respect for human rights and the\ncodification and development of the principles of\ninternational law. However, the present era is a time for\nreformulating international relations, which requires the\nAssembly to perform a new role that promotes our\ncollective capacity in the areas of security, development\nand international cooperation.\nThe Secretary-General\u2019s initiatives have also\ncontributed to initiating a discussion of such hot issues as\npreventive diplomacy, peace-building in post-conflict\nsituations, and coordination between the United Nations\nand other international and regional bodies. Such\ndiscussions have shown that there is a growing tendency\nto attach increasing importance to such issues, particularly\non the part of the developing countries, a matter which\nhighlights the need to promote the focal role of the\nGeneral Assembly in building international consensus on\nsuch important issues.\nThe growing tendency to develop and reform the\nUnited Nations has focused attention on the Security\nCouncil\u2019s role and its performance. It was only natural\nthat the General Assembly should have focused on\ndiscussing the rules and procedures that the Security\nCouncil should follow, particularly in the areas that need\nto be reviewed in the light of the latest developments in\ninternational affairs.\nAny in-depth examination of the Council\u2019s role in\nthe light of such developments would highlight the fact\nthat many of the substantive and procedural aspects of the\nCouncil\u2019s work need to be reviewed, either by the\nCouncil itself or by the General Assembly if the Council\nshould fail to do so. Since the end of the cold war, the\nCouncil\u2019s performance has tended to be characterized by\ncertain features of which stand out the ineffectiveness of\nsome of its resolutions, which lend themselves to many\ndiverse interpretations and the tendency of some of those\nresolutions to aim at achieving political objectives whose\nobjectivity is often debatable. All such aspects have an\nundoubted effect on the Council\u2019s credibility and efficacy.\nThe ongoing consultations in the Working Groups on\nhow to improve the methods and procedures relating to\nthe imposition and lifting of sanctions by the Council\nhighlight the concern felt by the Member States over such\nmatters. The point is that, in such cases, there should be\na minimum level of safeguards, through the application of\na set of agreed, uniform rules and procedures, in order for\nthe imposing and lifting of sanctions to take place in a\nmanner that strikes a balance between, on the one hand,\nthe interests of the international community and, on the\nother, the extent of the human suffering endured by\npeoples on whom the sanctions are imposed.\n6\n\n\nThe increasing importance the international community\nattaches to the question of reforming the Security Council\nhas focused attention on a number of issues such as the\nneed to improve the Council\u2019s practices and procedures,\nimprove its performance and underscore the need for\ntransparency in its work.\nEgypt is convinced that there exists consensus of\nopinion that there is a need to increase the membership of\nthe Council in order to expand international participation in\ndischarging the major responsibility of the Organization\nand, thereby, to promote the Council\u2019s efficiency. We are\nalso aware of the heavy responsibilities that go with\nmembership in the Council. Proceeding from this and given\nEgypt\u2019s regional and international contributions in the\ncontexts of Arab, African and Middle Eastern affairs and\nother spheres, together with its constant support of United\nNations activities, we believe that Egypt is well placed in\nthe ranks of the States qualified to bear the responsibility of\nmembership in a new and expanded Security Council that\nwould be more equitable and balanced in its representation\nof the different regions of the world.\nWhen we speak of expanding Security Council\nmembership, we do not have in mind a mere increase in the\nnumber of permanent seats allocated to the developed\ncountries at the expense of the developing countries. What\nwe have in mind is striking the necessary balance between\nthe developed and the developing countries, by reinforcing\nthe Council with a number of developing countries that are\ncapable of shouldering such a responsibility and are capable\nof having the necessary impact at the regional and the\ninternational levels, in a manner that would make the\nCouncil more representative of international reality and,\nthereby, much more effective in dealing with international\nissues.\nOn the other hand, and from a more practical point of\nview, we believe that the ideas put forward by Egypt and\nby other countries concerning the addition of a number of\nnew, rotating seats for a specific number of States would\nafford a larger number of States the opportunity of sharing\nin exercising the responsibilities of membership in the\nCouncil. We believe that this would promote the Council\u2019s\nrole, enhance its credibility as a body that is truly\nrepresentative and enrich it with the membership of\ncountries that play important and effective roles in their\nregions.\nI should like to seize this opportunity to put on record\nthat Egypt welcomes the consultations the Security Council\nconducts with the countries that contribute troops to peace-\nkeeping operations, and call upon the Council to adhere\nto the spirit of the provisions of Article 44 of the Charter\nby institutionalizing such consultations so that they may\nbecome an integral part of the decision-making process in\nrelation to any peace-keeping operation. This would\nincrease the chances of success for all such operations.\nHere I must point out the vital role that could be\nperformed by regional organizations and arrangements, in\naccordance with Chapter VIII of the Charter, in\nmaintaining international peace and security in general\nand in the area of preventive diplomacy in particular. In\nthis connection, I should like to mention that Egypt has\nset up the \u201cCairo Centre for the Settlement of Disputes\nand the Maintenance of Peace in Africa\u201d, and that we are\nconfident that this Centre will receive the necessary\nassistance from the United Nations Department of Peace-\nkeeping Operations and from States with the necessary\nexpertise in this field.\nThe founding of the United Nations was\ncontemporaneous with the beginning, 50 years ago, of a\nsad chapter in the evolution of the question of Palestine\nthat triggered the Arab-Israeli conflict, with all the wars\nand tragedies that conflict entailed. Now, half a century\nlater, we witness the beginnings of a comprehensive\nsettlement to this question and the progress towards an\nArab-Israeli peace. The United Nations has left its imprint\non all aspects of the question of Palestine and the\nArab-Israeli conflict. Some of its earlier resolutions\nsparked off the Arab-Israeli wars. Some others have laid\nthe foundations for a peaceful settlement, such as Security\nCouncil resolution 242 (1967), and resolution 425 (1978)\non Lebanon, the resolutions on Al-Quds, the refugees and\nthe Palestinian people\u2019s right to self-determination.\nA few days ago, in Washington, we witnessed the\nsigning of the transitional-phase agreement by the\nPalestinian President, Yasser Arafat, and the Israeli Prime\nMinister, Yitzhak Rabin. This is a historic achievement\ntowards resolving the Palestinian problem, as it initiates\nthe second phase of the agreement concluded between the\ntwo parties and expands Palestinian authority to the West\nBank. This is a sound move that brings Palestine closer\nto having a full-fledged Government with its legislative,\nexecutive and judiciary branches within a preliminary\nregional framework.\nAlthough the agreement is transitional and\nrepresents a delicate balance of commitments between the\nemerging entity and Israel, it is undoubtedly a major\npositive step at the strategic level. In practical terms,\n7\n\n\npaves the way for the partition of the land of Palestine\nbetween Israel and the Palestinian entity which would reach\ncompletion only through the establishment of the\nPalestinian State on all the territories of Gaza and the West\nBank. It is important to note here that the Palestinian\nparliament, which will be elected within a few months, will\nrepresent also the Palestinian people in Al-Quds.\nEarly on, Egypt had opted for the role of pioneer in\nthe long march towards peace in the Middle East. Camp\nDavid and Taba, which were two outstanding milestones on\nthis long march, have now been joined by a host of other\nlandmarks along the road to peace. However, we are fully\naware of the obstacles and pitfalls that are still in the way\nof a comprehensive peace, both on the Syrian and the\nLebanese tracks, which must be reactivated urgently indeed,\nand on the Palestinian track, where everything depends on\nthe honest and immediate implementation of the agreement\nand serious preparations for the Israeli-Palestinian\nnegotiations on the final status. Egypt looks forward to a\nday in the near future when its vision of a new Middle East\nwould materialize.\nFrom this very rostrum, at the forty-ninth session of\nthe General Assembly, on behalf of Egypt, I called upon\nthe States and peoples of the Middle East to give thought\nto the shape of our relations in the post-settlement period.\nI invited them to join us in formulating the makings and\nfoundations of new relations between the countries of the\nregion that would rest squarely on three pillars: political\nsettlement, economic and social development and regional\nsecurity and arms control.\nOur views in all this proceed from the conviction that\npeace will never become permanent and will never take\nroot without a balanced and constructive interaction that\nwould serve the common interests of all parties. I have\ntouched upon the recent developments in the area of\npolitical settlement. I should like to add here that the\nframework of this settlement is still fragile and that it needs\na great deal of prudence and caution. What is needed above\nall else in this respect is that all parties should abstain from\ntaking any unilateral action that might infringe the rights of\nthe other parties or pre-empt the final outcome of the\nnegotiations.\nThe Economic Summit meeting for the Middle East\nand North Africa, held in Casablanca in October 1994, was\nan important step for regional economic cooperation. The\nparticipants in that meeting may recall Egypt\u2019s insistence\nthat genuine peace is peace that prevails amongst peoples\nand that genuine peace is that which serves as a foundation\nfor economic cooperation. As we move closer to the\nAmman summit, scheduled to be held towards the end of\nOctober 1995, we reiterate that belief and call for real\nprogress on the different tracks of the peace process in\norder to provide the necessary conditions for promoting\ncooperation in the region.\nIn this connection, Egypt believes that it is the issues\nof arms control and regional security that will determine\nthe form and extent of cooperation amongst the countries\nof the region in the future. Egypt views security, as the\nprincipal mainstay of the edifice of peace in the Middle\nEast, and believes that it should rest squarely on the firm\nfoundation of equal rights and obligations for all parties\nin the region with regard to disarmament, so that equal\nsecurity may be achieved at the minimum level of\narmament and guaranteed through the defining of\ncommon rights and interests and not through the\nacquisition of weapons of mass destruction.\nProceeding from this, we call for initiating concrete\nsteps towards:\n- Israel\u2019s accession to the Treaty on the Non-\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and subjecting\nits nuclear facilities to the International Atomic Energy\nAgency (IAEA) international regime of safeguards and\ninspection.\n- Engaging in discussion aimed at establishing a\nzone free of weapons of mass destruction in the Middle\nEast.\n- Reviewing the relevant international agreements on\ndisarmament, by the countries of the region, with a view\nto harmonizing their positions and commitments regarding\nthose agreements.\nI seize this opportunity to call upon the permanent\nMembers of the Security Council which sponsored the\nresolution relating to the Middle East in the Review and\nExtension Conference of the States Parties to the Treaty\non the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons to take\nconcrete steps that would ensure the accession to the\nTreaty by all States of the region and to initiate the\nestablishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the\nMiddle East in accordance with the Egyptian initiative\nwhich has enjoyed the consensus of all the parties\nconcerned for more than 15 years now.\nSpeaking of the Middle East, I shall now address the\nsituation in the countries neighbouring Egypt. I shall\n8\n\n\nbegin by extending a brotherly greeting to the brotherly\npeople of Sudan and say that only what is right and true\nwill prove to be right and true in the end and that things\nwill inescapably revert to normal in a Sudan that will be\nfree from the politics of terrorism under the guise of\nreligion. The historical ties of friendship that took root over\nthe ages between our two peoples will continue to flow as\nstrongly as the flow of the river Nile through our two\ncountries. Egypt, which does not change its position on\nsuch matters, clearly reaffirms its support for the unity and\nterritorial integrity of Sudan within its political borders.\nOn the western borders of Egypt, we can state that\nLibya now has the firm political will to put an end to the\nLockerbie crisis by accepting the trial of the accused and\nby working for practical solutions within the framework of\nimplementing the relevant Security Council resolutions. In\nthe interests of justice and fairness to the families of the\nvictims, any objective view of the problem would\nunderscore the importance of respecting international\nlegality by accelerating the process of trying those accused\nof perpetrating an international crime.\nOn the other hand, the stability of the Middle East\nrequires the achievement of the security and stability of the\nGulf. In Iraq, the suffering of the Iraqi people continues as\nthat people lives under very cruel conditions. Even the\nterritorial integrity of Iraq is being threatened continuously,\na matter which we shall never accept or acquiesce in. We\ndo look forward to the day in the near future when the\nsuffering of the Iraqi people will come to an end and Iraq\nwill resume exercising its rights and obligations as a\nresponsible member of the Arab family and the\ninternational community.\nNow that the Iraqi Government has recognized the\nsovereignty of Kuwait and its international borders in\naccordance with the relevant Security Council resolutions,\nwe hope that resolving the problem of the prisoners of war\nand the detainees, side by side with the fact that it has\ncomplied with the provisions of Security Council\nresolutions on weapons of mass destruction will be the first\nmajor step towards easing the sanctions imposed on Iraq as\nstipulated in resolution 687 (1991). We also hope that this\nwill lead to practical steps by the Council towards the\nestablishment of a zone free of weapons of mass\ndestruction in the Middle East in implementation of\nparagraph 14 of the said resolution, the only paragraph of\nthe resolution which has remained unimplemented.\nAcross the gulf, we invite Iran, with which the Arab\nworld entertains well-known links and well-known\ndifferences at the same time, to seek to settle the problem\nof the Arab islands in the Gulf, namely: Abu Musa and\nGreater and Lesser Tunb Islands and to respect the\nsovereignty of the United Arab Emirates. This will no\ndoubt serve the interests of stability in that part of the\nMiddle East and work in favour of normal Arab-Iranian\nrelations.\nAllow me to state candidly that we are finding it\nincreasingly difficult to promote moral support for the\nUnited Nations because of a general feeling of frustration\nvis-\u00e0-vis what is going on in the world. Such frustration\nwas inevitable in view of the destruction, killings and war\ncrimes in Bosnia and Herzegovina against the backdrop\nof an unjustified dereliction of duty on the part of the\ninternational community vis-\u00e0-vis those atrocities. This,\nvery naturally, has led to a great deal of questioning about\nthe double standards which have come to be the main\ncharacteristic of the so-called new international order and\nhave deprived that order of credibility even before it took\nconcrete shape.\nAllowing the United Nations-declared \u201csafe areas\u201d\nto fall has shaken the international order and raised\ndoubts regarding the effectiveness of the peace-keeping\nsystem. The continuing deterioration of the situation in\nBosnia has led the Islamic countries to take a decision to\nreject the applicability of the arms embargo on Bosnia\nsince it contradicts the right to legitimate self-defence\nenshrined in the United Nations Charter, when necessary.\nHowever, we welcome the current international\npeace efforts aimed at halting the bloody conflict in\nBosnia and Herzegovina, provided that such efforts and\npolicies do not lead to Bosnia\u2019s partitioning or\nfragmentation, and provided that the peace plans will\nprove to be honest in their formulations and objectives.\nWe also welcome the parties\u2019 success in reaching a\ndeclaration of principles on a regional settlement and\nhope that the ongoing negotiations will lead to a\ncomprehensive, just and viable solution which would\nrespect legality and help bring stability to the region.\nProceeding from our constant support for the rights\nof the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina and their just\ncause, we accept what their Government deems\nacceptable, especially that, as the whole world has seen,\nPresident Alija Izetbegovic has shown admirable\nflexibility and has responded positively to international\nlegality throughout all the stages of the crisis. At the\nsame time, we underline the need for the negotiation\nprocess not to ignore the fundamental principles\n9\n\n\nestablished by the United Nations in dealing with this\nproblem. In particular, we underscore here, the following\nprinciples:\nFirst: Any attempt to treat the aggressor on the same\nfooting as the victim of aggression is unacceptable. Pressure\nshould not be brought to bear on the weaker party under the\npretext of searching for applicable solutions.\nSecond: The territorial map of Bosnia and\nHerzegovina should not be redrawn in a manner that would\nconsecrate the results of aggression, expansionism and\nethnic cleansing.\nThird: Recognizing an entity for the Bosnian Serbs\ninside the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina requires the\ninternational community to deal very carefully indeed with\nthe lack of political, military and institutional balance\nbetween the parties. It also requires international guarantees\nto ensure the implementation of any eventual settlement.\nThis highlights the importance of arming the government of\nBosnia Herzegovina with the necessary defensive means\nthat would enable it to exercise its legitimate right to self-\ndefence in consonance with the Charter, so that this\nMember State of the United Nations may not continue to be\nexposed to destruction or fragmentation should the Serbs\nrenege on the commitment to respect Bosnia\u2019s territorial\nintegrity.\nFourth: The measures of collective security measures\nshould be applied, if necessary, to support the negotiation\nprocess until the plan for a regional settlement is put into\neffect.\nFifth: War criminals must be punished for the crimes\nthey have perpetrated. Short of this, it will be farcical to\ntalk of upholding human rights in any part of the world and\nexpect people to take such talk seriously.\nAs we speak of the situation in Bosnia and\nHerzegovina, I must commend the efforts of the United\nNations Protection Force and salute, in particular, the sons\nof my country, the Egyptian officers and soldiers who are\nbravely carrying out their duties under very difficult\nconditions. I should like also, to stress in this connection\nthe need for the United Nations Forces should continue to\ncarry out their mandate until the Bosnian Government army\nbecomes capable of shouldering its tasks in defence of\nBosnia\u2019s territorial integrity, independence and sovereignty.\nThe fact that the Economic and Social Council\nallocated the high-level segment of its last substantive\nsession to discussing the problems of development in\nAfrica is proof of the United Nations awareness of the\nserious challenges facing economic and social\ndevelopment in the continent. It is essential to intensify\ninternational efforts aimed at restructuring the economies\nof African countries, diversifying their exports and\nstrengthening regional integration amongst the countries\nof Africa, particularly since the Abuja agreement which\nestablished the African Economic Community has entered\ninto force.\nEgypt\u2019s awareness of the seriousness and urgency of\nthese challenges and of the need to face up to them led it\nto call for a special extraordinary ministerial session of\nthe Organization of African Unity (OAU). The meeting\ntook place in March 1995 and adopted the Cairo Plan of\nAction for economic and social development in Africa.\nEven a cursory look at the overall situation in Africa\nwould reveal that the urgent need for a climate of peace\nand stability, makes it necessary for the United Nations to\nincrease its contribution towards the creation of such a\nclimate, in coordination and cooperation with the\nOrganization of African Unity. This highlights the\nimportance of the efforts deployed by the African\ncountries towards supporting and developing the OAU\u2019s\nmechanism for the prevention, management and resolution\nof disputes in Africa. Such efforts require the financial\nand technical support from both the United Nations and\nthe international community.\nAs I speak, tension persists in many parts of Africa.\nIn particular, Rwanda and Burundi, Egypt\u2019s sisterly\npartners in great resource, the Nile, continue to be in the\ngrip of a situation that endangers the stability and security\nof a large area of Africa. This calls for solutions that\nwould allow everyone to live in a society based on justice\nand equality. Egypt believes that the proposed regional\nconference for the countries of the Great Lakes region\nmust elaborate regional policies aimed at finding solutions\nto the problems of the countries of the region from an\noverall perspective that would take into account the plight\nof refugees, ethnic conflicts and other matters. Although\nthe primary responsibility for finding solutions to such\nproblem rests with the countries of the region, which\nmust manifest a spirit of tolerance and moderation if they\nare to achieve national reconciliation and social peace, the\nUnited Nations is called upon to support all the efforts\ndeployed in that direction, in line with the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s oft-repeated pledge that the United Nations\nshall pay attention on an equal footing to the problems of\nall regions of the world.\n10\n\n\nIn Somalia, Egypt hopes that all parties will adhere to\nAfrican values and listen to the voice of reason in order for\nthem to extricate the Somali people from its cruel plight.\nSuch a review of the hotbeds of tension and crises in\nAfrica should not detract from the importance of the\npositive developments that have taken place in Africa over\nthe past two years, particularly in Mozambique, Angola and\nmore recently in Liberia. These have been truly important\nachievements which were made possible by good intentions\nand through the effective role played by the United Nations\nand the OAU. We do hope that all parties, especially in\nAngola and Liberia, will remain committed to the\nagreements to restore peace and normal life in these two\nsister countries.\nI turn now to the world economy. In this respect,\nallow me to state that, although the responsibility for\nachieving development and improving economic\nperformance falls mainly on the shoulders of the States\nconcerned, we believe that the solidarity of the international\ncommunity \u2014 through the establishment of a propitious\neconomic environment and extending a helping hand \u2014 is\na very important element in the area of development.\nThe growing marginalization of the role of the\ndeveloping countries in an increasingly interdependent\nworld could adversely affect stability. We heartily welcome\nthe ideas which the Secretary-General set out in his Agenda\nfor Development and hope that the General Assembly\u2019s\ndeliberations on the Agenda will contribute to correcting the\ncurrent serious imbalances.\nThere is a need, as a matter of priority that should be\naddressed with courage and creativity, to reformulate\npolicies and solutions to the problem of the external debt of\nthe developing countries that would help create a climate of\nequal opportunity amongst peoples and nations and make\nuse of the latent potential of many parts of the world in\npaving the way towards balanced and comprehensive\ndevelopment at the threshold of the twenty-first century.\nThe liberalization of international trade is an essential\ningredient of economic growth. However, this liberalization\nrequires rationalization in the light of the present structural\nimbalances and the huge and widening gap between the\ndeveloping and the developed countries. Moreover, the\nselective policies pursued by some developed countries in\nliberalizing their trade and the disguised protectionist\npolicies which are put in place behind a fa\u00e7ade of\nenvironmental, human rights or other considerations,\ncontradict the spirit and the call for liberalizing international\ntrade and would lead to the worsening and entrenchment\nof the present imbalances.\nWe welcome the World Trade Organization as it\nbegins its work. We hope that rectifying those imbalances\nwill be one of its most important concerns in the future.\nWe should also like to stress the need for the United\nNations Conference on Trade and Development to\ncontinue to perform its role as the international\nnegotiating forum that is qualified to build consensus on\nissues relating to free trade and development and also as\nthe very valuable source of technical assistance and\ninformation on world trade for the developing countries.\nChanges on the international economic arena make\nit necessary to embark on a broad review of the role, the\ncapabilities and the structures of international financing\ninstitutions with a view to enabling those institutions to\nrespond to those changes and to the requirements of\ncomprehensive and sustainable development in a manner\nthat would reflect the spirit of democracy and reform.\nThere is no doubt that the phenomenon of terrorism\nhas become cause for deep concern to many peoples who\nhave become fed up with criminal acts that aim at\nterrorizing whole societies and with the export of\nterrorism by countries that, having allowed themselves to\nbecome safe havens for extremism and bases for assassins\nand criminals, have hosted terrorists and provided them\nwith refuge, protection and assistance.\nIn this connection, I should like to point out that\nevents have shown that terrorism is not limited to any\nspecific geographical area or to any culture or religion.\nTherefore, it is not wise for some to try to pretend that\nIslam is synonymous with extremism. Also, it would be\nabsolutely unfair to ignore the fundamental difference\nbetween Islam, a religion of tolerance that upholds human\nvalues, and the terrorism practised by certain\nfundamentalist, so-called religious groups that are deviants\nfrom Islam. It is therefore incumbent upon us to\nimplement the Declaration on Measures to Eliminate\nInternational Terrorism, which we adopted last year. Let\nus close the door in the face of those whose hands are\nsmeared with the blood of innocent victims and develop\na strict legal regime to prosecute terrorists and try them\nfor the heinous crimes they perpetrate to the detriment of\ninternational stability and security.\nIn conclusion, I should like to pay tribute to the\noutstanding role and sincere efforts of the Secretary-\nGeneral, Mr. Boutros-Ghali, to enhance and revitalize the\n11\n\n\nUnited Nations so that it may cope with the realities of our\nera and the expectations of our peoples for peace, security,\ndevelopment, justice and equality. Egypt is proud to see one\nof its prominent sons at the helm of the United Nations, at\nthis important juncture of its history and during this critical\nera of the history of mankind.\nNow that we are celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of\nthe United Nations, we find ourselves still far from\nachieving the noble goals and objectives enshrined in its\nCharter. On the threshold of a new century and a new\nmillennium, we have to work together to support the United\nNations and strengthen its capabilities. This is an absolute\nnecessity if we are to look to the future with confidence\nand hope for a better life for everyone.\n"

        "file_text": "May I first take this\noccasion to congratulate Ambassador Diogo Freitas do\nAmaral of Portugal on his election to the presidency of\nthe Assembly in this important fiftieth anniversary year.\nI should also like to offer a special welcome to\nPalau as the one hundred eighty-fifth Member. Palau\u2019s\naccession does signal honour to us as a fellow Pacific\nState.\nHere today I want to talk about making our global\nneighbourhood a safer place for all of us; the progress\nthat has been made in the years since the end of the cold\nwar, and what still needs to be done. Memories are short;\nit is hard to recall the degree of mutual suspicion that\ncoloured global politics just a few years ago.\nWe have made great strides in recent times. The\nworld community has achieved much in its efforts to\nmake the world safer, and more stable. But we need to\nmove on to reinforce our achievements in controlling,\nreducing and abolishing the horrific weapons of mass\ndestruction. We have yet to see the dividend we all\nexpected to flow from the end of the cold war.\nThe transition to a post-cold-war world is not easy.\nWe are painfully aware of that. In recent years though,\nwe have been encouraged to believe that a new world\norder was achievable. One of the reasons for this hope,\nthis optimism, was that the nuclear scourge had receded.\nFor the first time in 50 years nuclear Powers were\ncommitted to build down rather than to build up, to\ndecommission and destroy rather than to commission and\nconstruct.\nHowever, recent events have cast a cloud over that\nbrief period of optimism. New Zealand does not believe\n18\n\n\nthat continued nuclear testing, wherever it takes place,\ncontributes to a safer world. On the contrary, nuclear\ntesting sends the wrong message to States which do possess\nor which aspire to the possession of nuclear weapons. It\nalso tells them that the development of these weapons is\nstill acceptable.\nThe nuclear tests which have taken place since the\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons was\nextended have disturbed the delicate balance achieved at\nthat Conference. New Zealand believed then, and continues\nto believe, that indefinite extension was the right option.\nThe world needs a strong non-proliferation regime, one that\ncannot be called into question by changing global\ncircumstances. But the Conference went further than that,\nthe vast majority of participants making it very clear that\nthey were against nuclear testing. They also wanted to\nmove towards the nuclear-free world envisaged in article VI\nof the Treaty. The cavalier disregard, and dismissal of the\nviews of the many, has led to considerable disillusionment.\nIt will take a long time to restore the trust that had been\nthere.\nNew Zealand and the rest of the South Pacific region\nhave long stood tall and proud in opposition to nuclear\nweapons and their testing. We abhor testing wherever it\noccurs. But the decision to resume testing in what we see\nas our home region has particularly angered the people of\nNew Zealand. The leaders of the South Pacific Forum\nnations expressed their outrage at their meeting just two\nweeks ago. They were able to recall the painful memories\nin the region, going back to atmospheric testing conducted\nbetween 25 and 50 years ago.\nThe South Pacific has not been alone in its opposition\nto nuclear testing. Governments, parliamentarians and\npeoples from every region of the world have spoken up in\nanger, alarm and dismay. The two Governments which are\ncontinuing to test nuclear weapons must heed the voice of\nthe international community. They are dancing to a tune no\none wants to hear.\nIn these circumstances, New Zealand, along with a\nrepresentative group of like-minded States, will submit an\nappropriate draft resolution to the First Committee of this\nAssembly.\nTesting is a backward step, and I condemn it. It is not\ntoo late. All that China and France need to do is listen to\ninternational opinion and announce that their testing\nprogrammes have ceased.\nI want to welcome the commitment by three of the\nnuclear-weapon States \u2014 France, the United Kingdom\nand the United States \u2014 to a genuine ban on nuclear\ntesting: a prohibition on any nuclear explosions, no matter\nhow small. This is what we have always called for: a\ncomprehensive ban \u2014 where the word \u201ccomprehensive\u201d\nmeans just that. We are pleased that it is attracting serious\nsupport.\nNew Zealand calls on the two nuclear-weapon States\nthat have not yet indicated full support for this approach\nto do so quickly. Time is short. The deadline for the\nnegotiations is 1996, and the international community is\nholding the Conference on Disarmament accountable for\nmeeting that deadline and producing a treaty that is\ngenuinely comprehensive in scope.\nIn this regard, the General Assembly has become\nincreasingly concerned about the lack of accountability in\nthe Conference on Disarmament. Limited and\nunrepresentative membership has been a large part of the\nproblem. Enlargement is long overdue. New Zealand\nwelcomes the progress made in recent weeks in Geneva,\nand we express our gratitude to Morocco for its efforts in\nthis regard.\nHowever, the real test will be whether by the time\nwe meet here again next year the new members will have\nbeen able to take their seats. For the moment, the\noutcome is still not satisfactory. I recall that democratic\nrepresentation was once at the heart of a tea party in\nBoston. Let us hope that there will not be a tea party in\nNew York in 1996 on membership of the Conference on\nDisarmament.\nI also urge the members of the Conference on\nDisarmament to look beyond the conclusion of a\ncomprehensive test-ban treaty. New Zealand wants to see\nan international agreement banning the production of\nfissile material for nuclear weapons. That would be\nanother important step towards negotiations on the total\nelimination of nuclear weapons. We urge the Conference\non Disarmament to resolve its procedural differences and\nget the negotiations under way.\nI should add that at the Review and Extension\nConference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons we raised the idea of\nnegotiating an agreement to ban the future production of\nnuclear weapons. That could take us a step closer to\neliminating the nuclear threat.\n19\n\n\nBut it is also important to address the issues relating\nto conventional weapons.\nI wish, first, to address the issue of land-mines. I want\nto congratulate the Secretary-General and his staff for the\nway they have picked up this issue and raised public\nawareness around the world. The Conference organized in\nGeneva this year was most timely \u2014 but more is needed.\nBoth financial and technical resources need to be made\navailable to help dispose of the millions of treacherous life-\nand livelihood-destroying mines that have already been laid.\nI pledge New Zealand\u2019s ongoing assistance in this work.\nOf course, disposal alone is not the answer. Urgent\nprogress needs to be made to deal with these hideous\nweapons, which go on claiming the lives of innocent\npeople \u2014 farmers, their children, shopkeepers, collectors of\nwood, carriers of water \u2014 long after conflicts have ceased.\nI ask all the participants at the Conference which opened\nthis week in Vienna, which has as its main aim the revision\nof international law on land-mines, to work together to\nachieve the tightest possible restrictions on these totally\nindiscriminate weapons. I want to work to eliminate them\nentirely from the world\u2019s armouries.\nThis leads one to the broader questions of arms\ntransfers. We are profoundly disturbed at the unnecessary\nand irrational increase in arms transfers. At a time when,\nglobally, resources are desperately needed for development,\nfor the environment, for health, why is it that even modest\nmeasures, such as enhancing the United Nations Register of\nConventional Arms are still being resisted?\nNeither peace nor development is advanced if States\nput increasingly scarce economic resources into the defence\nsectors of their economies. Far too much of the global\neconomic capacity is going into armaments when the\ncitizens of the world desperately need better health, better\neducation and a better future for their children.\nThe widespread availability of conventional arms and\nthe resurgence of ethnic nationalism have, together,\nproduced a very dangerous cocktail, which poses a major\nthreat to stability in the post-cold-war era. The need for\nMember States to maintain a collective approach in\naddressing these challenges has never been greater.\nEvents in the former Yugoslavia over the past year\nhave presented an enormous challenge to the international\ncommunity. New Zealand fully supported the firm response\nmade by this Organization and the North Atlantic Treaty\nOrganization to the murderous shelling of Sarajevo late in\nAugust. The diplomatic efforts now under way, including\nthe very important constitutional agreement reached last\nTuesday, offer some prospect for bringing to an end\nalmost four years of a most appalling conflict.\nSome have been dismissive of the achievements of\nthe United Nations in the former Yugoslavia. That,\nhowever, is to overlook the saving of tens of thousands of\nlives and the substantial relief of suffering. This is why\nNew Zealand, despite its geographical distance from the\nregion, has been willing to play its part. I believe that,\none day, the United Nations mission in Bosnia will enjoy\nrecognition of the successes it has achieved so far.\nIt is a little too easy to focus on the problems of the\nUnited Nations. We need to remember its successes as\nwell. I think of Cambodia and Mozambique, of El\nSalvador and Haiti, of Namibia and Angola and of the\ncontributions to peace in various parts of the Middle East\nover the years. Even in Somalia, where a political\nsettlement proved elusive, massive famine was relieved\nthanks to the United Nations.\nThe United Nations is unique. It is called on to deal\nwith the most intractable problems \u2014 the ones that others\nput into the \u201ctoo hard\u201d basket. And it works under the\nclosest public scrutiny of Governments and the world\u2019s\nmedia.\nNew Zealand strongly supports practical steps to\nimprove peace-keeping management. We have, in fact,\nprovided additional specialist personnel to the Department\nof Peace-keeping Operations at our own expense. We\nhave contributed to the strengthening of the Secretariat\u2019s\ncapacity in the demining area. And we shall continue\nthese commitments because we believe that they are so\nnecessary. We also entered into the United Nations\nstand-by arrangements earlier this year, and we hope that\nthese will provide a clearer focus for peace-keeping and\nits planning.\nWe have also studied with interest the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s recommendation, in his Supplement to \u201cAn\nAgenda for Peace\u201d, that the United Nations should\nconsider the idea of a rapid-deployment force. I wish to\ncommend the ground-breaking work that has already been\ndone by Canada, the Netherlands, Denmark and others.\nMy discussions yesterday with Ministers from these and\nother countries were encouraging to me. Progress can and\nshould be made in this area.\n20\n\n\nAt about this time last year I spoke to the General\nAssembly about a number of elements that I consider\ncritical to the conduct of peace-keeping operations. These\nincluded a sustainable financial system, transparent political\naccountability, clear objectives, a credible legal regime that\nguarantees the security of United Nations personnel and, of\ncourse, the availability of resources so that objectives can\nbe met quickly and efficiently.\n\nProgress has been made. We were especially pleased\nto see the Convention on the Safety of United Nations\nPersonnel opened for signature during last year\u2019s session.\nWe urge those that have not signed it to do so, and soon.\nWe owe that to the thousands who have served, and are\nserving, in the United Nations operations worldwide.\nThe improved procedures for consultation between the\nSecurity Council and troop contributors, initiated by\nArgentina and New Zealand, have now been in place for\nalmost a year. Pleasing as this is, we still have some way\nto go. It is up to those of us who contribute troops to\nUnited Nations operations to ensure there is no slippage in\nthese procedures.\nRegrettably, however, we do not appear to have a\nsustainable financial system. I am gravely concerned that,\ndespite all the warnings here in this Assembly last year,\ndelegations have not made any real progress in the Working\nGroup addressing the financial crisis. The United\nNations \u2014 this United Nations \u2014 ran out of cash in mid-\nAugust. The arrears of Member States in respect of the\nregular and peace-keeping budgets have reached\nunprecedented levels. It is nothing short of a tragedy that\non the eve of our celebration of the fiftieth anniversary, the\nUnited Nations, this body of ours, is on the verge of\nbankruptcy.\nAt this critical point in the United Nations history, we\nneed political will, not more words. \u201cWords pay no debts\u201d,\nas Shakespeare wrote. We need new ideas, not recycled\nplatitudes. And, above all, Members must pay their dues,\non time, and in full.\nWe do stand here at a crossroads. In taking stock of\nthe United Nations 50 years, we have much on which to\nreflect. There have been good times, and there have been\nbad times. Reform and revitalization must stay on our\nminds. I wish to assure you, Sir, and all other members, of\nNew Zealand\u2019s commitment to help remould the\nOrganization to that which will be needed to work for all\nof us as we head towards the twenty-first century.\n"

        "file_text": "In a few days the United Nations will be marking the first\nhalf-century of its existence. This historic occasion, which\nthe world with its different races, ethnic groups, religions,\nand creeds will celebrate, will reach its peak here at\nUnited Nations Headquarters, where world leaders and\nHeads of State will meet.\nThis occasion, while it should reaffirm the need for\nthe United Nations, and underline its importance and the\nimportance of its principles, objectives, and activities,\nwill, at the same time, pose certain questions about the\ncurrent state of the Organization and where it stands\ntoday. Such questions must be viewed in the context of\nthe principles that governed the establishment of the\nUnited Nations and the objectives it was meant to\nachieve. For it must be recalled that mankind wanted the\nUnited Nations to be an enterprise for peace, harmony,\nsolidarity, dialogue, and rapprochement amongst peoples\nand cultures of the world.\nThrough this legitimate dream, mankind sought to\nbuild an edifice for rights, justice and peace. The United\nNations was meant to be an arbiter, a forum where people\ncould seek to defend their rights whenever they are\ndenied, and to redress injustice whenever oppression\nprevails. By establishing the United Nations, humanity\n4\n\n\nwanted to put an end to the era of war and to open the door\nto peace, national sovereignty, independence, and territorial\nintegrity, and to protect peoples\u2019 freedom of choice.\nIn the era of the communications and transportation\nrevolution, when political, economic, demographic, security\nand cultural barriers are lowered, people need the United\nNations more than ever. They need a forum for constructive\ndialogue and an effective and permanent mechanism for\nconsultation, cooperation, and coordination.\nWe are witnessing a scientific and technological\nrevolution that intensifies the need for a greater synergy\nthat would enable us to meet increasingly complicated\ndemands and challenges, to bridge the widening gap\nbetween nations and, together, to do what no nation can do\nalone.\nThe world\u2019s demographic explosion has put the\nEarth\u2019s environment under constant pressure to cater to the\nincreasing demands made upon it. Competition for the\nworld\u2019s resources is on the rise, as is the imbalance\nbetween human needs and disposable resources. The\naccumulation of lethal and sophisticated nuclear, chemical,\nand bacteriological weapons, and the concomitant increase\nin their destructive capabilities across continents, increase\npeoples\u2019 risk of annihilation. Their proliferation and\npossession by some States that lack even the absolute\nminimum of credibility and fail to provide any political\nguarantees regarding the decision to use such weapons,\nincreases the world\u2019s need for guarantees and controls on\narmament.\nThe information revolution is contributing to the rapid\ndissemination of information about political, scientific, and\neconomic achievements across boundaries. Unequal access\nto information by some societies is accentuating their\nisolation and causing them to be bound by their traditions,\neither because they want to protect their national identity,\nor because they are unable to assimilate such achievements.\nExtremist and fundamentalist tendencies express the fear\nhaunting these societies against what are often perceived as\nthreats to their national identity.\nAll these risks make it more important than ever\nbefore to reactivate United Nations machinery and to\nreinvigorate confidence in its justice and credibility, to free\nits decisions from hegemony, to redress its imbalances, and\nto apply the same standards in its approach and\ncommitment. That is the path we should take if the United\nNations is to remain a world authority and an alternative to\nheated confrontations.\nSo, where do we stand at present with regard to the\nmoral authority and credibility of United Nations\nresolutions? How can we apply one standard across the\nboard?\nThe world has witnessed and continues to witness a\nnumber of local and regional crises. Lebanon, which has\nsuffered from the scourge of war, follows what is\nhappening around the world with grave concern and\ninterest.\nRwanda and Bosnia and Herzegovina are two clear\nexamples of our inability to act in the face of horrible\natrocities. More than 20 years have passed and the\nCypriot problem still awaits settlement, despite numerous\nrelevant resolutions adopted by the General Assembly and\nSecurity Council to unify the island and to protect its\nindependence and territorial integrity. The question of the\nislands of the United Arab Emirates still awaits a solution\nthat would ease tension in the region.\nFour years ago the Madrid Conference was\nconvened. We were optimistic about the invitation, the\ncontent, and the sponsorship. As the co-sponsors were\nsuper-Powers, and the Conference was to be convened on\nthe basis of establishing a just, comprehensive, and lasting\npeace anchored in the principle of \u201cland for peace\u201d, and\non the basis of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967),\n338 (1973), and 425 (1978) respectively, we accepted the\ninvitation, assuming that those who accepted it were also\nin agreement with its content and that what remained to\nbe done was to discuss the questions of mechanisms and\nschedules.\nHowever, years have passed and months have gone\nby while some waited for the results of elections and for\nthe arrival of the opportune moment at the domestic level.\nTime has passed while some awaited circumstances that,\nthey bet, were bound to strengthen their positions, or\nconducted secret negotiations that they expected to\nweaken, isolate or single out some other side. The result\nhas been that we are still discussing today the basic\nprinciples which were supposed to have been settled at\nthe very beginning of the Conference.\nThe principle of land for peace still awaits the\nmaterialization of the concept of \u201cland\u201d. The principle of\nwithdrawal is still being obfuscated by the term\n\u201credeployment\u201d. We are told that resistance must cease,\nwithout any guarantee that withdrawal or liberation will\never take place. We are told that the boycott must end,\nbut no guarantee is given that usurped rights will be\n5\n\n\nrestored. We are required to engage in multilateral\nnegotiations on complementary subjects while the\nfundamental bilateralism remains frozen and while we\nknow not whether there will be peace, or what the form and\ncontent of that peace will ever be.\nWe are required to shake hands and to celebrate\nbefore we know what exactly we are supposed to celebrate.\nWe, the victims of aggression, are required to give security\nguarantees to the aggressor. Those who do not possess\nweapons are required to reassure those who possess one of\nthe largest nuclear and chemical arsenals which the world\ncould not make subject to the Non-Proliferation Treaty\nwhen the Treaty was extended.\nThe media hype that surrounded the recent signing of\nthe second Protocol between the Palestinian Authority and\nIsrael, which glorified the event and amplified its content,\nmakes us wonder about the extent of the authority that will\nbe exercised by the Palestinian people, the size of the\nterritories that would be returned and, ultimately, to wonder\nabout the fate of three quarters of the Palestinian people\nwho were displaced from the land of Palestine. What about\ntheir right to return, their right to a nationality, to an\nidentity? What about those whose status was never\ndiscussed either at Oslo or at Taba? We wonder: Could\nthose tiny specks of land \u2014 in which an authority less than\nthat of a municipality will be exercised \u2014 be called the\nPalestinian homeland? Doesn\u2019t the isolation of those tiny\nspecks into so-called security islands mean additional\nprisons in which anger and rancour will fester?\nWill the 400,000 Palestinians who are now in Lebanon\nand others who are elsewhere in the world ever enjoy their\nlong-awaited right of return? How can we have faith in a\ncountry that boasts of its desire for peace and its intention\nto restore legitimate rights to people while it continues to\nviolate those rights, to build settlements and to occupy and\nconfiscate land? It cannot be credited unless it desists from\nsuch actions forthwith, particularly in southern Lebanon,\nwhere it has recently confiscated lands.\nCould this bloated glorification by the media serve as\nan alternative to the restoring of legitimate rights? Could\nthis anaesthetization of international public opinion, this\nillusion of a solution, actually put an end to the problem?\nWe in Lebanon are patiently and diligently continuing\nto rebuild our homeland after the destruction of a ravaging\nwar. We are continuing to build our institutions and our\nsecurity. Those who had emigrated are continuing to return\nto their homeland, and those who were displaced are\ncontinuing to return to their villages. Laws are being\nenacted so that Lebanon may regain its natural place in\nthe Middle East on the economic, political and cultural\nlevels.\nLebanon has suffered for far too long from the\nconsequences and reverberations of the Middle East\ncrises. Lebanon has paid its heavy dues. Once again it\nproves that it is capable of facing difficulties and rising\nup to challenges and that its unity formula is much\nstronger than was once believed, because it is the only\ndefinitive reality.\nLebanon will once again prove that certain nations\nhave a history that is more extensive than their geography\nand a role that is much larger than their physical size. As\nlong as Lebanon\u2019s sovereignty and independence continue\nto be compromised; as long as major parts of its land\ncontinue to be out of its control; as long as the Lebanese\nState continues to be unable to extend its full sovereignty\nover all its national territory by its own legitimate\nnational forces; as long as Israel continues to occupy\nLebanon\u2019s territories 17 years after the adoption by the\nSecurity Council of resolution 425 (1978) which\ndemanded Israel\u2019s complete withdrawal from Lebanon; as\nlong as Lebanese citizens continue to languish in Israeli\nprisons and detention camps, ignored by the international\ncommunity in clear violation of their human rights \u2014 as\nlong as all this continues, the wounds will never heal and\nthe bleeding will never stop.\nSo long as the occupation of more than one eighth\nof our national territory continues; so long as Israeli raids\ndaily sow our land with cluster bombs, fission bombs,\nscatter bombs and booby traps for the killing of children;\nso long as such criminal acts continue to be perpetrated\nagainst a people that refuses to surrender; so long as our\nwomen continue to mourn the loss of their loved ones and\nso long as our children cry out, the cries of anguish will\ncontinue to haunt the world and the voices raised against\ninjustice will grow louder than the roar of the guns that\ndefend a senseless occupation.\nThe occupier has used all the means available to it,\nbut has failed to contain this anger. Israel\u2019s logic of\nsecurity zones inside Lebanese territories and security\nbelts has failed also. The cost has by far outweighed the\nreturns.\nThe Security Council\u2019s method in dealing with\nLebanon\u2019s complaints does not represent the optimum\nmeans of performing the role of that important body. We\n6\n\n\nhave waited so long for the implementation of Security\nCouncil resolutions. Instead, the Council has refrained from\ncondemning aggression, and if it happens to do so, it tends\nto equate the aggressor with the victim of the aggression.\nWhen it fails to condemn, it uses as a pretext the desire not\nto cause any distortion to the peace process.\nThe peace negotiations, however, do not absolve the\nSecurity Council from the obligation to perform its\nappointed role at any given moment, especially when an act\nof aggression is committed in the shadow of a peace\nprocess. Nor do they absolve the Council from its\nresponsibility towards international peace. Discriminating in\nthe application of United Nations resolutions for some and\ndepriving others of the right to call for implementation;\ndiscriminating in the application of the stipulations of\nChapter VII of the Charter on some trouble-makers while\nrefraining from such application on others in a sort of\ncover-up for the practices of those protected others, will\ndeprive the United Nations of credibility as an arbiter to\nwhom the nations of the world have recourse in search of\njustice.\nThe days when the problems of people were confined\nto their own countries are over. The days when State\nboundaries were barriers that contained a country\u2019s crises\nare over as well. Regardless of how distant any country\nmay be from a crisis area, it can none the less remain\nsubject to repercussions of such crisis. Thus every country\nremains vulnerable to the political, economic,\nenvironmental, demographic and security problems of other\ncountries.\nThe Middle East must not forever be a fiery volcano\nthat threatens international peace and security. This way,\nthe region will not see better days nor will time be forever\non the side of those who seek peace.\nWe have to realize that peace must be equitable, not\nbiased; just, not unjust; genuine, not ceremonial; balanced,\nnot deficient. Peace must help the refugee to return rather\nthan consecrate his displacement. Peace must satisfy those\nwho rebel against injustice, not provoke their anger.\nThe new tendency to weigh the suitability of\nresolutions, to selectively enforce some and freeze some, to\nelaborate different interpretations to different resolutions, an\nenterprise that is engaged in, from time to time, in the\nwings of the Organization under the pretext of having to\ninterpret resolutions with reference to the circumstances\nunder which they were adopted, all this threatens credibility\nof the United Nations as a whole.\nThis then is the situation we face today, and it is\nagainst the backdrop of this situation that I congratulate\nthe President on his election at this session and extend\nappreciation to his predecessor, to the Secretary-General\nand to the commanders, officers, and soldiers of the\nUnited Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL),\nwhom I wholeheartedly thank for their valuable efforts\nunder difficult circumstances.\nMay God guide us to peace and to acquitting\nourselves in the eyes of the generations to come.\n"

We would also like to express our deep gratitude\nto the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Boutros\nBoutros-Ghali, who is at the head of our Organization at\nthis momentous time, for his tireless efforts to strengthen\npeace and security around the world.\nThe fireworks commemorating victory in the Second\nWorld War still resounded when our Organization was\ncoming into being, but the world had already been divided\nby military and ideological confrontation. In the Soviet\nUnion, Ministries of Foreign Affairs were founded in each\nof the republics and hastily staffed with diplomatic\npersonnel. However, the Soviet Union\u2019s attempts to use its\nrepublics to increase the number of votes in its bloc within\nthe newly formed international Organization were not\nsuccessful. Only three out of the 15 republics were accepted\nas Members of the United Nations. Frozen by the years of\nthe cold war, we gained our independence without any\nviolence or bloodshed. Now, almost half a century later, we\nhave entered into the community of fully-fledged Members\nof the United Nations.\nSince then, the world has gone through dramatic\nchanges. Today we need the United Nations as never\nbefore.\nThrough the United Nations, we, the post-socialist\ncountries, enter into the world and interact with countries\nof the North and the South, the West and the East. Within\nonly four years of attaining independence, Kyrgyzstan has\nbecome a Member of the United Nations and has joined the\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe\n(OSCE), the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS),\nthe Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC), the\nNorth Atlantic Cooperation Council (NACC) and the\nEconomic Cooperation Organization (ECO), as well as\nmany other international political and financial\norganizations. The United Nations represents the main axis\nof the foreign policy of our young country, and we will\nwork without respite to increase the effectiveness of our\nOrganization.\nAs small countries, we see in the United Nations a\nguarantor of our independence, security and justice, based\non mutual respect for international law. The law is our\nstrongest argument in the family of the United Nations.\nAs countries with economies in transition and as\ndeveloping democracies, we receive extremely important\nand urgent aid and support from the United Nations:\nmedicine, food and technical equipment. The Gramin\nBank is fighting rising poverty by giving the people\nmicroloans. We are trying to build a civil society by\neducating the non-governmental organizations, lawyers\nand journalists. On 24 December 1995, open presidential\nelections will take place in Kyrgyzstan, to which we\nwould like to invite observers from all over the world.\nOne of our most significant achievements during our\nfirst years of independence, as our President, Askar\nAkayev, has pointed out, is \u2014 in addition to our small\neconomic advances on the road to a free market \u2014 the\nattainment of an inter-ethnic consensus, internal stability\nand peace in our country.\nHidden tensions based on religious and ethnic\ngrounds erupted in Central Asia after the dissolution of\nthe Soviet Union, requiring the involvement of the United\nNations, the OSCE and the CIS. We commend the\nmediating role of the United Nations, which led to a\ncease-fire agreement and the beginning of a dialogue\nbetween the sides in the inter-Tajik conflict. The five\ncountries of Central Asia, along with the Russian\nFederation, are doing their best to launch the fifth round\nof talks on the conflict in Tajikistan. These should lead to\na dialogue regarding fundamental issues pertaining to the\npolitical future of the country.\nActions taken by the organs of the United Nations\nsystem, the donor countries and international financial\ninstitutions should range from humanitarian assistance to\nlong-term development programmes. This is true for both\nTajikistan and Kyrgyzstan. I strongly support the proposal\nby the Secretary of State of the United Kingdom,\nMr. Malcolm Rifkind, for the establishment within the\nUnited Nations of special programmes for stabilization\nand transition.\nIt is a sign of the times that, in the face of horrible\nand prolonged conflicts, all the major countries, for the\nfirst time in half a century, have joined together to build\nand keep the peace.\nStep by step, the knot in the Middle East is being\nuntied. We would like to congratulate Israel and Palestine\non the recent signing of an agreement on the West Bank,\n17\n\n\nand we hope that both parties will have patience, courage\nand success on this difficult road to peace. There are\npromising hopes for a settlement to be reached that will end\nthe conflict in Bosnia. Kyrgyzstan welcomes the peace talks\nbased on the Washington Agreements on the creation of a\nState based on the federal principle. We are convinced that\nthe time has come to focus the world\u2019s attention on the\nsituation in Afghanistan. There can be no peace in Asia\nwithout the settlement of the conflict in Afghanistan.\nIt is impossible to be a mere spectator when the\nflames of wars and conflicts scorch our borders and\ndecrease stability. Kazakstan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan\nhave announced their willingness to create a peace-keeping\nunit under the auspices of the United Nations. We are\nconvinced of the need to have such United Nations\noperational peace-keeping forces in reserve, so they can be\ncalled upon in extreme situations.\nThere remains an undiscovered potential when it\ncomes to cooperation among the United Nations and the\nOSCE, the United Nations and the CIS, and all of them\ntogether when it comes to solving conflicts in post-Soviet\nterritory. It is not by competing but by cooperating that the\nregional security institutions can stop the violence and\nexplosions. They can use a wide spectrum of preventive\nmeasures, such as \u201cplanting\u201d the culture of peace, bringing\nthe sides to the negotiating table and constant monitoring.\nBorder issues, the distribution of water and natural\nresources, the rights of ethnic minorities: we in Central\nAsia need international legal expertise in all these areas, as\nwell as the introduction of proven legal, political, socio-\neconomic norms and regulations.\nFully sharing the responsibility for peace and security\nin our region, the newly independent States of Central Asia\nare trying to do all they can to keep peace and order on the\nland given to us by God. Kazakstan is working with\npersistence to organize a conference on confidence-building\nmeasures in Asia. Uzbekistan is working on the idea of a\nstanding seminar on the subject of regional security.\nTurkmenistan declared its intention to become a neutral\nState. During a meeting in May of this year at Lake\nIssyk-Kul, representatives of the five countries, with the\nsupport of the United Nations Development Programme\n(UNDP), created a standing seminar on stable development\nfor Central Asia.\nKyrgyzstan and other Central Asian countries\nsupported with great enthusiasm the unconditional and\nindefinite extension of the nuclear non-proliferation Treaty\nat the 1995 Conference on that Treaty. Along with\nUzbekistan, my country calls for establishing Central Asia\nas a nuclear-weapon-free zone. It is our firm wish to\nfinalize work on the agreement on a comprehensive test-\nban treaty no later than 1996 and to make the moratorium\non nuclear testing universal and permanent.\nFree economic and trade zones have become\nefficient instruments in speeding up trade and\ndevelopment among countries and continents. To make\nthe world a safer place, we need other types of zones: not\njust non-nuclear but \u201cnon-conflict\u201d zones. Central Asia\ncould become such a testing ground.\nThe lessons of the last decade require focused and\ncompassionate attention from the United Nations and the\nworld community in general on countries in transition\nsuch as Kyrgyzstan. The United Nations and its\norganizations \u2014 UNDP, the United Nations Children\u2019s\nFund (UNICEF), the United Nations Population Fund\n(UNFPA), the United Nations Educational, Scientific and\nCultural Organization (UNESCO) and the World Health\nOrganization (WHO) \u2014 although sometimes\noverwhelmed by the unprecedented nature and scope of\nproblems such as those of refugees, natural disasters,\ndegradation of the environment, illegal drug trafficking\nand the spread of AIDS, deserve a great deal of credit for\nhelping us to solve severe social problems in this difficult\ntransition period. It is not only professional office\nmanagers who work there, but true implementators of\nreforms. World forums of the United Nations \u2014 from\nCairo to Copenhagen, from Beijing to the Habitat II\nConference scheduled to be held in Istanbul \u2014 bind us\ntogether in the United Nations in understanding the\nmagnitude of the social problems confronting humanity.\nImplementing their decisions will require enthusiasm and\na huge concentration of effort. The most important thing\nnow is action \u2014 the political will of Member States to\ngo forward\u2014 effective international monitoring and\n\u201cglasnost\u201d.\nThe participation of women in all these\ntransformations is of critical importance. The world in the\ntwenty-first century means equal rights for men and\nwomen, for my son and my daughter, my daughter and\nmillions of other young girls and women in Central Asia,\nto be married in accordance with their own choice and\ndesires, to have unrestricted access to education and\nemployment, to be elected to Parliament and to work at\nall levels of government. It is for the sake of these goals\nthat I am tirelessly working today.\n18\n\n\nWe welcome the intention and determination of the\nPresident for this session, His Excellency Mr. Diogo Freitas\ndo Amaral of Portugal, personally to lead the activities of\na High-level Open-ended Working Group to report on the\nsubject of reform to the General Assembly at its fiftieth\nsession. We, the Member States of the United Nations,\nexpect not only thorough and precise reports, but seek\nconcrete, genuine reforms and changes.\nKyrgyzstan favours an enlargement of the Security\nCouncil, while bearing in mind the need for appropriate\nregional balance. Germany and Japan, in our view, deserve\nto be elected to the Council as permanent members. Being\namong the biggest contributors to the United Nations\nbudget, they are playing an ever-increasing role in\nstrengthening peace and promoting development and\ndemocracy. It is also necessary to increase the number of\nnon-permanent Security Council members.\nThe world at the end of the twentieth century is as\ncomplicated and multi-faceted as we are \u2014 peoples and\ncountries on six continents who are burdened with their\ndaily problems and worries, their dreams and concerns.\nModern means of communication and speed have\nencouraged humankind to feel more united on an\nunprotected Earth. It is likely that no one would have tried\nto rule the world if it were a single voting district.\nThe United Nations, empowered by its 185 Member\nStates with a clear understanding of its responsibility, is\nwisely and competently leading us to the new millennium.\nMy country is going forward consciously and confidently\nunder the United Nations banner with a hope for a better\nfuture.\n"

        "file_text": "Permit me, first of all,\nto congratulate Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral on his\nelection to the presidency of the current session of the\nGeneral Assembly. Indeed, as we commemorate 50 years\nof the existence of our Organization, his unanimous\nelection to preside over this Assembly is a fitting tribute\nto his country and an eloquent testimony to his personal\nexperience and skills as a seasoned diplomat. I therefore\nwant to assure him of my delegation\u2019s fullest cooperation\nas he directs and guides our deliberations on this historic\noccasion, and to wish him every success in that\nendeavour.\nTo his immediate predecessor, and our esteemed\nBrother, His Excellency Mr. Amara Essy of\nC\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, I convey my delegation\u2019s gratitude and\nappreciation for the exemplary manner in which he\nconducted the affairs of the forty-ninth session of the\nGeneral Assembly.\nI would also like to thank our eminent Secretary-\nGeneral, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for his bold\ninitiatives and his firm guidance of the work of the\nOrganization.\nThe world has come a long way from 26 June 1945,\nwhen 50 States appended their signatures to the Charter\ndocument, creating this enduring body. In spite of the\nundoubted advancement of science and technology, and\nindeed the enormous strides made by the Organization\nduring the past 50 years, the world continues, alas, to be\ngripped by the same age-old problems of poverty,\n\n\ndisarmament, maintenance of peace and security,\ndevelopment and many more.\nCertainly, on the economic front there is no cause for\ncomfort or complacency. Most developing countries,\nespecially the least developed, continue to be strangled by\nnegative economic trends, stagnating resource flows,\nseemingly unstoppable reductions in export earnings, rising\nunemployment and, above all, the phenomenal increase in\nthe number of people living in absolute poverty, occasioned\nlargely by wars, famine, drought and the heavy burden of\nforeign debts.\nThe debt burden, in particular, continues to be\nexcessive and harmful to the sustainable development of\ndeveloping countries, especially the least developed among\nthem. In this connection, the initiative of the British\nChancellor of the Exchequer earlier this year to put in place\nmeasures to help reduce the stock of multilateral debt of the\nmost indebted developing nations is a step in the right\ndirection. Nevertheless, we continue to hold the view that\nunless the debt issue is seriously addressed by the\ninternational community, no meaningful progress for the\nnext 50 years can be accomplished in the foreseeable future\nby the developing countries, especially the least developed\namong them.\nWe believe that a permanent and definitive\ncomprehensive solution to the debt problem must be found\nwithout further delay. That is why we commend the current\nChairman of the Non-Aligned Movement, His Excellency\nPresident Soeharto of Indonesia, for his initiative in\nconvening in August last year a Ministerial Meeting of\nNon-Aligned Countries on the subject of debt and\ndevelopment with the theme \u201cSharing of Experiences\u201d, at\nwhich a number of general principles for debt reduction\nwere adopted, marking significant progress in the search for\na lasting solution to this nagging problem.\nWe continue to appeal to the international community,\nparticularly to the international financial institutions, to give\nthose modest recommendations serious consideration in the\nformulation of policies and actions on the debt issue.\nThe persistence of these problems has undermined\npolitical stability and threatened regional and international\npeace and security. Determined as we in the developing\ncountries have been to improve the lot of our people and to\nredress the economic plight facing our various countries, we\nstill labour under excruciating circumstances. It is now\nabundantly clear that the developing countries cannot go it\nalone. We need the involvement of other, dependable,\npartners, particularly among the developed countries and\nthe major international financial institutions. Additional\nresources at multilateral and bilateral levels are essential\nfrom these partners to achieve rapid improvement in the\nlives of the millions of our affected people.\nAs for Sierra Leone, since April 1992, when the\nNational Provisional Ruling Council took over the reins\nof government, we have set for ourselves the task of\nimplementing anti-poverty programmes and socio-\neconomic reforms, including deregulation of prices,\nexchange control and interest rates, and the reduction of\nfiscal deficit.\nDespite the limited scope of the success attained so\nfar, we are determined not to relent in our efforts to cater\nfor the special needs of the most vulnerable groups in\nsociety.\nCalling upon the international community to pay\nspecial attention to the problems of developing countries\nby providing them with financial and technical support\nshould not be considered as an appeal simply for charity\nbut rather an investment in the future development and\nwell-being of mankind. Indeed, we realize that the key to\nsustainable development in any State is in the hands of its\ncitizenry. Developing countries are now very much aware\nof this and are taking responsibility for working towards\nimproving the lot of the peoples of their respective\ncountries.\nIndeed, during the 50 years of its existence, the\nUnited Nations has also been studying ways and means of\nimproving the economies of the developing countries of\nthe world. None the less, as our export prices have been\non the decline, our economic plans have remained\nunfulfilled and the rate of growth of our gross domestic\nproduct, which was never fast, is in great danger of\nslowing down to a complete standstill. The technical\nassistance schemes which have been formulated to study\nthe problem are numerous. My delegation firmly believes\nthat the time has now come for positive action that would\nlead to the eradication of the largely known causes of\neconomic stagnation, particularly in Africa. We call for a\nspeedy implementation of the United Nations New\nAgenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s as\nwell as for the consolidation of efforts towards the\ndiversification of the African economies.\nIn a world of growing interdependence, the\nliberalization of trade, the globalization of the economy\nand increasing regional integration, sustainable\n2\n\n\ndevelopment and the eradication of poverty cannot be\nensured in the absence of peace and stability. \u201cAn Agenda\nfor Peace\u201d and \u201cAn Agenda for Development\u201d not only\nshow that peace and development are inseparable and\nindivisible but rather that they contain the essential\ningredients of a new vision of our one world. No\ndevelopment is possible anywhere, save in an environment\nthat is peaceful, stable and secure. This holds true for\nnational development, as it does for regional and\ninternational cooperation. That is why we in Sierra Leone\nhave always believed that peace at home is incomplete\nunless our neighbours enjoy peace too. Today, more than\never before, we should all be aware that we are our\nbrother\u2019s keeper and that we can no longer afford to be\nindifferent to developments in any part of the globe.\nThree years ago, my Head of State, Captain Valentine\nE. M. Strasser, acquainted this body with the devastation\nvisited on Sierra Leone initially as a spillover from the civil\nwar in Liberia. He explained to this Assembly the pain and\nthe agony that our people have had to endure as a result of\nthat conflict and its ramifications for regional peace and\nstability.\nRegrettably, I am again constrained to inform you that\nthe conflict has persisted and that the lives of many\ninnocent Sierra Leoneans continue to be lost. In spite of my\nGovernment\u2019s repeated overtures for peace and\nreconciliation there is as yet no let-up in the fighting on the\nground and the rebel attacks against innocent and\nunsuspecting civilians in provincial cities and several towns\nand villages in the country continue unabated.\nConsequently, we are witnessing today the internal\ndisplacement of hundreds of thousands of our people and\nthousands more have had to seek refugee status in\nneighbouring countries, not to mention the devastation\ncaused to the national economy.\nWhat all this means is that the Liberian situation is\ninextricably linked with the situation in Sierra Leone. It is\ntherefore our ardent hope that with the budding peace in\nLiberia, Sierra Leoneans can realistically expect a lull in the\nfighting on their own soil to enable them embark on\neconomic reconstruction and rehabilitation. We would, in\nthis regard, like to express our profound thanks and\nappreciation to the West African leaders who have made\nthe success achieved in Liberia possible. The leadership of\nNigeria, Ghana and the countries contributing to the\nMonitoring Group (ECOMOG) of the Economic\nCommunity of West African States (ECOWAS) deserve\nspecial commendation. So do the United Nations and the\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU), organizations which\nin their own diverse ways, have contributed to the\npeaceful developments in Liberia.\nWe therefore call upon this Organization and all\npeace-loving people the world over to support the new\ngovernment in Liberia. At the same time, we would\nfervently appeal to the Liberian people to rise to the\noccasion, for in the final analysis, it must be Liberians\nthemselves who should find a lasting solution to their\nproblems. We wish the New Liberian Council of State\nand the people of Liberia success in their search for\ndurable peace in their country, for we believe that such\nsuccess will have a positive impact on Sierra Leone.\nThe need to strengthen the peace momentum in\nLiberia is particularly important because during the\ndisarmament process there are going to be thousands of\nhardened former combatants, some of them probably still\narmed, who might be tempted to relocate the theatre of\nwar unless they are effectively disarmed, brought under\ncontrol and suitably reintegrated into Liberian society.\nClosely linked to the search for peace in Sierra\nLeone is the implementation of the programme of\ndemocratization announced by my Head of State, His\nExcellency Captain Valentine E. M. Strasser, three years\nago for the return of Sierra Leone to multiparty civilian\nrule. I am happy to report that this programme is still on\ncourse, despite the unavoidable delays resulting from the\nrebel war. The ban on political parties has now been\nlifted and indeed the registration of political parties\ncompleted. A National Consultative Conference convened\nby the Interim National Electoral Commission was held\nin mid-August to seek national consensus on how\nelections could be conducted in a war situation and to\ndiscuss some other related issues. At that Conference, it\nwas agreed that both presidential and parliamentary\nelections will be held not later than in February 1996. The\nRevolutionary United Front, the rebel faction, was invited\nto participate in that political process, but unfortunately,\ntheir response, as has consistently been the case, was\nnegative. Yet, in spite of this, we continue to persist in\npursuing peace and continue to state clearly that the peace\noption is still on the table. Be that as it may, I should also\nstate that as a responsible Government, we cannot give up\nthe armed struggle, if only out of the sense of legitimate\nobligation to protect the lives and properties of innocent\nSierra Leoneans, who have borne a large measure of the\nbrunt of our senseless rebel war.\nAt this juncture, my delegation would like to express\nits appreciation to this Organization, to the OAU and to\n3\n\n\nthe Commonwealth for responding positively to our request\nfor help by way of exploratory fact-finding missions to\nSierra Leone. In the case of the United Nations, the\nSecretary-General subsequently sent a resident Special\nEnvoy in the person of Ambassador Berhanu Dinka, who\nis still in the country offering assistance. It is an\nencouraging sign that the international community, through\nthe United Nations, the OAU and the Commonwealth, is\njust as anxious as the National Provisional Ruling Council\nGovernment to see an early end to our destructive war so\nthat our peaceful citizens may once again be able to live in\nan environment free of fear and anxiety and to engage in\ntheir ordinary daily pursuits. At the same time, while\nappealing to the international community to help us with\nlogistical, financial and related support in the\nimplementation of our political programme, we will also\nrequire similar assistance, at the appropriate time, in\nrebuilding and rehabilitating our devastated economy. In\nthis connection, we would like to express our deep and\nsincere appreciation to all friendly Governments,\nparticularly Nigeria, Guinea and Ghana for their assistance\nin our trying moments.\nThe world-wide problem of refugees and displaced\npersons continues to be our concern, particularly as we\nourselves have become victims of this scourge. More than\nhalf a million of our citizens have become displaced in\nSierra Leone, and hundreds of thousands more are refugees\nin neighbouring countries. The yearning of all these people\nis for an opportunity to finally return to their homes, settle\ndown and rebuild their lives. We urge the international\ncommunity to urgently help us bring our people back home.\nThe use of narcotic drugs has for some time now been\na source of concern, mainly to developing countries,\nbecause of the inherent danger it poses to society,\nespecially the young. Today, no country can claim to be\ninsulated from this scourge, as it is now a global\nphenomenon. The abuse of drugs and drug-related\nsubstances is gaining in prominence, not only in Sierra\nLeone, but in the whole West African subregion, and there\nis no doubt that with the prevalence of rebel wars it will\ncontinue to plague us long after these wars are over,\nthereby threatening social peace and stability in the\ncountries concerned.\nThe Government of Sierra Leone is determined to take\nall necessary measures against drug abuse and illicit\ntrafficking domestically, as well as through subregional and\ninternational cooperation. To this end, my Government has\nratified the 1961, 1971 and 1988 Conventions dealing with\nillicit drug abuse and illicit drug trafficking, and has set up\nboth inter-ministerial and technical committees comprising\nall relevant sectoral departments to advise the\nGovernment on effective measures to contain drug abuse\nand other related ills.\nNo one can deny that the threat of global nuclear\ndestruction posed by the cold war has receded. However,\nit is becoming increasingly clear to us that where one\ntype of peril has been combated others are swiftly arising\nto take its place. Today, the breakdown of bipolar control\nhas lifted restrictions on long- simmering civic, ethnic and\nterritorial disputes. Violence has brought the very\nexistence of some States into question and, with it, gross\nviolations of human rights, including instances of\ngenocide exceeded only, perhaps, by those of the Second\nWorld War. Conflicts are becoming more numerous and\nmore complex, and are scattered all over the globe, even\nas there are glimmers of hope.\nIn Africa, for example, we welcome the recent\ndevelopments whereby both parties in the Angolan\nconflict are moving towards allowing the will of the\nAngolan people finally to prevail over the barrel of the\ngun. My delegation also notes with satisfaction the\nagreement by UNITA to join with the MPLA in a\ngovernment of national unity. In like manner, the\nacceptance by the Mozambican opposition leader,\nComrade Afonso Dhlakama, and his men of the outcome\nof the electoral process should be a source of relief to all\nAfricans and peace-loving people everywhere. It is our\nfervent hope that the Mozambicans will emulate the\nexample of their neighbours in Zimbabwe, South Africa\nand Namibia \u2014 societies which have shown that, with the\nright political attitude and good will, it is quite possible\nto replace strife with reconciliation and hatred with\naccommodation.\nIn the Middle East, we view the developments that\nstarted a few years ago with the mutual recognition of the\nPLO and Israel, followed later by the signing of the\nWashington Declaration between Jordan and Israel, which\nended the state of war between them, as extremely\nimportant positive steps towards the full realization of\npeace in that region. In like manner, we welcome the just-\nconcluded Interim Agreement on Jericho and the West\nBank, signed by Israel and the PLO in Washington.\nIn the same vein, we commend Norway, the United\nStates, Egypt and all those others that in one way or the\nother have played, and are continuing to play, a role in\nmoving this historic conflict towards a peaceful\nresolution.\n4\n\n\nOn the other aspect of the Middle Eastern equation,\nwe urge Israel, Syria and Lebanon to join fully in the\nhistoric peace process and display a spirit of\naccommodation, in the interest of all the people of the\nMiddle East and mankind as a whole.\nWith regard to the dispute between Kuwait and Iraq,\nwe call upon Iraq fully to respect the sovereignty and\nterritorial integrity of Kuwait, in accordance with the terms\nof the relevant resolutions of the Security Council.\nHowever, we call upon the international community, in\napplying sanctions against Iraq, not to lose sight of the\nsuffering being experienced by the innocent civilians of that\ncountry.\nMy delegation welcomes the decision to extend\nindefinitely the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\nWeapons (NPT), a decision which my country co-\nsponsored. It was indeed a decision of momentous\nimportance, which heralded what has been described as a\nmajor success of the United Nations in the field of\ndisarmament. However, we are disappointed that indications\nsince the extension are that final agreement on an\nimmediate and comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty seems\nuncertain. If humanity is to maintain any lasting hope for\nthe future, we must act now with courage and decisiveness\nto achieve a nuclear-free world. In this regard, we call\nunequivocally for the cessation of nuclear tests of any kind\nin all environments, and call upon the Conference on\nDisarmament to work towards the speedy conclusion of a\ncomprehensive test-ban treaty within the shortest possible\ntime.\nInternational peace can hardly be maintained in a\nworld in which some men are free while others are under\nthe yoke of colonialism. Being fully aware of that problem\nand imbued with the idealism that brought this Organization\ninto being, Member States solemnly resolved to remove any\nvestiges of colonialism from the world. This line of\nthinking achieved full stature at the United Nations in 1960,\nwhen the landmark resolution 1514 (XV), incorporating the\nDeclaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial\nCountries and Peoples, was adopted.\nToday, as the world celebrates the fiftieth anniversary\nof our Organization, its considerable success in the field of\ndecolonization is universally acclaimed. We remember the\nhistory of the struggle against colonialism and pay tribute\nto all those who were part of that struggle. We remain\nmindful of the sacrifices that made it possible for hundreds\nof millions of people to achieve self-determination and\nindependence. We commend the work of the Special\nCommittee of 24 for its effective contribution to the\napplication of the Declaration on the Granting of\nIndependence to Colonial Countries and Peoples. My\ncountry has had the honour of serving that Committee \u2014\nit is, in fact, currently chairing it \u2014 and we are proud to\nhave been able to make some contribution to its work and\nto bringing freedom to a good portion of the human race.\nIn that regard, while we welcome with profound\npleasure the State of Palau to this world Organization as\nthe 185th Member, it is my delegation\u2019s view that the\ntask of decolonization remains unfinished. Further\nconcerted and determined action is still required on the\npart of all involved to win freedom for people who are\nstill unable to exercise their right to self-determination \u2014\nmostly peoples of small island States, located mainly in\nthe Pacific and Caribbean regions. These territories are\nconfronted with unique problems that require new and\ninnovative solutions geared towards the implementation of\nthe International Decade for the Eradication of\nColonialism by the Year 2000, launched by the General\nAssembly in 1988.\nWe believe that the situation of these Territories\nshould not be seen as an impediment to the application of\nthe principle of self-determination. The wishes of the\npeople of the Non-Self-Governing Territories are what\ncount most. We appeal for the strengthened and continued\nsupport of the administering Powers, whose cooperation\nwith the Special Committee is essential for the progress\nof the Territories towards self-determination. We count on\nthe support of the specialized agencies and the\ninternational community as a whole to continue to assist\nthe Non-Self-Governing Territories in enhancing their\nstandard of living and promoting their self-sufficiency.\nWe also truly believe that our combined and unrelenting\nefforts will ensure the fulfilment of the promise of\nfreedom, lasting peace, sustained growth and sustainable\ndevelopment for all the people of our planet in\naccordance with the purposes and principles of the United\nNations.\nMy delegation welcomes the successful outcome of\nthe Conference on the Environment and Development in\n1992, the World Conference on Human Rights in 1993,\nthe International Conference on Population and\nDevelopment in 1994, the World Summit for Social\nDevelopment convened in Copenhagen in 1995 and the\nrecently concluded United Nations Fourth World\nConference on Women in Beijing. Referring to the\nBeijing Conference, we note with satisfaction that the\nhistory of the United Nations for the past 50 years has\n5\n\n\nalso been one of steady progress for women, from a drive\nfor their civil and political rights to their recognition as\nequal partners in the broader societal context.\nWe appeal for the urgent implementation of the\nrecommendations, conclusions and decisions adopted in\nthese various international Conferences. We believe that in\ntheir realization partly lies the possibility of lasting peace\nand security, economic progress and social emancipation for\nall humankind.\nWe note with satisfaction the positive role played by\nour Organization in facilitating international agreement on\nthorny issues, whose resolution would certainly have been\nmore difficult, if not impossible, in other forums. In this\nconnection, my delegation welcomes the new Agreements\nsigned at Marrakesh in April last year, establishing the\nWorld Trade Organization. However, we stress the need for\na continuous assessment of its likely impact on developing\ncountries, especially the least developed among them. We\nfear that countries which are net importers of food, such as\nSierra Leone, might face the prospect of higher food import\nbills arising from the liberalization of trade in the\nagricultural sector. Other areas in the Agreements which\nopen up competition between developed and developing\ncountries also need to be constantly reviewed to ensure that\nthe latter do not suffer unduly.\nSince the end of the cold war, it has become\nincreasingly clear that the United Nations is finding it\ndifficult to deal with the challenges of the post-cold-war\nera. As we enter the next millennium, we believe it should\nbe a strong, revitalized, effective and purposeful United\nNations, able to play its full role as envisaged in its\nCharter.\nWith democracy taking root among nations, logic and\ncommon sense dictate that decisions of the United Nations\nshould also carry the necessary imprint of the collective\nwill of its Members. Indeed, the Security Council, which is\ncharged with the primary responsibility for the maintenance\nof international peace and security, should be perceived as\nlegitimate in its decision-making process. My delegation\ntakes the view that a more efficient, transparent and\ndemocratic Security Council, embracing the views of a\nwider sector of the international community, could stand it\nin good stead to deal with the challenges of the next\nmillennium \u2014 challenges which touch humanity generally,\nrather than individual States which often lack the capacity\nand the ability to handle them successfully. Such challenges\ninclude the problem of drugs, devastating diseases like\nacquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), money\nlaundering, poverty and many more yet unknown. We\nsincerely hope that the final outcome of the work of the\nOpen-ended Working Group on institutional reforms will\nadequately address these concerns and offer appropriately\nbold suggestions and solutions.\nThe relevance of the United Nations after 50 years\nas an instrument for the peaceful existence and orderly\ndevelopment of every nation no longer requires\njustification. We commend the Secretary-General and the\nSecretariat for initiating a restructuring process which will\nultimately ensure the enhanced viability and efficiency of\nour Organization. We also pay tribute to all their\npredecessors whose own efforts contributed to the\nsurvival of the Organization. Member States owe it to\nposterity to adopt a firm commitment to the provisions of\nthe Charter and not to undermine the credibility of our\ncommon Organization. We renew our call for all Member\nStates to be resolute and uncompromising in the quest for\nglobal peace, security and social and economic justice as\nwe move into the twenty-first century. Let me, in\nconclusion, reaffirm my country\u2019s commitment to the\nUnited Nations Charter and dedication to the principles\nwhich undergird our Organization.\n"

        "file_text": "Fifty years ago, learning the lessons of two world wars,\nwhich in the space of one human generation had brought\nunspeakable suffering to mankind, people of good will,\ndedicated to peace and justice and determined to preserve\nfuture generations from such horrors, founded the United\nNations. To ensure peace, justice and equality; to promote\ncollective security and peaceful coexistence; to encourage\neconomic and social progress for nations and peoples\nthrough international cooperation; to develop and promote\nrespect for the rights of man and of peoples, in greater\nfreedom and without discrimination: these, inter alia, were\nthe main objectives of the founders of the United Nations.\nWhat lofty goals! And now the time has come when\nwe have an opportunity to review what our common\nOrganization has achieved. This is a difficult but uplifting\ntask, and the big question is whether the objectives have\nbeen attained.\nBefore going any further, however, Sir, on behalf of\nthe President of the Togolese Republic, His Excellency\nGeneral Gnassingb\u00e9 Eyadema, and the Government and\npeople of Togo, and on my own behalf, I extend our\nwarmest congratulations on your magnificent election to\nthe important post of President of the General Assembly\nat its fiftieth session. The community of the United\nNations, in unanimously choosing you to lead our work\nat this historic session, pays tribute to you and to your\nqualities as an experienced diplomat and also pays a well-\ndeserved tribute to your beautiful country, Portugal, with\nwhich Togo is proud of having excellent and fruitful\nrelations of friendship and cooperation.\nWe also congratulate the other members of the\nGeneral Committee. In our view, their experience and\nyour mastery of international affairs augur well for the\nsuccess of our work. We assure you of the full\ncooperation of the Togolese delegation to that end.\nI should also like to extend the Togolese\nGovernment\u2019s greatest appreciation to your distinguished\npredecessor, His Excellency Mr. Amara Essy, Minister for\nForeign Affairs of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, who presided so adroitly\nand competently over the work of the forty-ninth session\nof the General Assembly. This honour done to his country\nand also to Africa is particularly encouraging. I should\nlike to say once again how sincerely we admire him.\n\nI am also pleased to extend our warmest\ncongratulations to His Excellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-\nGhali, Secretary-General of the United Nations, for his\ntireless and unending efforts to ensure that the United\nNations continues to flourish and to preserve peace and\nsecurity in the world.\nThis session is an event in itself, coinciding as it\ndoes with the celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of the\nfounding of the United Nations. A half century has\npassed, and the various events that have marked the life\nof the Organization have altered neither the purposes nor\nthe principles of its Charter, which must preserve all its\nvitality and continue to be the legal and moral basis for\npresent-day international relations.\nMy delegation would like to pay a tribute to all\nthose whose imagination, creative spirit and intelligence\nled to the drafting of the provisions of the 111 Articles of\nthe Charter. Their knowledge and ability helped to\npreserve the world from a third world war, which, in this\nage of increasingly devastating nuclear weapons, would\nhave been fatal to the entire world, including the owners\nof the weapons.\n14\n\n\nIn its daily search to ensure the wellbeing of peoples,\nthe Organization has adopted and implemented strategies to\nrespond to world concerns. In this connection, the Agenda\nfor Peace and the forthcoming Agenda for Development\nbear witness to the United Nations resolve to realize its\nnoble ideals.\nMy delegation believes that the fiftieth session should\ngive serious consideration to the ways to work out the new\napproaches that are needed if the Organization is to go\nforward on solid and increasingly coherent bases in its\nsearch for viable and lasting solutions to problems of peace,\nsecurity and development that pose a daily challenge to the\ninternational community. What is important at this session\nis the lessons we can learn from United Nations activities\nover the past 50 years that will help us to deal with the\nenormous challenges the third millennium will bring us.\nThe aspirations of peoples to participate even more\nactively in the management of world affairs is evident in\nevery country. My country, like so many others on the\nAfrican continent, has been buffeted by the winds of\nfreedom and democracy. After more than three turbulent\nyears fraught with misunderstandings among our national\npolitical figures concerning the stakes involved in\ndemocratization, Togo has now completed its transitional\nperiod towards democracy and the multiparty system. This\nsession affords me an opportunity to say that Togo has\nregained its stability and its customary peace and quiet and\nthat our Government is now actively working to strengthen\nthe bases for a State of law.\nEager to promote national unity, the Togolese\nauthorities are continuing to take all possible steps to\nestablish a climate of peace, fraternity and concord. At their\ninitiative, on 14 December 1994 the National Assembly\nadopted a law of general amnesty for those responsible for\nthe acts of aggression of 25 March 1993 and 5 and 6\nJanuary 1994.\nToday, peace and order have been restored, for the\npeople of Togo have been able to surmount their opposing\nviews and achieve reconciliation. They have understood that\ndemocratization is a long-term undertaking, one that must\nbe based on the historical, social and cultural realities of a\ncountry if it is to be effective and promote political\nstability, economic development and social justice.\nToday, the collective effort to restore our national\neconomy is continuing without interruption and all the\npeople of Togo are determined to give of their best in the\nrebuilding of what they hold most dear, their homeland\nTogo, in order to restore its reputation and ensure its\nactive participation in the concert of nations.\nGiven the still fragile nature of our economy, and in\norder to ensure the strengthening of democracy, political\nstability and social unity, Togo calls upon the\ninternational community to give its strong support to the\nefforts our Government is undertaking to achieve the\ncountry\u2019s total recovery.\nAs I said earlier, the founding of the United Nations\nwas a response to the yearning of the peoples of the\nworld to live in peace, which is a prerequisite for\nprogress. Today, however, there is still a long road to\ntravel in the attainment of that peace, the principal goal\nof the United Nations, for the world is still experiencing\nhorrible upheavals and intolerance that daily threaten the\nhope of our peoples to live in a peaceful and secure\nworld.\nIndeed, uncertainty, anxiety and despair still haunt\nthousands of people, principally because of continuing\nfratricidal conflicts and poverty. Rivalry among\nneighbours, fanaticism and ethnic tensions continue\ninexorably to stoke the fires of discord and create armed\nconflicts, with all their accompanying horrors.\nIn Africa, the conflicts in Liberia, Sierra Leone and\nSomalia and the situations in Rwanda, Burundi and\nAngola continue to present challenges to the international\ncommunity and to call into question its ability effectively\nto ensure international peace and security.\nWith regard to the conflict in Liberia, which is now\nbeing resolved, my country welcomes the signing of a\nnew Agreement on 19 August 1995 in Abuja under the\naegis of the Economic Community of West African States\n(ECOWAS), and the installation of the State Council and\nTransitional Government pursuant to that Agreement.\nTogo calls upon its brothers in Liberia to shoulder\ntheir responsibilities to ensure the sincere and full\nimplementation of that Agreement. We urge them to do\nall they can to guarantee the cease-fire, support the new\ntransition institutions and contribute in good faith to\ndisarmament with a view to establishing an environment\nfavourable to the organization of the general open\nelections called for in the Agreement.\nWhile the international community is witnessing a\nnascent improvement of the situation in Liberia, the war\nwaged in neighbouring Sierra Leone by the Revolutionary\n15\n\n\nUnited Front (RUF) is continuing, with all its\naccompanying misery.\nMy delegation would remind our brothers in Sierra\nLeone that experience continues to prove the weapons do\nnot provide lasting solutions to any problem, no matter\nwhat.\nTurning to Somalia, my delegation deeply regrets that\nno appreciable progress has been made since the last\nsession. Unfortunately, we are forced to state that despite\nthe relative calm there, Somalia has become a country\nwhere national reconciliation and the establishment of a\nGovernment based on broad consensus are still hypothetical\nowing to fluctuating allegiances among the clans. That\nsituation continues to contribute to the eruption of violence\nand hinders the advent of peace to that country.\nMy Government therefore urgently appeals once again\nto our brothers in Somalia to enter into a true and solid\nprocess of national reconciliation, the sole way to ensure\nviable peace and establish a Somali State that the\ninternational community would regard as representative.\nIn Rwanda, the situation following last year\u2019s\nmassacres is still disturbing owing to the insecurity and\nintolerance that make peace and stability fragile, jeopardize\nthe return of refugees and threaten to embroil the entire\nsubregion. Given the climate there it is imperative for the\nRwandese Government to persevere on the courageous path\nof national reconciliation so that the country may regain its\nunity and the political stability essential to its\nreconstruction.\nThe international community must also commit itself\nto lending real assistance to Rwanda\u2019s efforts to establish\nbetter conditions that will encourage the repatriation of\nrefugees to their country of origin.\nIn the neighbouring country of Burundi the no-war,\nno-peace situation is still a matter of concern to my\ncountry. Those involved in Burundi\u2019s political life must\nrenounce all acts of violence of any kind and demonstrate\nwisdom and mutual acceptance in seeking solutions to the\nproblems facing them.\nIn the same spirit, my delegation urgently appeals to\nall the children of Burundi to adhere fully to the Agreement\nof Government signed on 10 September 1994 and to do\neverything they can to implement that Agreement in the\ninterests of peace and the people of Burundi. We believe\nthat they must also try to accept the initiatives of the\nCentral Conflict Prevention, Handling Management and\nSettlement Mechanism of the Organization of African\nUnity (OAU), which is attempting to organize a round-\ntable meeting of the parties involved in the Burundi crisis.\nHere too, the international community must continue\nto support Burundi so as to enable it to find peace as\nsoon as possible and to continue its development.\nTurning to the situation in Angola, the Togolese\nGovernment welcomes the resumption of the dialogue\nbetween President Jos\u00e9 Eduardo Dos Santos and the\nleader of UNITA, Mr. Jonas Savimbi. We noted with\ngreat satisfaction the positive evolution of the peace\nprocess under way as a result of the Lusaka peace\nagreement. We welcome the two meetings that took place\nthis year, and we see in them the firm resolve of our\nAngolan brothers to overcome their differences and set\nabout the irreversible creation of an atmosphere of\nunderstanding which alone can foster peace and national\nharmony.\nMy delegation greatly appreciates the active role that\nthe United Nations continues to play in the resolution of\nthat conflict, and we would call on the Secretary-General\nto speed up the deployment of the forces to be made\navailable to the United Nations Angola Verification\nMission (UNAVEM III).\nIn Europe, despite diplomatic efforts to find a\ndefinitive settlement of the conflict in the former\nYugoslavia, the situation there remains a source of\nprofound concern to all peace-loving countries.\nMy Government notes with regret that, in spite of\nmany measures taken by the United Nations, the state of\nwar in that part of Europe persists, continuing to claim\ncountless victims and give rise to flows of refugees and\ndisplaced persons. Togo believes that the international\ncommunity must become more deeply involved in order\nto stem, if not halt, the tide of massive destruction\nadvancing before our eyes.\nIn the view of my delegation, it is time for the Serb,\nCroat and Bosniac leaders to give up the idea of acquiring\nterritory by force and to seek a definitive solution to the\nconflict through negotiations, with a view to ensuring an\nirreversible, comprehensive and just solution that would\nguarantee sovereignty and territorial integrity to all the\nStates of the former Yugoslavia within internationally\nrecognized borders.\n16\n\n\nThe recent positive developments in the Middle East,\nmarked essentially by the adoption of a timetable for the\nsecond phase of the withdrawal of Israeli troops from\nPalestinian cities and the transfer of new powers to the\nPalestinian Authority, give my delegation grounds for\nsatisfaction. We regard these recently concluded agreements\nas a great achievement, a decisive step towards the\nestablishment of a Palestinian State.\nTogo congratulates the Israeli Government and the\nPalestinian Authority for the courage, commitment and\ninitiative they have shown in implementing the Declaration\nof Principles and the subsequent agreements despite the\nmany dangers that beset the path to peace. We urge them\nto continue the quest for a settlement of the question of\nPalestine through negotiations, the path they have chosen,\nsince true and lasting peace unquestionably involves\ndialogue.\nWe would appeal to the good will of the international\ncommunity to live up to its commitments by providing the\nPalestinian Authority with the necessary economic and\nsocial assistance for the development of Gaza and Jericho.\nWith regard to the Golan, my delegation would urge\nIsrael and Syria to demonstrate far-sightedness, good will\nand mutual understanding so as to arrive as quickly as\npossible at an agreement that could bring a just and lasting\npeace to the Middle East region.\nTurning to Asia, Togo welcomes the establishment at\nvarious levels of dialogue aimed at peaceful coexistence,\nand trusts that this political will be maintained.\nThese various hotbeds of tension, which jeopardize the\nexistence of mankind and which my delegation has just\nbriefly described, are a challenge to our collective\nconscience and, first and foremost, to the United Nations,\nthe only world structure that can ensure universal peace and\nsecurity.\nOn the eve of the second half of its first century, it\nbehoves our Organization to mobilize to combat the evils\nafflicting the world and that make it vulnerable. That task\nmust be one of our highest priorities if we want to leave to\nfuture generations a healthy world based on respect for\nhuman dignity, love and justice.\nTo attain this prime objective, which is to prevent\nconflicts from erupting or from continuing indefinitely,\nprevention must increasingly feature in the forefront of the\nmeasures taken by our Organization in favour of peace, for\nit is always better to prevent war than to try to end it.\nThis justifies the great importance we attach to preventive\ndiplomacy.\nMy delegation believes that the various peace-\nkeeping operations being conducted in countries riven by\nconflict must be accompanied and supported by the\nparallel and systematic establishment of mechanisms for\na peaceful settlement. The measures provided for in\nChapter VI of the Charter must be increasingly employed\nto this end. \u201cAn Agenda for Peace\u201d can achieve its full\nimport only if the United Nations, in its quest for peace,\nresorts to diplomatic procedures as a means of settling\ndisputes.\nThe objectives of peace and security that we seek\nmust necessarily also involve curbing the proliferation of\nweapons of all kinds.\nGeneral and complete disarmament is and has for\nmany years been one of the main objectives of the United\nNations, whose attainment would bring peace, stability\nand well-being for all. The energy with which we pursue\nthis goal must be maintained and, indeed, increased, if the\nhopes of mankind to avoid a new holocaust are to be\nfulfilled.\nTo that end, my delegation believes that we must\ncontinue to encourage a tangible reduction in the nuclear\nthreat, the elimination of special fissile materials and the\nconversion of nuclear installations for solely peaceful\npurposes.\nAll these overarching tasks require the unconditional\nsupport of all States, and particularly nuclear-weapon\nStates, so that we can use the resources made available\nthrough disarmament for development.\nConvinced of the need to free our continent from\nnuclear weapons, the African countries have concluded\ntheir consideration of the text of the Pelindaba treaty that\nwould establish Africa as a nuclear-weapon-free zone.\nThis instrument, prepared pursuant to the relevant\nDeclaration of the Heads of State and Government of the\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU), will soon be\nsigned in Egypt. My country welcomes this development\nas opening the way for the denuclearization of Africa, and\ncontributing to the international trend towards non-\nproliferation. My delegation sees in the recent indefinite\nextension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\nNuclear Weapons (NPT) and in the negotiations now\nunder way in the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva,\n17\n\n\nthe resolve of the international community to achieve\nnuclear non-proliferation and to eliminate other types of\nweapons of mass destruction.\nWith regard to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\nNuclear Weapons in particular, Togo believes that its\nindefinite extension is not an end in itself. We have to do\neverything possible to ensure that it responds to the\naspirations of all the parties.\nIn general terms, Togo proclaims its deep commitment\nto the various measures advocated by the United Nations\nfor the control of conventional weapons at the regional and\nsubregional levels. We continue to support all initiatives\nthat can facilitate disarmament and arms limitation, for all\nthese measures can help to maintain international peace and\nsecurity.\nWithin the context of the items relating to\ndisarmament, my delegation would recall the urgent need\nto strengthen the capacity of the United Nations Regional\nCentres for Peace and Disarmament. Designed to promote\npeace and disarmament in various regions, these Centres\nneed financing to function and to carry out their\nprogrammes of activities in order to attain the goals for\nwhich they were established.\nThis is particularly true of the Centre for Africa,\nwhich has its headquarters in my country. I would therefore\nappeal to the good will of all Member States to support this\nCentre by providing it with the help and assistance it needs\nto carry out its activities and to contribute to the\nmaintenance and strengthening of the peace and security\nwhich Africa so sorely needs to ensure its economic and\nsocial development.\nThe Charter which we adopted in 1945 states in its\nPreamble that the peoples of the United Nations are\ndetermined to promote social progress and better standards\nof life in larger freedom. Fifty years later, we must assess\nthe impact of action taken along the way to resolve the\nenormous problems of development.\nIt is clear that serious efforts are made every day to\neliminate poverty, hunger, malnutrition, disease and\nilliteracy. And yet, despite the considerable input of the\nUnited Nations and its specialized agencies, we must note\nthat many peoples, particularly in the developing countries,\nstill live in a state of great deprivation and are exposed to\nall manner of scourges. In other words, the situation in\nthose countries is tragic: more than half a billion human\nbeings live in abject poverty; more than 180 million\nchildren suffer serious malnutrition; and more than 1.5\nbillion individuals have no access to primary health care.\nAll this, as can be imagined, leads to the death of almost\n3 million children every year.\nThis bitter truth is the result of the injustice and\ninequality that characterize international cooperation\nrelations. In the absence of real understanding and\nsolidarity on the part of Member States, the poorest\ncontinue to suffer and the well-off grow ever more\nopulent. Distortions in economic relations between North\nand South do not reflect the spirit of our Charter. For\ndecades now, the developing countries have called for the\nestablishment of a new, more just and equitable\ninternational economic order, but their concerns are not\ntaken duly into account.\nIn this regard, it would not be overstating matters\nto recall that the continued drop in our commodity prices;\nthe sharp deterioration in the terms of trade; the problems\nrelating to access for products from developing countries\nin general, and African countries in particular, to world\nmarkets; and the foreign debt burden are all obstacles that\nmust be removed if we are to accelerate and strengthen\nthe process of sustainable development.\nIt is important therefore that our partners in the\nindustrialized countries should try harder to understand\nour problems in order that they may be better able to\nsupport our efforts. This multifaceted support must seek\nto ensure remunerative prices for our commodities and the\nnecessary technological support for processing these\ncommodities so as to ensure access for our products to\ninternational markets. To that end, the international\ncommunity must provide special assistance to Africa in\norder to build viable, lasting and competitive industrial\nstructures.\nIn this connection, my country would invite all those\ninvolved in development, and particularly industrialized\ncountries anxious about the future of Africa, to give new\nimpetus to the United Nations Industrial Development\nOrganization and the United Nations Conference on Trade\nand Development, two major agencies within the United\nNations system established to promote industrialization\nand the development of trade of the developing countries\nas a whole and particularly in Africa.\nAt a time when the globalization and liberalization\nof the world economy are accelerating as a result of\nrecent agreements made at the Uruguay Round, we should\ncreate new opportunities for cooperation to help African\n18\n\n\ncountries become part of the world trading system and\nbenefit from the advantages it offers for growth. The basic\nway to do so is to help Africa, through the appropriate\ntransfer of technology, to progress like other regions and to\nrespond to new conditions governing access to markets in\norder to become a real actor in the World Trade\nOrganization.\nThe prospects for Africa\u2019s development are not\npromising because the socio-economic situation is so\nprecarious and efforts made to date to step up progress\nhave proven vain. Indeed, Africa is being crippled under\nthe enormous weight of its debt. In 1994, the debt burden\nreached $313 billion and today represents 231.3 per cent of\nits export earnings, or an average of 71.6 per cent of its\ngross domestic product. Moreover, the continuing drop in\nofficial development assistance to African States has put\nAfrica in a very critical economic situation.\nFar from accepting this situation as our fated lot and\naware that we must rely on our own efforts, this year the\nAfrican countries adopted, in Egypt, the Cairo Programme\nof Action, which aims at ensuring the immediate\nrelaunching of Africa\u2019s economic and social development\nthrough political and economic reforms and a global and\ncoherent strategy. My country is ready to assume its share\nof the responsibility in the implementation of that\nProgramme.\nOn the crucial issue of debt, Togo would once again\nappeal to the international community and to the creditors\nin particular to consider cancelling the concessional debt\nrescheduled in the Paris Club. We would urge the adoption\nof innovative measures to reduce the multilateral debt,\nincluding the repurchase of that category of debt with the\nproceeds of the sale of part of the International Monetary\nFund\u2019s gold reserves. In short, this question must be\naddressed on an equitable basis with a view to a lasting\nsolution.\nFurthermore, giving new impetus to development in\nAfrica must include the mobilization of financial resources\nboth through official development assistance and through\nprivate investment. In this regard, my delegation would\ninvite our partners in the developed countries to renew and\nstrengthen their political commitment to support the\nrecovery of the African economy, for economic and\nfinancial stability in Africa will most certainly be in the\ninterests of the world economy.\nTogo duly appreciates the efforts of the United\nNations and the international community over the past 50\nyears to promote economic and socio-cultural\ndevelopment. In particular, we hail the initiatives that led\nto the adoption of the United Nations Programme of\nAction for African Economic Recovery and Development\nand the New Agenda for the Development of Africa in\nthe 1990s, as well as the Paris Declaration and\nProgramme of Action for the Least-Developed Countries\nfor the 1990s.\nIt is none the less regrettable that the implementation\nof these instruments, which were able to take into account\nthe concerns of Africa in various areas of development,\nhas yet to receive the support it deserves for the benefit\nof our continent and the least-developed countries in\nparticular. Thus the economic and social performance\nwhich they should have sparked has not lived up to the\nexpectations of the peoples of Africa.\nIn view of the present state of development in\nAfrica, the international community must make a\nsubstantial contribution towards attaining the objectives\nset forth, not only of the New Agenda for the\nDevelopment of Africa in the 1990s, but also of other\nprogrammes of action. Africa needs to be given specific\nattention commensurate with its problems, first among\nwhich is poverty. Indeed, according to data collected by\nthe United Nations Economic Commission for Africa, the\nnumber of the most needy rose from 105 million in 1985\nto 216 million in 1990 and may reach 304 million by the\nyear 2000.\nThe collective security to which all peoples aspire\nalso depends on finding determined and credible solutions\nto the question of poverty, to which a great portion of the\nworld is subject. Along the same lines, the Bretton Woods\ninstitutions must do more to ensure that structural\nadjustment programmes are politically, socially and\nhumanly feasible for those countries which must\nimplement them. My delegation concurs with the\nproposals for reform of the international financial and\nmonetary system with a view to adapting them to the\nneeds of our day, to make it more equitable and to allow\nit to respond to the true aspirations of peoples.\nIn its search for appropriate solutions to economical\nand social problems, the United Nations was prompted\nthis year to organize the World Summit for Social\nDevelopment in Copenhagen. My country welcomed the\nholding of that Summit, the first in the annals of our\nOrganization to offer such a marvellous opportunity for\ndeep reflection at the highest level on the issues of human\nand social development that are of major importance for\n19\n\n\nmankind. My delegation welcomes the 10-point\ncommitments adopted at the Summit and hopes that in\nimplementing those commitments for the benefit of the\nentire world all our countries will show the fervour that led\nthem to prepare and participate in the Summit.\nThe Fourth World Conference on Women, held just a\nfew days ago in Beijing, is another illustration of our\nOrganization\u2019s determination not to neglect any of the\nobjectives it has set for itself. The Togolese Government,\nwhich values women\u2019s active role in the development\nprocess and accords them rightful pride of place in human\nsociety, will spare no effort to implement the\nrecommendations emanating from that Conference. We urge\nthe international community to shoulder its share of\nresponsibility in the implementation of those\nrecommendations so that women can fully play their role in\nbuilding a peaceful and prosperous world.\nWith regard to the question of the environment, my\ndelegation welcomes the signing in Paris, in October 1994,\nof the international Convention on combating drought and\ndesertification, and we welcome most especially the entry\ninto force of the Convention on Biological Diversity and\nthe Convention on Climate Change. However, we do not\nbelieve that the signing and entry into force of those\nConventions are an end in themselves. In the light of the\nuniversal concern of a few years ago over the extensive\ndegradation of the environment and the enthusiasm aroused\nby the Rio Conference, our countries must take the\nnecessary measures to attain the objectives set forth in\nthose various international legal instruments.\nThis coming 24 October the United Nations will be\ncommemorating its fiftieth anniversary. It has at times been\ndifficult to put into effect the purposes and principles of the\nSan Francisco Charter, and the results achieved have not\nalways lived fully up to our expectations. But with the\nbeginning of this new phase, one could hope that \u2014 on the\nbasis of lessons learned by evaluating the activities of the\npast half-century and on the basis of Member States\u2019\ncapacity to adapt to the ever-shifting realities of the\ninternational context \u2014 our Organization will truly live up\nto its new ambitions.\nAs it is about to enter the second half of its first 100\nyears, the United Nations must preserve its universality and\nconsolidate its vitality, through prudent reform and\nappropriate strengthening of its entire system and its\nprincipal organs, including the Security Council, so that\njustice and equality may triumph.\nThe enormous tasks awaiting our Organization on\nthe eve of the third millennium require that Member\nStates have greater political will so that the objective of\nthe restructuring and democratization process now under\nway can be attained to the satisfaction of all, and so that\nMember States can participate together, on the basis of\nsovereign equality, in managing the affairs of the world.\nThe same political will is needed in order for\ndevelopment assistance to regain priority status, so that\nthe men, women and children of the countries of the\nSouth will enjoy the support that is essential for them to\nprosper.\nIn doing all this, an inestimable contribution will be\nmade to the promotion of human rights and the right to\ndevelopment, which is another way of averting threats to\ndomestic, regional and global peace and security.\nAs for my country, it renews its commitment to the\nnoble ideals of the United Nations, and, as always, it will\ndo its utmost to help build a world of peace and justice\nfor all.\n"

It is\nboth a time for celebration and an opportunity for\nreflection. The Organization has evolved over time and\nhas served us well for half a century. The significant\nincrease in the membership \u2014 from the original 51 to the\npresent 185 \u2014 underscores the continuing relevance of\nthe United Nations.

We wish to see a more efficient and result-\noriented Organization \u2014 one that retains mechanisms\nwhich have proved effective and adopts innovative\nmeasures to ensure cooperation in the post-bloc world.\nSecurity Council reforms constitute one of the most\nimportant issues to be addressed.

To judge from the work done during the\nlast two sessions of the General Assembly by the Open-\nended Working Group on the Question of Equitable\nRepresentation on and Increase in the Membership of the\nSecurity Council, it is clear that there is a convergence of\nviews that the Council should be enlarged. The enlargement\nshould however be accompanied by measures to make it\nmore effective. It should ensure equitable geographical\nrepresentation and at the same time preserve the possibility\nfor smaller States to serve on the Council.\nMyanmar fully supports the position of the\nnon-aligned countries which stresses the importance of\nenhancing the effective and efficient functioning of the\nSecurity Council by adopting measures geared towards\nreforming its working methods and procedures.\nMyanmar welcomes the actions already taken to\nenhance the relationship between the Council and the\ngeneral membership as well as measures to improve its\nworking methods and procedures. We are particularly\npleased to see that the Council has initiated the holding of\norientation debates and briefings by the President of the\nCouncil for States non-members of the Security Council.\nWe see the need to enhance cooperation between the\nSecurity Council and the General Assembly in accordance\nwith Articles 10, 11, 12 and 14 of the Charter. We also\nshare the view that reforms can best be achieved through a\ncombination of means that include General Assembly\nresolutions, changes in the rules of procedure, and\nappropriate amendments to the Charter where necessary.\nAt the same time, the role of the General Assembly \u2014\nthe one forum where all the Member States are\nrepresented \u2014 should be reviewed to enable it to deal more\neffectively with outstanding problems and to allow it to\nfocus on the new challenges of our times.\nWe consider it vital that there be a more dynamic\nrelationship between the main organs of the\nOrganization \u2014 the General Assembly, the Security\nCouncil and the Economic and Social Council.\nIn recent years the United Nations, despite constraints,\nhas been in the forefront of the international community\u2019s\nefforts to deal with the unresolved problems of the cold-war\ndecades as well as new ones that have surfaced. It has been\ncalled upon to meet the burgeoning demand for\npeace-keeping. In some cases, like Angola, Cambodia, El\nSalvador and Mozambique, it has scored successes. In some\nothers, like Bosnia and Herzegovina and Somalia, it has\ncome under heavy strain and has proved to be ineffective.\nThe lesson to be learned is that the Security Council\nshould be far more conscious of when and under what\nmandate to begin peace-keeping operations. Such\noperations must have clearly defined objectives. More\nimportant, agreement among major Powers must carry\nwith it the support of the majority of the Member States\nif it is to have the desired result.\nIf the United Nations system is to be revitalized and\nstrengthened, the basic issue of adequate financing,\nparticularly of peace-keeping operations, must be\naddressed. Whether that happens depends on us. The\nUnited Nations can only be as strong or as effective as\nMember States choose to make it. The limitations of the\nUnited Nations should not encourage Member States to\ntake precipitate action. As a Myanmar saying goes:\n\u201cWhen mice enter the granary, we must catch the\nmice and not set fire to the granary\u201d.\nThe founders of the United Nations also envisaged\nit as an international body for the promotion of the\neconomic and social welfare of all peoples. Even though\nthe right to development is recognized as an inalienable\nhuman right, the disparity between developed and\ndeveloping countries continues to widen. Member States\nshould reaffirm their commitment to cooperate in creating\nan international economic environment conducive to the\nrealization of the right to development. Without\ndevelopment there can be no prospect for lasting peace.\nIn this regard I am pleased to note that in his\nrecommendations on an Agenda for Development the\nSecretary-General last November stressed that\ndevelopment should be recognized as the foremost and\nmost far-reaching task of our time.\nThe United Nations was established on the principle\nof the equality of all its Members. The mandate of the\nOrganization is to advance peace and security, and bring\ninternational justice and economic and social development\nto all peoples. While it deserves to be commended for its\nvital role in the historic process of decolonization which\nled to the independence of more than 80 countries, much\nless can be said for its efforts to create an equitable\ninternational economic order.\nI am pleased to note that the perceptible\nimprovement in the international climate is generating a\nfavourable impact on some long-standing issues such as\nthe Middle East peace process. The initial steps taken two\nyears ago towards a durable peace have now been\nfollowed by firm strides. Myanmar joins other nations in\n22\n\n\nwelcoming the accord signed by Prime Minister Rabin and\nChairman Arafat in Washington, D.C. on 28 September\n1995. We hope that it will pave the way to a\ncomprehensive, just and lasting peace in the Middle East.\nJust as the family of nations must work together to\nensure international peace and stability, individual States\nmust promote peace within their territories. I am happy to\nbe able to say that in Myanmar peace reigns as never\nbefore and that the momentum for positive change\ncontinues. The Government has set 12 objectives in the\npolitical, economic and social fields and is working\nsteadfastly to achieve them.\nA unique feature of Myanmar is that it is a union\ncomposed of well over a hundred national races. Unity\namong the different national races is essential for the\npreservation of our independence and sovereignty as well\nas for the economic and social progress of the country. The\nGovernment has adopted policies to prevent the\ndisintegration of the Union, ensure the non-disintegration of\nnational solidarity, and ensure the perpetuity of our\ncountry\u2019s sovereignty. Moreover, with a view to building a\npeaceful, prosperous and modern nation, my Government\nhas formulated and is pursuing clear objectives in the\npolitical, economic and social spheres.\nAllow me to focus briefly on some of the main issues\non our national agenda.\nThe first issue of ensuring the stability of the State.\nNational reconsolidation is an indispensable component of\nmy Government\u2019s policy to achieve peace and tranquillity.\nA national convention has been convened to draft a new\nConstitution which would be in harmony with present-day\nrealities and would reflect the aspirations of the entire\nnation.\nSecondly, in the economic sector guidelines have been\nformulated to promote all-round development of agriculture,\nwhich forms the mainstay of the nation\u2019s economy. At the\nsame time, Myanmar has laid out a welcome mat to foreign\nand domestic investors in order to attract capital and\ntechnical know-how.\nThirdly, progress is sought in the social sector in order\nto buttress political stability and economic progress, which\nconstitute foundation-stones for a peaceful, prosperous and\nmodern State. We are engaged in efforts to strengthen the\nfabric of society by rekindling the spirit of patriotism and\nuplifting the moral integrity of our citizens. The\nGovernment is endeavouring to preserve the national\ncharacter and cultural heritage and to raise the standard of\neducation and health of the entire country.\nIt is a source of immense pride and satisfaction that\nour efforts have achieved a significant measure of success\nin charting a new course for the country. Insurgency,\nwhich was born with our independence, is now coming to\na close. The unprecedented return to the legal fold of 15\nout of the 16 armed groups speaks volumes for our\nefforts at national reconsolidation.\nOn 10 July 1995 the Government also lifted the\nrestrictions placed on Daw Aung San Suu Kyi. The lifting\nof restrictions is unconditional. A large number of\nindividuals against whom action had been taken in\naccordance with the laws of the land have also been\nreleased.\nI am also pleased to be able to say that we in\nMyanmar have been shouldering our responsibilities in\ncombating the menace posed by narcotic drugs. The\nMyanmar Armed Forces have been mounting major\noffensives against drug traffickers, including the forces of\nKhun Sa. Since the end of 1988 there have been 823\nengagements with the drug traffickers. In these clashes,\n16 officers and 567 other ranks from the armed forces\nsacrificed their lives for the country, 55 officers and 1,744\nother ranks were wounded in action and 153 weapons\nwere lost. Enemy losses amounted to 720 killed, 118\ncaptured, 221 surrendered and 708 assorted weapons\nseized. The numbers speak for themselves. We are\ndetermined to wage war against the drug traffickers as a\nmatter of national responsibility and we see it as our duty\nto humanity. Our men have sacrificed life and limb so\nthat the world may be rid of the scourge of narcotic\ndrugs. The actions of the Myanmar Armed Forces deserve\nto be accorded due recognition, just as the Blue Helmets\nhave been commended for their valour and courage.\nIn order to succeed in the fight against narcotic\ndrugs the Myanmar Government in May 1989 initiated an\nintegrated rural-development programme of an\nunprecedented nature and scope in the border areas.\nSubsequently, in 1992 a separate ministry devoted to the\ndevelopment of border areas and national races was\nestablished. We are fully confident that once those areas\nare developed, the living standards of the local populace\nare raised and alternative means of livelihood are made\navailable, poppy cultivation will be totally eradicated.\nWe have relied on our own resources in promoting\nthe development programmes in the border areas. Over\n23\n\n\n2,842 million kyats, the equivalent of US$ 400 million,\nhave been expended for infrastructure-building. We are\ngrateful that, recently, Japan approved a grant of 1 billion\nyen \u2014 US$ 10 million \u2014 to be used to purchase fertilizers\nand agricultural machinery and implements for the food-\ndevelopment programme in the border regions. It is our\nhope that others too will join hands with us to develop\nthose regions in order that humanity may be freed from the\nmenace posed by narcotic drugs.\nOn the economic front, Myanmar has made important\ngains. The economy registered a growth rate of 6.8 per cent\nin 1994-1995, and prospects look bright for the future.\nForeign investment in Myanmar totals US$ 2.7 billion and\nis expected to reach $4 billion by the end of the year.\nAn indicator of the pace of the development of the\neconomy is the dramatic increase in the production of the\nstaple crop, rice, permitting the export of over 1 million\ntons. In the meantime, Myanmar is fulfilling the basic\nneeds of the people and is striving to narrow the gap in\nliving standards between urban dwellers and the rural\npopulation.\nIn the realm of international relations Myanmar has\nconsistently pursued a policy of peace and friendship with\nall States, and especially with neighbouring countries. A\nrecent landmark event was Myanmar\u2019s accession to the\nTreaty of Amity and Cooperation at the twenty-eighth\nMinisterial Meeting of the Association of South-East Asian\nNations (ASEAN) in Brunei, paving the way for\nMyanmar\u2019s eventual entry into ASEAN.\nIn the light of the political and socio-economic\ntransformations taking place in the country and the\nincreased cooperation with its neighbours, Myanmar\ncontinues to make important contributions to peace and\nstability in the region and in the world.\nThe commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the\nUnited Nations is a time for reflection and for resolution.\nI should like to avail myself of this opportunity to renew\nmy country\u2019s dedication and commitment to the purposes\nand principles of the Charter and to pledge that Myanmar\nwill contribute, however modestly, to the realization of a\nUnited Nations which will both serve the cause of world\npeace and fulfil the needs of humanity.\nIn this new era we must strive to ensure that all\nnations can live together in peace and harmony. Every\nnation must also strive to keep its house in order. We have\na responsibility in our time, just as the founding fathers of\nthe United Nations had in theirs, to bequeath to the\ngenerations to come a world that is secure and peaceful.\n"

        "file_text": "I congratulate Mr. Diogo\nFreitas do Amaral on his election to the presidency of this\nsession of the General Assembly. His election is a tribute\nboth to him and to Portugal, and Australia will work with\nhim to ensure that this historic fiftieth session is as\nmemorable as it could possibly be.\nI join in warmly welcoming, as the 185th Member\nState of the United Nations, our fellow South Pacific Forum\nmember Palau.\nIf we are to effectively prepare for our future we must\nfirst be able to clearly see our past. If we are to see where\nwe must go, we must know where we have been: we must\nbe conscious of our failures, but we should be proud of our\nsuccesses.\nThe structure of today\u2019s world community \u2014 of\nsovereign, self-determined, independent States working\ntogether on the basis of equality in a framework of\ninternational law \u2014 simply did not exist before the Charter\nof the United Nations came into being. There were\nimaginings of it in the minds of many for a very long time,\nand we saw emerge between the two world wars a pale\napproximation of it with the League of Nations. But it was\nat that special moment in San Francisco, 50 years ago, that\ntoday\u2019s concept of a community of nations was first truly\nborn. And that concept has passed the test of 50 years of\nlife.\nGifted though the authors of the Charter were, they\nwould I think be awed to see how very much their vision\nof a globalized world has now been answered, and\nexceeded. Today\u2019s world is one world, a world in which no\nindividuals and no States can aspire to solve all their\nproblems or fulfil all their dreams alone. The ideas of San\nFrancisco have entered into the unconscious of people all\nover the world. Those who refuse to acknowledge the\nglobal character of our world, or who recoil from it and\nretreat into unilateralism or, worse, isolationism, have\nsimply not understood the new dynamics that are at work.\nOurs is an age in which we are called to more, not less,\ncooperation \u2014 and to ever more, and more responsible,\nsharing of our common destiny.\nThe ideas of San Francisco have assumed many\nconcrete forms, which have deepened and expanded over\nthe last five decades. States now habitually, virtually\nautomatically, conduct their relations with each other on\nthe basis of the United Nations Charter. We have added\ncontinually to the corpus of international law and\nagreements made pursuant to the Charter, in ways that\nhave touched every aspect of modern life. We have built\ninstitutions that have sought to deliver to the peoples of\nthe world their most basic needs \u2014 for peace and\nsecurity, for economic well-being, and for dignity and\nliberty.\nIt was natural that following a devastating world war\nand the hideous brutality which accompanied it, the\nCharter would have at its heart the maintenance of\ninternational peace and security. So far, anyway, we have\npassed the test of ensuring that the world would never\nagain be subjected to global conflict. The United Nations\nhas been, of course, deeply challenged in the maintenance\nof peace, from the very beginning and ever since. There\nare areas in which its attempts to maintain and restore\npeace have been flawed, and where the United Nations\nhas faltered. But for all that has gone wrong in places like\nBosnia and Somalia and Rwanda we should not forget the\nsuccesses, like those in El Salvador, Cambodia and\nMozambique. To go back a generation, no one should\nforget the role that was played by the Security Council\nand the Secretary-General in that desperate month of\nOctober 1962 when the hands of the clock were seconds\nbefore midnight and the world did face potential nuclear\nholocaust. And no one should forget the role that, for\nexample, the nuclear non-proliferation Treaty has played\nin falsifying the almost universal prediction in the 1960s\nthat within two decades there would be 20 or more States\npossessing nuclear weapons.\nIn development, in seeking to fulfil its commitment\nto promote \\\"social progress and better standards of life\\\"\nthe United Nations has laboured hard, sometimes in very\ndifficult circumstances. The gap between developed and\ndeveloping countries remains unacceptably high; there\nhave been and continue to be difficulties with the\navailability of resources for development assistance; and\nwe have to acknowledge the awful reality, according to\nthe World Bank, that 1.3 billion of our people still live in\nabsolute poverty. But in food and agriculture, in\nemployment and labour standards, in health, in education\nand in building the infrastructure so vital to communities\nin the developing world \u2014 roads, bridges, water\nsystems \u2014 the United Nations and its agencies have\nworked relentlessly in the service of the human family. It\nis because of the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund\n(UNICEF) that today 80 per cent of the world\u2019s children\nare immunized against six killer diseases. And this is just\n10\n\n\none of hundreds of similar stories that the United Nations\ncan and should be telling.\nBasic to the United Nations concept of the world\ncommunity was that it should operate under and foster the\ndevelopment of law, justice and human rights. A\nfundamental commitment of the United Nations is to\nestablish conditions under which justice may prevail,\ninternational law will be respected and peace can be built.\nIn fulfilment of this charge, the United Nations has\nprovided the setting for the negotiation of over 300 major\ntreaties, including in such crucial fields as arms control,\ntransport, navigation and communications. This very\npractical area of international cooperation has formed the\nframework of a globalized world.\nThe Charter of the United Nations speaks not just of\nsecuring better standards of life, but of those better\nstandards being enjoyed \u201cin larger freedom\u201d. And the\narticulation, development and implementation of human\nrights standards across the whole spectrum of rights \u2014\neconomic, social and cultural as well as political and\ncivil \u2014 has been one of the most important and\nconstructive roles of the United Nations. One of the worst\nof all denials of personal and political freedom was that\nimposed by apartheid. The triumph over that evil was above\nall a victory for those South Africans and their leaders\nwhose freedom and dignity apartheid had so long denied.\nBut it would ignore the testimony of history not to\nrecognize the importance of the role played by the General\nAssembly and the Security Council in creating the\nconditions for that to occur.\nFor the peoples of this world, no political right has\nbeen more important than the right to self-determination.\nThe achievements of the United Nations in this field alone\nare testimony to the indispensable role it has played in\nhuman affairs, with hundreds of millions of people having\nexercised their right to self-determination in these past 50\nyears. It is the great movement of decolonization, as much\nas the cold war and its aftermath, that defines the modern\nworld as we now know it, and which shapes the world\u2019s\nagenda for the years that lie ahead.\nThe United Nations of the future will need to be,\nabove all, an organization which works and speaks for all\nits Members, no matter how large or small, and whose\nlegitimacy is thus without question. It must be an\norganization better oriented to performance, to delivery to\npeople of the things they need and have a right to expect.\nAnd it must be an organization which seeks to reintegrate,\nand better coordinate, the implementation of the three basic\nobjectives of the United Nations so clearly articulated at\nSan Francisco 50 years ago: the objectives of peace \u2014\nmeeting the need for security; of development \u2014\nmeeting economic needs; and of human rights and\njustice \u2014 meeting the need for individual and group\ndignity and liberty.\nIn the peace agenda, disarmament and arms control\ncontinue to be of crucial importance, and a major\nchallenge immediately ahead will be to maintain the\nmomentum of multilateral disarmament and\nnon-proliferation efforts. The decision by the Review and\nExtension Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons to extend the\nTreaty indefinitely was, and remains \u2014 despite what has\nhappened since \u2014 the right decision. The work on a\ncomprehensive nuclear test-ban treaty must be brought to\nconclusion, as promised, in the first half of 1996. We\nmust also begin as soon as possible negotiations on a\ntreaty to ban the production of fissile material for nuclear-\nweapons purposes. A further helpful step, although more\ndifficult to achieve, would be a regime requiring all States\nto declare and account for their present stocks of fissile\nmaterial. The basic objective in all of this is to move\ntowards the goal that is agreed by all \u2014 and it should\nnever be forgotten that it has been agreed by all \u2014\nnamely, that we will, ultimately, eliminate all nuclear\nweapons.\nIt is in this context particularly that the decisions by\nFrance and China to continue nuclear testing are to be so\nstrongly deplored. The environmental consequences are\nbad enough of setting off an explosion more than five\ntimes the size of that which destroyed Hiroshima \u2014 as\nFrance did yesterday on the fragile atoll of Fangataufa in\nAustralia\u2019s Pacific neighbourhood. But the nuclear policy\nconsequences are even worse. This is not the time to be\nreinforcing nuclear stockpiles and asserting their ongoing\ndeterrent role: the world wants and needs to be moving in\nthe opposite direction.\nThis is the time to be negotiating away those\nstockpiles, and building verification systems of the kind\nwe did with the chemical weapons Convention \u2014 which\nstill needs to be ratified to come into effect \u2014 and I urge\nthose States that have not yet acceded to that Convention\nto do so urgently. This is not the time to be encouraging\nscepticism about the nuclear non-proliferation Treaty, as\nthe Chinese and French tests are doing. It is, rather, the\ntime for the nuclear Powers to be encouraging the\nuniversal observance of that Treaty in the way that they\nbest can: by showing that they themselves are absolutely\n11\n\n\nserious about moving to eliminate nuclear weapons from\nthe face of the globe. The best way for them to do that\nright now is for France and China to immediately end their\ntesting programmes; for all the nuclear-weapon States to\nsign the nuclear-weapon-free-zone treaties that now exist in\nthe South Pacific and elsewhere; and for those States to\ncommit themselves wholeheartedly to negotiating a\ngenuinely comprehensive, zero-threshold comprehensive\ntest-ban treaty into place by the middle of next year.\nThe past few turbulent years of United Nations\nexperience on the ground in peace-keeping and peace\nenforcement has underlined the need for it to improve the\neffectiveness of its work in these important fields. Australia\nhas welcomed the Secretary-General\u2019s further work in this\narea in his very lucid January 1995 \u201cSupplement to An\nAgenda for Peace'\u201d. In our own contributions to the debate\non these issues, we have argued for the clearest possible\nthinking to be given to the achievability of objectives right\nacross the whole spectrum of responses to security\nproblems \u2014 from peace-building to peace maintenance to\npeace restoration to peace enforcement.\nWe have consistently argued, and I make the point\nagain very briefly today, that if the United Nations is to be\nable to meet effectively the security challenges of the\npost-cold-war world it must begin to devote more resources\nto preventive strategies than to reactive strategies. It just\nmakes more sense to concentrate on prevention than on\nafter-the-event peace restoration, both for inter-State\nconflict and in the unhappily now far more common case\nof intra-State conflict. Violent conflicts are always far more\ndifficult and costly to resolve than non-violent disputes, and\nfailed States are extremely difficult to piece back together.\nAll that said, it has been encouraging to see the\nprogress made in recent days towards resolving the conflict\nin the former Yugoslavia, and in moving the Middle East\npeace process a substantial new step forward. The United\nNations should always be prepared to lend its support and\nencouragement to preventive diplomacy and to peacemaking\nefforts taking place outside the formal framework of the\nUnited Nations system, and it should remain particularly\nalert to the opportunities envisaged in the Charter for\nadvancing the peace agenda through regional organizations.\nIn the latter context we in the Asia-Pacific have been very\npleased with the rapid evolution of the new Regional Forum\nof the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN)\nover the last two years as a new vehicle for dialogue and\ntrust and confidence-building, in our own region.\nParticular attention has been given recently, as we all\nknow, to the question of improving the rapid reaction\ncapability of the United Nations, and I warmly commend\nthe work that has been done to clarify our thinking on\nthese issues by the Netherlands and Danish Governments,\nand particularly in the major Canadian report, \u201cTowards\na Rapid Reaction Capability for the United Nations\u201d, just\npresented to the Assembly. The very useful emphasis of\nthe Canadian study is on the idea of improving the United\nNations system\u2019s capability at the centre first, particularly\nin the area of operational planning, and thereby\nencouraging greater willingness by troop contributors to\ngive practical and more urgent effect to stand-by\narrangements. No organizational arrangements will ever\nsubstitute for clear-eyed decision-making by the Security\nCouncil on the responses and mandates that are\nappropriate to particular situations, but the implementation\nof changes of this kind should make us much better\nequipped as an international community to deal in future\nwith situations like that in Rwanda, where last time our\nresponse was so tragically inadequate.\nThe security agenda tends to dominate most popular\nperceptions of the United Nations role, but we in the\ninternational community must never allow our attention to\nbe diverted from the demands of the development agenda,\nnow as pressing as ever. When historians hundreds of\nyears hence look back at this last half century, the cold\nwar and its aftermath will not be the only great\ninternational current to be remembered; it will be the\ngiant step of decolonization that looms at least as large.\nDecolonization led to the emergence of a world\neconomy which for many years has been seen as divided\nprincipally into two categories, the developed and the\ndeveloping countries. But today, the picture is more\ncomplicated. Mainly for reasons of change in technology\nand information systems, we do now live in a global\neconomy. No part of it is entirely separate from the\nwhole, and no one can act in that global economy in an\neffective way, entirely alone. Because we live in that kind\nof economy a key part of our action to deal with the\nproblems of development must, accordingly, be\nmultilateral, and the key problem facing us, both\nmultilaterally and in our bilateral, donor roles, is that\nwithin the global economy the gap between rich and poor\ncountries, despite all efforts to resist this, has grown. The\nfact that some 1.3 billion of the 5.7 billion people alive\ntoday live at an unacceptable level of poverty is morally\ninsupportable, and dangerous.\n12\n\n\nThe United Nations of the future must, as a matter of\nthe most urgent priority, forge a new agenda for\ndevelopment and reshape its relevant institutions to\nimplement that agenda effectively. This is as important as\nany task it faces in the service of the human family and in\nrecreating itself as an institution fit for the twenty-first\ncentury. The agenda is available for all to see. It has been\nfully described in the six global conferences held by the\nUnited Nations in the past four years \u2014 the conferences on\nchildren, the environment, human rights, population, social\ndevelopment, and now women. There have also been\nimportant studies by the international financial institutions\nand by academic institutions. We know now what we need\nto do. We must resolve, politically, to do it.\nIn pursuing these various themes it is important,\nhowever, for us not to lose sight of those geographical\nregions where particular focus is still required, and where\nthe United Nations role is more vital than ever. Africa\u2019s\ninfluence and importance continues to be felt throughout the\nworld in every field of human activity and culture. Exciting\npolitical developments, including the ending of apartheid,\nhave been accompanied by major new efforts to restructure\nand reform national economies. Those efforts demand the\ncontinued support of the international community, and in\nparticular the United Nations system. Other regions where\nthe United Nations needs to play a particular role to\nfacilitate economic and social development are the Central\nAsian republics, the Middle East, the Caribbean, and in a\nnumber of areas in the Indian Ocean region.\nThe Indian Ocean region is one where Australia, as an\nIndian Ocean country as well as an Asia-Pacific country,\nhas been promoting, with others in the region, both\ngovernmental and non-governmental efforts to enhance\nregional cooperation, particularly on economic and trade\nissues. The success to date of the Asia-Pacific Economic\nCooperation Council (APECC) in developing cooperative\nstrategies in the Asia-Pacific region to promote prosperity\nand stability, complementing the United Nations broader\nwork for these goals at the international level, does offer\none possible model for the countries of the Indian Ocean\nRim to consider.\nThe institutions of the United Nations relevant to\neconomic and social development are urgently in need of\nreform. The General Assembly has created the high-level\nWorking Group needed for political consensus on this. That\nmust complete its work in this fiftieth anniversary year, and\nit must do so creatively, setting aside past vested interests\nin the system. We must implement the development agenda\nof the future in a way which ensures a productive and fair\nplace in the global economy for all States.\nThe complex and interlinked system of principles,\nlegal regimes and machinery that the United Nations has\nestablished to promote human rights is one of its major\nachievements. It must be built upon and strengthened,\nrecognizing always that the human rights whose\nuniversality and indivisibility we assert are about\neconomic and social and cultural rights just as much as\nabout the civil and political rights on which the developed\ncountries tend to focus so much attention. Priority must\nbe given to the major international human rights\ninstruments and machinery and the committees which\nmonitor their implementation. By this means we can\nprovide a frank, non-confrontational and constructive\ndialogue amongst States parties.\nThe advisory services and technical-assistance\nactivities of the United Nations can also play a role in\npromoting the observance of human rights and the\nimplementation of democratic principles around the world.\nProgrammes to help countries develop their own national\ninstitutions and systems to promote and protect human\nrights will enhance their capacity to prevent violations\nand, accordingly, make a direct contribution to human\nsecurity.\nIt cannot be sufficiently emphasized enough that the\npeace and development and human-rights agendas I have\nmentioned are all interlinked. We need to avoid the\ncompartmentalization that occurred throughout the cold-\nwar years, in which peace-and-security issues,\ndevelopment issues and human-rights and justice issues\nwere isolated in completely different conceptual and\ninstitutional boxes. Any viable modern concept of\ninternational peace, let alone peace within States, must\nrecognize that peace and security and development are\nindissolubly bound up with each other. There can be no\nsustainable peace without development and no\ndevelopment without peace. And human rights, in the\nfullest sense, as I have described them, have to come into\nthe equation too. There is unlikely to be sustainable peace\nin any society if material needs are satisfied but needs for\ndignity and liberty are not.\nNo agendas of substance, no matter how clear in\nconcept, how well-coordinated in principle they may be,\nwill mean anything to people if they are not able to be\nimplemented through effective organizational structures\nand instruments. There has been widespread recognition\nin recent years, as we all know, that the structure of the\n13\n\n\nUnited Nations that grew up during the past 50 years is\nsimply not adequate to the tasks of the next.\nWe now have an embarrassment of riches with respect\nto ideas and proposals for change to the United Nations.\nJust as it is urgent that we complete work on \u201cAn Agenda\nfor Development\u201d in this fiftieth year, it is equally urgent\nthat we complete the work of the high-level Working Group\non the reform of the United Nations system also within this\nfiftieth year.\nThe structural problem that it is probably the most\nurgently necessary to resolve, if the credibility of the whole\nUnited Nations system is to be maintained, is that of the\nSecurity Council. The debate on this subject has been long\nand detailed and is familiar to all of us. Australia\u2019s definite\nview is that it has been going on for long enough, and we\nare now at the time when action is required. Last year, we\nsubmitted some illustrative models on the basis of which\nconsideration could be given to an expansion in the\nmembership of the Council. Others have made very specific\nproposals. Again, in this field there is no lack of ideas.\nWhat we have to do now is move to the stage of forging\npolitical consensus on a new Security Council, which will\nbe effective, represent the whole membership of the United\nNations and sensibly reflect the realities of today and the\nfuture, not those of 1945.\nThere are many structural changes and personnel\nreforms that could and should be made within the United\nNations system to improve its efficiency. But ultimately the\nquality of that system depends on what we are prepared to\npay for it.\nIt is important to appreciate at the outset the order of\nmagnitude of the sums we are talking about. The core\nfunctions of the United Nations, involving the Headquarters\nin New York, the Offices in Geneva, Vienna and Nairobi,\nand the five regional Commissions, cost just US$ 1.2\nbillion between them. To take just one comparison, last\nyear the annual budget of just one Department in one\nUnited States city, the New York Police Department,\nexceeded that $1.2 billion by $600 million.\nThe total number of personnel needed to run those\nUnited Nations core functions is around 10,700. Compare\nthe local administration of my own national capital,\nCanberra \u2014 again, just one city in one of the 185 States\nMembers of the United Nations \u2014 which has some 22,000\nemployees on the public payroll.\nThe cost of United Nations peace operations last\nyear, in Cyprus, Western Sahara, the former Yugoslavia\nand 13 other locations, was $3.2 billion. That is less than\nwhat it takes to run just three New York City\nDepartments: the Police Department, the Fire Department\nand the Department of Correction.\nIf we add to the core functions of the United Nations\nall the related programmes and organs, including the\nUnited Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the\nUnited Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), the Office of\nthe United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees\n(UNHCR), the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund\n(UNICEF), the United Nations Conference on Trade and\nDevelopment (UNCTAD) and the International Drug\nControl Programme (UNDCP), we are still talking about\na total of around 33,000 people and a total budget,\nincluding both assessed and voluntary contributions, of\n$6.3 billion. That sounds a lot \u2014 rather more than just\nfor the core functions \u2014 but it is not quite so much when\none considers, for example, that the annual global\nturnover of just one international accounting firm, Price\nWaterhouse, is around $4.5 billion.\nIf we go further than that and add to the core\nfunctions and related programmes all the other specialized\nprogrammes and agencies of the entire United Nations\nfamily \u2014 agencies such as the Food and Agriculture\nOrganization (FAO), the International Labour\nOrganization (ILO), the United Nations Educational,\nScientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the\nWorld Health Organization (WHO) and the International\nAtomic Energy Agency, and put into the equation as well\nthe Bretton Woods institutions \u2014 the World Bank group\nand the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which\nbetween them employ nearly 10,000 people and spend $5\nbillion annually \u2014 we are still talking about total United\nNations-system personnel of just around 61,400 and a\ntotal United Nations-system dollar cost of $18.2 billion.\nA total of 61,400 may sound like a lot of people,\nand it is, but perhaps it is not so many when we consider\nthat more than this number \u2014 65,000, in fact \u2014 are\nemployed by the three Disney theme parks in California,\nFlorida and France. Three times as many people sell\nMcDonald\u2019s hamburgers around the world as work for the\nUnited Nations system. And $18.2 billion might be a lot\nof money, but just one major multinational corporation,\nDow Chemical, which happens also to have 61,000\nemployees world wide, has an annual revenue in excess\nof $20 billion.\n14\n\n\nWhen we put the financial problems of the United\nNations into this kind of perspective, as I think we ought to\ndo more often, the solutions do not really look quite so\nhard. Surely, between us, with our combined defence\nexpenditure alone of around $767 billion, the 185 Member\nStates can find that kind of money. But, of course, the\nproblem of paying for the United Nations has now become\ncritical because of the unwillingness or inability of so many\nof the Member States, including the biggest of us all, to\npay their assessed contributions, notwithstanding that the\ncost of these for the major developed-country contributors\nworks out at between $7 and $15 per head per year \u2014 the\nprice of no more than one or two movie tickets in this city.\nWe have a short-term problem, which I believe can\nand should be solved within the United Nations system by\nallowing the United Nations to borrow from the World\nBank. But we also have a longer-term problem which,\nfrankly, does not look as though it is going to be solved,\nhowever much we continue to work at adjusting assessment\nscales, exhort Member States to pay up and remind them of\nthe consequences under Article 19 of the Charter if they\nfail to do so.\nSo what are we to do about all this? In my judgement,\nit is time to look again \u2014 this time very seriously\nindeed \u2014 at the options which exist for supplementing\nMember States\u2019 contributions with external sources of\nfinance. The practicability of collecting a levy on every one\nof the $300,000 billion worth of foreign-exchange\ntransactions that now occur every year remains to be fully\nassessed, but simple arithmetic tells us that if we strike a\nrate of just .001 per cent for such a levy, which hardly\nseems likely to have any significant economic\nconsequences, we could generate $3 billion in revenue.\nMoreover, we know that if we could impose a levy on\ninternational airline passengers of $10 for every\ninternational sector flown, which would be very easily\ncollectible indeed, we could also raise $3 billion: nearly the\nwhole annual cost of United Nations peace operations.\nThere are also other revenue options that, to a greater\nor lesser extent, have the same rational nexus with United\nNations costs as these do, in that they involve transactions\nwhich are international, take place within a framework of\nlaw and cooperation provided by the United Nations and\ncan be harmed by a breakdown in international peace and\nsecurity \u2014 precisely the areas in which the United Nations\nhas a fundamental responsibility.\nBut traditionally, a threshold objection of principle has\nbeen mounted against any such talk. Member States, it has\nbeen said, should themselves wholly own the United\nNations system; if the Secretariat had direct access to\nrevenue other than assessed contributions of Member\nStates, who knows what adventures it might be inclined\nto get up to. But ownership and control are totally\nseparate issues. The United Nations operates on a\nsovereign-equality principle, which means that, for\nexample, those six States which between them pay at\npresent over 65 per cent of the United Nations regular\nbudget should under no circumstances have greater\nauthority over how it is spent than the overwhelming\nmajority of Members, each of which pays much lesser\nproportions of the total.\nWhatever the funding sources involved, the crucial\nquestion is surely how and by whom the money is spent.\nIt is absolutely crucial that there be appropriate control of\nfunds by Member States, with all the accountability\nmechanisms that implies. But that does not mean that\nthose Member States should themselves have to provide\nall the funds in the first place.\nIn talking about these issues to many of my\nministerial colleagues from a wide range of countries and\nacross all continents over the last few days, I have found\nthe almost unanimous reaction that the present, and likely\ncontinuing, financial crisis of the United Nations demands\nthat these issues be looked at again, without any\nprejudgements of the questions of principle or\npracticability involved.\nI would suggest accordingly that the time is right for\nthe Secretary-General to convene once again a high-level\nadvisory group, like the Volcker-Ogata group established\nin 1992, with a mandate to think explicitly through what\nhas hitherto been more or less unthinkable: how to fund\nthe United Nations system in a way that reaches out\nbeyond the resources that Member States are prepared to\nput directly into it. Such a group could report to or work\nwith a committee of representatives of Member States \u2014\none in existence already, such as the High-Level Working\nGroup on the Financial Situation of the United Nations or\none newly created for the purpose.\nA great deal of work has already been or is being\ndone on many of these issues, and it should be possible\nfor such a group to report within six months or so \u2014\ncertainly within a year. The parameters of the debate have\nto be changed, and for that to happen we need an\nauthoritative new statement of the art of the possible.\nHere, as elsewhere, we have to move forward. We\nhave to look to new ideas. We have to encourage\n15\n\n\nhumankind\u2019s ingenuity to search for better ways for States\nto deal with each other as relationships take new shape, as\nnew States emerge and as problems which could not have\nbeen conceived of a few years ago become the challenges\nof the day.\nWe will fail to meet those challenges if we adhere\nsolely to the ideas and dogma of the past. The United\nNations was itself founded on a mixture of idealism and\npragmatism. Both were essential to build a new world 50\nyears ago, and in the past 50 years that idealism has not\ndisappeared. It was an important force in bringing about the\nend of the cold war, and, more than anything else, it was\nidealism that lay behind the process of decolonization,\nwhich so shifted the tectonic plates of history.\nTo some idealism will always be the enemy of\npracticality. But to others it will always involve, more than\nanything else, the courage to take advantage of new\nopportunities, ensuring that at least some of today\u2019s ideals\nwill become tomorrow\u2019s reality. Perhaps now, 50 years\nbeyond San Francisco, we need to renew that idealism and\nwalk down some of those uncharted paths that idealists\nhave always been prepared to tread.\n"

        "file_text": "It is a great pleasure for\nme to see you, Sir, presiding over this very important\nsession of the General Assembly. As a politician with a\nlong and distinguished career, you are eminently qualified\nto guide us ably through the crucial coming months.\nIt goes without saying that I fully endorse the\nintervention by Minister Solana on behalf of the European\nUnion. At this fiftieth anniversary session of the General\nAssembly, I would like first of all to affirm the deep\nattachment of the Kingdom of the Netherlands to the\nUnited Nations. The United Nations is the expression of\nthe relatively new notion that nations and people\nanywhere in the world have the same rights and are\nbound by the same duties. For 50 years, this Organization\nhas provided the basis for building a civilized\ninternational community and we cannot afford to be\ncynical about the United Nations.\nThere is no alternative to the United Nations in\ndealing with global challenges. It is up to us, the Member\nStates, to make use of the Organization and to make it\nwork. This anniversary should be an occasion neither for\nself-congratulatory speeches nor for despondency. Rather,\nit should inspire us to unite in a renewed effort to bring\nthe Organization into harmony with the demands of the\ntimes.\nIn this age of instant communication and televised\nimages, respect for human rights and solidarity among\nnations can no longer be applied selectively. Aggression,\nwar crimes and massive violations of human rights, such\nas those in the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda, trigger an\nimmediate and massive response throughout the world. It\nis impossible for people to remain indifferent to the fate\nof their fellow human beings anywhere \u2014 unless, of\ncourse, they should be denied access to these means of\ncommunication. However, the revolutionary growth of\ncommunications has also created a gap between people\u2019s\ndemands for action and the limited ability of\nGovernments and organizations to satisfy these demands.\nThe same observation applies to national decisions\ntouching on the security concerns of people in countries\naround the globe; and nowadays, these concerns include\nenvironmental, ecological and all other aspects of human\nsecurity. Sovereignty has become restricted and\ncircumscribed because of new global interdependencies.\nIt is an illusion to think that in this age States can\ncontinue to conduct their business in splendid isolation\nwithout regard for international public opinion and\nsensitivities. Again, as sovereignty becomes less\nformidable a barrier and people organize themselves\nfreely and globally in various ways, the need for global\n12\n\n\nregulation becomes more pressing. For this purpose, people\nlook to the United Nations. But can the United Nations\nmeet these new demands?\nThe crises in Bosnia and Rwanda illustrate the types\nof conflict that at present pose the biggest threat to the\ninternational system. In many parts of the world ethnic,\nracial and religious divides are resurfacing with a\nvengeance. Where State structures are weak or\ndisintegrating, those divides may become battlegrounds for\nstruggles over land, water and other scarce resources.\nThe response of the international community to these\npolitical and humanitarian emergencies has often been\ninadequate, slow or hesitant. Lack of resolve in the early\nstages of a crisis has forced Member States to scramble\nlater to close the gap between their acts and their words\nand to restore lost credibility. There is a certain tendency to\ntake words for deeds and to be satisfied with words alone.\nLanguage is a currency whose value depends on\ncorresponding behaviour. For the United Nations to be\ncredible, its language must be credible, and its language can\nonly be credible if it is matched by its deeds. These are\nsimple, basic rules, not only in banking but also in politics.\nUnfortunately, it can be convenient to forget these rules for\nreasons of political expediency. In such cases a higher price\nmust be paid at a later stage.\nThe war in former Yugoslavia is a tragedy for its\npeople, but it also exemplifies the dangers threatening the\ninternational order. The fatal practice of \u201cethnic cleansing\u201d\nhas been unanimously condemned by the international\ncommunity. Those warnings have not been heeded, and the\nmad dream of ethnic purity is still being pursued. The\npractice of \u201cethnic cleansing\u201d has, moreover, set in motion\na cycle of revenge and further violence.\nThe end of the war may now come into sight, thanks\nto forceful international intervention and a shifting balance\non the ground. The current diplomatic initiative is designed\nto exploit this opportunity and finally to create conditions\nfor true peace. We should do everything in our power to\nassist the negotiators in their mission. But for the\ninternational community, represented by the United Nations,\nthe question also remains of whether it should have\nintervened earlier, and with greater decisiveness.\nMembers of all the parties to this conflict have at\nvarious times committed crimes and breaches of\ninternational law. But there is a difference in the scale of\nhuman rights violations and criminal responsibility.\nThe Bosnian Serb side has from the beginning\nresorted to \u201cethnic cleansing\u201d and acts of terror against\nthe civilian population as a systematic tool in its\ncampaign, and therefore its leaders carry prime\nresponsibility for initiating these practices.\nThe latest and perhaps largest single crime was\ncommitted against the population of the former Bosnian\nenclaves of Srebrenica and Zepa. The victims were living\nin areas declared safe by the Security Council. The Serb\nbehaviour has been condemned by the Security Council,\nbut the United Nations and its Member States cannot\nescape sharing some of the blame for not living up to the\nUnited Nations commitment. We, the Member States, had\nconvinced ourselves \u2014 and what is more, our Bosnian\nprot\u00e9g\u00e9s \u2014 that a largely symbolic United Nations\npresence would be sufficient to deter aggression. It did\nnot. We have been proved cruelly wrong, and as a result\nthe populations of the enclaves paid a terrible price in\nterms of human life and displacement at the hands of the\nBosnian Serbs. The Netherlands, whose small contingent\nof Blue Helmets was powerless to prevent the onslaught\non Srebrenica, is deeply shocked by the massive\nviolations of human rights which were committed by the\nSerb aggressors.\nWe share the Security Council\u2019s deep concern about\nthe fate of the former inhabitants of Srebrenica who have\nnot been accounted for. There are strong indications that\nthousands were murdered in cold blood. It is a disgrace\nthat the Bosnian Serbs have not honoured their\ncommitment to give immediate and full access to\nrepresentatives of international organizations to investigate\nthe situation of those who are missing. In the interest of\nthe credibility of any future peace agreement, we cannot\nacquiesce in the Bosnian Serb refusal to cooperate on this\nand other human rights issues. We expect the same kind\nof cooperation from the Croat and Bosniac authorities\nwith regard to verification of reports about human rights\nviolations in areas under their control.\nIf similar calamities are to be prevented in the\nfuture, we, the Security Council and the troop\ncontributors, must ensure that the operational aspects of\nthe Council\u2019s resolutions have a solid foundation in\nmilitary planning and available capabilities. This includes\nthe political will to use those capabilities when needed.\nTherefore, in the future no mandate should be given\n13\n\n\nbefore the means and the readiness for implementation are\nassured.\nSrebrenica and Zepa have also shown that\nhumanitarian action can never be a substitute for decisive\nmeasures against a party which perpetrates aggression and\nmassive human rights violations. Humanitarian assistance,\nimportant though it undoubtedly is in itself, risks being\ntainted in the eye of the public if it is perceived as a\nsubstitute for decisive action going to the root of the\nproblem.\nIn order to avoid the repetition of violent outbursts,\nthe seeds of future wars must be eliminated. These seeds\noften lie in the ruthless exploitation of situations of\npotential conflict by unscrupulous politicians and local\nwarlords. To deter such action, justice must be done and be\nseen to be done.\nThe establishment of the international criminal\nTribunals for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda may\nprove to be an important step in the right direction, and in\nmore than one respect. For the second time in history, after\nNuremberg and Tokyo, the international community is\nholding individuals responsible for their actions during\nwartime and in the initiation of war. So, hopefully, the\nblame for atrocities will not be put on entire peoples, which\nwould call for massive revenge in the future, but on those\nwho are personally and directly responsible. We hope that\nthe creation of these Tribunals will prove to be a catalyst\nfor the establishment of a permanent international criminal\ncourt.\nThe question of United Nations credibility in Bosnia\nand Rwanda points to a broad range of issues related to\nUnited Nations reform in the domain of peace operations,\nthe structure and work methods of the Security Council,\nfinance and the economic and social area. Let me comment\nbriefly on each of these.\nAt last year\u2019s session of the General Assembly I noted\nthat a more rapid response by the United Nations might\nhave prevented the genocide in Rwanda. My suggestion\nwas that in order to deal with emergencies like these we\nshould consider creating a permanent brigade which could\nbe deployed almost instantly once the Security Council had\ntaken a decision. In the months thereafter this idea was\nexplored in a series of consultations in New York and at an\ninternational colloquium organized in the Netherlands.\nThese discussions resulted in the Netherlands non-paper on\na United Nations rapid deployment brigade, which was\ndistributed to all Member States last April.\nBut the idea of a United Nations brigade should be\nseen as a contribution to the wider debate on United\nNations peace operations. The most logical manner to\naddress the problem of rapid response would be, in my\nopinion, a small, standing United Nations force which\ncould fill the time lag between a Security Council\ndecision and the deployment of national contingents.\nHowever, the Netherlands will support and actively\ncontribute to any proposal that represents an intermediate\nstep towards the longer-term objective of a United\nNations force for rapid deployment.\nAgainst this background, we applaud the Canadian\nstudy on a United Nations rapid-reaction capability.\nAmong other things, it recommends, as our colleague Mr.\nOuellet pointed out, setting up a United Nations planning\ncell, which could function as a mobile headquarters and\nbe part of the vanguard concept. That is, it could be the\nnucleus of a force composed of national contingents under\nthe United Nations stand-by arrangements system. We\nfully endorse this recommendation, which partly realizes\nthe idea I raised and in due course could lead to the\ncreation of a standing United Nations brigade. We shall\nbe in touch with other interested Member States in order\nto coordinate practical suggestions with a view to possible\nfurther political action.\nThe continued viability of United Nations peace\noperations ultimately rests on the preservation of their\nlegitimacy. This implies that the Security Council should\nbe made more responsive to the views of the United\nNations membership at large. The transparency of the\nCouncil\u2019s decision-making concerning peace operations\nhas already undergone noticeable improvements.\nNevertheless, further adjustments are called for.\nTherefore, we support the creation of a mechanism for the\ndiscussion of all aspects of peace operations with troop\ncontributors.\nThe Assembly should address with the utmost\nurgency the critical financial situation of the United\nNations. Without early agreement on financial\ncontributions, there can be no basis for the necessary\nbroad reforms. It is unacceptable that responsible Member\nStates should carry the burden of making up for other\nStates\u2019 lack of financial discipline.\nThese States are in contravention of the Charter,\nwhich makes assessed contributions, once agreed, a\nbinding obligation on Member States and, thus, of\ninternational law. I strongly associate myself with the\nEuropean Union Presidency in calling upon Member\n14\n\n\nStates to pay their contributions in full, on time and without\nconditions.\nThe problem can be solved only if Member States\nparticipate actively in the current negotiations aimed at\nstrengthening and reforming United Nations financing and\nrefrain from unilateral actions. The Netherlands, for its part,\nwill participate constructively in efforts to arrive at a\nsolution.\nThe provision of the necessary resources would also\ngive the United Nations the possibility of dealing more\neffectively with the promotion of the economic and social\nadvancement of all peoples. But effective multilateral action\non socio-economic issues is not a matter only of financial\nresources. It will require new thinking on the future of the\nUnited Nations. The Secretary-General indicated the right\ndirection last year, in \u201cAn Agenda for Development\u201d, in his\nanalysis of the five dimensions of development: peace,\neconomic growth, the environment, justice and democracy.\nA number of initiatives, some from within the Organization\nand others, such as the Carlsson report, from outside, aim\nat strengthening, revitalizing and reforming the United\nNations.\nThe Netherlands recognizes the need for a thorough\ndebate and early decisions on ways to improve the\nperformance and accountability of the United Nations. We\nwelcome these initiatives, including the creation of the\nHigh-level Open-ended Working Group by the General\nAssembly. I could imagine that three years from now, in\n1998, a ministerial conference could meet to agree on the\nbasis for the implementation of the High-level Group\u2019s\nfindings.\nIn the field of disarmament, the Netherlands attaches\nthe highest priority to the conclusion next year of a\ncomprehensive test-ban treaty. In order to ensure that the\nnegotiations will reach this absolutely essential objective,\nthey should be given a strong political impulse.\nIn this context, the Netherlands deplores the recent\nnuclear tests and fervently hopes that the other\nnuclear-weapon States will maintain their moratoriums. A\ndecision not to conduct any further tests would be of great\nbenefit to the creation of a positive climate for the\nresumption of the negotiations and their successful\ncompletion in 1996. Therefore, the Netherlands strongly\nurges the nuclear-weapon States to desist from all further\ntesting.\nHaving said all this, I should like to close on a note\nof hope and appreciation for what the United Nations has\ndone and can continue to do in a number of very\nimportant areas. I am thinking of the environment, the\npopulation problem, human rights, the status of women,\ndemocratization and social policy. In these areas, the\nUnited Nations is providing the infrastructure for the\nshaping and consolidation of a world-wide consensus and\nfor the practical realization of what this consensus is\nabout. Much of this happens through large-scale\nconferences, with elaborate preparatory processes\ninvolving the various regions of the world and a wide\nspectrum of both governmental and non-governmental\nactors.\nThe women\u2019s Conference in Beijing is clear proof of\nthe crucial role of these meetings in bringing about a\nglobal awareness of the issues at stake. These conferences\nset norms and standards by which individuals and non-\ngovernmental organizations around the world can measure\nthe progress made by Governments and by the United\nNations as a whole towards well-defined goals. If\nproperly implemented and monitored they can prove to be\ndecisive for the quality of life of future generations, and\neven of our own, and for the credibility of our\nOrganization.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, it affords me\ngreat pleasure to congratulate you on your election to\ndirect the work of this historic session of the General\nAssembly. Such an honour bears testimony to your\nundoubted dynamism and diplomatic skills, which will in\nno small measure bear on the outcome of the work of this\nAssembly.\nPermit me also to pay tribute to your predecessor,\nHis Excellency Mr. Amara Essy, of Cote d\u2019Ivoire, for his\noutstanding leadership of the forty-ninth session. We\ncongratulate him also on the many initiatives that he took\nin the furtherance of the work of our Organization.\nLastly, may I refer to the sterling work that the\nSecretary-General, Mr. Boutros-Boutros Ghali, continues\nto do against great odds. His report on the work of the\nOrganization in 1995 has painted in sharp relief the\nawesome task that faces us at the threshold of a new\nmillennium and as we enter the second half-century of the\nUnited Nations existence.\nThe United Nations has been, and will always be,\nthe symbol of humankind\u2019s fervent desire to conduct its\naffairs with the purpose of eternal survival. When the\ndark clouds of war threatened to engulf the world with a\ncatastrophe of unimaginable proportions, humankind\nfound strength within itself to negate the Armageddon.\nThe pattern of large-scale wars involving many nations\nhas been reversed, and the worst that we suffered in\nrecent years was a cold war that was more\npsychologically than physically damaging. Happily, that\nis now behind us.\nBut, even as we stop to ponder and reflect on the\npast, a new pattern of ethnic intra-State conflagrations has\nemerged and continues to threaten the very survival of\nhumanity. This new scenario has posed a serious\nchallenge to the initiatives and peace-keeping capabilities\nof our Organization.\nThe record of the United Nations in the recent past\nin peace-keeping has been mixed. We have had\nunqualified successes in some places, but then in others\n4\n\n\nsuccess has eluded us. Our resolve, therefore, has to be to\nshift the balance in favour of greater success. Our\nmachinery for peacemaking and peace-keeping needs to be\nfine-tuned to maximum precision. The implications of this\nrequirement are far-reaching and need to be appreciated in\ntheir amplitude.\nFirst, the financing of peace-keeping operations must\nbe put on a more secure footing. Persistent arrears, such as\nthose we are currently experiencing, especially when they\nare incurred by major Powers, cannot but have an adverse\neffect on the morale of the small countries, such as my\nown, that make great sacrifices to meet their obligations to\nthe Organization.\nSecondly, greater attention should be paid to peace-\nmaking and preventive diplomacy, thereby reducing the\nprospects of conflicts, with their attendant costs. In this\nregard, the ideas contained in the Secretary-General\u2019s\nSupplement to An Agenda for Peace merit our close\nattention. The strategy of pre-empting the eruption of\nconflict is, of course, closely linked to the United Nations\nefforts in the fields of social and economic development,\nbecause it is in the soil of poverty that the seeds of national\nupheavals take root and sprout.\nLast, but not least, the changed nature of the\nchallenges facing the Security Council call for the\nrestructuring of that organ to reflect the changed realities of\npresent-day international relations. All the international\npeace-and-security matters of which the Council is currently\nseized pertain to developing countries or countries in\ntransition. Thus, it is reasonable to suggest that the\ncomposition of the Security Council should include an\nappropriate proportion of developing countries in both the\npermanent and non-permanent categories.\nMy delegation therefore supports the view that the\nreform of the Security Council should be in accordance\nwith the following principles: one, the reform of the\nSecurity Council must not put in danger its effectiveness,\nbut, on the contrary, should strengthen it; two, the\nenlargement of the Security Council should enhance its\nrepresentative character, taking into account the emergence\nof new economic and political Powers as well as the\nincrease of United Nations membership; three, the\nenlargement of the Security Council should enhance\nequitable geographic representation; four, the possibility of\nsmaller Member States serving on the Security Council\nshould not be diminished; and, lastly, the enlargement\nshould take place in both categories of permanent and non-\npermanent members.\nThe Open-ended Working Group on the Question of\nEquitable Representation on and Increase in the\nMembership of the Security Council has continued to\naddress the question of the reform of the Council. It is\nencouraging to note that discussions have shown a general\nsupport for the need to increase the membership of the\nSecurity Council, especially of developing countries, and\na subsequent need to review the Council\u2019s composition.\nThe general view is that the size and composition of an\nexpanded Council should reflect more accurately the\nuniversal character of the United Nations and present-day\nrealities.\nIt has further been recognized that the principle of\nthe sovereign equality of all Members of the United\nNations and the concepts of equitable representation and\ndistribution, legitimacy, effectiveness and efficiency\nshould serve as guiding principles for the reform of the\nSecurity Council.\nA number of political questions continue to\npreoccupy us. In this regard, the leaders and people of\nIsrael, Jordan and Palestine deserve our congratulations\non having transformed the hopes and goals embodied in\nthe Middle East peace process into tangible achievements.\nThe people of Israel and the Palestinians have overcome\nformidable obstacles. Yet the most difficult and divisive\nissues still remain unresolved.\nThe peace process in that area of the Middle East is\nof the utmost importance and must therefore be negotiated\nagainst a backdrop of continuing and satisfactory\nprogress. Only that will help give both Israel and\nPalestine the further confidence needed to make the\npolitical decisions that will ultimately achieve a lasting\nsolution.\nWe also need to urge the international community to\nrespond quickly, appropriately, generously, practically and\nflexibly to the needs of the Palestinian people.\nAchievements must match expectations.\nIn the tragic situation of the former Yugoslavia, the\nGovernment of Bosnia and Herzegovina must be\ncommended for accepting the peace proposal of the five-\nnation Contact Group, which has been endorsed by the\nSecurity Council. This peace proposal, as recent\ndevelopments have indicated, does not sufficiently\nrespond to the requirements of justice and equity, but we\nare none the less encouraged by a number of positive\ndevelopments that have taken place.\n5\n\n\nWe therefore urge the international community, in\nparticular, the Security Council and the member States of\nthe European Contact Group, to respond effectively to the\nsituation in Bosnia and Herzegovina. We hope that the\nlogic of peace will finally overcome the logic of war, on\nthe basis of the cease-fire, which is yet to come into effect.\nIn Africa, many significant developments have taken\nplace in respect of peace-keeping that have to be\nunderstood in the context of changes in the international\nenvironment. The changes include the fatigue and\nreluctance of the leading world Powers, especially those in\nthe Security Council, to participate in peace-keeping\noperations in Africa. That reluctance was exemplified by\nthe events in Burundi, where the Organization of African\nUnity (OAU) had to deploy a limited observation mission\nbecause the United Nations could not.\nOn the other hand, however, some of the Western\ncountries have launched several initiatives aimed at\nidentifying ways in which the international community can\nassist Africa to cope with the challenges of conflict\nprevention and management. While Africa, in keeping with\nits determination to combat conflicts on the continent, is\nappreciative of these gestures from its outside partners, we\nwish to remind the international community of the United\nNations primary role as the guardian of world peace and\nstability everywhere, including in Africa. Africa remains\npart of the international community, and the notion that\n\u201cAfrican problems need an African solution\u201d, as some\ncountries advocate, is erroneous. The determination of\nAfrica to address, through the OAU, the problem of\nconflicts on the continent should not be misconstrued as\nabsolving the United Nations from its responsibility for\npeace and security where Africa is concerned.\nThe Sahraoui people have a right to self-determination.\nWe therefore appeal to all parties to respect the decision to\nhold a referendum in Western Sahara, to be held as\nscheduled in January 1996.\nMy delegation believes that the key to attaining\nnuclear disarmament and a nuclear-free world continues to\nbe the universality of the non-proliferation regime. In this\nconnection, therefore, I wish to register my delegation\u2019s\nstrong rejection of nuclear tests, which are clearly\ninconsistent with the decision of the Review and Extension\nConference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) regarding the\nprinciples and objectives of nuclear non-proliferation and\ndisarmament, which committed all States to work towards\nthe elimination of nuclear weapons and to exercise the\nutmost restraint with respect to nuclear testing. We call\non all nuclear-weapon States to refrain from any further\ntesting.\nWe express our deep disappointment at the lack of\nconcrete results on the question of the review and\nappraisal of the implementation of the declaration of the\n1990s as the Third Disarmament Decade.\nIt is important to note that at its forty-ninth session\nthe General Assembly adopted resolution 49/75 B of 15\nDecember 1994, in which it decided to undertake, at its\nfiftieth session, such a review and appraisal. The\nAssembly requested the Disarmament Commission, at its\n1995 session, to make a preliminary assessment of the\nimplementation of the Declaration and of suggestions that\nmight be put forth to ensure appropriate progress. We\nregret to note that despite extensive efforts to agree on\nconsensus language, there was a divergence of views and\nit was not possible to reach a consensus. It is\ndisappointing to note that delegations were not willing to\nengage in serious negotiations to find even small areas of\ncommon ground.\nIn recent decades the Organization of African Unity\n(OAU) has also adopted a number of other resolutions on\ndisarmament and on the denuclearization of the African\ncontinent. Convinced that the establishment of nuclear-\nweapon-free zones can contribute to the strengthening of\nthe international non-proliferation regime, the sixtieth\nordinary session of the OAU Council of Ministers\nadopted a resolution in which the OAU Secretary-General\nwas requested to convene a joint meeting of the\nOrganization of African Unity inter-governmental group\nof experts and the Group of Experts to Prepare a Draft\nTreaty on an African Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone set up\njointly by the Organization of African Unity and the\nUnited Nations. This initiative needs the unrelenting\nsupport of the international community, in particular that\nof the nuclear-weapon States, through their accession to\nthe protocols that concern them in connection with the\nreduction and prohibition of the use and testing of all\nweapons of mass destruction.\nMy Government, like the Governments of all African\nStates, is convinced that the establishment of nuclear-\nweapon-free zones worldwide, through the encouragement\nof the United Nations \u2014 especially in the Middle East, as\nalready proposed by Egypt \u2014 would enhance the security\nof Africa and the subsequent viability of the African\nnuclear-weapon-free zone.\n6\n\n\nIn the social and human rights field, the United\nNations continues to make some progress. The World\nSummit for Social Development, held at Copenhagen in\nMarch, was a milestone in humankind\u2019s quest for consensus\non universal standards for social development. The\nimplementation of the undertakings which the Heads of\nState or Government made needs to be monitored closely\nin order to assess the degree of progress being made in\nachieving those undertakings. In this regard, the 20/20\ncompact is an important step in the direction of\ninternational collaboration to achieve balanced development\nof the social sector. It is the intention of my Government to\nfulfil its commitment to allocate 20 per cent of its\ndevelopment budgetary allocation to the social sector; we\nexpect our development partners to meet us half way in this\nendeavour.\nThe outcome of the Fourth World Conference on\nWomen is still very fresh in our minds, having been\nachieved only a few weeks ago. Although it was\nunfortunate that some countries found it necessary to enter\nreservations in respect of certain paragraphs of the Platform\nfor Action, we are encouraged that a significant step\nforward was taken towards the goal of recognizing the right\nof women to be equal partners with men and to have\ncomplete control over all aspects of their lives. The triple\ngoals of equality, development and peace, enunciated 20\nyears ago in Mexico City, underscore the undeniable truth\nthat development and peace are not feasible while half of\nthe world\u2019s population is discriminated against and not\nallowed to realize its full potential. My delegation reaffirms\nour Government\u2019s determination to forge ahead with vigour\nwith the implementation of the Platform for Action until the\nfull emancipation of women is attained. In this connection,\nI should like to call for an early follow-up and review\nconference lest the momentum generated in Beijing be lost.\nThere is a widely held myth that the developing world\nis experiencing a high growth rate because of the\nremarkable economic performance of East Asia. How can\nthis be true when a total of 47 developing countries\nclassified as least-developed countries continue to fight for\nsurvival? These countries account for 10 per cent of the\nworld\u2019s population but earn only 0.1 per cent of the global\nincome. For over two decades now, they have continued to\nexperience serious declines in per capita income. Their\nshare of world trade has declined from 0.6 per cent in 1980\nto 0.2 per cent in 1992.\nAfrica continues to be the region most in need of help.\nThe 1995 economic growth indicators, however, present an\nencouraging picture. For the first time in over six years, the\neconomic-growth rate is projected to match the\npopulation-growth rate, which is, unfortunately, the\nhighest in the world.\nAfrica has been used over the past 20 years, and is\nstill being used, as a policy laboratory for the Bretton\nWoods institutions. It is regrettable that today, as the\nUnited Nations celebrates its fiftieth year since the\nsigning of the Organization\u2019s Charter in San Francisco,\nmany people in Africa continue to live under even harsher\nconditions of poverty, hunger, disease, civil war and\nnatural disaster. The plight of the African continent\nremains a major challenge for the emerging world order.\nThere is an urgent need for a stronger consolidated effort\nto pull the continent out of the poverty trap into which it\ncontinues to sink.\nA few months ago at Geneva, the Economic and\nSocial Council, at the high-level segment of its 1995\nsubstantive session, deliberated an item entitled \u201cThe\ndevelopment of Africa, including the implementation of\nthe United Nations New Agenda for the Development of\nAfrica in the 1990s\u201d. The high-level segment recognized\nthat, among all the five regions of the world, Africa\ncontinues to be the only one lagging far behind in terms\nof development and that it remains the most marginalized\nin the world economy.\nAllow me at this juncture to take this opportunity to\napplaud the Government of National Unity of the\nRepublic of South Africa for having embarked on a\nreconstruction and development programme as a strategy\nfor tackling the thorny issue of the economic imbalances\ncreated by the policies of apartheid. It is important for the\ninternational community to realize that the entire southern\nAfrican subregion was as much affected and that it still\nsuffers from the impact of the apartheid legacy. Any\ninternational support for the implementation of the\nreconstruction and development programme in South\nAfrica should take this fact into account.\nThe southern African States members of the\nSouthern African Development Community continue to\npay priority attention to closer and stronger integration of\ntheir economies. The international community should\nmake its best endeavours to ensure that our efforts are\nadequately supported through complementary financial\nand technological support, including improved terms of\ntrade, increased flows of direct foreign investment and\nappropriate debt relief measures.\n7\n\n\nLesotho, as a land-locked and least developed country,\nattaches great importance to issues of concern to the least\ndeveloping countries, particularly their transit transport\nproblems. We welcome the adoption by the\nintergovernmental meeting of the land-locked and transit\ndeveloping countries, donor countries and financial\ninstitutions of a framework for cooperation to alleviate\ntransit transport problems of the land-locked States and of\ntheir transit neighbours. It is our sincere belief that this\nsession of the General Assembly will seriously address\nitself to the provisions of this framework, with a view to\nspeeding up their implementation.\nThe Programme of Action for the Least Developed\nCountries for the 1990s remains largely unimplemented.\nLesotho, as a least developed country, is seriously\nconcerned about this.\nIn Lesotho, as in many other countries in Africa and\nother regions, we have undertaken far-reaching political\nreforms, thus heeding the international clarion call to\nrestore democratic administration, popular participation,\naccountability and good governance. These reforms have\nbeen undertaken amidst painful but necessary structural\nadjustment programmes intended to improve our\nmacroeconomic policies and structures. The international\ncommunity needs to realize that the success and\nsustainability of all these reforms cannot be guaranteed\nunless they bring about tangible results and satisfy the\nexpectations of our people, particularly the most\ndisadvantaged.\nOur cooperating partners, in the forefront of advocates\nof democratic rule, seem to be relinquishing their\nresponsibility of seeing to it that democratic institutions are\nsustained. In most of our countries our fledgling\ndemocracies face the serious challenge posed by lack of\nresources initially promised by our friends. We see\nemerging in each of our countries pockets of discontent\nwhich in essence challenge and destabilize the very shaky\nfoundations of our young democracies. We in Lesotho\nunderstand very well the complementarity of democracy\nand development, and it is on this basis that we call upon\nour partners to carry out as a matter of urgency their\ninternational responsibility, particularly in this area.\nFor two consecutive years now, Lesotho has been\nexperiencing an unprecedented devastating drought, which\nhas adversely affected food production. This year the\nquantity of acreage cultivated was substantially reduced,\ndue to lack of rainfall. As a result of the drought, the\nGovernment had to declare a state of food emergency and\nsend urgent appeals to our traditional and new food\ndonors for a helping hand. Unfortunately, not very\nencouraging responses have so far been received. It is\ntherefore my humble duty and responsibility to renew this\nappeal to the international community through the\nAssembly.\nToday\u2019s world is increasingly being made smaller\nand smaller by technological advances. Developments in\none part of the world are of direct relevance and interest\nto other parts of the world. Closer cooperation and\ncollaboration between partners is more urgently needed\nthan ever before. South-South cooperation has to be\nfurther strengthened and universalized. In this regard, the\nimportance of triangular arrangements for promoting and\nexpanding South-South cooperation cannot be over-\nemphasized. Furthermore, increased transfer of modern\nproductive and efficient technologies is a necessary\ncondition for all the nations of the world to be able to\nfulfil their obligations and commitment to leave man\u2019s\ncommon heritage \u2014 the Earth \u2014 in a condition that will\nenable future generations to sustain life on it.\nMany of us are doing our best to develop the full\npotential of our human resources through education, good\nhealth, a clean living and working environment and\nnutrition. We have put in place appropriate policies to\nensure the realization of this noble objective. We are\nworried about slow progress towards the discovery of a\npermanent cure for the HIV/AIDS pandemic, and would\nurge all humankind not to spare any effort or resources\nuntil this menace has been vanquished. We therefore join\nthe appeals for increased political commitment and\nfinancial and material support for scientific and other\nresearch that will lead to the discovery of a cure for this\ndisease.\nFor a long time the nations of the world have\nexpressed their desire to enhance the international justice\nsystem. The recognition that an international criminal\ncourt was an essential element in building respect for\nhuman rights throughout the world led the Members of\nthe United Nations nearly half a century ago to pledge to\ncreate a new system of international justice. Progress in\nthis regard has, however, been slow.\nThe atrocities in the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda\nprovided an impetus to establish a permanent international\ncriminal court. Lesotho supports the view that a\npermanent international criminal court should be\nestablished by 1996. We believe that the most practical\nmethod of establishing such a court is by a multilateral\n8\n\n\ntreaty that would enter into force following ratification by\na reasonable number of States. It is our fervent belief that\nsuch a court would be the living embodiment of the\nfundamental principles of international criminal law.\nBesides being able to hold individual perpetrators of human\nrights violations personally liable, the court would\ncomplement prosecutions in national courts by acting when\nStates were unwilling or unable to bring perpetrators to\njustice.\nThe commendable efforts of the International Law\nCommission in preparing the draft statute for the court are\nto be applauded. It now remains for Governments and other\norgans of civil society to strengthen the draft statute to\nensure that it is a model of justice, fairness and\neffectiveness.\n"

        "file_text": "There is, of course, a special\nresonance to the congratulations we offer the President on\nhis election to this high post at the fiftieth session of the\nGeneral Assembly. In this watershed year, his job will be\nparticularly challenging. The delegation of Belize pledges\nits fullest cooperation in helping to ensure the success of\nhis stewardship.\nAll the world is conscious of the historic significance\nof this fiftieth anniversary year. And a lot of work has gone\ninto the process leading up to this session. We also at this\njuncture, then, express our thanks to the President\u2019s\npredecessor, His Excellency Mr. Amara Essy, and those\nwhose job it has been to supervise and implement the\npreparatory effort.\nIf this is a year of celebration, it is also a year of\nreckoning. Inevitably, the jubilee has concentrated attention\nas never before on our Organization. Can we withstand the\nscrutiny we provoke? Is our record one that, on balance,\nvindicates the vision of the founders? And in a world that\nis almost unrecognizably transformed since 1945, are we\nequipped for the changing role the United Nations must\nnow play?\nWell over 100 States have come into being since\n1945. The myriad issues that now dominate the global\nagenda are attended by a host of problems. The duties and\nburdens of the United Nations system have therefore\nproliferated hugely. Can the United Nations cope? And are\nwe, the Member States, prepared to invest our enterprise\nwith the resources necessary to deal with the new realities.\nThese, it seems, are the questions most urgently in\nneed of answers.\nIn thinking of the future, though, we would do well to\nlook at the past. And I would wish briefly now to examine\nour historical record, highlighting some issues of special\nrelevance to small countries such as Belize.\nJust four days ago, Belize celebrated the fourteenth\nanniversary of its independence. It was an independence\nlong delayed by the territorial claim of a neighbouring\ncountry. But it the end it was an independence made\npossible in no small measure by this Organization and its\nrole in world affairs.\nOne of the things that in the first place made our\naspiration for sovereignty realistic, was the seminal 1960\nGeneral Assembly Declaration on the Granting of\nIndependence to Colonial Countries and Peoples. And the\nUnited Nations thereafter became our guiding star as we\nsteered our course between the Scylla of the historical\ncolonialism from which we were escaping and the\nCharybdis of the recolonization that was inherent in the\nterritorial claim.\nDuring the years of our independent existence, this\nOrganization has similarly continued to be a bedrock of\nour viability. The principles enshrined in the Charter, and\nthe international legal order derived from those principles,\nhave been a welcome guarantee of our sovereignty. The\nterritorial claim has not gone away. But the norms\nimposed by the United Nations, especially those requiring\npacific settlement of disputes among Member States, have\nat least helped to keep it from confounding our integrity.\nWho can doubt that, in one form or another, this\nsalutary experience of Belize with the United Nations has\nbeen replicated by any number of small countries?\nBecause of the multiplication of new States, especially\nsince 1960, the international order has been characterized\nby an unprecedented differentiation in underlying power\ncapabilities between the huge and the tiny. Very weak\nStates can, of course, never seriously hope to influence\ninternational behaviour solely through the use of their\nnational power capabilities. What the United Nations has\ndone for us, then, has been to offer a plenitude of\nsustenance via its many entities and constituent groupings.\nIn effect, the set of opportunities created by the character\nof post-Second-World-War international organizations that\nhave been the United Nations and its progeny has made\nsovereign equality a very real concept, power\nasymmetries notwithstanding.\nFor small States, certainly, the political and\ndiplomatic vitality of the United Nations system is a\nmatter of undeniable fact. Nevertheless, the United\nNations should continue to enhance cooperation with\nregional organizations, as it did last session when this\nAssembly resolved to institutionalize cooperation with the\nCaribbean Community. Belize was honoured to introduce\nthat resolution.\nLikewise, the principle of inclusiveness should be\nemployed to ensure that States in the various regions of\nthe world, including Asia and the Pacific, are not\nconfined to incomplete participation in the international\norder.\n22\n\n\nI turn now to the economic sphere. The record of our\nOrganization is, I am afraid, rather less compelling. It is\ntrue that various organs of the United Nations system \u2014\nthe United Nations Conference on Trade and Development\n(UNCTAD), the United Nations Industrial Development\nOrganization (UNIDO), the Economic Commission for\nLatin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC), the United\nNations Development Programme (UNDP) \u2014 have\nprovided small States with an unprecedented forum for the\narticulation of our concerns. Even now, Belize prepares to\nassume its elected seat on the Executive Board of the\nUnited Nations Development Programme. But continuing\nlarge disparities in wealth between rich and poor countries,\nthe debilitating debt consuming us in the developing world,\nthe unemployment, the persistent poverty, speak volumes as\nto the absence of sufficient progress on this front.\nSince the last general debate, the World Trade\nOrganization has come into being. In the Americas, the\nHemispheric Summit is now a matter of record. But we\nnote with regret that, even as liberalization advances, the\ncall of the disadvantaged for special and differential\ntreatment goes unheeded. This is accompanied by the\ncontinuing volatility of the international trading and\nfinancial systems, and the well-known vulnerability of small\ncountries to external shocks.\nFor us in Belize, negative economic trends among our\nmajor trading partners have had a baneful effect. This, in\nturn, has served to heighten our concern over the nature and\npace of globalization. The structural changes that fragile\neconomies need to make in order to be in step threaten to\nswamp us. But no one seems to be paying attention.\nPerhaps new forms of regionalism are the answer. One\narguable example is the new Association of Caribbean\nStates, which will create the world\u2019s fourth or fifth largest\nmarket area and of which Belize is the geographical centre\nand the cultural bridge.\nYet it is essential, we contend, that the international\ncommunity exhibit full sensitivity to the condition of\nsmallness. We remain highly susceptible to changes in the\nglobal marketplace; and adverse developments then impose\nadditional setbacks on us in the areas of competitiveness,\ndevelopment finance and overall fragility. For Belize, the\nrecent crisis in neighbouring Mexico, starkly dramatized our\nown precariousness.\nGenerally, we think, the impact of the events in\nMexico on the markets and economies of other countries\nserves as a clear warning. It is foolhardy to believe that\ninflexible social and economic formulas can be applied\nuniformly to our differing circumstances. Heedless\nadjustment and implacable time-tables might well\ncondemn small economies to extinction.\nIndeed, many of our small countries have already\nmade strenuous efforts at stabilization and reform. We\nhave liberalized trade, reduced fiscal deficits and\nprivatized State enterprises. But where are the rewards?\nWe continue to be overcome by debt, by poverty and by\nwoefully inadequate social and physical infrastructures.\nAnd our difficulties are exacerbated rather than solved by\nthe austerities that reduce government spending and\ncurtail our public sector investment programmes.\nTime is not on our side, as economic and fiscal\northodoxy bear inexorably down on us. Our constituencies\ncontinue to press us: Where is the understanding of our\nplight? Why is there is no capital inflow revival? What is\nto be done about the alarmingly high rate of\nunemployment? When will we see the special\nmechanisms to assist us with retraining, the moulding of\nnew technologies, and the critically needed human\nresources development? Can we ever seriously hope for\nthe dedicated financial resources that must underpin any\nserious effort at diversification?\nWe are being told that this liberalization advance \u2014\nthis march of the martinets \u2014 is the panacea for our ills,\nbut the evidence to the contrary is quite startling. For our\ndomestic producers, for our banana farmers, it is a bitter\njoke. Global free trade, it seems to many of us, is like the\nHoly Roman Empire: not holy, not Roman, not an\nempire.\nThe Bretton Woods institutions certainly need to\ndemonstrate more creativity. Their too-rigid reliance on\nthe prevailing orthodoxy is choking us. Democracy in\nsmall countries will not be worth a fig if this auto-da-f\u00e9-\ntype insistence on these articles of faith is not leavened\nby a real appreciation of our peculiar needs.\nIt is in this context that we also call for this\nOrganization to promote true global cooperation in efforts\ntowards sustainable development. This shared quest must\nbe the essence of the economic relations and the\ndevelopment dialogue between the North and the South\nand among the developing countries themselves. My\nGovernment certainly pledges full support for the United\nNations Development Programme (UNDP) Unit on\nSouth-South Cooperation, well exemplified by the Ruta\nMaya tourism project of our Central America. We also\n23\n\n\ncall for support for strengthening the Alliance for the\nSustainable Development of Central America, a major\ninitiative for developing what we call our delicate filigree\nisthmus. And we welcome such relationships as Belize\u2019s\nrecently concluded joint implementation pilot programme\nunder the Climate Change Convention.\nThe overarching goal of our precursors was\n\u201cto save succeeding generations from the scourge of\nwar\u201d.\nWell, how have we been doing on that score?\nIn the sphere of peace and security, some grave\ndevelopments have taken place in various parts of the\nworld. In several places genocidal impulses have been let\nloose, with predictably devastating results. Paradoxically\nenough, the end of the cold war has resulted in an upsurge\nof civil and territorial strife. Fratricidal conflicts have been\nlaunched to the drumbeat of overblown notions of history\nand dangerous concepts of ethnicity. For all the Assembly\u2019s\nefforts, we continue to experience a relative stalemate in\nCyprus and elsewhere. The Balkan conundrum still seems\nintractable, though we note with encouragement that this\nOrganization has recognized that there is a limit beyond\nwhich forbearance ceases to be a virtue. Rwanda refuses to\ngo away.\nYet we hail now the breakthrough in Palestine, and we\nagain rejoice at the continuation of peace and stability in\nSouth Africa. In Namibia, Mozambique and Angola, the\nUnited Nations has assisted, or is assisting, in bringing civil\nwars to an end.\nIn my own part of the world, the continuing United\nNations partnership with the people of Haiti is consolidating\nreconstruction and democracy in that Caribbean country.\nDespite the limitations on our resources, Belize is happy\nnow to be able to play a commanding role in the Caribbean\nCommunity and Common Market (CARICOM) sub-unit of\nthe United Nations Mission in Haiti.\nLikewise, the United Nations Observer Mission in El\nSalvador is successfully overseeing efforts to cement the\nnewly minted peace. In Guatemala, the dialogue between\nthe URNG and the Government, begun under the auspices\nof our Secretary-General, is proceeding apace.\nMy Government takes great satisfaction in the calm\nthat reigns almost universally on our continent, from\nHispaniola to Tierra del Fuego. The disappearance of\nauthoritarian Governments in Latin America and the\nresolution of most of our internal conflicts is bringing\nliberty and democracy to all our peoples. Our efforts can\ntherefore be committed fully now to the business of\nfostering economic and social development, human rights\nand the protection of the environment. As the first-ever\nDefence Ministerial Meeting of the Americas confirmed,\nour militaries are fully cognizant of the new role they\nmust play in supporting this process.\nWe therefore applaud the strong and clear views on\nnuclear sanity expressed during the Conference on the\nextension of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT)\nand currently being reiterated. This delegation reaffirms\nits own view that the parties to the NPT have now\ninvested in the nuclear Powers a trusteeship that those\nPowers must zealously discharge.\nAt the same time, we must be equally aware of the\nother danger: the continued production, trade and use of\nall types of so-called conventional weapons that harm,\nmaim and kill.\nIn the context of more general concerns, we cannot\nescape the overdue obligation to rationalize also the\nstructure of the Security Council, so that the veto is\ntamed and equity and democratization take centre stage.\nWe continue to insist that all regions obtain balanced and\nequal representation as permanent members; small\ncountries be brought into the Council\u2019s decision- making;\nand consideration be given to such devices as multipartite\nseats or constituency groupings.\nOne final word on the question of peace and\nsecurity. The Secretary-General has stressed the multitude\nof new demands for peace-keeping made upon the\nOrganization as conflicts erupt around the world. The\ncaution has been expressed that the increased burdens in\nthis regard should not displace the attention that economic\nand social questions demand. Of course, the two are\ninterrelated. It is a truism that there can be no\ndevelopment without peace. We would content ourselves,\nthen, with merely urging that we put in place a more\ncoordinated system to embrace peace-keeping and conflict\nresolution as well as human rights and social and\neconomic development.\nAlso, the non-traditional threats to peace and security\nmust be addressed. In recent years we have witnessed\ngrowing links among organized crime, drug trafficking,\nterrorism and the spread of armaments. The dangers from\nthis phenomenon are all the more insidious for being\n24\n\n\nnovel. We must therefore quickly develop the international\ncooperation measures to deal with it.\nSo, as this Organization completes its fiftieth year, we\nin Belize are well convinced of its continuing vitality. The\njeremiads of those that bemoan its failures are not for us.\nWhile we are not going to be Pollyannaish about what is\nadmittedly a mixed record, we see enough to be sanguine\nabout.\nThere is extraordinary cooperation on the part of\nStates, other political entities and non-governmental\norganizations in the dozens of areas of substantive concern\nof the United Nations organs; in the burgeoning,\nmultidimensional sphere of sustainable development; in the\nterritory where humane concerns and values, social ordering\nand cultural norms coalesce; and in the field of\npeace-keeping, of providing States and peoples with\nsecurity from violence and disorder.\nOf course there is still a long way to go. And we will\nnever truly realize the vision of the founders unless\nMember States agree to provide the future United Nations\nsystem with adequate, reliable and predictable resources.\nLet us therefore, during this our half-century session,\ndetermine to enhance our effectiveness. Let us rationalize,\nlet us economize. Let us pay our dues in full and on time.\nAnd let us intensify the quest for agreement on autonomous\nfinancing for the Organization and for related activities.\nAbove all, let us dedicate ourselves to universality and\npledge to enlarge our image and re-energize the world. For\nthat day may still be greatly postponed when our\nresolutions and decisions, rather than blood and iron, will\nsummarily determine the great international questions.\nBut in continuing efforts at global conflict avoidance,\nwe are still, if the Assembly will forgive the colloquialism,\nthe only game in town. In other words, true international\npeace and security can only ever come by way of the\nUnited Nations, which remains the last, best hope for\nmankind.\n"

I assure\nyou, at this stage, of the cooperation of my delegation.\nWe commit ourselves to doing everything to support this\narduous but honourable task with humility and a sense of\nresponsibility.\nI cannot let this opportunity pass without expressing\nmy appreciation to the outgoing President, Mr. Amara\nEssy, for the dedication and interest with which he carried\nout the activities of the Assembly during his mandate.\nSimilarly, I address my remarks to the Secretary-General,\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, who has tenaciously done\neverything, to find the very best solutions for the\nproblems afflicting humanity, pledging to provide our\nOrganization with the dynamism needed to face future\nchallenges.\nThe fiftieth session of the General Assembly, which\ncoincides with the fiftieth anniversary of the founding of\nthe United Nations, provides us with an opportunity to\nengage in profound reflection on the extent to which we\nhave moved forward towards the realization of its main\ngoals, inter alia, preservation of international peace and\nsecurity, promotion and protection of human rights, and\neconomic and social development, with a view to looking\nmore optimistically and more boldly at the challenges\nwhich lie ahead on the eve of the twenty-first century.\nIn fact, although the changes that took place in the\nwake of the cold war led to a certain easing in\ninternational relations and promoted, as never before,\ndemocratic values, the international situation nevertheless\nhas continued to deteriorate in recent times in the\npolitical, economic, social and financial spheres. Conflicts\nof all sorts proliferate, affecting principally the countries\nof the so-called third world and creating a climate of\nuncertainty as to the future of humankind.\nAs we approach the twenty-first century, we face\nnew and greater challenges that will necessitate joint,\n12\n\n\nconcerted action by the Members of the United Nations.\nThis will require a new democratic structure in international\nrelations, in the broadest sense.\nMore than ever before, we need to think about the\nobjectives and role of the United Nations, as set out in the\nCharter, and focus on that task.\nThe process of restructuring the United Nations should\nlead the Organization to an arrangement that reflects the\nnew challenges we face in the world at this time and that\nwould allow for the broad participation of its Members. We\nare convinced that the present structure of the United\nNations \u2014 and in particular that of the Security Council \u2014\ndoes not meet the present needs of post-cold-war\ninternational relations. Apart from the restructuring\nundertaken in the agencies that coordinate economic and\nsocial development worldwide, priority should be given to\nthe restructuring of the Security Council, whose\ncomposition continues to be a reflection of the cold war.\nThe enlargement of the Council should take place with\nrespect to the categories of permanent and non-permanent\nmembers alike. This will require taking into consideration\nthe need for geographic balance.\nWe are also in favour of restructuring the methods of\nwork of the United Nations so as to make them more\ntransparent.\nFurthermore, it is important to guarantee the\neffectiveness of the mechanisms and means of ensuring\nimplementation of the decisions of United Nations organs.\nIn recent years, the General Assembly has adopted\nnumerous resolutions, and important global strategies have\nbeen defined in various forums under the aegis of the\nUnited Nations, aimed at solving problems afflicting all\nhumankind. These problems range from the living\nconditions of children, the environment, human rights,\npopulation problems and social development to, more\nrecently, the issue of the situation of women, dealt with at\nthe Beijing Conference.\nThe time has come to take action. The unsatisfactory\nfunctioning of some of the mechanisms for monitoring the\napplication of decisions and the weak commitment of States\nhave been the root cause of the failure to carry out many of\nthese recommendations.\nThe world socio-economic situation continues to\ndeteriorate, particularly in the so-called developing\ncountries, where many economies are on the verge of\ncollapse.\nPublic assistance for development has sunk to\ndeplorable levels. United Nations agencies involved in\ndevelopment have seen their budgets severely affected by\nthe financial crisis, resulting in cuts in numerous\nprogrammes that were destined to help raise development\nindicators in various countries. To give just one example,\nthe annual report of the Secretary-General indicates that\nthe United Nations Development Programme experienced\na reduction of $1.4 billion in the period 1992-1996.\nStructural adjustment programmes undertaken in\nvarious countries have not produced the desired results,\nleading to reductions in national funds in the social field.\nThese negative factors are cumulative, and added to them\nis the heavy burden of external debt, whose service alone\nconsumes a large part of the gross national product of\ndebtor countries.\nAfrica\u2019s capacity to repay debt has been negatively\naffected not only by weak economic structures inherited\nfrom the past, but also by natural disasters and internal\narmed conflicts. In view of this situation, it is necessary\nto adopt measures that are more just and less prejudicial,\nso that debtor countries can pay their external debt\nwithout hindering their development or requiring further\nsacrifices on the part of the poorest segments of their\npopulations.\nThe principal international financial institutions\nshould grant more favourable credit to developing\ncountries, so that the remedies applied to their respective\neconomies will not lead to a deterioration of the health of\nthose economies.\nThe present international economic order does not\nfavour the economies of the so-called third world. It is\nthus necessary to have a more just international economic\norder, without protectionist measures that impede\ninternational business relations and create discrimination\nagainst developing countries, the majority of which\nbecome sources of raw materials and inexpensive labour\nand importers of manufactured goods.\nThe strengthening of south-south cooperation and\nregional economic integration will, as we see it, be an\nadequate response to this trend. Countries of the southern\nregion of Africa, to which Angola belongs, have provided\na good example of regional integration, both economic\nand political, by forming the Southern African\nDevelopment Community (SADC). Given the prospects\nfor total political stability in the region and its economic\npotential, the region may well transform itself into an\n13\n\n\nimportant development zone. In the same way we value the\njoint regional integration between members of the Zone of\nPeace and Cooperation of the South Atlantic, of which\nAngola is also a member.\nIn successive resolutions the General Assembly has\nrecommended that priority be given to our continent in\nterms of aid for development, because it is the region of the\nworld that has most suffered the tragic effects of\ncolonialism. But reality shows a significant drop in\nresources available for development. This aggravates the\nprecarious economic situation of African countries that have\nno capital and no technology, which increases poverty and\nmakes them susceptible to serious internal conflict.\nIf, as we have just indicated, it is true that we are\nwitnessing, nearly everywhere, some proliferation of\nregional conflicts that put peace and international security\nat risk, it is also true that in Africa these conflicts have\nreached a level of great danger. Not only is the dimension\nof such conflicts a source of concern but so is their nature.\nIts markedly ethnic, racial or religious character is being\nused to justify intentions which place at risk the unity and\nterritorial integrity of several nations.\nThe inadmissible genocide that occurred in Rwanda\nseriously damaged the values of human dignity and\ntolerance. Above all, it demonstrated the need for the\ninternational community to seek new ways and means to\neliminate the focal points of conflict and to guarantee\nprotection for civilian populations, the people who are the\nprimary victims of internal conflicts.\nIn Burundi we are concerned about the deteriorating\ninternal situation. In this connection the international\ncommunity, and the United Nations in particular, should\nshoulder their responsibilities in order to help avoid the\nrepetition in that country of earlier events by supporting by\nevery means available the efforts carried out by the\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU) mission with a view\nto fostering peace and stability.\nIn Somalia the continuing fratricidal war that is tearing\nthat society apart is threatening the very existence and\nintegrity of the country. The international community, and\nthe United Nations in particular, cannot and should not fail\nto shoulder its responsibilities vis-\u00e0-vis the people of\nSomalia.\nWe pay tribute to Liberia for the recent developments\nin that country, thanks to the recent Abuja peace agreement\nbetween the warring parties. We hope that this agreement\nwill finally bring lasting peace to the Liberian people.\nConcerning Western Sahara, we join our voice to the\nvoice of the international community in urging the\ninterested parties to observe the United Nations peace\nplan.\nDespite its own internal difficulties, the Government\nof the Republic of Angola is doing its utmost to support\nOAU efforts within the framework of African\nmechanisms of prevention, management and resolution of\nconflicts. In that context we did not hesitate to make a\ncontribution to a resolution of the crisis faced by the\npeople of the Republic of Sao Tome and Principe after\nthe coup d\u2019\u00e9tat of 15 August. As the Assembly will be\naware, Angolan mediation helped to restore democratic\ninstitutions and constitutional order in that country. We\nhave acted on behalf of the historic solidarity which links\nour two peoples in a common struggle for democratic\nliberties and respect for the law of constitutional\ninstitutions.\nThanks to the support provided by the international\ncommunity, particularly the Portuguese-speaking\ncountries, along with the European Union, France and\nPortugal in particular, and of course the Secretary-General\nof the United Nations, we were able, in a short period of\ntime, to get an agreement between the parties on 22\nAugust last.\nThe conflict in the countries of the former\nYugoslavia is one of the most complex conflicts seen in\nEurope since the end of the cold war. The Government of\nAngola is concerned about this conflict. We support the\ncurrent peace initiatives and hope that the meeting\nbetween the parties involved and the mediators will lead\nto concrete results, to the satisfaction of the peoples of\nthe region.\nThe situation in the Middle East has been marked by\nsome important and significant developments since the\nsigning of the agreement between Israel and the Palestine\nLiberation Organization (PLO) and the beginning of the\nnormalization of bilateral relations among countries of the\nregion.\nSuch advances are quite encouraging. We are\nconfident of a final end to the Arab-Israeli conflict if we\ncontinue to see political will, a constructive spirit and\nflexibility demonstrated on all sides. Angola has always\ndefended the right to self-determination of the people of\n14\n\n\nPalestine and the restitution of the occupied Arab territories.\nWe here reiterate our support for the peace process that is\nunder way and express our opposition to acts of violence\nintended to call into question the continuation of this\nprocess.\nThe question of East Timor continues to prick the\nconscience of the international community. It is necessary\nto ensure that the people of East Timor enjoy the legitimate\nright freely to choose its own destiny and that this be\nrecognized. In this regard the United Nations has an\nimportant responsibility, which it cannot escape.\nWe are particularly encouraged by the opening of a\ndialogue between Portugal and Indonesia. But there will be\npositive results only if the interests and options of the\npeople of the Territory are borne in mind during the search\nfor a just and acceptable solution.\nAngola shares with the people of East Timor a\ncommon past of struggle against Portuguese colonialism.\nWe will continue to give our utmost to the search for a just\nand acceptable solution.\nBy sustaining an economic, commercial and financial\nembargo against Cuba for more than 30 years the United\nStates of America has created a paradox within the reality\nof our times. The embargo is a set-back to international\nefforts to eliminate the last relics of the cold war. Angola\ntherefore reiterates its opposition to this unilateral measure,\nwhose extraterritorial impact is in violation of international\nnorms of free trade and international law.\nPractice shows that constructive dialogue is the best\nsolution for resolving differences, similar to that which\noccurred in reaching a solution to the problem of migration\nbetween the two countries. We think that it is up to the\npeople of Cuba freely to decide their own destiny.\nObviously, I cannot refrain from making reference to\nthe situation in my own country, which will be of interest\nto many here. As is known, after long years of war Angola\nfinally found the path to peace, starting with the signature\nof the Lusaka Protocol and the initial steps taken to\nimplement its provisions. It is an agreement that\ncomplements the fundamental structure of the peace process\nestablished by the Bicesse Accords, which were signed with\nthe mediation of the Government of Portugal.\nSince the signature of the Lusaka document in 1991\nand the cease-fire agreed to in November last year, the\nsituation in our country has evolved significantly, despite\nsome negative aspects and obstacles that I shall mention\nshortly. Major offensive military actions have stopped,\nleading to the free movement of people and goods in\nmany areas of the country under Government control. We\nare now seeing the return of thousands of displaced\ncitizens to their areas of origin.\nIn the political area, a direct dialogue has begun\nbetween the Government and UNITA, between His\nExcellency the President of Angola and Mr. Savimbi.\nThis has facilitated the resolution of many problems\nrelated to the implementation of the Accords that were\nnot resolved at Lusaka.\nIn addition, the Government has taken important\nsteps to strengthen the climate of mutual trust and to\nmake reconciliation possible. Within this context, the\nGovernment supported a legislative initiative to modify\nthe Constitution to accommodate the leader of UNITA as\none of the two Vice-Presidents of the Republic. That\nsignificant political gesture, along with the future\nintegration of UNITA members in a government of\nnational unity, will create conditions for Angolans to\nenjoy a definitive and lasting peace in a climate of\ntolerance, free from hatreds or resentment.\nDespite those efforts, which my Government views\nas positive, we continue to be concerned by the excessive\ndelays in the implementation of the peace process, whose\nmost serious issue is the quartering and demobilization of\nUNITA forces, which has not yet been implemented as it\nshould have been under the Lusaka Accords. This delay\nhas resulted in some serious recent problems and\nincidents in some regions of the country. Such incidents\ndo not at this time pose a serious threat to peace, but they\nare capable of creating dangerous focal points of tension\nthat call into question the trust that is needed for full\nimplementation of the Peace Accords.\nMy Government would like to take this opportunity\nto express its gratitude for the work done by the United\nNations Observer Mission in Angola. It has by and large\nassured respect for the provisions of the Peace Accords\nand has involved the presence of many countries\nrepresented here. We believe that the complete\ndeployment of peace-keeping infantry units will make it\npossible better to control the implementation of the\ncommitments made in Lusaka.\nThe post-conflict phase in Angola will require urgent\nmeasures of a special economic and social nature in order\nto move the country rapidly out of the state of crisis, to\n15\n\n\nrebuild its productive and social infrastructures and to\nprevent a return to war, measures which must guarantee the\nsocial reintegration of thousands of military personnel, of\nwhom some 150,000 are to be demobilized, and the return\nof refugees and internally displaced persons who are\nreturning to their areas of origin.\nAs I speak, a meeting is being held in Brussels\nbetween my country and the European Community to come\nup with an overall plan for national reconciliation. From\nthis rostrum we should like to express our thanks to all\ncountries that have assisted us and to all the United Nations\nagencies that have made it possible to organize this\nimportant meeting, the first round table meeting in Brussels.\nMy Government has entered in earnest on to the task of\nachieving national reconciliation in our country. As we said\nearlier, a community rehabilitation programme has been\ncreated, in collaboration with the United Nations, to this\nend. It has a budget of $700 million that will be open to all\ndonor countries in Brussels with a view, inter alia, to\nrestoring in the shortest possible time basic production\nactivity in the 18 provinces of the country.\nWe are aware that the rapid recovery of the Angolan\neconomy will depend largely on our success in\nimplementing this programme and achieving peace and\nharmony in our country. It is an economy that saw its gross\nnational product and per capita income decrease by one half\nas a consequence of war. Thus, we would like once again\nto request the international community to continue to lend\nassistance to Angola in order to achieve complete peace and\nreconciliation among all Angolans. We hope that can\nbecome a reality.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr President, let me\ncongratulate you and your country, Portugal, on your\nelection as President of the fiftieth session of the General\nAssembly. At the same time, I wish to thank your\ndistinguished predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Amara\nEssy.\nItaly fully supports the statement made by the\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Spain in his capacity as\nChairman of the European Union, and wishes to add the\nfollowing considerations.\nThe fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations is an\nopportunity for us to reflect on the Organization\u2019s past\nachievements and future role. The fundamental challenge\nof the United Nations has always been the maintenance of\ninternational peace and security, to which Italy has\ncontributed by participating in several peace-keeping\noperations, in which some of our young men have lost\ntheir lives. Our experience has convinced us that the\nUnited Nations should expand its role in the areas of\npreventive diplomacy, peace-keeping and peace building.\nThe activity that has provoked more controversy in recent\nyears, peace enforcement, must take place under the\nmandate of the Security Council, but the Council can\ndelegate such operations to coalitions of States or regional\narrangements, thereby drawing on their valuable military\nexpertise, particularly in matters of command and control,\nand preventing an overextension of United Nations\nresources.\nThe responsibility for peace-keeping operations must\nbe shared by the international community as a whole, and\nthus they should be financed through assessed rather than\nvoluntary contributions, to be calculated on the basis of\nconsensus, and in accordance with international\ncommitments.\nIn the former Yugoslavia, we have welcomed and\nconstantly supported the diplomatic initiative undertaken\nby the United States Government and we sincerely hope\nthat it marks the turning-point in the crisis.\nThe renewal of diplomatic action has thus far scored\nmajor achievements: the Geneva agreement of 8\nSeptember on basic principles for a settlement in Bosnia,\nthe Framework for a Cessation of Hostilities within the\nSarajevo Exclusion Zone signed by the Bosnian Serbs in\nBelgrade on 14 September, and the joint statement issued\non 26 September. For the first time in three years, there\nseem to be real prospects for a viable and stable peace in\nBosnia and we cannot afford to miss this opportunity. It\n24\n\n\nis essential that Europe, the United States and Russia work\ntogether to overcome the remaining difficulties in the way\nof a general cease-fire and a peace agreement. We call\nupon all the parties concerned to come to the negotiating\ntable, to show good faith and to resist the temptations to\nresort to military action to gain political advantages.\nWe should also prepare well in advance for the\nreconstruction and rehabilitation of the former Yugoslavia\nby crafting an approach that would reaffirm respect for\nhuman rights and the rights of minorities and foster civil\nand cultural coexistence, development and welfare\nthroughout the area.\nIn the Middle East and the Mediterranean, Italy\napplauds the determination and courage of Prime Minister\nRabin, Foreign Minister Peres and Chairman Arafat in\nreaching yesterday\u2019s agreement on the second stage of\nself-government. Every effort should be made to implement\nit, starting with the holding of democratic elections in the\nPalestinian territories as soon as possible. Italy will\ncontinue its commitment to provide economic support to the\nPalestinian people.\nOther situations in the Middle East give rise instead to\ntension and instability. We must contribute ideas and\ninitiatives to efforts aimed at defusing these tensions and\nencouraging dialogue between opposing forces, except those\nwhose programme and policy are violence. At the same\ntime, Italy expects those countries trapped in self-inflicted\nisolation to engage in a constructive dialogue with the\ninternational community.\nIt is of the utmost urgency that an international\nconference be convened in the Great Lakes region of Africa\nunder the sponsorship of the United Nations and the\nOrganization of African Unity, with the goal of fostering\nthe process of national reconciliation and allowing a rapid\nrepatriation of the millions of refugees still living in camps.\nBut there have also been positive developments in\nAfrica, such as the historic events of 1994 in South Africa,\nthe reconstruction currently under way in Mozambique, the\nagreements that brought an end to the bloody conflict in\nAngola, and the political and constitutional developments in\nEthiopia. My country\u2019s commitment did not stop at the\nparticipation of its military personnel in Mozambique. We\nalso responded positively to the Secretary-General\u2019s request\nfor military advisers to train de-mining personnel in\nAngola.\nLatin America has made significant progress in the\nreaffirmation of democratic laws and respect for human\nrights. Italy supports the peace process in Guatemala and\nhas sent a contingent to the United Nations human-rights\nmonitoring Mission there, as it did to the peace-keeping\noperation in El Salvador.\nThe Asian continent is teaching all of us a lesson in\nrealism, hard work and investment in human resources. Its\ngrowing force and economic success have brought it to\nthe forefront of the community of nations.\nItaly will actively participate in the new Working\nGroup for the reform of the United Nations, paying\nspecial attention to the economic and social sectors, which\nneed improvement and streamlining. While proceeding\nwith determination, we must avoid hasty decisions in\nareas where caution and diligence should be the rule. We\nmust keep our sights on results and effectiveness rather\nthan on symbolic and artificially-imposed deadlines. This\nis true not only for the economic and social sectors, but\nalso for the reform of the Security Council, which is\nalready the subject of a detailed Italian proposal inspired\nby the principles of democracy, equitable geographical\nrepresentation and efficiency. It aims at reconciling the\naspirations and interests of the greatest possible number\nof countries. Our goal is a Security Council with more\nnon-permanent members that is able to express the\nfeelings and political will of the international community\nas a whole. Only a Council that is truly representative of\nthe entire United Nations membership and closely linked\nto the General Assembly can make this goal a reality.\nHowever, if the financial crisis of the United Nations\nis not solved, budgetary problems could derail any reform\nproposals and send the entire system down the road to\nbankruptcy. The Secretary-General has repeatedly made\nthis point, as has the President of the Council of the\nEuropean Union. In the review of the scale of\nassessments, Italy hopes that the Member States will\napprove much-needed reforms, confirming beyond a\nshadow of a doubt their will fully and promptly to honour\ntheir financial obligations.\nIn some sectors of weapons of mass destruction,\nimportant limitations have been agreed on and\nimplemented. As we recently learned, biological weapons,\namong the most horrifying arms known to man, are still\nin our midst. It is our wish that the prohibition of\nbiological weapons be backed up by an effective system\nof verification.\n25\n\n\nAs for nuclear weapons, the indefinite extension of the\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons paves\nthe way for new goals in the field of disarmament. The\nprimary goal is the conclusion of a comprehensive test-ban\ntreaty by 1996. It is imperative that we achieve an outright\nban on all nuclear testing, and my country will do its part\nto see that this becomes a reality.\nThe Agenda for Development should be finalized by\nthe end of the current session. The Agenda must reflect the\nconclusions and commitments made in the series of world\nconferences on the major social issues of our time, which\nwill conclude with the World Conference on Food being\nhosted by Italy in the fall of 1996.\nThe growth of the economy and of employment is\nfundamental to international political stability in an era of\ninterdependence. An effective form of coordination\nbetween the United Nations system and the financial\ninstitutions of Bretton Woods should be devised.\nMultilateral trade and the free flow of investments could\nenhance the spread of equitable and sustainable\ndevelopment. With regard to the persistent problem of the\ndebt of developing countries, Italy ranks second among\ncreditor countries in its reduction of the external debt of\ncountries with grave economic difficulties.\nThe Italian Government is pleased with the work of\nthe Ad Hoc Committee on the Establishment of an\nInternational Criminal Court and with the draft statute of\nthe court prepared by the International Law Commission.\nSignificantly, this draft explicitly does not include the\ndeath penalty among the sentences that can be handed\ndown, in line with a position that Italy defended in this\nsame Hall. My country hopes that the debate in the Sixth\nCommittee will set the basis for convening a diplomatic\nconference in 1996 or 1997, which Italy has offered to\nhost, to adopt the statute of the court.\nThe Italian Government believes that the United\nNations should step up its efforts, as should its\nspecialized agencies and international financial\ninstitutions, to channel more resources towards\nhuman-centred activity. Democracy and respect for human\nrights must become the hallmark of our efforts to build a\nbetter future for our children.\n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of the delegation of the United\nArab Emirates, it gives me great pleasure to extend my\nsincere congratulations to the President on his election to\nthe presidency of the fiftieth session of the General\nAssembly. This demonstrates the esteem the international\ncommunity holds for the President and his friendly country.\nWe wish him every success and good fortune. We also\nwish to express our deep appreciation to his predecessor,\nHis Excellency Amara Essy, the Foreign Minister of\nC\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, who presided over the last session with\nwisdom and competence.\nI should like to seize this opportunity to express anew\nour confidence in the strenuous efforts made by Mr.\nBoutros Boutros-Ghali, the Secretary-General, to enhance\nthe role of our Organization in today\u2019s world.\nThis session coincides with the celebration of the\nfiftieth anniversary of the foundation of the United Nations.\nThis is an important political event in the history of this\nOrganization, particularly in light of the rapid changes that\nhave taken place in international relations. These changes\nhave contributed, in varying degrees, to the achievement of\nsome progress with regard to a number of issues that relate\nto disarmament, economic and social development, and to\nthe containment of some regional conflicts.\nIn spite of this, our international community remains\nfar from the desired world peace. New challenges have\nemerged and have entailed suffering, extermination,\nexpulsion and famine to thousands of people. These, in\nturn, have affected international life as they have impacted\non the economic, political and social situation in the world.\nSuch a situation, of course, does not measure up to\nthe expectations the new regional and international\nchanges gave rise to when they followed on the heels of\neach other. The hope of witnessing the emergence of a\nnew world order that would favour development, peace,\ngrowth and justice has not yet taken a concrete shape that\nwould affect the future of mankind. The emergence of\nsuch an order requires a wider framework of regional and\ninternational cooperation which would work in favour of\nfinding peaceful solutions to world problems. Such\nsolutions should aim at elaborating a comprehensive\napproach designed to promote and enhance human,\neconomic and social development, encourage harmony,\ntolerance and communal solidarity, ensure respect for the\ncustoms, traditions and religious beliefs of each\ncommunity and country, in addition to combating\nterrorism and its manifestations, combating drug\ntrafficking, and strengthening the role of the United\nNations in the areas of peace-keeping, conflict prevention\nand the mitigation of the human suffering of many\npeoples of the world, especially in the developing world.\nWe believe that the establishment of such a world order\nrequires a stronger political will and a much wider\nframework of regional and international cooperation in\norder for it to be compatible with the thrust of the new\ninternational changes.\nThe stability and security of States and the\nsettlement of disputes have become high priorities of\ntoday\u2019s world. To achieve stability and security, new\npractices are needed. Such practices should be based on\nthe provisions of international law and the principles of\nthe Charter, especially the principles of sovereignty,\nregional peace, non-interference in internal affairs of\nStates, the settlement of disputes and conflicts by peaceful\nmeans and the promotion of relations of good-\nneighbourliness.\nOn this basis, the United Arab Emirates reaffirms its\nposition which calls for direct bilateral and unconditional\nnegotiations with the Islamic Republic of Iran to put an\nend to its military occupation, which has lasted since\n1971, of the three Arab islands of Greater Tunb, Lesser\nTunb and Abu Moussa, as those islands form an\nindivisible part of the territorial sovereignty of the United\nArab Emirates. If this is feasible, my country renews its\ninitiative, announced at the last session, which calls for\nreferring the dispute to the International Court of Justice,\nin view of the fact that the Court is the international body\nentrusted with the settlement of disputes and that many\ncountries, including Iran, have had recourse to it in\nseeking to settle similar disputes.\n11\n\n\nOur peace initiatives have received support from\nsisterly countries in the Gulf Cooperation Council, the\nLeague of Arab States and other friendly, peace-loving\nnations, since what is at stake here is one of our legal\nsovereign rights. In spite of this peaceful approach, the\nIslamic Republic of Iran not only rejects those initiatives\nbut also imposes a policy of fait accompli by military force.\nIt has adopted a set of illegal measures with the aim of\nentrenching its occupation. Those measures conflict, not\nonly with the principles of peaceful coexistence and good-\nneighbourliness, but also with the provisions of the Charter\nof the Organization of the Islamic Conference, the Charter\nof the United Nations and the principles of international\nlaw.\nOver the past decade, the Arabian Gulf region\nwitnessed a number of conflicts and wars that resulted in\ndevastation and loss in terms of human, material and\nenvironmental resources. It would have been wiser to\nbenefit from such resources by striving for economic and\nsocial integration and sustainable development in the\ninterests of the region\u2019s peoples who enjoy common bands\nof history and religion and have common interests.\nThe question of building confidence between the\ncountries of the region has become one of the most\nsignificant and focal issues for the Governments of the\ncountries of the Gulf Cooperation Council. Over the past\nfew years, those Governments have spared no effort in\ntrying to ease the suffering caused to their peoples by past\nevents whose consequences have demonstrated that the use\nor threat of force by certain parties will never lead to the\nachievements of their aim of changing the immutable\nhistorical and geographical realities of the region. On the\ncontrary, the use or threat of force creates new crises and\ndisputes that threaten international and regional peace and\nsecurity. It is our belief that the best way of avoiding such\na situation is to opt for dialogue, bilateral and multilateral\nnegotiations, confidence-building measures and to comply\nwith international legality.\nIn this context, we welcome all peaceful efforts and\ninitiatives aimed at the demarcation of boundaries between\nthe sisterly countries of the region. While we wish to put\non record our firm position regarding the need to safeguard\nthe sovereignty and territorial integrity of Iraq, the need to\nease the suffering of the Iraqi people and not to interfere in\nits internal affairs, we call upon the Iraqi Government to\nmeet all its international obligations set out in relevant\nSecurity Council resolutions, especially those relating to the\nrelease of Kuwaiti prisoners and detainees and the nationals\nof other countries, as well as the return of Kuwaiti\nproperty still in its possession.\nThe United Arab Emirates welcomes the progress\nmade in the negotiations between the Palestinians and\nIsraelis, which led to the Declaration of Principles and\ncomplementary agreements, the latest being the agreement\non the second phase of expanded self-rule in the West\nBank. Implementation by the Israeli Government of those\nagreements would be an important and essential step\ntowards enabling the Palestinian people to exercise its\nright to self-determination and to the creation of its\nindependent State on its national soil, like any other\npeople in the world.\nIn the same context, we are of the view that the\nachievement of a just, comprehensive and permanent\npeace in the Middle East is contingent on making tangible\nprogress on the Syrian and Lebanese tracks. This will\nrequire a greater international effort, especially on the part\nof the two sponsors of the peace process, to encourage\nthe Israeli Government to comply with its undertakings\nand obligations in the context of the principle of \u201cland for\npeace\u201d and of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967),\n338 (1973) and 425 (1978), which stipulate complete and\nunconditional Israeli withdrawal from all the occupied\nArab and Palestinian territories, including the holy city of\nAl-Quds, the Syrian Golan and southern Lebanon.\nThe maintenance of international peace and security\nis a collective international responsibility that requires the\nexistence of political will, a new approach and the\nadoption of transparency, instead of the application of\ndouble standards, if the declared intentions in the field of\ndisarmament and the elimination of weapons of mass\ndestruction are to be translated into concrete realities. In\nthis field, it behoves the international community to take\nfirmer steps to prevent the proliferation of nuclear\nweapons and the possibility of their use in any region of\nthe world.\nProceeding from the importance we attach to the\nachievement of common security, we announce that on 25\nSeptember 1995, the Government of the United Arab\nEmirates completed the legal procedures for acceding to\nthe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.\nThis is in conformity with our position which calls for the\ncreation of zones that are free from all weapons of mass\ndestruction, especially in the Middle East. This is a goal\nthat cannot be achieved so long as Israel continues to\nrefuse to submit to the system of international monitoring\nand safeguards or to accede to the Treaty on the\n12\n\n\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, a posture that\nweakens the credibility of the Treaty.\nIn spite of regional and international efforts to rescue\nSomalia from its plight, conflicts between the disputing\nfactions continue. We therefore call on those factions to end\nthe bloodshed, to renounce conflict and to work towards a\nsettlement that would restore Somalia\u2019s national unity,\nsecurity and stability.\nAfter more than three years of crimes of murder,\ndestruction and \u201cethnic cleansing\u201d that have continued to be\ncommitted by the Serbian forces against the people of the\nRepublic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, a new turning-point\nhas emerged in the form of the recent peace negotiations\nthat have led to a preliminary agreement on the\nfundamental principles for a comprehensive settlement\nbased on the decisions of international legality.\nThe United Arab Emirates, which has continued to call\nupon the parties, since the outbreak of the conflict,\nespecially on the Serbian side, to resort to peaceful dialogue\ninstead of military force, today renews its support for all\nthe efforts undertaken by the international community,\nespecially the Contact Groups of the Organization of the\nIslamic Conference, the European Union and the United\nStates of America, to solve this crisis peacefully and to\nguarantee respect for the territorial sovereignty of Bosnia\nand Herzegovina. At the same time, we stress the need, in\naccordance with Article 51 of the Charter of the United\nNations, to lift the arms embargo imposed on Bosnia and\nHerzegovina, in order to prevent the repetition of the acts\nof aggression, massacre and \u201cethnic cleansing\u201d that the\nSerbian forces have perpetrated against Bosnian civilians,\nparticularly Muslims.\nIn spite of the positive situations which the changes in\neconomic and social situations at the national, regional and\ninternational levels gave rise to over the past few years, the\ndeveloping countries have continued to suffer from hunger,\npoverty and an aggravated debt burden, side by side with\nthe decline in the prices of primary commodities, and the\ninequitable measures that the developed countries continue\nto apply as part of their economic and trade policies and\nthat contribute to widening further the economic and social\ngap between them on the one hand and the developing\ncountries on the other. In view of this situation,\nresponsibility for the resumption of dialogue between the\ncountries of the North and the South rests with the\ninternational community, in order for it to serve equally the\ninterests of the developed and the developing countries\nalike.\nIn the midst of the celebrations on the occasion of\nthe fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations, the United\nArab Emirates supports the international call for\nevaluation, reform and development in the structures of\nthe United Nations, especially with regard to increasing\nthe membership of the Security Council and ensuring the\ntransparency and equitable geographical representation\nneeded if the Organization is to face up to the great\nchallenges, whether at the level of consolidating\ninternational peace and security or at the level of\npromoting economic and social development.\nWe should like also to emphasize the need for\ncooperation between the United Nations and regional\norganizations with a view to creating a wider framework\nof coordination and consultation, and with the aim of\nreaching joint peaceful solutions to current conflicts based\non international law, with a view to strengthening security\nand stability and promoting development.\nIn conclusion, we hope that these aspirations will\nhelp shape and strengthen the commitment of all States to\nthe principles of the Charter and the provisions of\ninternational law and will form a framework for the\nrenewed unification of the power and determination of\nthis Organization, which over the last fifty years has\nremained a symbol of hope in the ability of humanity to\nfree itself from the scourges of war, hunger and disease\nand to live in lasting peace and security.\n\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me to congratulate\nMr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral on his election as President\nof the General Assembly. I wish all of us a productive\nand fruitful session.\nI also wish to thank His Excellency Mr. Amara\nEssy, President of the Assembly at its forty-ninth session,\nfor his able leadership, and to give due recognition to the\nSecretary-General for his achievements in restructuring\nthe United Nations on the eve of its golden\nanniversary \u2014 an occasion for remembrance and\ncelebration, but also a time for reflection and appraisal.\nThe Baltic States have participated in the work of\nthe United Nations only since 1991. Nevertheless, during\nthe long years of occupation the United Nations was\nperceived in Latvia as a unique global international\nOrganization embodying humanity\u2019s ideas about freedom,\nhuman rights, sovereign equality and respect for the\nprinciples of international law.\nI shall not join in detracting and criticizing the\nUnited Nations, for it is not an entity existing on its own.\n12\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\n\nRather, the effectiveness of the Organization is a function\nof the political will of its Member States and their resolve\nto find common ground. In criticizing the United Nations,\nwe should keep in mind the amount of criticism that must\nbe directed against ourselves.\nIt is to be hoped that the end of the cold war has put\nan end to balance-of-power politics. Still, the situation in\nthe world today evokes historical analogies \u2014 about\ncollective security, aggressors and their appeasement. A\ngeneration of Latvians still alive remembers the results of\nappeasement in 1939. It is often stated that today\u2019s leaders\nmust try not to repeat the mistakes of the past. The notion\nthat they have succeeded is belied by the recent\nestablishment of international ad hoc tribunals regarding the\nterritory of the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda and by the\npressing need for an international criminal court.\nConflict-prevention mechanisms, including preventive\ndiplomacy and preventive deployment, as well as other\nconfidence-building measures, have become increasingly\nimportant. The establishment of political dialogue between\nparties and early action by the international community are\na key to heading off potential conflicts.\nThe status of the United Nations as a centre for\nconflict resolution may be enhanced by promoting the\nuniversality of the Organization. We support the statement\nof the Secretary-General that the process of arms control\nand disarmament needs to be globalized and that it is vital\nthat all States be engaged in the disarmament process in\npractice as well as in declared intent. Latvia supported the\nunconditional and indefinite extension of the Treaty on the\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. We hope that\nanother historic step will be taken next year with the\nconclusion of a comprehensive nuclear test-ban treaty.\nThe dramatic rise in the number and complexity of\npeace-keeping operations in recent years, as well as the\ndistinctive nature and experience of each operation, requires\nnew approaches to peace-keeping. Humanitarian assistance,\nhuman rights and economic and political questions are now\nintegral components of peace-keeping. Experience shows\nthat it is necessary to detach peace-keeping from\nenforcement action. In Somalia, as well as in the territory\nof the former Yugoslavia, peace-keepers have been\nperceived as enemies. In such cases the most suitable\nsolution is for the United Nations to grant clearly defined\nauthority to international organizations or groups of States\nthat have the desire and the capacity to establish peace.\nRecognizing that each State has a duty to contribute\nto the maintenance of international peace and security,\nLatvia is ready to participate, within the Danish battalion,\nin bringing peace to the territory of the former\nYugoslavia. For the purposes of peace-keeping, the Baltic\nStates have established a Baltic battalion (BALTBAT),\nwhich is currently undergoing intensive training in\npreparation for a future role in peace-keeping missions. I\ntake this opportunity to thank all countries that have\nsupported the establishment and training of BALTBAT \u2014\nin particular, the United States, the Nordic countries, the\nUnited Kingdom and Germany.\nLatvia strongly supports efforts to strengthen and\nreform the United Nations system so that it may better\nserve the peoples of the Earth. It recognizes that it is still\ntoo early to clearly perceive the shape of the post-cold-\nwar world, which must be the final determinant of the\nnature of the necessary reforms.\nIn these circumstances there is a need to view\nreforms of the United Nations system as a long-term,\nongoing process that must protect the stability of the\nUnited Nations system at all times. At the same time,\nthere is an opportunity for progress in regard to reforms\nwhich can be made without making permanent\ncommitments to new fundamental system structures and\nprocedures.\nIn the light of these general considerations, I should\nnow like to address Security Council reforms and United\nNations system financing issues.\nThe operation of the Security Council must continue\nto become more transparent and open, while preserving\nthe Council\u2019s effectiveness. Its expansion must strengthen\nthe role played by small countries in global\ndecision-making, while respecting equitable geographic\ndistribution and the new geopolitical realities of the\npost-cold-war era.\nSince there is general agreement about the need for\na modest expansion of the Security Council, the General\nAssembly could immediately decide to carry it out, if the\ndecision would not force Member States to make\npermanent commitments on the two controversial\nissues \u2014 the composition of the Council and the use of\nthe veto. Latvia intends to make proposals in this regard\nto the relevant Working Group of the General Assembly.\nThe current system of financing the activities of the\nUnited Nations depends largely on assessed and voluntary\n13\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\n\ncontributions of Member States. The unprecedented\ndifficulties of financing the recent growth in international\nactivities have exposed the limitations of the current\nsystem, in which international activities have to compete for\nfunds against national activities that have stronger\nconstituencies.\nA recent report, commissioned by the Independent\nCommission for Population and Quality of Life, on\ninnovative financing mechanisms for internationally agreed\nprogrammes, has made a number of recommendations to\nstudy and compile information relevant to such\nmechanisms. Latvia would support a decision by the\nGeneral Assembly at this fiftieth session to prepare a\ncompilation of information relevant to, and appropriate\nstudies of, innovative financing mechanisms.\nInnovative financing mechanisms are a matter for the\nfuture. Even then, they should not supplant the current\nsystem, which, however, needs to be improved.\nGovernments have a long-range interest in strengthening the\nUnited Nations by completing the reform of the current,\nhighly inequitable scale of assessments for the regular\nbudget. The reformed scale must obey the equitable\nprinciple that Member States with equal average per capita\nincomes should bear assessments that are broadly at the\nsame per capita level.\nThe current inequitable scale is one cause of the\ncurrent financial crisis of the United Nations, in that the\nover-assessed States are responsible for relatively high\namounts of outstanding contributions, including arrears\nfrom preceding years.\nThis observation is illustrated by the case of the 15\nMember States, including Latvia, that were over-assessed\nby a General Assembly decision, adopted by vote, in 1992.\nA second decision in 1994 improved the situation\nsomewhat, by initiating a gradual decline in the excessive\nassessment, which in 1997 will still be two times higher\nthan the assessment based on the principle of capacity-\nto-pay.\nWhile Latvia recognizes and tries to discharge its\nobligation, derived from the principle of sovereign equality,\nto pay in full and on time, it also believes that a second\ncomponent of the principle of sovereign equality \u2014 the\nequal rights of all Member States \u2014 is not respected by the\npresent assessment. The resulting over-assessment is a\nreason that has led, in spite of Latvia\u2019s best efforts under\ndifficult financial conditions and in the face of many\npressing social, economic and humanitarian needs, to a\nbuild-up of arrears which now threaten the application of\nArticle 19 of the Charter, beginning January 1996. It will\nforce Latvia to seek relief from the General Assembly.\nIn discussing the work of the United Nations in the\neconomic and social sphere, it is useful to do so from the\nperspective of the individual. Is he or she secure? Has he\nor she enough food? Does he or she have adequate living\nconditions and opportunities for developing his or her\npotential?\nIn the world today, enormous differences in levels of\ndevelopment persist among countries. The United Nations\nhas accomplished a great deal in its work to eradicate\npoverty and disease and to provide humanitarian relief. It\nwould be possible to further improve this work by\nimproving coordination between relief agencies and\nprogrammes and by eliminating redundancies. Relief must\naddress needs; the United Nations has a significant role to\nplay in needs assessment.\nIn the past Member States of the United Nations\nhave met in a number of global forums to highlight the\nissues surrounding people-centred development. World\nconferences in Rio de Janeiro, Vienna, Cairo, Copenhagen\nand, most recently, Beijing have drafted platforms for\naction. Such large gatherings are sometimes criticized as\nbeing expensive and resulting in few tangible outputs.\nSuch criticism could be avoided if Member States were\nto implement their commitments fully. However\nimplementation is greatly constrained by the financial\nrealities of each State.\nNevertheless, Latvia has implemented a\nrecommendation of the 1993 World Conference on\nHuman Rights by establishing a national Human Rights\nOffice, which commenced operations earlier this year.\nThe Latvian Human Rights Office is an independent\ninstitution for the protection and promotion of human\nrights.\nThe international community has agreed that human\nrights are inviolable and are the cornerstone of democratic\nsocieties. We intend to continue to implement the\nrecommendations of the Vienna Declaration and\nProgramme of Action, and urge other States to do the\nsame. Further, we believe that the question of the\nadequate financing of the Office of the High\nCommissioner for Human Rights must be resolved.\nThe environment is an area that, along with human\nrights, demands Latvia\u2019s attention during the present\n14\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\n\nperiod of remedying the many consequences of Latvia\u2019s\noccupation. In this connection, Latvia is making efforts to\nhold an international conference on disarmament and its\nrelationship to environment and development.\nLatvia\u2019s development, particularly in the social sector,\nhas been greatly assisted by the work of the Office of the\nUnited Nations Development Programme (UNDP),\nestablished in Riga in 1992. The Government of Latvia\nfully cooperates with and supports the work of UNDP, and\nis ready to increase the level of this cooperation.\nLatvia attaches high priority to the economic and\nsocial work of the United Nations and understands the\nobligation of each Member State to contribute to this work.\nWe value and support the efforts to reform the Economic\nand Social Council and, in the spirit of sustaining and\nfurthering its work, have presented our candidature for\nmembership in the Economic and Social Council for the\nperiod 1997-1999.\nIn pondering the future of the United Nations during\nits fiftieth anniversary, allow me to quote Mr. Henry Cabot\nLodge, Jr., a former United States representative to the\nUnited Nations:\n\u201cThis Organization is created to prevent you from\ngoing to hell. It isn\u2019t created to take you to heaven.\u201d\nLet us remember these words as we look to the future of\nthe United Nations. Let us make the necessary changes to\nour Organization and, moreover, concentrate our political\nwill so that we may ensure that humanity will always\nremain firmly anchored between heaven and hell, on the\nplanet Earth.\n"

        "file_text": "Half\na century ago the representatives of some 50 nations met in\nSan Francisco, in the United States, to create a new world\norder for the post-war period. The founding fathers sought\nto define rules and conduct enabling the countries of the\nwhole world to live free and safe from the scourge of war.\nThey gave the United Nations certain purposes that were as\nnoble as they were ambitious, such as, to mention only a\nfew, the maintenance of international peace and security;\nthe promotion of progress and international development;\nrespect for human rights and the rights of peoples; and\ninternational cooperation.\nWhile we rightly rejoice at the results obtained in\nsome of these areas, we must note that in others, concern\npersists regarding the many internal conflicts and economic\nand social crises that confront some of our States.\nIt was in an atmosphere of hope, but also uncertainty,\nthat His Excellency Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral was\nelected to guide the work of this session which must\naddress the aspirations for peace and well-being of our\npeoples. My delegation is happy at his election and warmly\ncongratulates him, convinced that his intellectual qualities\nand diplomatic skills will ensure success in our\ndeliberations. We assure the President of our full\ncooperation.\nI wish also to pay a well-deserved tribute to his\npredecessor, His Excellency Mr. Amara Essy, Foreign\nMinister of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, who skilfully guided the\nproceedings of our previous session.\nI should like to reiterate our deep gratitude to His\nExcellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, who since his\nelection as the head of our Organization has resolutely\nsought to find solutions to our world\u2019s many problems.\nOur Organization has succeeded in sparing humanity\na third world war, but areas of concern remain. Before\naddressing them, I should like to briefly describe the\nsituation in my country, and particularly the efforts that\nmy Government has made to solve both political and as\nsocio-economic problems.\nAt the last session the Chadian delegation described\nto the Assembly the progress that we had made towards\nthe democratization of political life. Today I can report\nthat this has become a tangible reality. We have put\nmachinery and structures in place to enable the Chadian\npeople freely and openly to choose their institutions and\ntheir leaders. I refer in particular to the Independent\nNational Electoral Commission, responsible for\nsupervising and monitoring the preparation of electoral\nrolls and organizing the various elections; the Supreme\nCouncil for Communications, charged with guaranteeing\nequitable access to the media to political parties, civil\nsociety and individual citizens; and the Constitutional\nCourt, which is to settle electoral disputes, among other\nthings. It is important to emphasize that all shades of\npolitical and social opinion are represented in these\nbodies.\nThe liberalization of political life can also be seen in\nthe existence of 53 recognized parties as well as a number\nof civil associations and trade unions. Moreover, a draft\nconstitution agreed by all those involved in civil and\npolitical life will soon be put to the vote in a referendum.\nI can state from this rostrum that the democratic process\nis under way and that Chad is merely awaiting the various\nvotes to conclude it.\nThe President of the Republic, General Idriss D\u00e9by,\nstated at this year\u2019s presentation of New Year\u2019s greetings\nfrom the Diplomatic Corps that he was determined to do\nhis utmost to ensure that the votes were transparent and\ntook place in the best possible conditions. Despite this\nsolemn commitment, some of those involved in political\nlife, manipulated from abroad, are trying desperately to\nhoodwink national and international public opinion by\n16\n\n\nsaying that the Government are responsible for delaying the\nvotes. We reiterate the commitment of the Head of State\nand invite all those who wish to do so, to come to Chad\nand observe the various election processes.\nI should like to extend our thanks to the United\nNations, which has already given us technical assistance. I\nalso take this opportunity to appeal to countries and\ninternational organizations to help us properly to organize\nthe elections.\nBecause of the tumultuous history of my country,\npeace and stability are constant concerns of my\nGovernment, which seeks only to make a reality of the\nlegitimate aspirations of the Chadian people to economic\nand social well-being.\nNational reconciliation was rightly one of the main\nrecommendations of the Sovereign National Conference, for\ntrust and harmony among the people of Chad must be\nrebuilt. The establishment of a national reconciliation\ncommission and the proclamation of a general amnesty and\na unilateral cease-fire throughout the country are\ndemonstrations of the avowed will of the Government to\nreunite Chadians. Some people in Chadian political life\nconsider that the final step in achieving this objective is to\norganize a round table. The Government is in favour, as\nlong as the other participants are not limited to the armed\nopposition and as long as it does not threaten the\nachievements of the Sovereign National Conference, the\ndemocratic process, or the established timetable.\nPolitical freedom is truly beneficial only when it is\nbased on an economic situation from which all the\npopulation gain. My country faces an economic and\nfinancial crisis due to external factors, aggravated by\ndesertification, an uncertain climate and the fact that it is\nland-locked. My Government has taken a series of measures\nto improve the financial situation, while strengthening its\ncontrol over debt servicing and trying to exert similar\ncontrol over the civil service and the army. These measures\nhave had satisfactory results and should be supported by\nour partners.\nWhile we are pleased that the cold war has ended,\nthere remain, as I said earlier, many matters causing great\nconcern. The international community is confronting some\nproblems that negatively impact on the evolution of our\ncountries and require collective thought.\nWith regard to peace, since the last session the picture\nhas continued to be one of contrasts.\nIn Angola, my Government is heartened by the\nprogress achieved since the Lusaka Accords, which have\nopened up great prospects for the consolidation of peace\nand the reconstruction of the country.\nSimilarly, we welcome the signing in Washington on\n28 September of the agreement between the State of\nIsrael and the Palestinian Authority. This is an important\nmilestone on the path towards a just and lasting\nsettlement of the crisis, which has lasted far too long.\nMy country also welcomed the agreements reached\nby the Liberian factions on 19 August. With the setting\nup of the Council of State, we can hope that the six years\nof nightmare are now coming to an end for the people of\nLiberia.\nElsewhere, the situation is much less favourable.\nBurundi, Rwanda, Somalia and Sierra Leone are still\npowder kegs, experiencing loss of human life and massive\ndisplacements of populations.\nMy country is also concerned about the situation in\nBosnia and Herzegovina, in the very heartland of Europe,\nwhere the spiral of war seems to hold sway over the logic\nof peace. We encourage the patient and tireless efforts of\nthe international community to settle this conflict, with\nrespect for the country\u2019s sovereignty and territorial\nintegrity.\nWe would make an urgent appeal to the various\nprotagonists to demonstrate perspicacity and political\ncourage in order to put an end to these human tragedies.\nForeseeable causes of conflict in most States are\nbehaviour and attitudes revealing a desire for hegemony\nthat threatens territorial integrity and harms good-\nneighbourly relations. We must appeal to leaders to show\nwisdom and refrain from such conduct; rather, they\nshould work together in a spirit of solidarity and mutual\nassistance to implement joint development programmes.\nFor its part, Chad fully supports the principle of the\npeaceful settlement of all disputes. In this spirit, on the\nbasis of resolutions of the United Nations, the\nOrganization of African Unity and the Organization of the\nIslamic Conference, we again appeal for the lifting of the\nembargo on the Libyan people, which has a negative\nimpact on neighbouring countries.\nMy country supports the efforts under way in our\nOrganization in the field of peace-keeping operations,\n17\n\n\nparticularly in the consolidation of peace in various parts of\nthe world. Thus, it is making its modest contribution to the\nUnited Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda.In the same\nspirit, Chad supports Argentina\u2019s \u201cWhite Helmets\u201d\ninitiative.\nAfrica, for its part, took a decisive step by\nestablishing, in 1993, a mechanism for the prevention,\nmanagement and settlement of conflicts; it is already\noperational. We call for close cooperation between the\nUnited Nations and this mechanism under Chapter VIII of\nthe Charter and for multifaceted support from the entire\ninternational community.\nAs a party to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\nNuclear Weapons, my country welcomes its indefinite\nextension. This is a major step, because, since the\nestablishment of the United Nations, the prevention of the\ndissemination of nuclear weapons has been one of the\nmajor goals of Member States. Chad fully supports the\nnegotiations currently under way in the Conference on\nDisarmament for the conclusion of a comprehensive test-\nban treaty.\nMy country welcomed the Secretary-General\u2019s\nconvening of an international meeting on mine clearance\nfrom 5 to 7 July 1995 at Geneva. We greatly appreciate the\npositive reaction of the international community, which, by\nannouncing a contribution of more than $20 million,\ndemonstrated its determination to struggle against this\ninvisible, pernicious and constant menace.\nChad, a large part \u2014 about one third \u2014 of whose\nterritory is infested with mines of all types, supports the\nSecretary-General\u2019s statement that, by damaging local\ncommunities, by contributing to emptying vast territories of\ntheir population and by preventing the return of refugees,\nmines are obstacles to economic and social development.\nHence, we appeal to the international community to help\nmy country rid itself of these death machines.\nThe unbearable pictures of thousands of mutilated\nmen, women and children throughout the world cry out to\nus. That is why my country stands ready to support any\nmeasure that would lead to the total prohibition of the\nproduction and sale of such weapons.\nPeace and development are the major objectives of our\nOrganization. So far as economic and social development\nis concerned, in recent years many summits and\nconferences have been held with the goal of improving the\nliving standards of peoples. But the results have not met the\nexpectations. In fact, as the Human Development Report\n1995 states,\n\u201cMore than three-fourths of the world\u2019s people live\nin developing countries, but they enjoy only\n16 per cent of the world\u2019s income.\u201d (Human\nDevelopment Report 1995, p. 14)\nAfrica, where the majority of the least developed\ncountries are located, is in a most precarious situation.\nThe continual decline in export income condemns Africa\nto such an increase in the servicing of its debt that any\ndevelopment activity is futile.\nWhat can one say about structural adjustment and\neconomic liberalization measures, which frequently have\na negative impact on the most vulnerable segments of our\nsociety? Most of the initiatives to promote the\ndevelopment of Africa in the 1990s have not brought the\nhoped-for results.\nWe venture to hope that the Agenda for\nDevelopment, as a prop for the Agenda for Peace, will\nfoster a genuine spirit of solidarity and partnership in the\ninternational community.\nWe believe that, 50 years after its creation, and\ndespite the outstanding results it has achieved in some\nareas, the United Nations must continue to change in\norder to meet new and increasingly complex challenges.\nIn this connection, we reiterate our support for the\nprocess of restructuring and revitalizing the United\nNations in the economic, social and related areas. We\nemphasize, however, that this necessary action must not\nlead to marginalization of the developing countries.\nChad has already expressed its position on the\nexpansion of the Security Council, the organ with primary\nresponsibility for the maintenance of international peace\nand security. The principle of equitable geographical\nrepresentation must be observed.\nIn conclusion, I should like to express the hope that\nour deliberations will be fully successful and that the\ntwenty-first century will witness the beginning of a\ngenuine rebirth of our international Organization, so that\nit can work decisively towards the greatness of mankind.\nThe meeting rose at 5.25 p.m.\n18\n"

A world of greater\nfreedom, prosperity and security - the fundamental goals of\nthe United Nations Charter - unfortunately has not yet been\nattained. Much remains to be achieved by the United\nNations, and that, to a great degree, depends on the\ncollective support of each and every Member nation.\nPapua New Guinea retains a strong belief that the\ninternational community cannot do without the United\nNations, despite its shortcomings. If it was necessary in the\naftermath of the Second World War, it is even more so\ntoday. In 50 years, the United Nations has contributed\nimmensely to positive international interactions and has\nprovided the codes of conduct that today we take for\ngranted in our international dealings.\nAs one of many countries governed under the watchful\neye of the United Nations before becoming a full Member\nat independence, Papua New Guinea is firmly committed to\nrejuvenating and strengthening the world\u2019s paramount\ninternational Organization.\nEverything that needs to be said for the good of\nhumanity has been said many times over in this very Hall.\nNoble and practical sentiments have always been expressed,\noften in the strongest terms. What too often have been\nlacking are political will and international statesmanship.\nTherein lies the difference between wishful thinking and\nturning our hopes and dreams for humanity into reality.\nOn the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the\nUnited Nations, I am proud to say that Papua New Guinea\npledges full commitment to the principles and objectives of\nthe Organization.\nWe should together strive to build a better world for\nthis generation and for those to come, in the next 50 years\nand beyond. In areas where the United Nations has been\nsuccessful, we have to recommit ourselves, and where it\nhas not been successful, now is the time to correct and\nrebuild inadequate systems. Our ultimate objective must be\nto promote a more effective, more accountable, more\nresponsible and more caring United Nations, capable of\nmeeting the challenges of the twenty-first century.\nWe must consider very carefully how we should usher\nin and embrace the twenty-first century. The end of one\ncentury and the beginning of another provides us with a\nnatural period of reflection and self-examination. It is time\nto resolve to untangle, and rid ourselves of, all that has\nstopped us from creating a better world.\nFor that reform, we require a fresh start with greater\ndetermination, less cynicism, and hearts open more widely\nto the plight of all humanity. That is our collective\nchallenge between now and the year 2000. The\ninternational community must demonstrate the necessary\nresolve, courage, vision and moral will to make this world\na better place.\nIn setting the agenda for a better future, we must\nfirst understand our shared history. We must know that\nwithin the United Nations, our collective search for true\npeace is deeply rooted in events that took place just\nmonths before this Organization came into existence.\nI speak of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and\nNagasaki. They did not just change our world forever \u2014\nthese events changed the very way we think. Effectively\nthe closing acts of the Second World War, they forced\nupon the world an urgency in the search for peace. It is\nan urgency that has never been lost, as morality and the\nheart of man battle to keep pace with technology in all its\nforms.\nIt is a race that the United Nations is running. It is\na race that it cannot afford to lose.\nIf peace is in the hearts of men, and men in turn are\nthe heart of nations, and nations the heart of the world,\nthen we must fully realize just how profound a change we\nmust undergo to find true peace. The extent to which the\nworld discovers and embraces peace will be reflected in\nthe way it faces up to other threats to humanity.\nOne of the challenges that I believe is eating away\nat the health and lives of all nations is the abuse of\ndrugs \u2014 and it truly is a world problem.\nThe drug trade preys upon the youth of the world,\nshattering the lives of individuals and the peace and\nprosperity of communities. It has truly established its own\nfoul \u201cunited nations\u201d.\nThe criminals \u2014 and they are criminals of the\nlowest order \u2014 have broken down barriers of nationality,\npolitics, race, religion and culture far more successfully\nthan has this Assembly, as they ply their evil trade.\nThe networks they have established make\nmultinational corporate giants look like small players, and\n2\n\n\nhave become so entrenched that they can be met only with\nan equally determined and broad-based international\nresponse.\nThat task must be placed at the door of the United\nNations because, quite simply, no other group, no nation,\ncan take them on alone.\nVictory in the battle against the drug barons will\nrequire the same qualities needed in every other serious\nendeavour of the United Nations \u2014 political will and\ncollective determination. Without these factors, we risk\nlosing generations to destructive substance abuse. The price\nis too high. We must fight as one against this evil.\nIt is battles such as this that collectively we must take\nup. If we do not commit ourselves to fights for decency\nsuch as this one, we will never find the courage required to\nattain true life and peace in this world.\nOn the question of the expansion of the Security\nCouncil membership, we urge the five permanent members\nof the Council to join us in looking critically at the\ncontinuing relevance of their privileged positions and to\nconsider how the Security Council might operate more\neffectively.\nPapua New Guinea fully supports the permanent\nmembership of Japan and Germany on the Security\nCouncil.\nWe are also aware of the need to support shared\nobjectives and decisions with adequate resources. We are\nespecially concerned that the ongoing financial difficulties\nshould be resolved promptly, so that the United Nations can\nfunction to its full capacity.\nNo one should rest satisfied while we are faced with\nthe perpetuation of social and economic disparities between\nand within nations \u2014 largely the result of parochial\ninterests being pursued at the expense of genuine human\nconcerns.\nIt is precisely this short-sightedness that has resulted\nin United Nations failure in some areas in the past.\nDecency and justice must prevail in fact, and not just\nin words.\nPapua New Guinea, as an active participant in and\nbeneficiary of the Lome Convention between the European\nUnion (EU) and the African Caribbean Pacific Group of\nStates (ACP), is greatly honoured to currently hold the\npresidency and the chairmanship of all Lome Convention\ninstitutions, including the ACP-EU Joint Assembly, the\nACP Council of Ministers and the ACP Committee of\nAmbassadors.\nWe feel confident that we will play a substantive\nrole, under the Lome Convention, in addressing these\ninequities. We are also hopeful that the international trade\nand economic situation will improve with the advent of\nthe World Trade Organization, with protections to ensure\nthat the weak are not manipulated by the strong.\nThe problems of debt management and servicing\ncontinue to plague many developing countries. In trying\nto address them, we do not believe there are universal\nsolutions. Every case must be dealt with individually and\non its own merits. To do otherwise will simply cause\nserious social and political dislocation.\nIn this regard, international lending institutions such\nas the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund\n(IMF) should demonstrate the requisite sensitivity and\ntact. We do not believe there is a single recipe for all\nproblems, particularly as they relate to structural\nadjustment programmes of the type which we in Papua\nNew Guinea have only recently ploughed through and\nadopted, after refinements to meet our own particular\ncircumstances.\nWe live in a rapidly changing world, and it is a\nworld dogged by confusion and distortion as it struggles\nto set new bounds of acceptability and compatibility.\nWith the decline of the cold war, our optimistic\nhearts thought we might at long last enter a period of\npeace, security and prosperity. Much of that optimism has\ntoday given way to doubt and concern.\nThe challenge to the resolve and the resources of the\nUnited Nations is arguably as great as it has ever been \u2014\nin Bosnia, the former Soviet Union, Rwanda, Somalia and\nelsewhere.\nSome of these trouble-spots have highlighted the\nUnited Nations problems and been a source of acute\nembarrassment to the United Nations, which has too often\nbeen reduced to shameful impotence. The tragedy \u2014 the\noverwhelming tragedy \u2014 of this is that lives have been\nlost; people have died in huge numbers. The simple fact\nis that so many of them would still be alive today if the\n3\n\n\nUnited Nations had more effectively fulfilled its role once\nit had decided to intervene.\nWhen we lay this accusation at the door of the United\nNations, let us make no mistake about it: we do not and\ncannot distance ourselves from these failings. We, the\nmembers, are the United Nations. We are responsible for\nwhat it does, or fails to do. We must lay much blame at the\ndoor of the Member States which, collectively, have so\nlacked political will and moral courage.\nThe reforms that will bring about increased political\nwill and a more humanitarian view must occur within each\nand every Member nation. As the United Nations celebrates\nits fiftieth anniversary, we would like to stress that if it\nwants to be a true world forum, then it should exclude no\ncountry, large or small.\nAt a time when reconciliation is superseding\nconfrontation the United Nations, in accordance with the\nspirit of preventive diplomacy, should do its best to ease\nthe tensions between both sides of the Taiwan Straits. Peace\nand prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region are at stake.\nOn a global scale, we thought there was a hope for\npeace and prosperity on the horizon when the international\ncommunity gathered in Rio for the Earth Summit on\nEnvironment and Sustainable Development.\nWe all pledged and acknowledged at the Rio Summit\nthat something had to be done, because humanity was\nendangered by environmental degradation and climate\nchange, and we adopted \u201cAgenda 21\u201d as the framework\ndocument.\nAll Governments took the document firmly in hand,\nbut sadly their grip today appears to have slackened.\nThis experience and others call into question the\nusefulness of further global conferences, when the results\nof the ones already held are so generally disappointing.\nWe have had all the special world conferences, such\nas the ones in Barbados on small island developing States,\nin Cairo on population, in Copenhagen on social issues, in\nBerlin on climate change and the recent Fourth World\nConference on Women, held in Beijing \u2014 although in\nfairness to the latter, we should give it more time to\nproduce results. We should consider a moratorium on such\ngatherings until we begin to see practical benefits coming\nthrough. The talking has been done; it is now time for\naction.\nEnvironmental issues have become an all-\nencompassing international agenda. In the context of an\ninterdependent world, we have a collective responsibility\nguided by the framework of international conventions to\nmanage and develop our resources sustainably. The goals\nof sustainable development can be realized only through\neffective intergovernmental cooperation and through\nregional and international efforts.\nFor its part, the South Pacific Forum, made up of 16\nnations, including Palau, which joined at the most recent\nForum, has adopted both national and regional strategies\nto develop and implement environmentally sound\nprogrammes. Together with our fellow members of the\nMelanesian Spearhead Group, we have become party to\nthe Lakatoro Declaration on Oceania Cooperation on\nDenuclearization.\nPapua New Guinea and the other 15 members of the\nSouth Pacific Forum recently expressed extreme outrage\nat the French Government\u2019s resumption of nuclear testing\nat Mururoa and resolved to review the status of their\ndialogue with France. In total disregard of our stand,\nFrance detonated its second nuclear test, at Fangataufa\nAtoll, at 9.30 a.m., Papua New Guinea time, on Monday,\n2 October 1995. Consistent with the resolution of the\nSouth Pacific Forum nations, I now, regrettably, in my\ncapacity as Chairman of the Forum, announce the\nsuspension forthwith of all post-Forum dialogue with\nFrance.\nI am pleased to report that the twenty-sixth South\nPacific Forum paid close attention to the changed regional\nand world security situation. The Forum\u2019s concept paper\n\u201cSecuring Development Beyond 2000\u201d looked at security\nissues well beyond the scope of military threats and\nmilitary solutions. We focused on increasing security on\na sustainable basis by promoting trade, transport and\ntourism in and for our region. We addressed the need for\nregional arrangements on environmental damage, natural\ndisasters and other emergencies; as a result, we are\nworking to have a comprehensive and detailed plan of\naction for the region.\nThat is a Forum document to which we are party;\nbut for Papua New Guinea\u2019s part, we have our own\nnational guiding document, \u201cThe Pacific Plan\u201d, for our\nrelations with our Pacific neighbours.\nIn considering Pacific issues, the Forum was\nconscious that small island States are very vulnerable and\nhave unusual needs. Their economies are constantly under\n4\n\n\nthreat from natural disasters such as cyclones, volcanoes\nand the looming danger of rising sea levels. When such\nStates are hit by cyclones, it is akin to the ravages of war,\nand their economies and infrastructures face severe strains\nthat seriously hamper and set back their development.\nPapua New Guinea therefore appeals to the international\ncommunity to render support consistent with the Barbados\nProgramme of Action for the Sustainable Development of\nSmall Island Developing States to assist their efforts to\nachieve greater self-reliance.\nSmall nations, including many in the Pacific, have\nsuffered from declining international concern since the end\nof the cold war. Geo-economic considerations have largely\nreplaced the geo-political considerations of the past, with\nnew webs of alignment replacing the old and familiar ones.\nThis has forced regionalistic tendencies upon nations, which\nin some respects has crippled moves towards a true global\npartnership.\nMember nations will be aware of the internal crisis\nthat Papua New Guinea has faced on Bougainville, one that\nhas demanded enormous energy, time, patience and\nresources from the Government of my country. I am\npleased to inform the Assembly that my Government, since\ntaking office in August of last year, has wholeheartedly\nsought a successful resolution to the Bougainville situation,\nso far with notable success. Please allow me to express the\nappreciation of the people and the Government of Papua\nNew Guinea to the United Nations, and to the\nSecretary-General\u2019s office in particular, for the cooperation\nand understanding extended to us throughout this process.\nI am thinking particularly of the support the United Nations\noffered to the Bougainville Peace Conference of October\nlast year, which, I am pleased to say, with the coming\ntogether of the South Pacific peace-keeping force, put flesh\non the words of the Secretary-General on the value of\nregional approaches to conflict resolution. I believe that\ntoday the benefits of that wise policy are there for all to see\nin the situation on Bougainville, which has vastly improved\nover the past 12 months.\nWe also wish to assure the international community of\nour absolute commitment to human rights in dealing with\nthis situation, as guaranteed in our Constitution. Indeed, it\nis a fundamental regard for the right of all our people to\nlive free and peaceful lives that has driven me and my\nGovernment to search tirelessly for a resolution to this\ncrisis.\nThere is no such thing as a minority group in Papua\nNew Guinea because we come from numerous and diverse\nlinguistic, cultural and social backgrounds. We have over\n800 tribes and languages among 4 million people, in a\ncountry the size of Malaysia. In effect, we are all\nminorities in our land. As such, every group has a\nlegitimate place in Papua New Guinea.\nFor us and for other developing nations, the focus of\nsocial issues falls squarely on the question of empowering\npeople to eradicate poverty, get an education and live\nhealthy lives. When that is achieved, the people are then\nin a position to expand their participation in the social\nand economic development of their nation. Without those\nbasics, theirs is simply a battle for survival.\nIncreasing marginalization of the poor and of\nminorities remains a major problem within every country,\nregardless of economic or political status. We support the\nview that a new paradigm of development has to redefine\nthe needs of people in terms of securing the basics of life\nsuch as housing, food and water. This can be achieved\nonly by empowering people through decision-making and\nthrough direct participation in the development process.\nIn that connection, I wish to draw the attention of\nthe Assembly to a report to be prepared by the\nSecretary-General on the United Nations initiative on\nopportunity and participation, which I hope will receive\nthe serious consideration it deserves.\nOne of the hallmarks of United Nations achievement\nhas been the decolonization of peoples under colonial\ndomination. As we commemorate the fiftieth anniversary\nof the United Nations, we can proudly testify that the\nUnited Nations has generally fulfilled its duties and\nresponsibilities with respect to the decolonization process.\nMy country and many others represented in this Hall are\ntestimony to the honourable achievements of this\nOrganization in decolonization. Less than three weeks ago\nmy people joyfully celebrated the twentieth anniversary of\nthe independence of Papua New Guinea.\nWhile we acknowledge and commend the United\nNations for its decolonization achievements, its task is not\nyet complete. There are still many Territories under\ncolonial domination of one form or another. In\nrecognition of the unfinished task relating to colonialism,\nthe General Assembly has adopted a resolution\nproclaiming the International Decade for the Eradication\nof Colonialism. This carries great hope for those who are\nstill under the yoke of colonialism.\n5\n\n\nThe end of apartheid in South Africa brought a great\nsense of relief and enlightenment, not just there but\nthroughout the world. In that vein, colonialism \u2014 another\nblight on humanity \u2014 should be done away with and\nconsigned to the pages of history as a degrading\nphenomenon of a bygone age.\nThere is a need to take a case-by-case approach in\naddressing the problems of the Territories under colonial\nadministration to ensure that the wishes of the people\nconcerned are adequately and realistically taken into\naccount in determining their eventual political status.\nIn our immediate region, we are keen to see the\ndecolonization process in New Caledonia allowed to take its\ndue course, consistent with United Nations principles and\npractices. While we acknowledge the progressive attitude\ntaken by the French Government with regard to New\nCaledonia, we are concerned that certain negative and\ncounter-productive policies still exist. In that regard, we call\non France to fulfil its decolonization responsibilities quickly\nand with dignity.\nThe eradication of colonialism before the year 2000\nwill place us on a more enlightened plateau. It will make\nthe world a better place, more equipped to take on the\nchallenges of the future with justice and dignity for all.\nThe United Nations undoubtedly stands for humanity.\nIt provides the best possible avenue to peace, security and\nprosperity. While we all acknowledge the worthy objectives\nof the United Nations Charter, no country can claim that it\nhas given full and complete support to the Organization.\nUnfortunately, the United Nations has time and again\nbeen used for parochial pursuits, whether in respect of\npeace-keeping, human rights or environmental areas or in\nSecurity Council deliberations. In this very imperfect world,\nit would be naive to have ever expected perfect solutions\nfrom the United Nations. I say again that it is, however, an\nOrganization that my Government strongly believes the\ninternational community cannot do without. If the United\nNations did not exist, we would have to invent it. Fifty\nyears on, our task is to reinvent it, to make it better, to\nallow it to fully and ably serve humanity. This is a most\nnoble goal that must be pursued with pragmatic intensity\nand determination.\nThe fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations is the\ntime for each and every Member nation to recommit itself\nto the purposes and principles of the United Nations\nCharter. We must do it for peace, and with the vivid\nrecollection of Hiroshima and Nagasaki never far way. If\nwe are to welcome the new century as we should, then\nthe United Nations Charter provides the yardstick for the\nchallenges ahead.\nThere are many global issues confronting us today,\nand the United Nations provides us with the best\nchance \u2014 the only chance \u2014 of handling them\nsuccessfully. So let us act for the sake of all humanity. In\nthis global age we must mend our ways. We must think\nwith global heads and attend to humanity\u2019s needs with\nglobal hearts. Only then will our attitudes have kept pace\nwith the realities we face. Only then can we leave a better\nworld for our children.\n"

        "file_text": "It is a pleasure for me to congratulate you, Sir, on your\nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly on\nthis, the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations. I also\nwish to extend our recognition to the Secretary-General,\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, and to the outgoing President,\nMr. Amara Essy.\nWe are convinced that one of the most important\nitems of this session must be support for the effective and\nsubstantive reform of the United Nations.\n\nThe only way to approach the construction of a new\ninternational order is by renewing our faith in\nmultilateralism and giving the United Nations its central,\nindispensable role in the search for lasting solutions to the\ncomplex problems that all our societies are experiencing.\nHalf a century has passed since the founding of the\nUnited Nations. With its successes and setbacks, its\naccomplishments and its problems, the United Nations has\nshown that only organized international cooperation will\nmake it possible to prevent new conflicts. It is impossible\n18\n\n\nto imagine today\u2019s world without this universal institution.\nThe profound changes that have taken place since that era\nand the demands of the future make it necessary for the\nUnited Nations to be renewed, revitalized, reformed and\nstrengthened.\nIt is valid, then, for us to ask ourselves what the new\nvision of our United Nations is in a changing, global and\ninterdependent world. The transformation of the United\nNations cannot be separated from the profound\ntransformations that democracy itself is undergoing\nthroughout the world. Our Organization must be reformed\non the basis of the new conception of democracy.\nThe concept of democracy in the world has changed.\nDemocracy is no longer a static concept, nor is it limited\nonly to the internal affairs of States. Democracy is a\npatrimony of values that are common to all humankind.\nToday\u2019s democracy is dynamic, and in order for it to take\non a profound character, it should be understood as an\nunfinished work that is always in transition.\nToday I should like to emphasize various aspects of\nthis international democratic transition, which is closely\nrelated to the transition that our Organization must undergo.\nFirst, we are moving away from the political agenda\nand moving towards the social agenda. The World Summit\nfor Social Development, held in Denmark, reminded us that\nthe ultimate objective of all our efforts is to improve the\nliving conditions and quality of life of our peoples. Our\nOrganization was born in the geopolitical era, marked by\nEast-West confrontation and bipolar division. Today we are\npassing towards a world divided into economic blocs where\nsocial policies are demanding their rightful place at centre\nstage.\nOur Organization has the duty to facilitate this\ntransition from a world divided between military Powers to\na world where democracy, economic efficiency and social\njustice crown a new world order.\nSecondly, democracy is passing from centralized\ndecision-making to broad participation by citizens in\nsociety. In this way we are moving from formal democracy\nto participative democracy, where power and choice are\nsomehow returned to communities. This transition means\nmore opportunity for dialogue and internal consensus within\nour societies. As has been said on other occasions, the\nconcept of international peace gives way to the concept of\ninternal peace within our States. Last year the Secretary-\nGeneral himself said, at the luncheon he gave for Heads of\nState, that wars are no longer waged between States but,\nrather, within our nations. That is why it is so important\nto promote reconciliation and negotiation in divided\nsocieties.\nThirdly, we are moving from bureaucracy to good\ngovernment. This transition requires that special attention\nbe given to the reform and modernization of the State.\nEfficiency and effectiveness should now be the new terms\nfor public administration.\nFourthly, we are passing from the unilateral\nperspective that has characterized the world to a focus on\ngender that opens the doors for the full, active\nparticipation of women in the great tasks of our times.\nEquality and equity between men and women is a basic\nprinciple for achieving the true development of\ninternational society. In this regard, the recent Conference\nin Beijing opened up a new chapter for us, leading\ntowards this new goal.\nOur Organization also has to assimilate the transition\nfrom a partial concept of development to an integrated\nconcept of sustainable development. This new concept\nrequires us to combine the political dimension with the\nsocial, cultural, economic, ecological and even ethnic\ndimensions of development processes.\nCentral America, a region that emerged into\ndemocracy from out of the ashes of war and conflict \u2014\na region, as the President of El Salvador, Mr. Armando\nCalder\u00f3n Sol, said this afternoon, is going through a new\nstage in its history \u2014 has also adopted a new model of\nsustainable development that makes ours the first region\nin the world to try, through the concrete fulfilment of\ncommitments in all areas, to make a reality of the\nagreements of the Rio Conference on Environment and\nDevelopment.\nWe Central Americans are moving from the model\nof military security centred on the cold-war poles of\npower to the new model of democratic security. The\nUnited Nations should therefore lead the way in this new\nconcept of security, which is not limited to the military\naspect. Rather, human security should be the new axis of\nthis new model of world security.\nToday we Central Americans are discussing a treaty\non democratic security, developed by Nicaragua, that\nenshrines this new concept of security, which is no longer\nbased on number and quality of weapons, but, rather, on\nthe quality of human life, the efficiency of democratic\n19\n\n\ninstitutions, civil security, the fight against drug trafficking,\nterrorism and arms trafficking and cooperation in all areas.\nWe Central Americans have concluded that democracy and\nits improvement are the best way to strengthen regional\nsecurity.\nWe must be aware that we are also going through a\ntransition to what we call preventive democracy. By this we\nmean that we should strive to anticipate conflicts and their\ncauses in order not to have to resolve them later with the\npeace-keeping forces of this Organization. That is why we\nhave always said that the best peace-keeping operation is\nthe one that we can avoid, that we never have to carry out.\nThis also means rechannelling efforts into the area of\npromoting human rights \u2014 no longer treating this subject\nas a mere list of violations of fundamental rights and\nfreedoms devoting great efforts to the promotion of respect\nfor those rights and human freedoms.\nIn its reform process, our Organization should also\ntake into account that commerce and investment are ceasing\nto be merely economic factors; they are becoming a\ngenuine element of support for those democratic processes\nthat demand to form part of economic development. The\nbattles waged before on the battlefield are now waged in\ninternational markets. What we must understand is that\nthere, too, a battle for the sustainability, progress and\ndevelopment of democracy is taking place.\nWe are also making the transition from a world\ndivided between opulence and poverty to one with a new\nfocus on establishing a real alliance for development\nbetween the countries of the north and the countries of the\nsouth. The era of confrontation should give way to a new\nera of cooperation directed at reducing the inequalities\nbetween a rich and prosperous north and a dispossessed and\npoor south.\nWe need to make the transition from an era of\ninequality of opportunities to an era of democratization of\ndevelopment. By this I mean, at the internal level,\nbroadening the base of the benefits of progress for a\nsteadily growing number of small and medium-sized\nbusinessmen. At the international level democratization of\ndevelopment implies sharing the benefits of progress in a\nmore equitable manner between countries.\nIt is not possible to make a deep revision of the\nstructure of our Organization without looking at the\nprofound changes that have taken place in the world and\nwhich are enriching and broadening many of our values,\nconcepts and goals while presenting new challenges.\nFor this reason it is very important to see that the\nreform of the United Nations rests on this global renewal\nof democracy, whose consolidation constitutes the\nfundamental political priority for the new world order we\nare all building.\nI would like to emphasize here that the new and\nrestored democracies, which met in Managua in 1994,\nhave much to do with and much to say about the future\nand the values of our Organization. The consolidation of\ndemocracy in the societies that lived through the\ntotalitarian doctrines of this century is fundamental to\nsustaining this new vision of the United Nations.\nMy country has always counted on the invaluable\ncooperation of the United Nations to complete a transition\nprocess characterized by its complexity. The United\nNations has accompanied us on our road from a\nNicaragua at war to a Nicaragua at peace; from a\nNicaragua divided and without democratic institutions to\na new Nicaragua that today enjoys complete freedom. The\nsame United Nations is accompanying us in the process\nof strengthening the advances made, with the benefits of\neconomic development.\nI would like to recall with special gratitude the\nvarious resolutions of this General Assembly, requesting\nMember States and international financial institutions to\ncontinue to lend their support to Nicaragua in a wider and\nmore flexible manner, taking into consideration the\nexceptional circumstances of our country.\nNicaragua now faces the challenge of successfully\nending the first stage of its transition process, giving\nspecial attention to overcoming dire poverty, to the\nmodernization of its institutions and to the improvement\nof its productive capacity. Nicaragua is preparing to hold\nits next elections in 1996, thus taking a new step in the\nconsolidation of its democratic institutions. It is worth\nrecalling that six years ago this Organization, for the first\ntime in its history, participated in observing elections, and\nthat happened in Nicaragua. Today I want to invite the\nUnited Nations to participate as an observer again, in\nthese new elections which will mark a transcendental\nstage in our democratic process.\nThese challenges make indispensable our continuing\ncollaboration with the United Nations system and with\nfriendly countries in establishing once and for all strong\nfoundations for economic and social development and for\na lasting peace. The United Nations still has much to do\nin Nicaragua.\n20\n\n\nI would like to refer now to the subject of the reform\nof this Organization. We need to move forward urgently in\nthe matter of the democratization of the United Nations and\nall its main organs. In this endeavour Nicaragua fully\nsupports an increase in the number of members of the\nSecurity Council, in order to ensure the equitable\nrepresentation of all regional groups, among the permanent\nmembers as well as the non-permanent. In this context, we\nsupport the entry of Germany and Japan, countries that we\nare certain will make a significant contribution to the\neffectiveness of the Security Council.\nWe must redouble our efforts to promote\nadministrative and budgetary reforms that will make our\nOrganization more efficient. We consider it necessary to\ncontinue with the functional and organizational\nstrengthening of the Economic and Social Council, which\nshould maintain its role as the custodian of the economic,\nsocial and cultural rights of Member States.\nWe cannot speak of reforms in the United Nations\nwithout speaking of reforms in the General Assembly. The\nAssembly must be revitalized, and it should coordinate its\nactivities more closely with the other United Nations\norgans. The President of the Assembly should be given\nmore specific tasks, in accordance with the new\ncircumstances I have already mentioned.\nThere can be no reform of the United Nations without\na solution to the financial crisis through which the\nOrganization is passing. The continual budgetary problems\nmust be examined in an honest, pragmatic way, since the\ncredibility of the Organization is at stake.\nWe are convinced that the development programme\nwill be a strategy that is coherent, not only with the new\nvision of world development, but also with the goals and\nobjectives of the new or restored democracies. It is\nnecessary to have a creative programme for development,\nwith universal validity, which will combine assistance for\ndevelopment, trade, investments, the transfer of technology\nand a reasonable solution to the problem of the debt and the\nnegative transfer of resources.\nOne of the fundamental pillars of Nicaragua\u2019s foreign\npolicy is general and complete disarmament, nuclear as well\nas conventional. Nicaragua is therefore concerned about the\nrecent nuclear tests in the Pacific.\nNicaragua is in solidarity with the 21 million\ninhabitants of the Republic of China in Taiwan, and in this\ncontext we call for resolution of the exceptional situation of\nthe Republic of China through peaceful means, in\naccordance with the principles of the peaceful resolution\nof disputes between States and within the framework of\nthe creation of an ad hoc committee of the General\nAssembly.\nNicaragua takes the opportunity once more to salute\nthe courage and determination of the South African\npeople in the achievement of a new South Africa, united\nand non-racist.\nIn Mozambique we hope that the process of\nreconciliation will continue and that, finally, that patient\nbrother country will take the road to economic growth\nand development.\nSimilarly, we hope that Angola will consolidate the\nestablishment of a strong and lasting peace, indispensable\nfor national reconciliation and reconstruction.\nAs regards the Palestinian question and the Middle\nEast, we are pleased with the positive and irreversible\nevolution towards a just and lasting solution to the\nconflict. We warmly welcome the recent agreements\nbetween Israel and Palestine.\nOur country continues to be alarmed by the situation\nin Somalia, Liberia and Rwanda, and considers that\ngreater efforts are necessary on the part of the\ninternational community, and principally of the United\nNations, to bring stability and peace to those countries.\nIn Europe, in relation to Bosnia and Herzegovina,\nwe are worried about the continuation of hostilities and\nhope for a peaceful solution to the conflict. The\nNicaraguan Government greets with approval the Joint\nStatement and Agreed Basic Principles, signed recently by\nBosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia and Yugoslavia.\nTo end, I wish to say that today more than ever, on\nthe occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the United\nNations, Nicaragua and the majority of the peoples of the\nworld put our confidence in our Organization, since we\nconsider that the time has come for the United Nations to\nassume fully its responsibilities under the Charter.\nNicaragua is ready, in its current conditions of peace and\nharmony, to support this new vision of the United\nNations, also based on a new vision of democracy.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, it is\nundoubtedly a great honour to be the President of the\nUnited Nations General Assembly session in this very\nimportant year. Please accept my sincere congratulations on\nyour election and my very best wishes for a successful\ncourse of its fiftieth session.\nI should also like to thank your predecessor, His\nExcellency Mr. Amara Essy, for his significant contribution\nto the positive results achieved at last year\u2019s session.\nBy the end of 1995, the Slovak Republic will have\nconcluded the third year of its sovereign existence.\nAlthough my country is relatively new in the international\ncommunity, it has during the past three years confirmed\nthat its activities in the international scene are based on\nrespect for international law and for the principles of\ndemocratic coexistence between nations.\nThe basic coordinate of Slovakia\u2019s foreign policy is its\nintegration into the geopolitical and economic sphere with\nwhich we not only have numerous historical ties, but\nalso \u2014 and, I think, more importantly \u2014 with which we\nshare the same hierarchy of modern civilized values.\nAlong with other Central European countries,\nSlovakia has made significant progress in the\ntransformation of its political and economic system, as\nwell as in the process of democratization. We feel\npolitical and economical closeness to the West, and we\nare aware of the unique historical opportunity to join the\nprosperous union of democratic European countries.\nSlovakia as a standard democratic State is an integral\npart of the Central European space, which is undoubtedly\nimportant for political and military stability in Europe.\nWe want to contribute to building that stability by\nmaintaining good-neighbourly relations backed by a set of\nlegally sound treaties, as well as by mutually beneficial\ncooperation. We proceed from the fact that such\ncooperation is a basic precondition for the stability and\nprosperity of all the countries in our region.\nGood relations with the States of the G-7, of the\nCommonwealth of Independent States and all democratic\ncountries, are also of great importance to us. We wish to\nmake full use of the opportunity for cooperation with the\ndynamically developing Asia-Pacific region, with the\nLatin American countries, and with Near and Middle East\ncountries as well.\nThe Slovak Republic participates in maintaining\ninternational peace and security within the framework of\nUnited Nations activities. Our priority at this stage is full\n\n\nmembership in the Conference on Disarmament (CD). In\nthis respect I cannot omit to note that our membership in\nthe Conference on Disarmament following that of the\nformer Czecho-Slovak federation, which had been working\nin that organ since the very beginning, remains the only\nunresolved issue. In all other organs, the seat occupied by\nthe former Czecho-Slovakia was assigned to either the\nCzech Republic or to Slovakia by elections or by\nappointments based on the respective rules, with both\nsuccessor States having agreed not to compete with each\nother in order to obtain seats in organs of the United\nNations system which had been vacated by the dissolution\nof the federation. In accordance with this agreement and\nwith the support of the Eastern European regional group,\nSlovakia submitted its candidature for the seat vacated by\nthe former Czecho-Slovak federation, to which Slovakia is\none of the successor States, in the Conference on\nDisarmament. In other words, we have had and we still\nhave a serious interest in filling the gap which has arisen in\nthe membership of that Conference. We consider it\nunjustifiable to link the issue of filling the vacancy in the\nmembership of the Conference with the broader issue of the\nexpansion of its membership, which has been under\ndiscussion for many years. We expect that States members\nof the Conference will understand this situation and will\nsupport Slovakia and its legitimate effort to pursue the\nprevious activities of Czecho-Slovak diplomacy in the\nConference on Disarmament.\nThe results of the Fifth Review Conference of the\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT)\nrepresent an important impulse for the further activities of\nthe Conference on Disarmament. The extension of the\nTreaty for an indefinite period is the most important result\nof the Review Conference. We consider it a precondition\nfor the further development of international cooperation in\nthe peaceful uses of nuclear energy, as well as for the\ncomplete elimination of nuclear weapons. The Non-\nProliferation Treaty has played a positive role in the\nmodern history of mankind. Being the only Treaty with a\nglobal character, it has managed to reduce the risk of\nfurther expansion of the group of nuclear-weapon States.\nSlovakia places special emphasis on the preparation of\nthe comprehensive test-ban treaty (CTBT) in 1996, and\nsupports the immediate commencement of negotiations\naimed at elaborating the text of the fissile materials cut-off\ntreaty. This would lead to further progress in building up a\nnew security architecture, and it would become an\nimportant milestone on the road to an era when nuclear\nweapons will be considered unnecessary.\nSlovakia, as one of the signatory States, attaches\ngreat importance to the chemical weapons Convention\n(CWC), which has outlawed a whole category of weapons\nof mass destruction. It is my pleasure to inform the\nAssembly that the Slovak Parliament approved this\nConvention three weeks ago, and we will soon submit the\nratification instruments to the Secretary-General.\nIn connection with the forthcoming Review\nConference of the States Parties to the Convention on\nProhibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Certain\nConventional Weapons Which May Be Deemed to Be\nExcessively Injurious or To Have Indiscriminate Effects\n(CCW), my country is ready to support the successful\ncourse of work and the adoption of the text of Protocol\nIV, which would enable the effective implementation of\nthe Convention. Slovakia was among the very first\ncountries to place an embargo on the export of anti-\npersonnel land-mines. We also highly appreciate the\nresults of the International Meeting on United Nations\nMine Clearance Programmes held under the auspices of\nthe Secretary-General. This forum stressed the need for a\nmore active approach to the reduction of negative impacts\ncaused by the use of these inhumane weapons, which\nespecially afflict the civil population, including innocent\nchildren.\nThe conflict on the territory of the former\nYugoslavia has thoroughly tested the entire international\ncommunity, but especially the United Nations\nOrganization itself. The level at which we pass this test\nwill affect relations in the international political scene for\nthe next few decades. Slovakia considers peace talks to be\nthe only way leading to a stable and just solution.\nMilitary actions have turned out to be counter-productive\nand to have only a temporary character. They cannot\novercome the animosity between the warring sides. Our\neffort is aimed at finding generally acceptable solutions\nagreed upon by all parties at the negotiating table. Their\nequal status can be considered to be one of the crucial\nprerequisites in approaching this crisis. Therefore, we\nsupport the plan of the Contact Group and see it as a\nsound starting-point for direct negotiations between the\nparties to the conflict.\nIn order to achieve stability in the Mediterranean\nregion, a just and lasting solution of the problem of\nCyprus should be found. In this context, my country\nsupports the efforts of the international community and\nhighly esteems in particular the contribution which the\nSecretary-General made in stressing the territorial\nintegrity and sovereignty of Cyprus. We think it is\n2\n\n\nnecessary that negotiations continue between the two\ncommunities in order to reunite the island. This process, if\nit is to be concluded successfully, has to take into\nconsideration the individual and specific differences existing\nwithin the population. Slovakia is ready to continue\nproviding its good services aimed at facilitating meetings\nbetween political representatives of the two communities.\nSince there are so many conflicts in all parts of the\nworld, my country welcomes any progress that would\nstrengthen international security and peace. Just to mention\na few examples, visible progress has been made in the\nMiddle East peace process focused on the final settlement\nof the long-standing Arab-Israeli conflict. The agreements\nsigned between the State of Israel and the Palestine\nLiberation Organization have proved the correct and\nappropriate nature of the peace talks and of the efforts of\nthe two parties and of the international community. These\nefforts are based on the conviction that the two parties can\ncoexist peacefully.\nUnited Nations peace-keeping operations have become\none of the most discussed issues. Slovakia considers peace-\nkeeping operations to be an important instrument with\nwhich the international community can maintain peace and\nsecurity in the world. On the other hand, we realize that the\ncurrent situation is not ideal. Therefore, we support the\nprocess of restructuring peace-keeping operations, which\nwould increase their effectiveness and allow them to react\nquickly. This would require the mandate of peace-keeping\nmissions to be clear, unambiguous and realistic \u2014 that is,\nimplementable. In this context, we welcome the Supplement\nto the Agenda for Peace as an effort to strengthen the\nelement of conflict prevention. We have been following the\ndiscussions on these issues with great attention and we\nshare the view that, at this stage, peace-keeping, rather than\npeace-enforcement, is the realistic solution reflecting both\nthe complexity of most conflicts and what the international\ncommunity can sustain.\nSlovakia\u2019s position has been reflected in the types of\nunits and services provided for peace-keeping operations.\nAt the current time we have 600 engineers in the former\nYugoslavia and five military observers in the United\nNations Angola Verification Mission. The Slovak Engineer\nBattalion was awarded an honorary diploma by the Force\nCommander of the United Nations Protection Force in\nNovember 1994 in recognition of its professional skills and\nthe quality of the work done.\nIn order to achieve the goals set forth by the United\nNations, it is necessary that they be realized in a democratic\nenvironment, especially with regard to the protection of\nhuman rights. The Slovak Republic has succeeded to all\nthe relevant international obligations of the former\nCzecho-Slovak federation. In the field of human rights,\nthis means that Slovakia is a party to all of the\ninternational human rights conventions. This active\napproach has also resulted in a variety of documents\napproved in domestic legislation and in foreign policy.\nI should like to mention just a few examples,\nespecially the incorporation of international human rights\nprotection standards into the Constitution of the Slovak\nRepublic; the further harmonization of other legal norms\nto those standards; the establishment of the Slovak\nNational Centre for Human Rights, and the Governmental\nCommittee for the implementation of the Action\nProgramme against Racism, Anti-Semitism, Xenophobia,\nand Intolerance; active participation in the preparation of\ninternational documents concerning the protection of\npersons belonging to ethnic minorities; the ratification of\nthe Framework Convention of the Council of Europe on\nthe Protection of Minorities; and, last but not least, the\nreflection of this document, together with the United\nNations Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging\nto National or Ethnic, Religious and Linguistic Minorities\nin the Treaty on Good Neighbourly Relations and\nFriendly Cooperation signed this year with Hungary.\nSlovakia is very sensitive to all kinds of disrespect\nfor and gross violation of values which are the keystone\nof human dignity, and my country therefore highly\nappreciates United Nations activities in regard to the\nprotection of human rights. We are prepared to contribute\nto the strengthening of international cooperation in order\nto achieve higher respect for human rights and basic\nfreedoms for all, regardless of their race, gender, language\nor religion.\nSpeaking of human rights, we cannot overlook the\nrights of women. The Fourth World Conference on\nWomen, which has just concluded, has raised a number\nof questions which will have to be resolved by our joint\nefforts. We welcome the successful outcome of this event\nand we were honoured, as a member of the Commission\non the Status of Women, to take active part in the\npreparation of its final document, the Platform for Action.\nThere are a number of social issues related to the\nstatus of women. One of them is the role of the family in\nsociety. The International Centre for Family Studies has\nbeen active in Slovakia since the end of 1993 and it has\nrepeatedly proved its viability by actively participating at\n3\n\n\nvarious international events. This Centre was the\nco-organizer of the United Nations Interregional Meeting of\nNational Coordinators \u2014 Focal Point for the Year of the\nFamily, held in Bratislava from 4 to 7 February 1995.\nThese facts have led our Government to seek opportunities\nfor closer cooperation between the Centre and the United\nNations. Slovakia has therefore submitted a proposal for\naffiliating the Centre with the United Nations. We would\nhighly appreciate our proposal being given positive\nconsideration.\nSlovakia appreciates the efforts of the United Nations\nwith a view to the restructuring and revitalization of its\nactivities in the economic, social and other related fields, as\nwell as all reforms connected with them. We consider these\nefforts to be a contribution to improving the efficiency of\nthe work of the United Nations and a positive reaction to\nall major changes taking place all over the world.\nWe fully support the basic approach and goals of the\ntwo fundamental documents approved by the United\nNations in the area of international economic cooperation\nin the 1990s: the Declaration on International Economic\nCooperation, in particular the Revitalization of Economic\nGrowth and Development of the Developing Countries, and\nthe International Development Strategy for the Fourth\nUnited Nations Development Decade.\nOne of the main priorities anchored in these\ndocuments is the development of human resources within\nthe overall development framework. These documents are\nbased on global consensus. Their aim is to improve the\nsocial and economic situation of the poor and least\ndeveloped parts of our planet and thus to eliminate one of\nthe main sources of conflicts \u2014 the huge differences\nbetween the wealthy and poor countries. All these goals are\nin the best interest of the Slovak Republic, too.\nDuring the last decade, the number of countries\nmeeting the criteria for being \u201cleast developed\u201d has\nsignificantly increased. Together with other global problems\nsuch as environmental protection and sustainable\ndevelopment, which cannot be resolved by a single country\nor several countries, this is a challenge for all mankind, and\nfor the most developed countries in particular. However, we\nmust stress also the primary responsibility of the countries\nconcerned for their further development.\nNowadays, Slovakia itself, as well as other Central and\nEast European countries, must face a variety of complicated\neconomic problems related to the process of transition from\na centrally planned economy to a market economy. This\nprocess has never before been carried out to such an\nextent. We are deeply interested in continued access to\nvaluable information within United Nations projects\nrelated to know-how, human resources development and\nmanagement training. This would certainly help us in\ncarrying out our economic reform.\nDespite the complicated economic situation, my\ncountry has a strong will to participate actively in United\nNations programmes in areas in which we could be of\nassistance, namely in areas concerning human resources\nin developing countries. For example, we see\nopportunities for broader participation by Slovak experts\nin development programmes.\nSlovakia supports all activities of the United Nations\nin the field of assistance to developing countries. We\nwelcome the increasing efforts of these countries not to\nbe in the position of passive recipients only, and we value\ntheir endeavour to take over the management of their\neconomic and technical development. At the same time,\nwe highly appreciate the United Nations role in\nimplementing its projects, to reflect the needs of the\nreceiving countries fully, while respecting specific\nfeatures of their economies and their priorities and\nmaking use of the domestic human, technical and\ntechnological potential.\nNowadays, when the United Nations is going\nthrough a complicated period of its existence, it is\nparticularly important to determine the direction of its\nactivities, with, as a starting-point, the processes going on\nin international relations. Interconnection between global\nand national interests is the defining factor in coping with\nthe problems which all mankind is facing at the moment.\nIf the United Nations is really to understand the very\nnature of these processes, it will be necessary to start its\nown reform. We support such reform and therefore\nsupport all steps that would strengthen the United Nations\nsystem and thereby enable it to perform its tasks more\neffectively. This reform will require, inter alia, the\nrestructuring of most of the Organization\u2019s main bodies.\nAs for Security Council reform, we support expanding the\nCouncil by the addition of new members that are able to\nassume global responsibilities and have sufficient\npotential to support United Nations activities financially.\nThe credibility and efficiency of the Security Council\nhave to be stressed as the main priorities.\nWe are fully aware of the difficult financial\nsituation, which is a result of unpaid arrears by Member\n4\n\n\nStates. Member States are very often unable to pay their\nassessed contributions. Therefore, we support the reform of\nthe scale of assessment based on the principle of the\ncapacity to pay, and we also expect the reform to increase\neffectiveness and transparency of spending.\nIn connection with the United Nations budget, I wish\nto mention that Slovakia, in spite of the fact that it is\nundergoing a transformation of its economy and has to cope\nwith various pressures on State finances, has always\nfulfilled its obligation to pay its assessed contribution to the\nregular budget in full. As concerns its contribution to the\nbudget for peace-keeping operations, Slovakia is in the\nsame position as the Czech Republic. These two countries\nhave not been classified into any of the groups for the\napportionment of peace-keeping expenses even though they\nhave been Members of the United Nations for more than\ntwo and a half years. We believe that this issue will be\nresolved at this year\u2019s session of the General Assembly, and\nthat in so doing we shall take realistically into account the\nrespective economic data. Having analysed the data and\nhaving compared it with data from other countries, we have\nreached the firm conviction that Slovakia should be placed\namong the Member States of Group \u201cC\u201d for the\napportionment of peace-keeping expenses. From this\nrostrum I want to confirm that Slovakia is ready to shoulder\nits fair share of responsibility for this important activity of\nthe United Nations.\nThis year we commemorate five decades since the end\nof the horrors of the Second World War, since that moment\nwhen all nations put aside weapons with the intention of\nliving in peace, and, for this reason, decided to establish an\norganization which would serve as a platform for\ninternational cooperation. Looking back at those decades we\nmust logically come to the conclusion that the United\nNations has played a crucial role in our history and that its\nexistence is still justified.\nAlthough the ceremonies will culminate in meetings\nnext month, we can already say that we did our best to\nensure the commemoration of this anniversary with honour.\nFor the celebration of this anniversary, a special committee\nestablished in Slovakia organized many education-oriented\nevents, a number of which are still taking place. The main\ngoal of all seminars, meetings, and television and radio\nbroadcasts has been to focus more attention on the activities\nof this undoubtedly most important international\norganization, not only in the field of maintaining\ninternational peace and security but also, and especially, in\nthe field of the development of international cooperation in\nall areas of human activity.\nI wish the best for this session of the General\nAssembly, and I wish it much spiritual strength in\nresolving the important issues which the United Nations\nis facing now.\n\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me first of all to express\nvery warm greetings and congratulations to the President\nfrom the Government and people of Fiji on his election to\npreside over the General Assembly at this historic fiftieth\nsession. We are confident that with his vast experience\nand demonstrated leadership, the General Assembly will\ncomplete its deliberations at this important session\nfruitfully. I would also like to express the compliments of\nmy delegation to His Excellency Foreign Minister Amara\nEssy, whose presidency during the forty-ninth session\nbrought the work of the General Assembly to a successful\nconclusion.\nI wish to join other speakers in warmly welcoming\nthe Republic of Palau as the one hundred and eighty-fifth\nMember of the United Nations.\nOn 13 October 1970, a quarter of a century ago, Fiji,\na newly independent State only three days old, was\nadmitted as this body\u2019s one hundred twenty-sixth\nmember. Standing at this very rostrum, the Permanent\nRepresentative Designate of Fiji to the United Nations,\nAmbassador Semesa Sikivou, said,\n\u201cAlthough I represent a small country far away\nin the Pacific, my Government and people warmly\ncherish the principles and ideals which led to the\nfoundation of the United Nations and which have\nmade this great Assembly, in its 25 years of\nexistence, one of the main hopes for the future of\nmankind. And we are fully resolved to play our part,\nhowever humble, in helping to maintain and foster\nthe high purpose for which this Assembly was\nestablished \u2014 the brotherhood of mankind.\u201d\n(Official Records of the General Assembly, Twenty-\nfifth Session, Plenary Meetings, 1863rd meeting,\npara. 111)\nToday I wish to confirm that since that memorable\noccasion, nothing has changed to diminish that resolve in\nany way. It has never been shaken. The intervening years\nhave demonstrated that the high purpose to which\nAmbassador Sikivou referred constitutes the very cement\nthat binds us together in the pursuit of a common global\ndestiny. The principles and ideals which inspired the\narchitects of the United Nations still endure as noble\ngoals that challenge us.\nToday is a special day for Fiji because it marks the\ntwenty-fifth year of our nationhood. While anniversaries\n18\n\n\nare appropriate moments for celebration, they are also a\nfitting time for reflection, stocktaking and giving thanks. In\nour particular case, Fiji owes a debt of gratitude to its\nfriends in the international community who reached out to\nassist us over these years. Since that moment, over two\ndecades ago, when our frail canoe embarked on its long\nvoyage, with all its reefs and shoals, it has been comforting\nto have so many friends ready to show us the beacons and\nlighthouses, enabling us to choose a course that would\nmake our independence meaningful for ourselves. On behalf\nof the Government and the people of Fiji, it is my solemn\nduty today to say thank you to our friends. As the canoe\ncontinues its journey, we are confident that we will be able\nto continue counting on the guidance and help of our\nfriends. And this includes the United Nations \u2014 we highly\nvalue our association with it and the assistance it provides.\nHalf a century ago, the United Nations was established\nto end the scourge of war and build a better world for\nsucceeding generations. The cold war and its attendant\nsuper-Power rivalry have ended. However, despite\ndecreases in inter-State conflicts, recent history indicates\nthat the much-promised peace dividend from the end of the\nsterile confrontations that characterized much of the life of\nthe United Nations has not materialized. Conflicts within\nStates continue to tear at the fabric of established societies.\nCan we truly say, looking around our world, that it is better\ntoday than it was 50 years ago?\nDuring the last year, in particular, there has been\nmuch soul-searching about the role of the United Nations.\nThis has stemmed in part from a growing perception that in\nthe face of civil strife, the Blue Helmets have been\npowerless to save lives and prevent conflict. I believe that\nthe seeming hesitancy of United Nations peace-keepers\nreflects our inability as Member States of the Organization\nto develop a clear and confident sense of the new role of\nthe United Nations in today\u2019s changed global environment.\nWe all have a collective responsibility to ensure that\na more precise vision of the role of the modern United\nNations is created. With political will, we can do it. In this\nprocess, I suggest that the moment is right for us to\nrededicate ourselves to the Charter, for it is the principles\nenshrined in it that represent our best opportunity for\nfinding a clear direction ahead as we approach the new\nmillennium. No less important is that we, as Member\nStates, should equip our Organization with the resources to\ncarry out its reinvigorated mandate.\nThe United Nations must further enlarge its\ninstruments of preventive diplomacy. The Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s Agenda for Peace has clearly made an\noutstanding contribution to discussions in this area. Fiji\nurges the Assembly to give earnest consideration to\nimplementing his recommendations on this issue. Fiji\nconsiders that there is much merit to proposals that a\nspecial department or unit be set up to deal with conflict\nprevention and resolution. This unit could coordinate the\nactions of a rapid-deployment force to be dispatched to\ntrouble spots when conflicts erupt. More importantly, it\nwould collate, analyse and interpret information and\nintelligence and develop early detection capacities on\npotential conflict situations. It would also work with\nStates in developing confidence-building measures\ndesigned to minimize both intra- and inter-State conflicts.\nThe financial position of the United Nations\ncontinues to be a matter of concern to Fiji. In this we are\nnot alone, I am sure. The sudden and huge increase in\nexpenditures for peace-keeping operations to a level more\nthan three times as high as that of expenditures for\ndevelopment is becoming difficult to sustain and justify.\nIt has been our view for some time that the apparent\nimbalance between resources committed to security issues\nand those committed to development is not justified.\nAs regards peace-keeping, we all know that there are\nlarge-scale arrears in contributions. We do not object to\npeace-keeping operations. On the contrary, despite our\nsmallness and our relative lack of resources, we have\nbeen a consistent and active contributor of troops to\nvarious peace-keeping missions. Fiji has paid a heavy\nhuman and financial price for contributing troops, but it\nhas done so gladly and willingly and will continue to do\nso. Clearly, though, the United Nations has to rationalize\nits peace-keeping expenditures and at the same time\nreimburse fully and in timely fashion monies that it owes\nto troop-contributing countries.\nIt is now becoming clear that a large number of\nMember States, if not the majority, wish the United\nNations to devote more attention and resources to human\nand social development. Ultimately, there can be no\nsustainable peace without development. Enduring\nsolutions to social and economic problems represent the\nbasic infrastructure for long-term peace. The United\nNations cannot \u2014 indeed, must not \u2014 shrink from this\naspect of its mission.\nA greater rationalization of agencies and\nprogrammes within the United Nations and its agencies\nmust be tackled with urgency and vigour. Fiji supports\nefforts to establish a high-level working group on United\n19\n\n\nNations reform, and we look forward to contributing to\nefforts within the Organization aimed at revitalizing and\nstrengthening the United Nations system. Of critical\nimportance to this review process is the need for the United\nNations to redirect its focus away from activities of limited\nvalue and relevance and to strengthen those which the\nMember States identify as meaningful. This will require the\ntaking of some hard decisions which can no longer be\npostponed.\nThe end of bipolarism and the increased membership\nof the United Nations have created new challenges for the\nOrganization. One of these is the reform of the Security\nCouncil. Fiji has followed with keen interest the\ndeliberations of the Open-ended Working Group on the\nQuestion of Equitable Representation on and Increase in the\nMembership of the Security Council. We believe that the\nstructures of the United Nations should reflect changes in\nthe global political landscape. They should reflect the\nprinciples of geographical representation and equity\nconsistent with today\u2019s global political and economic\nrealities. The arguments for an enlarged Security Council\nreflecting these principles are compelling. Fiji also believes\nthat while questions as to the form of the Council are\nimportant, equal attention to the substance of the Security\nCouncil is crucial. In particular, we would urge that closer\nattention be paid to the \u201cveto\u201d power in the light of the new\nglobal realities to which I have referred.\nFiji would like to register its strong view that the\nquestion of the protection and security of small States\nremains a central concern of the United Nations. Last year,\nwe joined in sponsoring a resolution on this issue in the\nFourth Committee, for as long as drug traffickers,\ninternational arms dealers, money launderers and\ninternational white-collar criminals continue to ply their\ntrade, and as long as mercenaries and terrorists and other\nadventurers exist, the protection and security of small States\nwill remain vulnerable to acts of aggression from without\nas well as from within. Small States especially look to the\nprovisions of the Charter as regards respect for their\nsovereignty and its preservation.\nEarlier this year, Fiji joined other States Members of\nthe United Nations in agreeing to an unconditional and\nindefinite extension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation\nof Nuclear Weapons (NPT). The Review and Extension\nConference was difficult and involved a willingness to\ncompromise on the part of many parties. During the\nConference, Fiji stated that the future viability of the NPT\nwould depend on the conduct of States in relation to their\nrights and obligations. Fiji went along with the decision to\nextend the Treaty despite its imperfections because we\nbelieved that it made an important contribution to global\npeace and security.\nWe were therefore bitterly disappointed when France\nannounced its decision in June this year to resume nuclear\ntesting in the South Pacific. Coming in the wake of the\nNPT Conference, the French decision displayed great\ninsensitivity. Fiji has long been a consistent opponent of\nnuclear testing in all forms and in all environments. If\nanything, we believe that rather than contribute to, they\ndetract from, national and indeed global security. As an\noceanic State heavily dependent on the sea for food and\nsurvival, we maintain that nuclear testing in our region\nhas a more immediate impact. It threatens one of our\nmain sources of livelihood and our health, not only at the\npresent time, but for generations to come. The French\ndecision to resume nuclear testing at Mururoa has, as is\nwell known, met with worldwide condemnation. South\nPacific countries, as those most immediately affected,\nhave added their strong individual and collective voices\nto the protests. In the light of the cessation of the cold\nwar, one might ask, What is the need for further testing\nof nuclear weapons?\nFiji therefore urges France, even at this stage, after\nit has already detonated two of its planned eight nuclear\ndevices, to reconsider its decision. It is not too late to turn\nthe clock back. In recent years, thanks to the moratorium\non testing put in place by President Mitterrand, France\nhas enjoyed cordial relations in the Pacific region, but all\nthat good will and the warmth of those relationships are\nnow being rapidly compromised by their recent decision.\nAt their meeting in Madang last month the leaders of the\nPacific Forum expressed their extreme outrage at the\nresumption by the French of their nuclear testing in the\nPacific. They decided that, should France continue its\ntesting in the Pacific, the Forum would review the status\nof France as a Forum dialogue partner. It is therefore\nsingularly disappointing that despite all these objections,\nFrance went ahead and detonated a second nuclear device\nat Fagataufa, on 2 October 1995. We regard this as a slap\nin the face of the leaders of the Forum and a violent\ncrime against the people of the South Pacific.\nAs the Assembly is aware, the Forum has now duly\nsuspended France as a post-Forum dialogue partner. This\nwill remain so until France changes its decision on\nnuclear testing in the Pacific. Fiji fully associates itself\nwith the Forum decision.\n20\n\n\nFiji would also like to express its deep regret at the\ncontinued nuclear testing by the People\u2019s Republic of\nChina. We see no justification for such tests. My\nGovernment calls upon all States having similar intentions\nto desist from taking any action that would threaten\nnegotiations at the current session of the Conference on\nDisarmament taking place in Geneva. While present\nindications are that negotiations to conclude a universal,\nmultilateral and effectively verifiable nuclear-test-ban treaty\nare on track, we cannot yet assume that the time for\ncongratulations and back-patting has been reached. That\nwill only come with the final conclusion of a\ncomprehensive test-ban treaty (CTBT) which takes into\naccount the security of all States, including non-nuclear\nStates. Fiji continues to place high priority on completion\nof the CTBT negotiations in 1996. We welcome President\nClinton\u2019s commitment to a zero threshold test-ban treaty.\nFiji urges other nuclear-weapon States that have not yet\ndone so to give similar assurances. These States have a\nspecial responsibility in ensuring that the CTBT\nnegotiations remain on track. We believe that a\ncomprehensive treaty covering all relevant concerns will\nmake a significant contribution to efforts towards nuclear\ndisarmament and the prevention of the proliferation of\nnuclear weapons in all its aspects.\nWithin our own region, the South Pacific, we have a\nnumber of conventions and treaties designed to keep the\nregion free from nuclear and other hazardous material.\nThese include the Convention for the Protection and\nDevelopment of the Natural Resources and Environment of\nthe South Pacific Region, of 1989, and its related\nProtocols \u2014 the Noumea Convention, the Waigani\nConvention \u2014 which was opened for signature only last\nmonth and which aims to ban the importation into Forum\nisland countries of hazardous and radioactive wastes and to\ncontrol the transboundary movement and management of\nhazardous wastes within the South Pacific region \u2014 and\nthe South Pacific nuclear-free-zone Treaty, the Treaty of\nRarotonga, of 1985, and its three Protocols.\nWith regard to the latter, we are pleased that two of\nthe five nuclear Powers \u2014 China and the Russian\nFederation \u2014 have signed the relevant Protocols. But the\nremaining three have not done so as yet. We therefore urge\nthe United States of America, France and the United\nKingdom to sign the Protocols as soon as possible as a\ndemonstration of their commitment to a comprehensive\nnuclear test-ban treaty.\nFrom a global perspective, it had been predicted that\nthe conclusion of the Uruguay Round would link economies\nmore strongly through increased flows of trade and\nfinance based on trade liberalization and a concomitant\nstrengthening of multilateral trading systems. While trade\nliberalization caused by the Uruguay Round has had\npositive effects on the trade and incomes of some\ncountries, the beneficial results of that process have been\nfar from uniform. Nor have they been universal. Most, if\nnot all, of the Pacific island countries are among those\nthat have been adversely affected by the changed global\ntrading regime, in part as a result of the removal of\ncertain preferential trade arrangements of which they\nformed a part. Small island developing economies have\nborne the brunt of these changes, which have forced\nsometimes painful adjustments.\nWe would therefore urge our developed-country\npartners to assist efforts we are making at the national\nand regional levels to enhance our international economic\ncompetitiveness and to expand our trading opportunities.\nLast year, Fiji, along with other small island developing\ncountries, welcomed General Assembly resolution 49/100,\nwhich recalled the special economic vulnerability of the\nsmall island developing States. Fiji acknowledges the role\nof the United Nations Conference on Trade and\nDevelopment (UNCTAD) and the Department for Policy\nCoordination and Sustainable Development of the\nSecretariat in research and policy analysis in the\nstrengthening of the capacities of small island developing\nStates to capture a larger share of world trade. We\nwelcome the recent appointments of senior staff in both\nthose entities to provide greater focus on problems related\nto small island developing States. However, Fiji believes\nthat more tangible and concrete evidence of specific\nsupport measures to small island developing States must\nbe put in place without further delay. We would urgently\ncommend this as a matter to be studied in some detail by\nthe Commission on Sustainable Development at its high-\nlevel segment to be convened next year.\nTalk of peace and development enjoins all within\nour global village, especially leaders, to recall and to\nrededicate themselves to the commitments they agreed to\nat the World Summit for Social Development held earlier\nthis year in Denmark. If we as leaders in Government\ncommit ourselves to creating an economic, political and\nsocial environment that will enable people to achieve\nsocial development, we will have gone a long way\ntowards creating an environment conducive to peace.\nFiji would therefore renew its plea to the developed\nindustrialized countries to enhance their assistance to\ndeveloping countries within the framework of the\n21\n\n\nCopenhagen Declaration to bring about improved standards\nof living in the third world. In the long term, more stable\nand more affluent national societies comprising well-\nnourished individuals will be less of a threat to global peace\nand stability than States whose citizens languish in abject\npoverty and the horrors of sectarian violence. At the same\ntime, we also recognize that since resources, particularly\ndevelopment assistance, are getting harder to come by, it is\nincumbent upon all of us to see that whatever resources are\nmade available are put to the best possible use.\nIndeed, proper management of resources is\nincreasingly becoming one of the major preoccupations of\nboth the aid donors and the aid recipients in our region of\nthe South Pacific. The South Pacific Forum had \u201cManaging\nresources\u201d as its theme in 1994. The Forum\u2019s deliberations\nthis year, which took place only last month in Papua New\nGuinea, centred on the theme of \u201cSecuring development\nbeyond 2000\u201d. As in previous years, the Forum island\nmembers again had very useful discussions with aid donors\nin the region in their post-Forum dialogue. We are deeply\nappreciative of the opportunity to sit down together with the\ndonors and discuss regional issues of mutual concern. The\ndonors included the United States, the United Kingdom,\nFrance, Japan, Canada, the European Union, the People\u2019s\nRepublic of China, Taiwan and the Republic of Korea.\nWe believe that regional cooperation will play an\nincreasingly important role in the development of our\nnational economies. We therefore highly value our\nincreasing contacts with the countries members of the\nAssociation of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the\neconomies of South-East Asia generally. This includes\nTaiwan, with which we enjoy very useful and close trade,\neconomic and technical cooperation, just as we do with the\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China, with which we have strong and\nunequivocally clear official relations. We believe that\nTaiwan, like the People\u2019s Republic of China, has huge\npotential to contribute in a practical way to the development\nof our region and to the world generally. We therefore\nwelcome the spirit of dialogue and cooperation between\nTaiwan and the People\u2019s Republic of China and hope that\nthe international community at large will also be able to\nbenefit from such cooperation. Their increased participation\nand cooperation in the activities of various international and\nregional forums would certainly be welcome.\nFiji, as a member of the South Pacific Forum, is\npleased that the Republic of Korea has now joined the\nForum as a post-Forum dialogue partner. We are confident\nthat the Republic of Korea, a rapidly growing economic\nPower, can play a very significant role in the development\nof the South Pacific region. We welcome the\nopportunities that lie ahead. Further, we hope that\ninitiatives for talks between the Republic of Korea and\nthe Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea will continue.\nWe hope that in due course there will be direct dialogue\nbetween the two Koreas, leading to their reconciliation\nand eventual reunification.\nLast month, the Fourth World Conference on\nWomen, in which Fiji also participated, was held at\nBeijing. We thank the Government and the people of\nChina for acting as host to the Conference. Our\ndelegation had high praise for the efficient organization of\nthe Conference. We welcome the very useful deliberations\nthat took place at Beijing. Fiji looks forward to early\nimplementation of the Platform of Action so that the ideas\ncontained in it may be translated into meaningful activity\nfor the betterment of women.\nPreoccupation with economic progress should not be\nat the expense of continued protection of the environment\nand sustainable development. Indeed, good environmental\nhousekeeping will encourage economic growth rather than\nhinder it.\nWhile the United Nations Conference on\nEnvironment and Development at Rio de Janeiro was seen\nas a defining moment in the quest for sustainability and\nenvironmental protection, Fiji regrets that a lack of\npolitical commitment, coupled with donor fatigue, has\nbeen responsible for the failure of most developed\ncountries to allocate adequate financial resources to\nenable developing countries to tackle the plethora of\nproblems associated with environmental degradation.\nIf no increased official development assistance is\nforthcoming and if the international target of 0.7 per cent\nis not met, there will be serious reneging on commitments\nmade at Rio. Fiji is especially concerned as a small island\ndeveloping State that the more affluent industrialized\ncountries should recognize their responsibility towards the\ninternational community and take urgent steps to assist\nsmall island developing States in implementing the\nBarbados Programme of Action. Specifically, the need is\nfor international cooperation, technology transfer and\nfinancial resources.\nThere is also a critical need for access to markets,\nacquisition of new technologies, investments and\ninstitutional and human resource development by small\nisland developing States to enable them to respond more\neffectively to the challenge of finding new paths to\n22\n\n\nsustainable development. My Government would urge all\nparties to the United Nations Framework Convention on\nClimate Change to move speedily towards the conclusion\nof an effective protocol that would ultimately bring about\nimprovements in the global climate system. For front-line\nStates such as Fiji, vulnerable as we are to rising sea levels,\nhurricanes and other phenomena associated with a worst-\ncase scenario of climate change, politics has little to do\nwith the reality that our physical survival would be affected\nif immediate action to remedy ailments in the world climate\nsystem were not taken. In this context, Fiji welcomes the\ncommencement of negotiations on the Berlin mandate to\nstrengthen the Framework Convention on Climate Change,\nwhich got under way in Geneva last August.\nAt the first Conference of the Parties to the\nConvention, Fiji had expressed its regret that the outcome\nof the Conference was minimal. Fiji continues to believe\nthat the protocol of the Alliance of Small Island States\nshould form the basis of any new instrument aimed at\nstrengthening the climate Convention. Further, at the\npresent time, no new commitments should attach to\ndeveloping countries, given that their overriding priority\nwill remain the combatting of poverty. Recognizing that the\npresent health of the world\u2019s climate system is a result of\nthe detrimental patterns of production and consumption of\nthe industrialized countries, those countries should continue\nto take the lead in reducing the emission of greenhouse\ngases.\nFiji welcomes the successful completion of the United\nNations Conference on Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly\nMigratory Fish Stocks. The Agreement produced by the\nConference was the culmination of more than two years of\nwork by Member countries that participated in it. It will\nform yet another important building block in the\nprogressive development of international law under the\nauspices of the United Nations. Fiji hopes that the\nAgreement will lead to the sustainable utilization of the\nliving resources of the sea. For its part, Fiji was both\nhonoured and privileged to have played a small part in\nfacilitating the work of the Conference. We have kept true\nto the promise of Ambassador Sikivou that Fiji would play\nits part, however humble, in the affairs of this great\nAssembly.\nAt this time I would like to pay a special tribute to\nAmbassador Satya Nandan, under whose guidance as\nChairman the Conference completed the difficult task of\nweaving together the sometimes competing interests that\nunderlie the often complex and technical negotiations that\nallowed for an agreement. Ambassador Nandan has done us\nproud, and Fiji is indebted to him for his enduring\ncontribution.\nFiji has followed with keen interest the deliberations\nof the Working Group on Indigenous Populations under\nthe brilliant stewardship of Mrs. Erica-Irene Daes, under\nwhose guidance a draft declaration on the rights of\nindigenous peoples has been completed. Fiji believes that\nthe draft declaration is comprehensive and contains the\nfundamentals that should be part of any instrument that\nseeks to address the legitimate concerns and aspirations of\nall indigenous peoples. We would urge all States\nMembers of the United Nations to support efforts to\nconclude work leading to early adoption of the draft\ndeclaration. However, while the draft declaration is\nimportant, Fiji considers that it is now time to give the\nfullest recognition at the international level to the rights\nof indigenous peoples by commencing negotiations to\nconclude as soon as possible a legal covenant on the\nsubject. My Government believes that such an instrument\nwould be a logical progression following the adoption of\nthe draft declaration and would signal that the political\nwill to respect the rights of indigenous peoples exists.\nDuring the greater part of the life of the United\nNations, the strong have dictated to the feeble, the big to\nthe small, the mighty to the weak. While there has been\nsome semblance of order, it has often been at the expense\nof justice and equity. In this context, while the United\nNations has been a symbol of hope for people from small\ncountries such as mine, much more remains to be done\nbefore it can fulfil the promise of promoting human\ndignity, improved standards of living and social progress\nfor all. That said, however, Fiji\u2019s view is that the United\nNations remains the best and most imaginative\norganization mankind has yet devised for its survival in\npeace, justice and progress.\nOn this day, 10 October, which is the silver\nanniversary of the independence of Fiji, and on the golden\nanniversary of the United Nations, we want to share with\nthe international community the extraordinary opportunity\nto rededicate ourselves to fulfilling the aspirations of the\nCharter. The United Nations must continue to advance the\ninterests of all mankind by providing a meaningful forum\nfor genuine dialogue between the rich and the poor for\nthe establishment of conditions for development, and thus\nfor peace.\nPermit me to conclude with a final walk down\nmemory lane. When Fiji\u2019s first Prime Minister, the Right\nHonourable Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara, now President,\n23\n\n\naddressed this Assembly on 21 October 1970, he ended his\nhistoric address with these words:\n\u201cmuch of the effort of the United Nations has been\nconcentrated on improving the material well-being of\nthe peoples of the world, and I have just been reading\nthe far-reaching and imaginative report of the Second\nCommittee setting out a blueprint for the second\ndecade of economic development. It may then sound\nungrateful for a small country like Fiji, which has so\noften been at the receiving end of the bounty, to\nquestion this priority. But so many of these schemes,\nwelcome as they are, are confined within the\nboundaries of one country. Spiritual and moral values,\non the other hand, know no frontiers, and by\nupholding and encouraging these, we are following a\ncourse which is truly international, and which is\ncalculated more than anything else to give reality to\nthe concept of one world. We do not live by bread\nalone, and it is only from the firm base of sound\nmoral and spiritual standards that we can go on to\nmeaningful economic progress\u201d. (Official Records of\nthe General Assembly, Twenty-fifth Session, Plenary\nMeetings, 1876th meeting, para. 210)\nI would suggest that this advice, given with\ncharacteristic humility, as it was then by the architect of\nmodern Fiji, is no less powerful today than it was 25 years\nago. I recommend it for the further consideration of this\ngathering.\n"

        "file_text": "It is a great honour\nfor me to speak on behalf of my delegation, since my\nForeign Minister is currently campaigning in the\nimpending presidential and parliamentary elections.\nAllow me to congratulate you, Sir, on your election\nas President of the historic fiftieth session of the United\nNations General Assembly. You bring to this office a\nwealth of experience and rich intellectual and diplomatic\nskill which assure us of a fruitful conclusion of the work\nbefore the session. And, above all, my delegation\napplauds your sensitivity to development issues.\nA well-deserved tribute is also due to your\ndistinguished predecessor, Mr. Amara Essy, the Foreign\nMinister of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, who successfully presided over\nthe forty-ninth session.\nAt this juncture, I would like to pay tribute to\nSecretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, whose\nindefatigable efforts in the search for peace and\ndevelopment are very well appreciated by my\nGovernment and the people of Tanzania. We also salute\nthe selfless efforts and commitment of the overwhelming\nmajority of the Secretariat staff in the service of the\ninternational community.\nMy delegation wishes to reiterate Tanzania\u2019s firm\nconviction that the United Nations is all of us - its\nMembers. It does not exist apart from us, nor should it be\nused by one Member or group of Members to the\ndetriment of the wishes and hopes of the international\ncommunity. It can do only what we, its Members, are\nprepared to do, acting together.\n\nThis is not to say that our Organization is perfect\nand sacrosanct, and therefore beyond criticism. On the\ncontrary, much as we derive satisfaction from the fact that\nthe United Nations has survived 50 difficult years, there\nis plenty of scope to re-examine its role, especially now,\nas we are on the threshold of the next millennium.\nWork in this direction has already started, and it has\nbeen covered in the comprehensive report of the\nSecretary-General on the work of the Organization. The\n11\n\n\nreport draws our attention to the work under way and what\nneeds to be done about problems which threaten\ninternational peace and security. It is up to nation States\nwhich are Members of the United Nations to reflect on, and\nassess the role of, the only universal organization at the\ndisposal of all humankind.\nUndoubtedly the United Nations has been doing the\nbest possible in the pursuit of the lofty ideals of the\nCharter \u2014 in particular, in regard to maintaining\ninternational peace; economic and social advancement for\nall peoples, and enhancing human rights. While loudly\nfaulted on its peace-keeping role, the silent achievements of\nthe United Nations agencies, including the United Nations\nChildren\u2019s Fund (UNICEF), the World Health Organization\n(WHO), the United Nations Educational, Scientific and\nCultural Organization (UNESCO), the Food and Agriculture\nOrganization of the United Nations (FAO), the International\nLabour Organization (ILO), the United Nations\nDevelopment Programme (UNDP), the United Nations\nEnvironment Programme (UNEP), the United Nations\nConference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) and the\nUnited Nations Industrial Development Organization\n(UNIDO), need not be simply taken for granted.\nEven in terms of peace-keeping operations, we only\nneed to ask why it was possible to succeed in Namibia,\nCambodia, El Salvador, South Africa and Mozambique, and\nwhy prospects are now brightening in Angola, under United\nNations leadership, while we have not quite succeeded in\nSomalia, Rwanda or Bosnia and Herzegovina.\nAs I speak, conflicts are raging unabated in the world,\nespecially in parts of Africa, the Balkans and the Caucasus.\nA lot of work is yet to be done in the area of\npeace-keeping. Every effort must be made to enhance the\ncapacity of the United Nations along the lines described in\nthe 1992 \u201cAn Agenda for Peace\u201d (A/47/277) and its\nsupplement (A/50/60), issued in January this year.\nThe real problem with the United Nations rests with\nthe new post-cold-war era. The promises of peace have\neluded us and as a result we are still \u201cin the woods\u201d\nregarding the international community\u2019s ability to manage\nnon-military transnational issues, including development,\nenvironmental degradation and inequalities within and\nbetween nations.\nOne point of grave concern to my delegation is that\nthe new world order \u2014 if there is order at all \u2014 has tended\nto perpetuate the situation in which the wealthy and\npowerful nation-States dominate and seek to exert undue\ninfluence on the United Nations. Consequently, United\nNations reform is urgent and imperative. The thrust of\nthis reform must be to maintain and enhance the\ndemocratic values of the Charter of the United Nations\nand translate them into reality throughout the work of the\nOrganization. We must jealously guard the central role of\nthe General Assembly, in which all Member States,\nregardless of size or wealth, have an equal say. Careful\nattention should be given to the functioning of the\nSecurity Council. We must ensure that the Council acts\nwithin and in accordance with the Charter and that its\nmembership reflects the realities of our times, taking into\naccount the tremendous expansion from 51 Member\nStates in 1945 to 185 in 1995.\nIn welcoming the report of the General Assembly\u2019s\nOpen-ended Working Group on the Question of Equitable\nRepresentation on and Increase in the Membership of the\nSecurity Council, my delegation restates the need to have\ndeveloping countries of Africa, Asia and Latin America\nand the Caribbean represented in the Council, in terms of\nboth permanent and non-permanent seats. Secondly, not\nonly is transparency in the functioning of the Council\nnecessary, but there must also be a regularized system of\nreporting to, and consultation with, the General Assembly.\nThirdly, the veto power has outlived its usefulness. It\nshould be abolished, since it is a negation of democratic\nprinciples to empower any one member, or group of\nmembers, to decide on the vital issues of peace and\nsecurity without due regard to the sensitivity and wishes\nof the majority.\nThe reform process under way should focus also on\nrestoring the Economic and Social Council to its intended\nhigh status as the organ for bringing all international\neconomic and social affairs under the strategic control of\nthe United Nations, and here I refer to Article 63 of the\nCharter. My delegation believes that the governance of\nthe Bretton Woods institutions should be democratized,\nalong with their internal decision-making mechanisms.\nLet me conclude the question of reform by quoting\nthe very apt perception of the South Centre:\n\u201cThe opposition to a strong and dynamic United\nNations is political and profoundly ideological, and\nis largely concentrated in a few States whose\nestablishments prefer not to strengthen a forum in\nwhich their domestic and global policies can be\nchallenged or trimmed. But the United Nations\nexists for all humankind, not just a handful of\nMember States representing a small minority of the\n12\n\n\nworld\u2019s population ... . This is not a time for despair\nbut for determined efforts to rekindle the United\nNations original inspirations and to inject a new sense\nof purposeful direction ... to help fulfil the aspirations\nof many millions of people throughout the world.\u201d\nThe financing of the United Nations by Member States\nis also badly in need of reform. As we meet here, our\nOrganization is on the brink of bankruptcy. As of early\nAugust, unpaid assessed contributions stood at $3.9 billion.\nMy delegation is in agreement with the Secretary-General\nwhen he laments that\n\u201cthere is no use talking about reshaping the\nresponsibilities of the United Nations unless the\nresources are there to carry out those responsibilities\u201d.\nIt is urgent that action be taken to make good on late\npayments of assessed contributions, for both the regular\nbudget and peace-keeping operations, without any\npreconditions. Having said that, my delegation believes that,\non the one hand, the principle of financing the United\nNations should be on the basis of relative capacity to pay,\nand secondly, that other options should be explored that\nwould lessen overdependence on the policy inclinations of\na few Members.\nI should like now to turn to conflicts closest to the\nheart of the Government and people of Tanzania: the\nsituations in neighbouring Rwanda and Burundi. It is\nheartening to note that the situation in Rwanda is gradually\nreturning to normal following the end of genocide and the\nfratricidal war of July 1994. Tanzania, in the true spirit of\ngood-neighbourliness, salutes the new government\u2019s efforts\nto consolidate peace, rebuild State institutions and make\nnational reconciliation a reality on the basis of the Arusha\nPeace Agreement.\nTanzania, besides facilitating political mediation for\nthe two neighbouring countries, has always readily\nwelcomed Rwandese and Burundi peoples fleeing atrocities\nin their homelands. The Government is anxious that the\nnow more than one million refugees concentrated in the\nwestern part of the country should be assisted to return\nhome as soon as possible, but it should be sooner rather\nthan later. It is a huge burden of immense proportions. My\nGovernment is appreciative of the international assistance\nthat is directed to the refugees and to Tanzania. However,\nthe ideal solution is to facilitate their speedy return to their\ncountries of origin so that they may become part of the\nreconstruction and reconciliation efforts. To do otherwise is\nto postpone the problem and sow the seeds of future\nconflicts and mistrust.\nWorse still, long-term damage to the environment is\nnow a reality. Urgent measures are required to prevent the\narea of concentration from being stripped bare of trees.\nPressure on the already overstretched infrastructure and\nsocial services remains overwhelming. This humanitarian\ncatastrophe must not be allowed to go on indefinitely. My\nGovernment believes that the reconstruction efforts being\nput in place must have a component for the return of\nrefugees.\nNo effort should be spared to help the two\nneighbouring countries create an environment conducive\nto the return of their peoples. In this connection, we take\nnote of the Secretary- General\u2019s efforts to convene a\nGreat Lakes region conference on security, stability and\ndevelopment, in line with the decisions of the\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU) and Security\nCouncil. But my Government is of the view that\ncommensurate efforts should first be made to implement\nthe Nairobi and Bujumbura declarations on stability and\nthe situation in the refugee camps. We also urge the\nOffice of the United Nations High Commissioner for\nRefugees and other organizations on the ground to extend\nto the region the quick impact programmes that are\ncurrently being undertaken in Mozambique and Somalia.\nThese programmes are aimed at meeting the reintegration\nand rehabilitation needs of returnees on their arrival\nhome.\nMention should also be made of my Government\u2019s\nreadiness to cooperate in establishing the seat of the\nInternational Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda at Arusha in\nnorthern Tanzania. The judges have since been appointed,\nand the Registrar of the Tribunal is already in Tanzania\nas part of the preparatory team. It is my delegation\u2019s view\nthat an early start of the Tribunal\u2019s proceedings should go\na long way towards helping the healing process in\nRwanda.\nConcerning Burundi, we commend the work of the\npeace mission of the Organization of African Unity and\nappeal to the leaders of all parties to rise above parochial\ninterests and work in the larger interest of their country,\nAfrica and the world.\nMy delegation is especially encouraged by the\npositive developments in Angola, which, as we heard\nfrom its Foreign Minister when he addressed the current\nsession, is finally headed towards peaceful settlement\n13\n\n\nunder the terms of the Lusaka Protocol and the Bicesse\nAccords. We are also hopeful that the deployment of the\nUnited Nations Angola Verification Mission (UNAVEM\nIII) will be speeded up, to ensure that the peace process\nremains on course.\nRegarding Liberia, we are encouraged by the recent\ndevelopments by which the OAU and the Economic\nCommunity of West African States (ECOWAS) in\nparticular have secured agreement among faction leaders\naimed at a peaceful resolution of the long-simmering civil\nwar. The United Nations Observer Mission in Liberia also\ndeserves our appreciation for its contribution. Consequently,\nit is our hope that the positive developments in Liberia will\nimpact on the restive situation in neighbouring Sierra\nLeone.\nRegrettably, four years on, the international\ncommunity has yet to implement the United Nations peace\nplan calling for a referendum in Western Sahara. The\nparties concerned, Morocco and the Polisario Front, need to\nsummon their political will and, without undue\nprevarication, cooperate fully with the United Nations in\nspeeding up the process.\nAfrica has received with anger reports of recent\nmercenary interference in the Comoros. The perpetration of\nsuch a dastardly act must not be countenanced by the\ninternational community, in particular the United Nations.\nMy delegation supports the OAU call for the speedy and\nunconditional restoration of the constitutional order in that\nAfrican country and would also wish to recall the General\nAssembly\u2019s resolution on the sovereignty of the Islamic\nFederal Republic of the Comoros over the island of\nMayotte.\nWe welcome progress in the Middle East situation.\nThe signing in Washington of the latest agreement between\nthe Government of Israel and the Palestine Liberation\nOrganization represents an important step towards the\nimplementation of the Declaration of Principles. We hope\nprogress will also be made on the other fronts in\naccordance with Security Council resolutions 242 (1967)\nand 338 (1973).\nAs for the Balkans, my delegation supports United\nNations peace-keeping and other international efforts aimed\nat finding a lasting solution to the conflict in the former\nYugoslavia. We urge all parties to the conflict to invest in\na political settlement and to resist the temptation of a\nmilitary solution.\nThe continuing threat of hunger and poverty to\nworld peace and security cannot be overemphasized.\nTheir impact on the developing countries is made clear by\nthe stagnant or negative rates of economic growth and\ndeclining real per capita incomes in most of the South,\nespecially in the least developed countries, including\nTanzania. As the Administrator of the United Nations\nDevelopment Programme said recently:\n\u201cPoverty is growing faster than population.\nThere are scores of countries where progress is\ngoing backwards rather than forwards. Rich\ncountries are not going to be able to build a wall\naround themselves and shut themselves off. These\nproblems don\u2019t need passports.\u201d\nInternal and external factors alike have contributed\nto the underdevelopment of the largest segment of the\nworld. The debt crisis, depressed prices of primary\ncommodities, protectionist measures, the inadequate flow\nof direct foreign investment and financial and technical\nassistance, and deteriorating terms of trade are but a few\nof the factors adversely affecting socio-economic\nperformance in most of these countries.\nIt is with this frustrating situation in mind that we\nintend to continue participating in the work of the Ad\nHoc Open-ended Working Group of this Assembly on An\nAgenda for Development. It must become a true vehicle\nfor ending poverty the world over. Other supportive\nUnited Nations agencies, especially UNCTAD, which will\nbe holding its ninth conference in South Africa next year,\nand UNIDO should be accorded their due importance by\nthe international community as true instruments of\ndevelopment.\nDuring the High-level Intergovernmental Meeting on\nthe Mid-term Global Review of the Implementation of the\nProgramme of Action for the Least Developed Countries\nfor the 1990s, there was some North-South meeting of\nminds on what Governments ought to do individually and\ntogether to reverse the trend of underdevelopment. My\nGovernment reaffirmed its commitment to continue\nimplementing socio-economic reforms considered\nbeneficial to our people. Inevitable difficulties aside, the\nfocus is on sectors concerned with agriculture, industry,\nfinance, civil service, trade and privatization.\nAt the same time, we are undertaking political\nreforms which are essential not only for good governance,\nbut also for the creation of the necessary environment for\neconomic management and sustainable growth. This\n14\n\n\nexercise culminates in the multi-party national elections that\nwill take place towards the end of this month. The\nunderstanding and cooperation of our traditional donor\ncountries have been instrumental in supplementing our own\nefforts. We also count on the international community\u2019s\ncommitment to implement fully existing programmes such\nas the United Nations New Agenda for the Development of\nAfrica in the 1990s and the conclusions of a series of\nUnited Nations world conferences, including the Fourth\nWorld Conference on Women, successfully concluded in\nBeijing, China, last month.\nIn conclusion, let me refer to two other important\ndevelopments since the forty-ninth session. First, regarding\ndisarmament, we hope that the controversial indefinite\nextension last May of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation\nof Nuclear Weapons will lead to total nuclear disarmament\nand the immediate cessation and complete elimination of\nnuclear testing. Secondly, we urge the international\ncommunity to iron out differences over how to constitute\nthe membership of the International Seabed Authority\nCouncil, in order to formalize the work of this important\ninstrument, the United Nations Convention on the Law of\nthe Sea.\nFinally, my delegation is privileged to be a part of this\nhistoric fiftieth session of the General Assembly, whose\nwork should further reaffirm our commitment to\nmultilateralism. We look forward to celebrating the fiftieth\nanniversary of the United Nations later this month, when\nwe will be called upon to reflect together on how best to\nequip our Organization on the eve of the twenty-first\ncentury. Nevertheless, it is important to bear constantly in\nmind the fact that, for developing countries and especially\nthe least developed among them, it is not a time of\nrejoicing. I can do no better than to quote the address of\nmy President, Ali Hassan Mwinyi, to the General Assembly\nat its forty-ninth session, in which he said:\n\u201cA supportive international environment is crucial\nif we are to attain sustained economic growth in\ndeveloping countries, especially in the least developed\nones. The United Nations must be able to play a much\ngreater role in this matter because, unlike the Bretton\nWoods institutions, the United Nations is universal; its\nprogrammes operate everywhere; and it does not\nignore countries.\u201d (Official Records of the General\nAssembly, Forty-ninth session, Plenary Meetings,\n16th meeting, p. 5)\n\n"

        "file_text": "Let me first\ncongratulate you, Sir, and wish you success in your new,\nmost historically significant task.\nThe fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations can be\nviewed as a time of retirement or as an opportunity for a\nnew beginning and rejuvenation. We all bear a\nresponsibility to maximize the possibility that the United\nNations will not only endure the next 50 years but will\nthrive as the centrepiece of a new world order and\ninternational peace and security.\nBosnia and Herzegovina is keenly aware of the pivotal\nrole into which our country has been thrust. It is not a role\nwe sought or one that we cherish. The successful settlement\nof the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, consistent with the\nprinciples of sovereignty, democracy and respect for human\nrights engraved in the United Nations Charter, can be a\ncatalyst for this new beginning for both Bosnia and\nHerzegovina and the United Nations. However, a failure to\nhonour basic principles of the United Nations Charter and\ninternational humanitarian law could be fatal to Bosnia and\nHerzegovina and threaten the vitality and integrity of the\nUnited Nations.\nThis coming Thursday, we all hope to see another firm\nstride towards peace in the Middle East. Although much\nmore needs to be done to secure the rights of all in the\nregion and to bring about real stability and therefore true\npeace, the peace process in the Middle East is anchored\nby leaders who deserve our respect. They represent\npeoples who have been long maligned during the recent\npast. The substantial differences that still exist between\nthese peoples are born out of previous injustices and out\nof conflicting claims to land.\nThe war waged upon our country does involve a\nland grab and an aggression in violation of the United\nNations Charter. However, more directly, the war is about\nideology \u2014 ideology not of religion and ethnicity but of\npolitics and tolerance. We have been the victims of\ngenocide and our enemy is not defined by its ethnicity or\nreligion but by the ideology of intolerance, dictatorship\nand fascism that it promotes.\nI have just come out of the negotiations with the\nmembers of the Contact Group on Bosnia and\nHerzegovina and my two colleagues from Croatia and\nSerbia and Montenegro. I wish that I could say that I was\nas confident about the prospects of success with respect\nto our negotiations as I am for the prospects of the\nnegotiations in the Middle East. While the Middle East\nnegotiations involve statesmen trying to resolve the\ncompeting claims of maligned peoples hungry for peace,\nwe find among our negotiating partners at least two\nindividuals already indicted by the War Crimes Tribunal\nin The Hague for genocide and other crimes against\nhumanity. While the international media show pictures of\nthe mass graves of civilians murdered in the campaign of\n\u201cethnic cleansing\u201d and genocide that gave the Republika\nSrpska its very beginning, we are now negotiating with a\nteam that includes the very indicted war criminals\nresponsible for these murders and the mass graves.\nWe really do hope that this negotiating process will\nbring about a step towards peace. We have come to the\nfirm understanding that victory can be defined in more\nthan one way. We are not seeking military victory over\nour enemies, even though our legal and moral status is\nconsistent with absolute military triumph. We have\nlearned to define our victory in terms of the lives that we\ncan save and in the opportunity to rebuild and reinstate\nthroughout our country democracy and human rights. We\ncertainly do not seek revenge for the thousands of persons\nexpelled, tortured, raped and murdered. We only seek not\nto allow war criminals responsible for these crimes to\ndictate our future and to seek legitimacy through the\nnegotiating process. We do have confidence that the War\nCrimes Tribunal in The Hague will bring about justice\n18\n\n\nand will certainly know better how to address such war\ncriminals than the negotiators.\nWe are sincerely committed to, and do believe in, the\nnegotiating process. Negotiations are consistent with our\ngoal, which is to achieve peace, even if we have to make\ndifficult, painful compromises. Through peace we hope to\nre-establish democracy and respect for human rights\nthroughout the entire country and in that fashion gradually\nreintegrate our country. It is in many ways a risky and\nunprecedented road. None the less, we do believe that, in\npeace, the ideology of an open, free, democratic and\ntolerant society is strongest, while a closed, totalitarian and\nintolerant ideology is strengthened by conflict. We do\nrecognize also that there are some legitimate considerations\nthat have to be addressed in the negotiating process,\nincluding internal territorial delineations and means to\nrebuild the confidence of the population in the political\nprocesses and mechanisms that are designed to secure\nrespect for human rights.\nOur country has been too scarred and too polarized by\nthis war for us to expect that peace and reintegration will\nnot require a special effort and mechanisms that may seem\nunnatural to many of us. None the less, there still remains\na basic contradiction in the existing negotiating process.\nThat is because it is theorized that dictators and despots as\nnegotiators on one side are truly prepared to negotiate to\nbring about free and fair elections and democratic\ninstitutions as the basis for a new Bosnia and Herzegovina.\nThat is because it is expected that hate mongers on\none side are prepared to negotiate the establishment of\ninstitutions that in fact ensure respect for basic human\nrights.\nThat is because war criminals on one side \u2014 the same\nside \u2014 are called upon to negotiate the creation of\nmechanisms that would facilitate the return of refugees and\ndisplaced persons, the very victims that these criminals\nactually subjected to \u201cethnic cleansing\u201d.\nI have just come from a set of lengthy and difficult\nnegotiations. The other side continues to refuse to accept\nthe requirement that the future Parliament and Presidency\nof Bosnia and Herzegovina should be elected by direct\nelections by popular vote.\nWe are being strongly encouraged \u2014 even pressured,\nif you will \u2014 to agree to what may be a process other than\nelection by popular vote as the means by which the future\nParliament and Presidency of our country would be\nselected.\nWe have already been lectured that the negotiating\nprocess would collapse if we persisted in demanding that\nthe extradition of war criminals to The Hague must be\nhonoured by all authorities within the future Bosnia and\nHerzegovina, as is consistent with international law and\nthe demands of the international community on our\ncountry as a whole.\nLet us be clear here once and for all on this. We\nwill not settle for sham elections or other selection\nprocedures in respect of our most basic governmental\ninstitutions that dictators and despots want in order to\nundermine real democracy and legitimize totalitarianism\nunder the cover of an international peace agreement.\nThe other side has been given the opportunity to\nchoose its own negotiating team. But the fact that they\nhave selected members who have already been formally\nindicted by the War Crimes Tribunal and others who may\nyet be indicted will not affect our demand that they be\nextradited to the Tribunal.\nThe selection of these negotiators is their choice. But\nlet me emphasize once again: we will not allow a\nnegotiating process to shield war criminals from\ninternational justice \u2014 not our justice, but international\njustice. In fact, the success of the negotiating process will\nbe measured by whether or not war criminals are brought\nto justice and by whether despots and dictators are swept\nout of power, not by the agreements that such criminals\nand dictators may sign.\nElections in Bosnia and Herzegovina cannot be\neither free, fair or democratic until a basic respect for\nhuman rights is established, until war criminals are sent\nfor trial to the War Crimes Tribunal in The Hague, until\nrefugees and displaced persons are guaranteed the right\nand opportunity to return and to vote in these elections,\nand until overall conditions are established consistent with\na free and open society.\nFinally, neither can there be real peace unless an\nenvironment consistent with democracy and respect for\nhuman rights is promoted by all, including the\ninternational community.\nWell, what does all this have to do with the United\nNations? It certainly has a lot to do with Bosnia and\nHerzegovina as a Member of the United Nations. Simply\n19\n\n\nput, the United Nations Charter and basic international\nprinciples can be overlooked only temporarily. However,\nthe United Nations cannot be the envisioned authority in the\npreservation of international peace and security if the\nUnited Nations Charter is overwhelmingly ignored in\nestablishing the building blocks for peace. This is a\nuniversal principle with global application.\nAs I mentioned, I have just come from the\nnegotiations. I will be going back. We are surprised, we are\nangry that we have to negotiate over whether or not, in\nestablishing peace and a new beginning in Bosnia and\nHerzegovina, the other side will be forced to accept direct,\nfree and democratic elections. We are being told that we\nmust accept compromise language that means less than this.\nIf they will not accept the words today, we must be truly\nsuspicious of their longer-term intentions ever to accept real\npeace and democracy, or whether they in fact just intend to\nperpetuate their hold on power and domination over an\ninnocent Serb population.\nWe have already made many painful compromises.\nWe are prepared to make more \u2014 many more \u2014 in the\nsearch for a real peace. However, do not ask us \u2014 do not\nask yourselves \u2014 to settle for concessions to dictatorships,\nto intolerance, to illegality, to criminality and hate. Do not\nallow yourselves and us to set aside the most basic\nprinciples of the United Nations Charter.\nWe are prepared to work with all Member States in\npartnership for that real peace and the necessary\ncompromises that all of us can live with.\n"

        "file_text": "It gives me great pleasure, on behalf of the\ndelegation of Kuwait, to convey to Mr. Diego Freitas do\nAmaral our sincere congratulations on his unanimous\nelection to the presidency of the fiftieth session of the\nGeneral Assembly. We have no doubt that his election is\ntestimony to his expertise and skills, which will guarantee\nthe able stewardship of this historic session. I assure\nMr. Freitas do Amaral of the support and cooperation of\nthe delegation of the State of Kuwait.\nI take this opportunity to commend the President of\nthe General Assembly at its forty-ninth session, His\nExcellency Mr. Amara Essy, Minister of Foreign Affairs\nof C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, for his significant contribution to the\nwork of this world body as well as for the wisdom he\ndemonstrated as he presided over the deliberations of the\nlast session.\nLet me also pay tribute to the Secretary-General, His\nExcellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for his immense\nefforts to streamline the structure and operations of the\nUnited Nations with an eye to the constantly changing\nmodern world. Also, I should like to put on record\nKuwait\u2019s support for the proposals put forward by the\nSecretary-General in his programme of action to deal with\npotential crises, the use of preventive diplomacy and the\nmodalities of peacemaking and peace-building. In this\ncontext, special mention should be made of the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s annual report on the work of the Organization,\nwhich demonstrates incisive vision combined with a\ndispassionate and in-depth analysis of the challenges\nfacing the United Nations. The report outlines in a\nresponsible fashion the failures suffered in some of the\nactivities and operations undertaken by the Organization.\nNext month, a great number of Heads of States or\nGovernments will come to New York City to celebrate\nthe fiftieth anniversary of the establishment of the United\nNations. This massive presence will reflect a genuine\nbelief in the role of the United Nations in building a\nworld founded on justice, equality, coexistence and\ncooperation, free of tension and aggression. Their\n12\n\n\nstatements in this Assembly Hall will no doubt define their\nvision of the tasks the United Nations should undertake,\ntheir hopes for the ideal way of life that should prevail in\nthe world and their determination to spare no effort in\nworking for a better world. We cherish the wisdom of the\nfounding fathers who established an Organization that\nembodies mankind\u2019s collective effort and hope in a better\nworld that would differ from the world of war and strife,\nwhich wrought enormous destruction in terms of\ngeopolitical entities, property and human life. States were\ndestroyed and entire human populations were annihilated to\nsatisfy the capricious whims of individuals who were driven\nby greed and hegemony. The scale of sacrifice and\ndevastation, and the toll in human life caused by the\ndevelopment of atomic weapons was too immense to\nignore. In the wake of such destruction, the world\u2019s leaders\nwere determined to make the Second World War the last\nwar the world should ever endure.\nThe signing ceremony of the United Nations Charter\nin San Francisco was, in a sense, a universal pledge to\nrenounce the use of force, to embrace peaceful coexistence\nand to shun the power politics of blackmail and hegemony.\nRegardless, the world continued to live thereafter in an\nenvironment that differed from the vision of the founding\nfathers of the United Nations. The intense bipolar strife that\nfollowed plunged the world in the maelstrom of a cold war\nthat lasted for some five decades and spawned numerous\nregional conflicts with which the United Nations dealt\nwithin the constraints imposed by big Power rivalries. The\ninability to act was not due to impotence on the part of the\nUnited Nations but was the direct result of that bipolar\nrivalry. Notwithstanding, the Organization did manage to\ndemonstrate its effectiveness in many a peace-keeping\noperation it undertook over the past decades and did\nmanage to pacify many a volatile area.\nIn point of fact, experience has shown, over the past\nfew decades, that the presence of the United Nations in the\nareas of tension did prevent the eruption of conflict and war\nin several flash points while its absence increased the\nchances of war. In all this, the United Nations has been a\ntrue reflection of the will of its Member States and, during\nthe cold war, it provided a war-prevention mechanism by\ncreating buffer zones between the belligerents. It was\neffective in containing tensions and in creating a climate of\npeaceful negotiation.\nOver the years, the United Nations system has\ndeveloped an array of effective and credible mechanisms,\nand gained wide-ranging experience and undoubted\ncredibility that are employed to the common benefit of\nmankind. Over the past 50 years, since the adoption of its\nCharter, the United Nations has worked consistently to\ngive real meaning to the dream of peoples all over the\nworld, that of saving\n\u201csucceeding generations from the scourge of war,\nwhich ... has brought untold sorrow to mankind\u201d \u2014\nas expressed in the opening paragraph of the Charter. In\nlarge measure, the United Nations has lived up to its\ninitial commitment.\nOnce the cold-war chapter was closed, the world\nstarted to edge towards rapprochement and meaningful\ndialogue. Once the arms race ended, an intense\ndevelopment-race started. The territorial-gains mentality\ngave way to a new commitment to intensive human\ndevelopment. Thus the new challenge facing our world\nnow is the fulfilment of the immediate concerns of the\nhuman person and his or her right to live in dignity.\nThe world was an arena of rivalry between the\nsuper-Powers; now it has become a vast battlefield in the\nwar against poverty and backwardness. The world was a\nbattleground for fighting between various blocs in\ndifferent regions; now many regions are closing ranks in\na common effort to combat illiteracy and want. While the\nworld was the theatre of many a battle, now the world\nhas but one battle, that of trying to break loose from the\ngrip of underdevelopment and backwardness.\nWe in Kuwait were in the forefront of donors for\ndevelopment. The volume of assistance we offered was\nthe highest, in terms of gross national product, because\nwe wanted to live in a world dominated by justice, a\nworld whose hallmark is human compassion, a world in\nwhich the privileged will reach out towards the\nunderprivileged without strings attached.\nAlong these lines, Kuwait welcomes the trend\ntowards the consolidation of relations between members\nof the family of nations on the basis of equality. We are\npart of a common effort to eliminate tensions. We rely on\nthe collective will of nations to suppress aggression, and\non global cooperation to confront underdevelopment.\nAgainst this backdrop, we cannot overlook the need\nfor reform and restructuring inside the United Nations\nitself with a view to bringing the system more into line\nwith these new objectives. In 1945, 50 founding Member\nStates signed the Charter. Ever since, 135 other States\n13\n\n\nhave joined the membership. Regardless, the Security\nCouncil, which is a major organ of the system, has, for\nexample, retained its original structure \u2014 without change\nto reflect the enormous expansion in the membership of the\nUnited Nations. Nor has the Economic and Social Council\nshown, as yet, significant improvement in programme\ndelivery, as dictated by the requirements of modern\ndevelopment, in the broad sense of such requirements, at\nthe threshold of the twenty-first century.\nWe call for expanding the membership of the Security\nCouncil in order to enable the larger membership of the\nUnited Nations to participate in the process of decision-\nmaking. The change, which would enhance fairness, should\nbe effected in such a way as to ensure balance between the\nrequirements of efficiency and of expansion. We also call\nfor more transparency in the Council\u2019s methods of work,\nfor this, in our view, would reinforce our sense of\ncollective participation and responsibility. We are also in\nfavour of the trend towards better use of the resources of\nthose States that can contribute significantly to\npeace-keeping operations and development activities.\nThe people of Kuwait participate in the celebrations of\nthe United Nations fiftieth anniversary with a deep sense of\ngratitude to the Organization for its crucial role in liberating\nKuwait from occupation. The people of Kuwait recognize\nthe firm resolve of the world community in rejecting\naggression and its commitment to putting an end to\noccupation. We cherish the determination displayed in the\nseries of successive resolutions adopted by the Security\nCouncil from the second day of August 1990, when the\npeople of Kuwait, together with the rest of the world, were\ntaken by surprise by the sneak invasion of the State of\nKuwait by Iraq. That naked aggression was committed in\ntotal violation of the principles of the Charter of the United\nNations and international treaties. Beyond Kuwait, the\ninvasion totally shattered the security and stability of the\nentire Gulf region.\nIn facing up to that blatant aggression, the United\nNations did indeed live up to its principles and was true to\nits mission. It did indeed stand firm in upholding justice\nand in defending the victim.\nBuilding on the Kuwait experience, it is our hope that\nthe critical role that the United Nations can play will be\nfully utilized to further consolidate the underpinning of\npeace and to safeguard security and stability. The United\nNations system can indeed provide deterrence in the face of\nthose regimes that harbour schemes of aggression. There is\na full range of measures and restrictions that the United\nNations can put in place to ensure the isolation and\ncurtailment of those aggressive regimes and, if need be,\nto strip them of their stockpiles of weapons that can be\nused in committing aggression.\nThe ultimate goal of the United Nations is to ensure\nequality, mutual respect amongst Member States and\nrespect for the will of peoples. This would be conducive\nto peaceful coexistence among nations and would create\na favourable atmosphere allowing freedom of choice in a\ndemocratic climate, where the stronger cannot dominate\nthe weaker, nor can a big country exploit a small\nneighbour, nor one party assume a privileged role to the\ndetriment of others.\nOver a long period \u2014 since the end of the Gulf\nwar \u2014 the Iraqi regime has continued to claim that it has\nfulfilled all its obligations under all Security Council\nresolutions relating to the situation between Iraq and\nKuwait, especially resolutions 687 (1991) and 715 (1991),\nand thus blamed the Security Council and the Special\nCommission for the delay in lifting the sanctions imposed\non Iraq. The Chairman and staff of the Special\nCommission, as well as the Security Council itself, have\nbeen harshly and offensively criticized by senior Iraqi\nofficials and the regime-controlled media.\nIn view of the recent dramatic surprises that\nunfolded in regard to the Iraqi armament programmes, a\nthoroughly legitimate set of questions arises \u2014 namely:\nDoes the Iraqi regime have any more credibility? Who\namongst us would be willing to accept Iraq\u2019s statements\nat face value? Who would believe its claims, echoed at\nevery gathering or forum, that it had met its obligations?\nWhat about Kuwaiti property and military hardware\nlooted from Kuwait? Who can go along with Iraq\u2019s\nassertions regarding Kuwaiti and third-country prisoners\nand hostages?\nThe tragedy of Kuwaiti and other prisoners held by\nIraq remains unresolved four years after the liberation of\nKuwait. This is due to the intransigence and\nprocrastination of the Iraqi regime, which continues to\nsidestep a straightforward and genuine resolution of this\nhuman tragedy. This represents a failure on the part of\nIraq to fulfil its commitments under paragraph 30 of\nSecurity Council resolution 687 (1991), which demands\nthat Iraq should cooperate fully with the International\nCommittee of the Red Cross.\nAccordingly, Kuwait reiterates its appeal, to the\nSecurity Council in particular and to the world\n14\n\n\ncommunity in general, to continue to bring pressure to bear\non Iraq, in a bid to bring this painful episode to an end.\nIraq\u2019s false claims and lies that it is sincere in its efforts to\nclose this case should be met with a firm stand. Indeed, this\nwas the only course of action that forced Iraq in the first\nplace to cooperate with the Special Commission.\nIraq must recognize that participation in the meetings\nof the Tripartite Commission and its sub-committee is not\nan end in itself. The purpose of these meetings is to secure\nthe freedom of prisoners and to account for the missing\npersons. The litmus test of Iraq\u2019s cooperation in this area is\nthe number of persons released or accounted for. Mere\nattendance at those meetings is an exercise in subterfuge,\nintended by Iraq to mislead world public opinion and to\ncircumvent its obligations.\nThe final objective of Kuwait\u2019s overall policy is to\nensure security and stability in our region. This goal will\nremain elusive unless and until Iraq implements fully and\nunconditionally all relevant Security Council resolutions.\nWe are aware of the difficulties endured by the Iraqi\npeople. However, the responsibility for the suffering of the\nIraqis lies squarely on the regime itself which wasted\nvaluable time since April 1991 in pursuing a futile course\nof prevarication, deception, suppression of data and\nmisinformation in regard to every area of its mandatory\nobligations.\nThe most recent events came to confirm our\nsuspicions and fears, namely, the disclosure of the\npossession by Iraq of an arsenal of prohibited weapons of\nmass destruction, which were being prepared for use against\npeoples of the region without heed for the potential massive\nloss of human life.\nIn the meantime, let me take this occasion to set on\nrecord that Kuwait affirms the need to maintain the unity\nand territorial integrity of Iraq. In view of the hardships\nfaced by the Iraqi people, Kuwait has moved to send,\nthrough the Kuwait Red Crescent Society, food and medical\nsupplies to the Iraqi civilian population in areas bordering\nIran and in Northern Iraq. We will continue to pursue this\npolicy on humanitarian grounds.\nIn the context of international endeavours to bring\nabout just, durable and comprehensive peace in the Middle\nEast, Kuwait follows closely the ongoing peace negotiations\nbetween the immediate parties. We support the negotiations\nprocess. In our view, this process should be anchored in the\nset of principles agreed upon, namely, full withdrawal in\nreturn for peace. Also, progress should be made on all\ntracks of negotiations. And the final peace package should\nbe satisfactory to all sides because this would be the real\nguarantee of a lasting peace.\nKuwait did participate in the multilateral negotiations\nbecause we believed that our role within the multilaterals\nwould strengthen the position of the Arab parties engaged\nin the bilateral talks and would eventually give\nmomentum to the process as a whole. We fully appreciate\nthe position of our sister State, Syria, which insists on full\nIsraeli withdrawal from occupied Syrian territory in return\nfor peace. Israel cannot attain full peace without complete\nwithdrawal.\nIn the same vein, international efforts should\nintensify to ensure full implementation of Security\nCouncil resolution 425 (1978) which requires\nunconditional Israeli withdrawal from all Lebanese\nterritory and the exercise by the Lebanese Government of\nits sovereignty over all Lebanese territory, including the\nSouth. In the end, the territorial integrity and\nindependence of Lebanon must be preserved.\nFurthermore, Kuwait supports the self-rule\nnegotiations between the Palestine National Authority and\nIsrael. In our view, the agreement signed yesterday in\nWashington, D.C. regarding the expansion of the self-rule\narrangements represents an important step in the right\ndirection towards the exercise by the people of Palestine\nof their right to self-determination and the establishment\nof their independent State.\nIn this regard, let me recall that Kuwait has pledged\n$25 million in aid to the development programmes\nundertaken by international specialized agencies in the\nself-rule areas. Indeed, Kuwait has started disbursement\nof funds earmarked for those purposes.\nAlso, we would like to underline the status of\noccupied Al-Quds, given its special significance to the\nthree heavenly-revealed religions. We emphasize that Al-\nQuds is Palestinian territory under occupation and should\nas such be subject to the withdrawal conditions under\nSecurity Council resolution 242 (1967).\nKuwait welcomes the recent developments aiming at\nachieving a fair settlement of the situation in the Republic\nof Bosnia and Herzegovina. We expect such a settlement\nshould satisfy the behests of international legality and be\nbased on Security Council resolutions. In the wake of\nlarge-scale suffering, destruction and displacement, the\n15\n\n\npeople of the region now yearn for an overall settlement\nthat satisfies the demands of all parties, especially the\npeople of Bosnia and Herzegovina who insist on\nmaintaining their independent State on their own territory\nwithout any interference from outside. My Government\nvalues the role played by the North Atlantic Treaty\nOrganization (NATO) and the United Nations Protection\nForces (UNPROFOR) in opposing territorial expansion by\nthe Serbs at the expense of other parties, as well as the\nactions taken to lift the siege on Sarajevo. It is our hope\nthat this joint NATO-UNPROFOR action will persist until\nthe declared objective is attained, that is, the conclusion of\na final accord that brings security and stability to the whole\nregion. It is our sincere hope now that the most recent\nagreement reached several days ago will be honoured by\nthe parties to the conflict.\nExperience has shown that regional groupings and\narrangements can play an effective role in addressing\ncontentious issues that create tension, impact adversely on\npeace and security and poison the relations amongst the\npeople of a given area. These groups have also\ndemonstrated a great sense of commitment in defusing flash\npoints of tension that might undermine regional security.\nA case in point is the experience of the Gulf\nCooperation Council whose member States are firmly\nconvinced that understanding among them is crucial in\nsteering away from frictions and tensions. To them,\ndialogue is an essential channel of confidence-building\namong neighbour States. Since our established policy\nconsiders negotiations as the only viable means of resolving\ndisputes, we call upon the Islamic Republic of Iran to\nrespond favourably to the call by the United Arab Emirates\nto resolve the problem of the islands occupied by Iran by\nthe means suggested by the International Court of Justice.\nSuch an approach would indeed reinforce the principle of\nunderstanding and negotiations to which we adhere as a\nprimary component in relations among States.\nKuwait is convinced that world peace is indivisible\nand that it has far-reaching multiple implications on all of\nus. Accordingly, ethnic disputes, tribal wars and factional\nconflicts should be addressed as phenomena that can lead\nto massacres and genocides and to a total collapse of the\nafflicted communities. Therefore, in this year which marks\nthe fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations, we ring down\nthe curtain on the Rwanda tragedy before a solution is\nfound, nor can we walk away from the catastrophe in\nSomalia, nor give up hope in the face of enormous odds in\nAfghanistan. All these remain burning issues despite the\nfeeling by some Powers that they have moved outside the\ncircle of global strategic limelight.\nWe call for scaling up the efforts and showing more\ndetermination in addressing these festering wounds within\nthe framework of collective world peace.\nThe burden of debt is a major constraint on the\nbudget resources of many nations, especially the\ndeveloping ones. It aggravates their social problems and\npushes up unemployment rates to a point where it\nundermines domestic security and stability and endangers\nthe lives of millions of people.\nBack in 1988, His Highness Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmad\nAl-Jaber, Emir of the State of Kuwait, launched from this\nrostrum an initiative to write off the foreign debt under\nwhich many least developed countries were suffering.\nThose countries have been victims of a complex host of\nfactors that denied them the privilege of a calm life and\nindeed posed a real threat to their very existence. Kuwait,\nfor its part, cancelled all interest on loans to these\ncountries in a bid to alleviate their debt burdens. It is our\nhope that this approach would be expanded and that the\ndeveloped nations would cancel the interest on their loans\nto the developing countries.\nThe dreams of the Charter\u2019s authors stood the test of\ntime and transcended the tensions and limitations of the\ncold war. The era of the cold war was characterized by\nthe stockpiling of weapons of mass destruction to the\ndetriment of construction needs. It represented a hard\ndrive to acquire the means of annihilation at the expense\nof the means of development. Prestige was put ahead of\nreal meaningful growth. Human ingenuity was put in the\nservice of human exploitation rather than in the service of\nenhancing human freedoms. That chapter is now over.\nAnd we have entered a new epoch in which we have to\nheed the rational calls for civilized conduct in order to\nbuild up an atmosphere of genuine brotherhood and\nharmony. This can only be achieved by our collective\nendeavour that emphasizes our universal identity. Only\nthrough such a common effort can we pool together the\nresources and energy of all peoples, big and small, to\nachieve a strategic consensus that would translate into a\nreality the dreams envisioned 50 years ago when the\nCharter was signed.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, Namibia joins\nthe preceding speakers in extending sincere congratulations\nand best wishes to you upon your unanimous election. This\nalso goes for your esteemed General Committee, of which\nNamibia is a proud member.\nThis historic session of the General Assembly \u2014\nmarking the golden jubilee of our Organization \u2014 coincides\nwith the fifth anniversary of Namibia\u2019s independence,\nbrought about through a long and bitter struggle and the\nsacrifices of the Namibian people and, no less, in\npartnership with the United Nations, which played a crucial\nrole in the process of our country\u2019s decolonization. We are\nfilled with immense joy and satisfaction over this happy\ncoincidence.\nThe Minister of Foreign Affairs of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, my\ngood brother and colleague, His Excellency Mr. Amara\nEssy, presided over the forty-ninth session of the General\nAssembly with great skill, wisdom and dedication. I\ncommend him for a job well done and, in particular, for\nbringing excellence and industry to this important office,\nall aimed at partnership and development. In this context,\nNamibia will fully cooperate with the presidency of the\nGeneral Assembly and the Secretary-General in pursuit of\nour common objectives that have been assigned to various\nopen-ended working groups aimed at restructuring and\nstrengthening the United Nations.\nThis special commemorative session of the General\nAssembly will bring together a record number of world\nleaders including, naturally, the Head of State of the\nRepublic of Namibia, Mr. Sam Nujoma, for a big\ncelebration, collective stock-taking, introspection and\nreflection, and for renewed commitment to action on the\nbasis of a new vision for the future and rededication\ntowards peace, development, gender equality, tolerance\nand brotherhood in this, our one global village.\nThe cardinal purposes and principles of the Charter\nof the United Nations, since its adoption in 1945, have\nbeen these: to save lives, to liberate all those everywhere\nstill in bondage, to promote democratic ideals and values,\nto protect and defend human rights and civil liberties \u2014\ncodified subsequently in the Universal Declaration of\nHuman Rights \u2014 and, above all, to protect succeeding\ngenerations from the scourge of war, which has wrought\nso much devastation and human suffering in the world in\nthe course of this century.\nIn furtherance of these purposes and principles and\ntheir early realization, our illustrious Secretary-General,\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, has applied his mind and\nenergy to the challenges of our times by formulating two\nseminal documents \u2014 \u201cAn Agenda for Peace\u201d and \u201cAn\nAgenda for Development\u201d. These timely and compelling\ninitiatives call for international cooperation, as well as for\nthe allocation of new and additional resources. Indeed,\nthey also place domestic obligations on Governments and\ncivil societies alike.\nSpecifically, in the context of the fiftieth anniversary\nsession of the General Assembly, the Secretary-General\nhas submitted a comprehensive annual report, complete\nwith focused recommendations for action on various\nfronts. Namibia therefore pays a well-deserved tribute to\nthe Secretary-General for his tireless efforts in the service\nof the United Nations and for fresh initiatives to further\nadvance peace and development in the world.\nReviewing history and past achievements, on this\noccasion marking the fiftieth anniversary of the United\n5\n\n\nNations, is necessarily in order. At the same time, however,\nbalancing present challenges and opportunities requires\nleadership, vision, commitment and courage on the part of\nworld leaders. Let us hope that this commemorative session\nwill show the way forward and achieve the desired\nobjectives.\nThe most important of all the commitments that the\nglobal community must fulfil is to use the collective\npolitical will and resources of the States Members the\nUnited Nations\n\u201cto promote social progress and better standards of life\nin larger freedom\u201d.\nThis is the soul of the Charter of the United Nations.\nToday, the world is united behind the promotion of\ndemocracy, respect for human rights and the rule of law.\nLet me, however, hasten to add that the eradication of\npoverty on a sustainable basis, through the provision of\nadequate education, health care, employment and housing\nand the empowerment of women, needs to be placed at the\ntop of the priority list of the United Nations and its\nspecialized agencies, which have been playing a vital role\nin social and economic development.\nWith the hindsight of 50 years, we know that the\nUnited Nations was at the start, and remains today, more\nthan a mere response to the horrors and circumstances of\nthe Second World War and its tormenting legacies. It is a\nsacred trust of life itself and an indispensable vehicle for\nthe preservation of civilization, in the interests of all nations\nand peoples.\nOne of those tormenting legacies was the cold war.\nThe hopes and expectations of millions the world over were\nheld hostage for decades by the politics of confrontation\nand the division of the world into hostile military blocs and\nrival ideological camps. This resulted in the derailing of the\npurposes and objectives for which the United Nations\nstands.\nThe arms race and espionage, as well as competing\nalignments, seriously sapped the vital resources, time and\nenergies of nations, creating more and more hotbeds of\ntension, thus militating against peaceful coexistence and\nmutually beneficial inter-State relations.\nFortunately, a nuclear holocaust was averted. A third\nworld war did not happen. But violence, distrust and\nmilitary build-up characterized world affairs for a very long\ntime. During this dangerous period the planet Earth\nteetered on the brink of a ghastly disaster. In the face of\nall this, men and women of peace, wisdom and\ncompassion, from all corners of the Earth, kept raising\nvoices of reason and appealing for sanity, disarmament\nand dialogue.\nDecolonization is perhaps the most laudable\nachievement of the United Nations. The world witnessed\nan unprecedented and unstoppable wave of demands, by\nmillions the world over, for freedom and the exercise of\nthe right to self-determination. This, happily, led to the\nachievement of independence by so many countries in\nAsia, Latin America \u2014 especially the Caribbean \u2014 and\nAfrica, which swelled the membership of the United\nNations beyond 100. Today the number of Members, at\n185, is more than three times the original number \u2014 the\n51 founding nations of 1945.\nIn Namibia, the moment came for the United\nNations to put its resources where its convictions and\nresponsibilities were. It demonstrated its firm commitment\nby providing necessary funds and technical capacity to the\nUnited Nations Transition Assistance Group (UNTAG),\nwhich facilitated Namibia\u2019s smooth transition to\nnationhood in 1990. This success story stands out today\nas a model of successful United Nations peace-keeping\nand decolonization.\nOther major United Nations success stories\nfollowed \u2014 in Cambodia, El Salvador, Mozambique and\nHaiti. We hope for the same positive outcome in Angola\nand other places. In all these cases, what ensured success\nwas a combination of political consensus, peace-keeping,\npeace enforcement and humanitarian assistance.\nIt has been said many times in so many ways that if\nthe United Nations had not existed, collective yearning to\ncreate it would have been irresistible. That is why\nNamibia attaches great importance to its membership of\nthe United Nations. Since joining the United Nations,\nNamibia has been playing an active role in all the\nactivities of the Organization. Namibia participated in the\npeace-keeping operation in Cambodia and sent election\nobservers to Angola under United Nations auspices.\nNamibia also sent a legal expert as a rapporteur to\nrepresent the Human Rights Commission in Somalia. But\nmore than that, Namibia has been paying its assessed and\nvoluntary contributions on time and in full, for we believe\nmembership is not enough: without resources the\nOrganization cannot carry out its mandate.\n6\n\n\nAs we look towards the next millennium, I should like\nto state the position of the Government of the Republic of\nNamibia on the following issues: regional cooperation;\ninternational economic cooperation; major United Nations\nconferences; nuclear disarmament; and reform of the United\nNations.\nRegional cooperation: in southern Africa, member\nStates of the Southern African Development Community\n(SADC), which now includes Mauritius, have combined\ntheir efforts to bring about genuine reconstruction and\ndevelopment in our subregion. Peace is a prerequisite of\ndevelopment. Without sustainable development, there can\nbe neither peace nor stability. While achievement of peace\nhas created favourable conditions for socio-economic\ndevelopment in southern Africa, the scars of apartheid and\ndestabilization remain. For example, to realize these\nobjectives, States members of SADC have decided to pool\ntheir resources in order to implement joint projects in the\nfields of energy and water. With this in mind, several\nprotocols were signed at the recent SADC Summit in\nJohannesburg.\nAdditional areas in which SADC member States are\ncoordinating their policies include de-mining, combating\ncrime, gun-running, drug-trafficking, money-laundering,\nillicit cross-border trade, and other forms of criminal\nactivity. It is hoped that these efforts will lead to an ideal\nsituation allowing for free movement of people, capital,\ngoods and services, thereby transforming SADC into a\ncommunity of shared experiences and aspirations.\nMoreover, mechanisms for conflict resolution, political\nconsultation and peace-keeping are enjoying high priority\namong these regional concerns.\nI felt reinforced after listening to the inspiring\nstatement delivered this morning by my brother and\ncolleague, His Excellency, Mr. Alfred Nzo, Minister for\nForeign Affairs of the Republic of South Africa. May I\nreassure him here of Namibia\u2019s firm commitment to\ncontinue working closely with the Government and people\nof South Africa for the achievement of genuine peace,\nstability, development and prosperity throughout southern\nAfrica.\nThe completion of the Trans-Caprivi and Trans-\nKalahari highways connecting land-locked neighbouring\ncountries to the Namibian port of Walvis Bay will further\nstrengthen regional cooperation, trade and integration. We\ndo all this pursuant to the letter and spirit of the Abuja\nTreaty establishing the African Economic Community.\nThere is no doubt that a successful SADC will strengthen\nthe African Economic Community.\nOn international economic cooperation, Namibia\nsubscribes to the view, emphasized by the Economic and\nSocial Council at its last meeting, that development\ncannot flourish in the midst of conflict and instability. It\nfollows from this that mutually beneficial economic\ncooperation is not possible as long as an unjust\ninternational economic system exists. Until we all become\nequal partners in the global economy, developing\ncountries, especially African countries, will for ever\nremain underdeveloped. Contrary to the views being\nexpressed in some quarters, Namibia maintains that the\nUnited Nations Conference on Trade and Development\nand the United Nations Industrial Development\nOrganization have played a vital and constructive role in\nassisting developing countries.\nThe strengthening of South-South cooperation is\nmore than ever a vehicle that is needed for the\nenhancement of the trade and economic development of\nthe countries of the South. Namibia therefore supports the\nSouth Centre and appeals for financial and material\ncontributions to its programmes.\nIt is also Namibia\u2019s firm belief that the recently\ninaugurated African-Latin American Institute, with\nregional headquarters in Namibia and Uruguay\nrespectively, will further strengthen South-South\ncooperation. Namibia also welcomes the emerging\ninitiatives aimed at encouraging horizontal dialogue and\ncooperation among SADC, the Association of South-East\nAsian Nations, the Common Market of the South\n(MERCOSUR) and other economic groupings of the\ncountries of the South.\nAs regards major United Nations conferences, we\nmay say that never before in the history of our\nOrganization have the social needs of humankind taken\ncentre stage. Humanity has recognized that conservation\nof the environment is tantamount to preservation of\nhuman life; respect for and protection of human rights is\nthe basis for democracy, good governance and\ndevelopment; addressing population issues within the\nframework of development is necessary in order to\nidentify the impact of socio-demographic trends on the\nwell-being of people; peace is not only the absence of\nwar but also a necessary condition for the attainment of\nsocial and economic development; and gender equality is\ncentral to development and peace.\n7\n\n\nThe realization of the commitments made at all these\nconferences should form the centrepiece of the agenda for\nthe twenty-first century.\nFor Namibia, protection of the environment is\nenshrined in our Constitution. The promotion and defence\nof democracy and human rights have become the vital\npillars of Namibia\u2019s Government and society. In keeping\nwith the Programme of Action adopted at the International\nConference on Population and Development in Cairo,\nNamibia has fully integrated population issues into its First\nNational Development Plan.\nSimilarly, the commitments we made at the World\nSummit for Social Development continue to be a top\npriority of the Government. The Law Reform Commission\nis finalizing recommendations to the Namibian Parliament\nfor enactment of the necessary legislation.\nNamibia is proud of its contribution to the preparation\nfor the Fourth World Conference on Women and the\nhonour bestowed upon its delegation to serve as\nRapporteur-General at that Conference, in Beijing. It\ntherefore goes without saying that Namibia will do\neverything possible to ensure implementation of the\nPlatform for Action adopted at the Conference.\nThe scientific and technological achievements of\nhumankind should be used for peace and development. All\nweapons of mass destruction must be destroyed. The time\nhas come for complete nuclear disarmament.\nFurthermore, Namibia calls upon the nuclear-weapon\nStates to fulfil the commitment made at the last Conference\non the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons\nand to move speedily towards the destruction of all nuclear\nweapons. In this regard, Namibia deplores the new spate of\nnuclear testing. Namibia will continue to participate actively\ntowards the early completion of the draft treaty of the\ndenuclearization of Africa.\nWith regard to United Nations reform, Namibia\nbelieves that the decision-making machinery of the Security\nCouncil, as it exists today, cannot effectively serve the\ninternational community in the twentieth century. The\nphenomenal numerical growth in the membership of the\nUnited Nations must be reflected in representation on the\nSecurity Council. The reform, restructuring and enlargement\nof the Security Council should reflect the cardinal principles\nof sovereign equality of all States, universality, democracy\nand transparency. It is only in this way that the authority,\nlegitimacy, credibility and effectiveness of the Security\nCouncil can be ensured.\nNamibia sees no problem in the addition of Germany\nand Japan as permanent members of the Security Council.\nBut at the same time, it is Namibia\u2019s strong view that\nAfrica, Asia and Latin America are entitled to\nrepresentation as permanent members as well as through\nthe allocation of additional seats in the Security Council\nfor non-permanent members. What we seek is the\nacceptance of the principle. The mechanism of how to\nbring this about is the subject of ongoing consultations in\nthe relevant Open-ended Working Group. The new world\norder has no place, in Namibia\u2019s view, for the outmoded\nveto power, and it must be abolished.\nThe new world order, which is thought of as\noffering the best hope for economic cooperation and free\ntrade, should liberate itself from the remaining shackles\nof the cold war and replace confrontation with dialogue\nwherever differences still exist.\nNamibia welcomes the latest agreement on\nPalestinian self-rule, signed between the State of Israel\nand the Palestinian Authority. We look forward to the\nearly achievement of a comprehensive, just and lasting\npeace in the Middle East, leading to the establishment of\na Palestinian State.\nThe decolonization of Africa is not yet complete.\nNamibia therefore supports the early exercise by the\nSaharan people of their right to self-determination on the\nbasis of a free, fair and transparent referendum in\nWestern Sahara, under the joint supervision and control\nof the United Nations and the Organization of African\nUnity.\nThere can be no military solution to the conflict in\nBosnia and Herzegovina conflict. Therefore, Namibia\nurges all parties involved to end the suffering of their\npeople and find a lasting and peaceful political solution to\nthat conflict.\nAs the year comes to an end, it is heartening to note\nthat the conflict in Liberia has been resolved with the\nestablishment of a broad-based, multi-party provisional\nGovernment. We welcome this wholeheartedly. Let us\nhope that this is a good omen for the resolution of the\nconflicts in Somalia, Sudan, Burundi and Sierra Leone.\nSince the signing of the Lusaka Protocol on Angola\nlast year, the peace process in that sisterly country is\n8\n\n\nmaking steady progress. The spirit of reconciliation and\ndialogue is permeating the entire society, encouraged by the\nregular face-to-face talks between President Jos\u00e9 Eduardo\ndos Santos of Angola and Mr. Jonas Savimbi of UNITA. It\nis Namibia\u2019s sincere hope that the pledges made in Brussels\nat the recent round-table conference on Angola will be\ntranslated into actual resources for reconstruction and\ndevelopment in that country, a neighbour of ours.\nAfrica is long overdue to root out, once and for all, all\nthe criminal activities of mercenaries, which, like acts of\nterrorism, stand condemned in the resolutions of both the\nUnited Nations and the Organization of African Unity. The\nlatest coup on one of the islands of the Comoros has made\nthis an extremely serious matter which now calls for urgent\naction by the international community. Namibia therefore\nwelcomes the action taken to restore the Government and\nlaw and order on the island.\nThe address His Holiness Pope John Paul II delivered\nfrom this rostrum yesterday was a thoughtful message\nconveying optimism, hope and good will as we stand on the\nthreshold of the next millennium. The Pope stressed\nuniversal love and family, subjects which embrace the\nentire human race.\nLet me conclude by expressing my sincere wish that\nthis historic commemorative session of the General\nAssembly will not fail to highlight public awareness of the\nwork of the United Nations and the continued relevance of\nthe Organization to the lives of individuals and\ncommunities everywhere. The vision of the founders 50\nyears ago focused on the welfare and security of succeeding\ngenerations. Nations and peoples, as represented by non-\ngovernmental organizations, should move forward together\ninto the next millennium for a better world in which\nchildren will feel safer.\n"

        "file_text": "May I at\nthe outset congratulate President Freitas do Amaral of\nPortugal on his well-deserved election to the presidency of\nthe fiftieth session of the General Assembly of the United\nNations and assure him of the full cooperation of the\ndelegation of the Islamic Republic of Iran at this\nimportant session, which coincides with the fiftieth\nanniversary of the United Nations.\nLess than a month from today, Members of the\nOrganization will assemble in this very Hall to celebrate\na half-century of operation of the United Nations. Fifty\nyears ago, when the bitter events and experience of the\nSecond World War were omnipresent, the original\nMembers decided to establish an organization \u201cdetermined\nto save succeeding generations from the scourge of war\u201d.\nThey signed the Charter of the United Nations, the result\nof two months of negotiations and compromise among the\nparticipants at the San Francisco Conference, which was\nto serve as the framework and the guide to prevent war\nand promote the economic and social advancement of all\nnations, large and small.\nHowever, it is generally acknowledged that shortly\nafter the establishment of the Organization, the spirit of\ncooperation and friendship gave way to bloc politics and\nrivalry, which led to the cold war and effectively\nprevented the achievement of the objectives enshrined in\nthe Charter. It would not be excessive to point to the\nantipathy between the two blocs as the principal cause of\nwars, underdevelopment of the third world, suppression of\nliberation struggles of nations under foreign domination,\nand interference in the internal affairs of others. It was\nthis mentality, prevalent in the bipolar world, which in\neffect denied the Organization the opportunity to fulfil its\nobligations completely, and which circumscribed the\nextent of participation by Member States in the\ndecision-making process and brought about the dominance\nof a few countries.\nAfter 50 years of turbulence, the United Nations is\nnow in one of its most sensitive periods. Although many\nproblems and obstacles of the past no longer exist, a new\nset of challenges have appeared, each of which has taken\nthe credibility, efficiency, relevance and ability of the\nOrganization to task, and which provide opportunities and\nresponsibilities to bring into conformity the modus\noperandi of international relations in general and the\nOrganization itself in particular, with the purposes and\nprinciples of the Charter.\nToday the United Nations faces these challenges and\nopportunities at a time when it remains the only truly\nuniversal organization. This universality of the\nOrganization can naturally put tremendous resources at its\ndisposal to facilitate the achievement of the principles and\n25\n\n\nobjectives of the United Nations Charter, particularly the\nmaintenance of international peace and security, the\npromotion of economic and social development, justice and\nmutual cooperation, and place it in a better position to deal\nwith emerging challenges in a more efficient and\ndistinguished fashion.\nWhat should be of the utmost importance to the\nOrganization is the extent to which Member States\nparticipate in its decision-making process. In fact, if we\ndefine and assess the universality of the Organization in\nterms of the wide participation by Member States in its\ndecision-making process, and not merely in terms of the\nnumber of its Member States, and direct all our efforts to\nstrengthening such universality, we will contribute\ntremendously to enhancing the credibility, authority and\nability of the Organization. In other words, when public\nparticipation of all Members as sovereign States is\nguaranteed in decisions of the Organization and their\nimplementation, then the possibility of the exerting of\nundue influence and dominance by a few States to shape\nthe approach of the Organization vis-\u00e0-vis international\nissues according to the limited confines of their own\nnational interests diminishes to a large extent.\nRegrettably, even in the current international\nenvironment, certain Members continue to adopt unilateral\nactions contrary to the provisions of the Charter, and\nthereby exhibit an absence, for their part, of the spirit of\ninternational cooperation.\nThe arrogant approach and attitude of the Government\nof the United States of America towards the international\ncommunity, and the unsuccessful attempts of the American\nforeign policy establishment to exploit issues of global\nconcern, such as terrorism and the proliferation of weapons\nof mass destruction, to advance an extraneous and\nillegitimate agenda represent a most vivid and indeed\ndangerous manifestation of such unlawful unilateral\nmeasures.\nThe United States Secretary of State must put to rest\nthe illusion that his Government can become both the judge\nand the policeman of the global community. Nor should he\nexpect others to follow American pressures against\nindependent States brought to bear with the sole objective\nof pleasing Zionist pressure groups even at the expense of\ndisregarding the interests of the American people.\nPerhaps they still do not really believe in the\nfundamental principle of the sovereign equality of States\nthat constitutes the cornerstone of the United Nations and\nthat requires each and every Member of the Organization\nto play its role in securing the objectives of the Charter.\nThis mentality is unfortunately the unwelcome heritage of\nthe cold-war period when, owing to the nature of bloc\nrivalries, States Members of the United Nations were\nviewed, not as independent, sovereign equals, but as\nmembers of power blocs. The unfortunate natural by-\nproducts of such a world view are inequality, hegemony,\ndisrespect for the interests and spiritual values of other\nnations, disregard of the choices and opinions of the\nmajority, preference for the short-term interests of the\nminority and self-serving interpretations of the rules and\nprinciples of international law.\nIt seems imperative, therefore, that in the new\ninternational political environment all organs of the\nUnited Nations, particularly the Security Council, should\nadopt substantive and procedural measures to facilitate the\nfull integration and participation of all Member States.\nThe Security Council, which constitutionally represents\nthe general membership of the Organization and acts on\nits behalf, should muster the requisite political will to deal\nwith all crises on the basis of principle and the same set\nof standards and should avoid preference for the interests\nof powerful States over the interests and choices of the\nmajority in order to discharge its responsibilities in\naccordance with the Charter. To achieve that objective\nsome structural, substantive and procedural reforms in the\nwork of the Council, including democratization and\ntransparency, are inevitable and will enhance the\ncredibility, efficiency and relevance of the Council as the\nrepresentative of the general membership.\nAt the same time, I should emphasize that the most\nimportant organ of the United Nations, the one that is the\nmanifestation of the principle of sovereign equality and\naffords direct participation to all Member States, is the\nGeneral Assembly. Therefore, strengthening this important\norgan and ensuring the accountability of other organs,\nparticularly the Security Council, before the General\nAssembly will guarantee full and more meaningful\nparticipation by the Organization\u2019s general membership in\nits decisions and their implementation. This will go very\nfar towards strengthening true universality and providing\nthe most effective guarantees for the implementation of its\ndecisions.\nIn the past few years, following the end of the cold\nwar, we have witnessed increased efforts to formulate\nnew sets of international standards in various political,\nsocial and economic spheres. A thorough review of the\nfinal documents of recent international conferences clearly\n26\n\n\nillustrates that, notwithstanding the conceptual and\nnormative transformations which the international\ncommunity has undergone in the formulation and\nexpression of its concerns and recommendations, it has\nlegitimately stood firm on the need to respect the\nfundamental principles that preserve the very fabric of our\ndiverse and pluralistic world. For instance, concepts and\nphrases such as \u201cthe necessity and importance of upholding\nfull respect for the spiritual and ethical values, national and\nregional particularities, as well as different historical and\ncultural backgrounds of countries\u201d, and \u201cthe necessity of\nhomogeneity and conformity in final documents and\nrecommendations of international conferences with the\npurposes and principles of the United Nations Charter and\nthe prevalence of a spirit of international cooperation and\nconsensus in their implementation and follow up\u201d have\nbeen incorporated and reaffirmed in the final documents of\nthe World Conference on Human Rights in Vienna, the\nInternational Conference on Population and Development in\nCairo, the World Summit for Social Development in\nCopenhagen, and the recently held Fourth World\nConference on Women in Beijing.\nThis clearly attests to the fact that while the\ninternational community has taken it upon itself to adopt a\njust and non-discriminatory approach through international\ncooperation towards the protection and promotion of all\nhuman rights, including the right to development, as\nuniversal, indivisible and interdependent rights, it continues\nto insist on the absolute imperative of guaranteeing that in\nthe process of international standard-setting, promotion and\nprotection, the sanctity of the principle of the national\nsovereignty of all States is respected and that no nation\u2019s\nreligious values and beliefs and cultural and national\nidentity are infringed.\nFurthermore, the Charter of the United Nations\nrecognizes international cooperation in economic and social\nissues as necessary for the maintenance of peaceful and\nfriendly relations between States. Unfortunately,\nnotwithstanding this emphasis, because of the conditions\nprevailing in international relations, both during and after\nthe cold war, the importance and centrality of issues related\nto economic and social development have not received due\nconsideration.\nIn addition, at a time when the North-South gap\ncontinues to widen on a daily basis, the world economic\ntrend, manipulated by unilateral actions and protectionist\npolicies on the part of the developed countries, also tends\nfurther to debilitate the potential of the developing countries\nto deal with the adverse impacts of international economic\ndevelopment. In this connection, we welcome the\nSecretary-General\u2019s \u201cAgenda for Development\u201d and\nannounce our intention to participate actively in the\ndeliberation of it. We firmly believe that post-cold-war\nopportunities should be utilized to their maximum\npotential so as to place issues of economic and social\ndevelopment at the centre of the United Nations attention.\nHence, there is a renewed need for recommendations\nabout and practical measures for expansion of the role of\nthe United Nations in promoting the economic\ndevelopment of developing countries, as well as full and\nrapid implementation of relevant agreements and\ninternationally agreed upon objectives in this field. In this\nconnection, the fundamental principle that States have the\nright to benefit from the utilization of their own resources\nthat are vital for their sustained economic growth and\ndevelopment in accordance with their national policies\nand priorities must not be neglected.\nAnother key characteristic of the post-cold-war era\nis the expansion of peace-keeping operations, which have,\nin recent years, demanded an increasing share of the\nenergy and resources of the Organization. Nevertheless,\nthe expansion of United Nations peace-keeping operations\nshould not take place at the expense of its activities in the\narea of development, which constitute one of the most\neffective measures for preventing the occurrence of\ntensions and conflicts as well as for ensuring tranquillity\nand stability. The Islamic Republic of Iran, along with\nother non-aligned countries, supports the United Nations\npeace-keeping efforts in principle, but emphasizes that all\nMember States that are willing and able to participate in\nsuch operations should be treated equally and without\ndiscrimination. In like manner, while a unified United\nNations command structure is essential for successful\npeace-keeping operations, its leadership should not be the\nmonopoly of a handful of States.\nAlthough the United Nations has been successful in\nreturning peace and stability to some volatile parts of the\nworld, its disregard for some important principles has\nresulted in the failure of the Organization to resolve other\ncrises that still rage. Let me emphasize that it is\nabsolutely imperative for the United Nations fully to\nrespect fundamental principles, including national\nsovereignty, territorial integrity and non-interference in\nthe internal affairs of States in all phases of the\nestablishment and execution of peace-keeping operations.\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran, eager to contribute\nmore actively to this growing area of United Nations\n27\n\n\nactivity, announces its readiness in principle to participate\nin United Nations peace-keeping operations in accordance\nwith our tenets and the fundamental principles of the\nCharter. Here, I deem it necessary to reiterate the\npreparedness of the Islamic Republic of Iran to dispatch\npeace-keeping forces to Bosnia and Herzegovina, which we\nhad earlier committed along with other Islamic countries to\nstrengthen the United Nations Protection Force\n(UNPROFOR) in order to enable it to discharge effectively\nits mandate to protect safe areas.\nWe hold the firm view that if the Security Council had\nat least provided the necessary mandate or committed the\nnecessary forces for the protection of the safe areas,\nincluding through taking advantage of the assistance offered\nby the Islamic countries, the Bosnian Serbs could not have\ncontinued, with relative ease, their crimes of genocide\nagainst the defenceless people of United Nations-declared\nsafe areas. However, the lack of political will to suppress\naggression and to deal effectively with non-compliance with\nUnited Nations decisions, coupled with the unreasonable,\nimmoral and legally baseless insistence by some on\nextending the arms embargo against the former Yugoslavia\nto the victim of its aggression have in fact proven to the\nSerbs that they can continue with impunity their murder,\ndestruction, aggression, \u201cethnic cleansing\u201d and genocide.\nSince the outbreak of the crisis, Islamic countries,\nincluding the Islamic Republic of Iran, have adopted a\nconstructive position and called for international\ncooperation in finding a just and peaceful resolution of the\nconflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The recent decision of\nthe joint meeting of Foreign and Defence Ministers of the\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) Contact\nGroup and troop contributing countries to establish the\n\u201cAssistance Mobilization Group\u201d in order to address the\nhumanitarian, economic, legal and defence requirements of\nthe Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina represents a proper\napproach to this tragedy in keeping with the principles and\npurposes of the United Nations.\nThis decision, along with the previous declaration by\nOIC member States of their readiness to dispatch a\nsufficient number of peace-keepers to Bosnia, as well as\ntheir declaration on the \u201cde-jure inapplicability\u201d of the arms\nembargo on Bosnia and Herzegovina are not only solidly\nbased in international law, the United Nations Charter and\nhumanitarian principles, but also emanate from the\nconsidered assessment that without a proper military\nbalance, it would be impossible to compel the Serbs to\nengage in serious negotiations or to guarantee the\nunhindered implementation of any negotiated settlement.\nIn this connection, the Islamic Republic of Iran\nwelcomes the recent cooperation between the two Contact\nGroups, and holds that only a plan which does not entail\nrecognition of the fruits of \u201cethnic cleansing\u201d and\nguarantees the national sovereignty and territorial integrity\nof Bosnia and Herzegovina as a Member of the United\nNations can restore peace and stability to the region.\nFurthermore, it is necessary in any peace negotiations to\naccord the non-Serb populations of Kosovo, Sanjak, and\nVojvodina the same rights and privileges as those\nrequested for the Serbs in Bosnia. Moreover, in order to\nguarantee a durable settlement and to preclude the\nrepetition of aggression and genocide, the International\nTribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for\nSerious Violations of International Humanitarian Law\nCommitted in the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia\nsince 1991 should continue its work resolutely, without\nany regard for political expediency, and severely pursue\nand punish those who are found guilty.\nThe increasing growth of inter-State cooperation\nwithin the framework of regional groupings constitutes\nanother characteristic of the new international climate.\nThere exist natural common grounds for cooperation,\nas well as shared interests among the countries of any\nregion, which together create a framework for the\npromotion of regional organizations. Such regional\ncooperation leads, in turn, to enhanced peace and stability\nin each region and the world through the expansion of a\nculture of cooperation, coexistence and dialogue. In this\ncontext, the Islamic Republic of Iran has emphasized\nregional cooperation and taken significant steps in this\nregard in order to enhance prosperity, peace and stability\nthroughout its own region.\nToday, the Economic Cooperation Organization\n(ECO) has grown to an organization with 10 members.\nWith a population of 336 million, rich natural resources\nand considerable potential, and in close proximity to\nimportant centres of economy and trade in Asia, Europe,\nand the Middle East, the organization endeavours to\nstrengthen and expand its activities, particularly in the\nareas of transportation, communications, trade and energy,\nin order to achieve well-being and prosperity for the\npeoples of the region, and to promote trade and economic\ngrowth.\nIn another effort for the expansion of regional\ncooperation, the Islamic Republic of Iran has made\nconcrete proposals for the establishment of the Caspian\nSea Cooperation Organization which, with the\n28\n\n\nparticipation of the littoral States, would aim for the\nexpansion of cooperation in the fields of shipping, fishing,\nthe protection of the environment and the exploitation of\nthe resources of the Caspian Sea. Fortunately, the proposal\nof the Islamic Republic of Iran has been accepted by the\nStates concerned, that is, the Russian Federation, the\nRepublic of Kazakhstan, the Republic of Azerbaijan and the\nRepublic of Turkmenistan. In our opinion, the Caspian Sea\nmust be a sea of peace and tranquillity whose affairs will\nbe decided by the concurrence of all its littoral States.\nConsidering the political and economic characteristics\nof our region, and the occurrence and expansion of conflicts\nand tensions due to internal and external factors, the\nGovernment of the Islamic Republic of Iran feels nationally\nand internationally obliged to exert every effort aimed at\nthe enhancement of economic prosperity and regional\nsecurity, the prevention and de-escalation of tension and the\npeaceful resolution of regional crises, based on respect for\nsovereignty and territorial integrity, the inviolability of\ninternationally recognized borders, and non-interference in\nthe internal affairs of others.\nIn Afghanistan, while refraining from any involvement\nin the regrettable fratricidal war, our policy has focused on\nkeeping channels of communication open with the\nGovernment and all Afghan groups in order to put an end\nto fighting and to bring about a negotiated settlement.\nIn the crisis in Tajikistan, the Islamic Republic of Iran\nhas exerted every effort and has succeeded in securing\nnegotiations in Tehran at the highest level between\nGovernment and opposition groups, leading to the signing\nof significant agreements concerning a cease-fire and the\npeace process. Attempts to find solutions to these crises\nrequire the constructive engagement of regional States and\nthe effective participation of the United Nations and the\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference.\nAt the same time, the maintenance of internal and\nregional stability and security in Central Asia and the\nCaucasus requires economic prosperity. The Islamic\nRepublic of Iran, in view of the special economic and\ngeographical situation of regional States, has tried to serve\nas a reliable economic and trade partner, through bilateral\neconomic cooperation, as well as the establishment of\ntrilateral commissions with the participation of States from\nwithin and outside the region aimed at the expansion and\nfacilitation of trade.\nInter-State cooperation in the sensitive and strategic\narea of the Persian Gulf, where regional States share many\ncommonalities, can also lead to economic prosperity, as\nwell as guaranteeing peace and stability. The military\npresence of foreign Powers, who have interests at\nvariance with stability and long-term cooperation among\nregional States, cannot be conducive to achieving the\ncommon objective of securing the tranquillity of this\nimportant waterway.\nIn the final analysis, all littoral countries of the\nPersian Gulf would be better served if they were to join\nhands in a concerted effort to maintain peace and security\nin the region, which will directly affect our destiny. Such\nefforts can be channelled through an institution organized\nby these same littoral States, where confidence-building\nmeasures commensurate with the specificities of the area\ncan be devised and followed up.\nReducing military budgets, setting a ceiling for arms\npurchases, acceding to disarmament and arms-control\ntreaties, cooperating with the United Nations Register of\nConventional Arms and devising a mechanism for\ntransparency in armaments are but a few examples of\nconfidence-building measures which the aforementioned\ninstitution could consider. The Islamic Republic of Iran\ndeclares its full readiness to enter into bilateral and\nmultilateral negotiations with its neighbours in order to\nreach common understandings on these issues.\nIn the Middle East, the Zionist entity, supported by\ncertain powerful countries, continues its occupation of\nPalestine and parts of Syria and Lebanon, and persists in\nits policies of aggression, suppression of those who dare\nto express opposition to its illegal occupation, and\nviolation of the very basic human rights of the Palestinian\npeople.\nExperience and the events of the past few years\nfurther illustrate the fact that the only viable option for\nrestoring peace and security to the Middle East is one\nwhich is comprehensive and just and which addresses the\nfundamental issues of the Palestine question. Such a\nsolution should entail a realization of the inalienable\nrights of the Palestinian people, including the return of all\nPalestinian refugees and displaced persons to their\nhomeland, the full and free exercise of their right to self-\ndetermination, and liberation of all occupied territories. In\nview of the volatility of the Middle East and the Persian\nGulf, these two regions must be off limits to any foreign\nmilitary presence and weapons of mass destruction. My\nGovernment continues to underscore the need to\nimplement numerous General Assembly resolutions as\nwell as the decision of the Review and Extension\n29\n\n\nConference of the States Parties to the Treaty on the Non-\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) to establish a\nnuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East as an\nimportant factor for installing stability in the region. What\nhas actually prevented the NPT from achieving its\nobjectives and the establishment of the Middle East as a\nzone free from nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass\ndestruction has been Israel\u2019s illegal nuclear capabilities and\nits refusal to join the NPT and put its unsafeguarded\nnuclear facilities under the safeguard regime of the\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).\nUndoubtedly, without the direct and indirect financial\nand technological support of certain Western\nnuclear-weapon States, Israel could not have acquired the\ncapability to develop nuclear weapons. Unfortunately, there\nexist strong indications that the nuclear capability of that\nregime is being continually increased by the very same\ncountries that are the most vocal proponents of nuclear\nnon-proliferation. This discriminatory trend persists even in\ncircumstances where Israeli nuclear policy has adversely\naffected regional security, the negative effects of which\ninclude a lack of confidence and a perception of insecurity\nin the region, an escalating arms race and influx of foreign\nweapons into the region, and the refusal of some States in\nthe region to join certain disarmament treaties.\nOn the international level, it must be acknowledged\nthat, despite the modest progress achieved in the control of\nnuclear, chemical and conventional weapons, these weapons\nhave unfortunately increased qualitatively and quantitatively\nto an alarming degree. We are of the view that the failure\nof the international community to deal effectively with\nthese weapons is primarily due to the fact that major\nproducers of conventional weapons and weapons of mass\ndestruction have prevented the United Nations from\nfulfilling its primary responsibility and central role in the\nfield of disarmament. Another main reason for this failure\nis that the policies of major arms-producing countries\ndesigned to control the spread of weapons of mass\ndestruction and conventional weapons are always\nshort-sighted and discriminatory and aim simultaneously at\nsecuring the destructive power of their own weaponry and\ntheir own military dominance.\nA glance at generally unsatisfactory disarmament\nnegotiations in various fields, including nuclear\ndisarmament, the Hague negotiations on the chemical\nweapons Convention, negotiations concerning verification\nsystems for the bacteriological weapons Convention, and\nthe performance of the United Nations Register of\nConventional Arms make the veracity of our contention\nquite evident.\nFollowing four weeks of difficult negotiations, the\n1995 Review and Extension Conference of the NPT could\nnot reach the conclusion that any progress towards the\nprimary objectives of the Treaty, including complete\nnuclear disarmament and the peaceful use of nuclear\nenergy, had been achieved in the past 25 years. The\nindefinite extension of the Treaty must be viewed within\nthe framework of three major final documents of the\nConference, together with the necessity for all signatories,\nparticularly the nuclear Powers, to commit themselves to\nthe full implementation of all provisions and objectives of\nthe Treaty. These obligations include achieving complete\nnuclear disarmament, expanding the peaceful uses of\nnuclear energy, strengthening the role and enhancing the\nauthority of the IAEA as the only international body\ncompetent to oversee the good-faith discharge of Member\nStates\u2019 responsibilities under the Treaty, ensuring the\nuniversality of the NPT as an urgent priority, and\nestablishing the Middle East as a zone free from nuclear\nweapons and other weapons of mass destruction. In this\nconnection, the nuclear-weapon States should, as a first\nstep, prove their good faith by refraining from nuclear\ntesting and finalizing a comprehensive test-ban treaty in\n1996.\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran, inspired by the divine\nteachings of Islam and benefiting from national solidarity\nand the continued participation and efforts of its people,\nhas endeavoured to develop a society on the basis of the\ndignity and worth of the human person and respect for\nhuman values, a society whose ethos includes fairness and\nsocial justice as well as cultural, social and economic\ndevelopment. In this regard, despite extensive damage\ncaused by the imposed war and other economic pressures,\nthe Islamic Republic of Iran, endowed with the resolve\nand work ethic of its entire population, has been able not\nonly to move towards reversing the vast destruction of the\nwar, but also successfully to complete its first five-year\neconomic and social development plan and embark upon\nthe implementation of the second five-year plan on solid\nfoundations. We foresee bright prospects for a\nstrengthened economic, social, cultural and political\ninfrastructure.\nSince the Islamic Republic of Iran firmly believes\nthat the maintenance of peace and security, at the\nnational, regional and international levels alike, is\ndependent upon economic growth and sustained\ndevelopment, we spend only about 1 per cent of our\n30\n\n\nnational budget on defence and devote the rest to\noverhauling and strengthening our economic, social and\ncultural infrastructures. We have made this strategic\ndecision at a time when the bitter experience of military\naggression against my country, a foreign military presence\nin the region and an alarming military build-up following\nthe second war in the Persian Gulf could have justified very\nextensive military expenditures.\nThe current session of the General Assembly provides\na golden opportunity for us to engage in a serious review\nof the performance of our Organization over the past 50\nyears, assess the current international situation and try to\nshape the conduct of international relations in the light of\nthe United Nations Charter in a fashion that remedies the\nshortcomings of the past.\nThe most important characteristic of our world is its\ncultural diversity, which has enriched human civilization.\nThe experience of the past 50 years has clearly illustrated\nthat attempts to impose Western standards, beliefs and\nculture upon the rest of humanity have not only failed to\nachieve the desired results, but also undermine the\nfoundations of peaceful coexistence and mutual\nunderstanding because, in spite of the appearance of\nchampioning the cause of freedom and tolerance, such an\napproach manifests extreme intolerance towards the values\nand beliefs of others.\nMutual respect for the rights, values and beliefs of all\nmembers of the international community, along with the\nempowerment of all nations to participate actively in the\nsetting of international norms, the maintenance of peace and\nsecurity and the promotion of economic and social\ndevelopment throughout the world must form the solid\nfoundation of Member States\u2019 activities in the next 50 years\nof the United Nations. The Islamic Republic of Iran is\nprepared to fulfil its role in this respect.\n"

        "file_text": "My country, Senegal, is very pleased to express to Mr.\nDiogo Freitas do Amaral its warm congratulations on his\nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly at its\nfiftieth session. His election reflects how much the\ninternational community values the role his country \u2014\nPortugal \u2014 has played in analysing and managing the\nmajor questions that mark the evolution of the world. It\nalso values his personal qualities as a diplomat and a\nstatesman, as well as his experience in the field of human\nrelations, the fundamental basis of peace among nations.\nI should like also to pay tribute to Mr. Freitas do\nAmaral\u2019s predecessor, Mr. Amara Essy, Foreign Minister\nof C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, who conducted the work for the year of\nthe forty-ninth session with effectiveness and remarkable\nopen-mindedness, thus earning the pride of all Africa.\nFinally, I should like here, once again, to emphasize\nmy country\u2019s support for the Secretary-General, Mr.\n6\n\n\nBoutros Boutros-Ghali. His initiatives, his repeated actions\nand his determination to accomplish his noble mission in\nthe service of peace, security and development, despite a\nparticularly unstable international situation, have earned the\ngratitude of the world. History will owe him a debt of\nthanks.\nToday, the United Nations has travelled through half\na century. For 50 years the peoples of the Earth, following\nthe Second World War, having wisely learned the lessons\nof the mistakes and set-backs of the history of human\nconflicts, have been engaged in an effort to create a new\nenvironment, an atmosphere of mutual understanding and\nof cooperation in solidarity, a framework within which\nmankind can finally realize that communal spirit, generosity\nand mutual respect are the best possible guarantees of\npeace, well-being, health and the environment, as well as\nthe blossoming of society.\nFor 50 years, pursuant to the principles set forth in the\nUnited Nations Charter by the founders of our shared\nOrganization, we have, stage by stage, laid the foundations\nfor an international system that can provide collective\nsecurity for all countries and, at the same time, create the\nbest possible conditions for life in greater freedom.\nIf we consider the action that the Organization has\nundertaken since its creation \u2014 in particular, if we analyse\nthe management of the many conflicts that arose here and\nthere during the period of the cold war \u2014 we can see,\nwithout any shadow of doubt, that it has indeed proved to\nbe an irreplaceable tool for the promotion and maintenance\nof peace.\nIndeed, beyond the simple maintenance of\ninternational peace and security, the Organization\nremarkably distinguished itself in the struggle for\ndecolonization, but, above all, in the establishment of a\nprogressive system of specialized agencies, all of which\nprovide highly valued assistance in the social, economic,\nhumanitarian and cultural fields.\nBut, despite these recorded achievements, we have to\nadmit that there is still a long road to travel, that a number\nof important challenges still have to be met, and new and\nbold initiatives taken, if we are to realize fully the ideals\ncontained in the San Francisco Charter.\nPatient preparation is being made for a historic reform\nof the structures of the Organization itself and, specifically,\nthe Security Council. In this connection, Senegal\nunreservedly supports an increase in the numbers of\npermanent and non-permanent members of the Council\nwith a view to strengthening the conditions and\nmachinery available for the maintenance of peace.\nIt must indeed be accepted that the end of\nideological confrontation has brought the world neither\nthe peace nor the development that was so earnestly\nanticipated by the founding fathers of the Charter.\nFrom Afghanistan to Angola, from Bosnia and\nHerzegovina to Somalia, from Liberia to the republics\nthat emerged from the former Soviet Union, many\nconflicts continue to this day to resist our attempts to\nsolve them. True, for some conflicts, such as those in\nAngola or the Middle East, significant progress has\nrecently been achieved. And I wish to take this\nopportunity to welcome the new important step that has\njust been taken in the search for a settlement to the\nMiddle East conflict with the signing, on 28 September in\nWashington, of the Taba Agreement.\nIn the case of other conflicts, such as that in Bosnia\nand Herzegovina, a glimmer of hope is now showing over\nthe horizon thanks to the concerted action of the Western\nContact Group and the Contact Group of the Organization\nof the Islamic Conference, as well as the European Union,\nthe United States of America, the Russian Federation and\nother Governments of good will. This is also an\nopportunity for me to congratulate the Organization of the\nIslamic Conference and its member States for all their\nefforts and initiatives. They have made a considerable\ncontribution to the results we have solemnly welcomed\ntoday.\nIn this regard, it is clear that the heroic struggle of\nthe Bosnian people, underpinned by its leaders\u2019 acute\nawareness of their responsibilities, has made a powerful\ncontribution to the new situation which the international\ncommunity wishes to see strengthened and eventually\nresult in a definitive peace for the former Yugoslavia.\nThe proliferation of conflicts resulting from the\ndisappearance of blocs has had the positive effect of\nlaying the foundation for a consensus on the machinery,\ncriteria, conditions and means to be used to ensure,\norganize and safeguard peace throughout the world. This\nconsensus implies that we must have greater recourse to\npreventive diplomacy as an innovative concept to ensure\nthat our system of collective security functions properly.\nThis consensus also implies that the mandates of peace-\nkeeping operations should henceforth be better defined in\nthe light of the circumstances and objectives sought. The\n7\n\n\nnecessary means should therefore be collected and\nmobilized.\nThe importance which my country, Senegal, attaches\nto this question is commensurate with its tireless\ndetermination to work towards an effective security system\nthat works because it is fully adapted to current realities. It\nis above all in this spirit that Senegal is a regular\nparticipant in the work of the Special Committee to review\nthe whole question of peace-keeping operations in all their\naspects.\nMoreover, Senegal\u2019s position is in accord with the\nclear awareness in Africa of changes occurring throughout\nthe world and which led our continent in 1992, at the\nsummit meeting of the Organization of African Unity in\nDakar, to conceive and establish a mechanism for the\nprevention, management and settlement of conflicts. This\nAfrican initiative, which contributes to the maintenance of\npeace and security throughout the world, should therefore\nbe supported by the international community in order to\nreduce the practical ramifications of the lack of funds\nwhich, as everyone knows, is so sorely afflicting Africa,\nand enable it to achieve its legitimate ambitions through\nfulfilment of the aims of this machinery. With such support,\nour continent, Africa, would be able to devote itself further\nto settling the conflicts in Rwanda, Burundi, Liberia, Sierra\nLeone and Somalia.\nSpeaking of regional conflicts, in regard to the\nproblem of Jammu and Kashmir \u2014 involving two\nneighbouring and fraternal countries, India and Pakistan,\nwith which Senegal has friendly relations \u2014 my delegation\nwould urge a definitive settlement that would allow these\ntwo great Asian nations to devote their efforts to\nestablishing an atmosphere of peace conducive to integrated\ndevelopment and mutual benefit. The Organization of the\nIslamic Conference, in conjunction with these two\ncountries, is giving careful thought to this matter.\nIt is universally recognized today that there can be no\ndevelopment without peace and stability. It is thus in the\nlack of development, poverty, marginalization and exclusion\nthat we must seek the underlying causes of insecurity. We\nmust therefore devise together a new system of collective\nlife that will give everyone new reasons for hope on the\nbasis of the spirit of solidarity and desire for peace in\nwhich the system is founded.\nSuch action should begin with a new awareness that,\neven if the expression \u201cglobalization of the economy\u201d is\nnow in vogue, the phenomenon goes far beyond the trend.\nIndeed, it involves, coevally, economics, finance and\ninformation. It is also and particularly relevant to the\nmajor problems of humanity\u2019s future, be it the question of\nprotecting the environment, fighting threats against our\ncollective health, drug trafficking or fighting organized\ncrime. It has become obvious today that the solutions to\nthese problems cannot but be global.\nIn the light of these new realities of today\u2019s world,\nit is clear that only a new conception of collective\nsolidarity will allow us to avoid or at least mitigate the\nmany serious consequences of poverty and exclusion that\nare so damaging to everyone. We must therefore make a\ncollective commitment to defining a new social covenant\nfor the future of mankind. The struggle against poverty in\nthe countries of the southern hemisphere therefore\nassumes particular importance in this context.\nGiven the current globalization and liberalization in\nthe economy of nations, the new World Trade\nOrganization (WTO) \u2014 opened in Geneva a few months\nago after having been christened at the historic Marrakesh\nmeeting \u2014 should prove to be a new framework and\ncradle for a world open to fairer, more balanced and more\nhuman economic and trade relations between the countries\nof the North and South, in the spirit of the legitimate\nclaims of the peoples of the third world. Here, I wish\nsolemnly to reaffirm that the WTO carries with it the\nhopes of the world for a new era of profitable, balanced\nand sustainable trade for all.\nFrom this perspective, the World Trade\nOrganization, to the establishment of which the African\ncountries contributed, should help those countries to\nparticipate more actively in the new international\neconomic system.\nMoreover, the globalization and liberalization of the\neconomy should also encourage the developing countries\nto intensify South-South cooperation as an essential\ncomponent of both the strategy for development and the\nmeans to ensure the integration of their economies in the\nnew context and within the new aspirations of the\ninternational community for development in peace,\nparticularly of the countries of the South. The same is\ntrue of the need to boost commodity prices and to ensure\nequitable access to markets \u2014 to all markets \u2014 to allow\nour countries to develop genuine and effective trade\npolicies. My country, Senegal, wishes unreservedly to\nstake its claim to this dynamic process.\n8\n\n\nOn the occasion of this fiftieth anniversary of the\ncreation of the United Nations, from this rostrum I wish to\nmake a solemn and heartfelt appeal on behalf of the\ndevelopment of Africa. This appeal reflects a major concern\nof African leaders and peoples. The United Nations, as we\nknow, has devoted much fruitful attention to this matter, as\nwitnessed by the convening in Geneva last July, within the\nframework of the session of the Economic and Social\nCouncil, of a high-level debate on African development.\nToday, it is a truism to stress the dangers of Africa\u2019s\nmarginalization. It is a danger, a real one, painful and\nserious. Although it is real, the danger is none the less\nunacceptable. It is therefore absolutely essential, for all\nthose for whom solidarity and international cooperation\ncontinue to hold meaning, that it be averted.\nI welcome the fact that the Secretary-General of the\nOrganization that shelters us today is one of those who\nbelieves that there is no historical inevitability which Africa\ncannot overcome. Has not Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali\ndecisively proved this by deciding to launch a special\ninitiative for Africa, with the clear aim of breathing fresh\nlife into international cooperation?\nThrough me, Senegal reiterates its total support for\nthis initiative, which is particularly fortunate since it\ndovetails with all the priorities Africa has set for itself \u2014\nnamely, food security, water control, social and human\ndevelopment, democracy, mobilization of resources and,\nfinally the struggle against poverty.\nIt should also be recalled that the Head of the\nSenegalese State, His Excellency President Abdou Diouf,\nhas been tirelessly devoting himself for a long time now to\nseeking global solutions to the problems of Africa,\nparticularly the excruciating question of debt which is\ndelaying the development of African countries.\nThus, during his first term of office as Chairman of\nthe Organization of African Unity, he was the initiation of\nthe convening in 1986, for the first time in the annals of the\nUnited Nations, of a special session of the General\nAssembly devoted to Africa\u2019s critical economic situation.\nSimilarly, Senegal welcomed the conclusion in Paris\nin 1994 of the international Convention to Combat\nDesertification in those Countries Experiencing Serious\nDrought and/or Desertification, particularly in Africa, and\nwould like to stress here that this Convention must be put\ninto effect very soon and that the allocation of the\nconsiderable resource that would be needed to uproot this\nscourge from the African continent should be accelerated.\nThis is the task which for years now has been the special\nconcern of the Interstate Committee for Drought Control\nin the Sahara.\nWe cannot speak about development without\naddressing the question of respect for and protection of,\nfundamental human rights and freedoms, which have\ntoday become a universally recognized requirement.\nEveryone is aware of how wedded Senegal is to this\nrequirement of our modern times that, in view of the\nchanges which have affected the world since the end of\nthe 1980s, all African countries, integrate this policy into\ntheir development policy as an unavoidable dimension of\nprogress.\nTo conclude, may I emphasize once again that the\nnew international context and the multi-dimensional\nnature of the problems that must be solved require\nconcerted action by all of us: integrated action, solidarity\namong all partners \u2014 Governments, agencies and bodies,\npublic or private \u2014 that mould the life and the evolution\nof the human international community.\nSolidarity is the cement and also the guarantee of\nthis common approach, which is inspired by what is\nneeded for mankind to survive. Solidarity is first and\nforemost a profound conviction that we all belong to one\nand the same world, whether it be developed or\nunderdeveloped. Solidarity also entails a duty to face up\nto our common problems and our common challenges,\nwhether we come from the North or from the South.\nSolidarity is, finally, a collective will to build the future\non the basis of a partnership from which none are\nexcluded. Solidarity is also a common commitment\nvoluntarily to promote the collective progress of all\nmankind. It is in the name of all the nations that are so\ngreatly devoted to the mission of man on earth that we\nmust nurture solidarity, cooperation, friendship and\nbrotherhood.\nIn this spirit and at this juncture in the history of our\nplanet when hope has been rekindled by the celebration\nof the fiftieth anniversary of an organization \u2014 the\nUnited Nations \u2014 without which the world would not be\nwhat it is today, we solemnly express our ardent hope\nthat this 1995 session, the fiftieth in the history of the\nUnited Nations, will be the dawn of a new era in which\nwe shall witness the realization of all our ideals of peace,\njustice and progress, to the greatest benefit of future\ngenerations, to which it is our duty to hand over a world\nof peace, a world of security and a world of development.\n"

        "file_text": "I am delighted to\naddress the General Assembly in the year of its fiftieth\nanniversary. On behalf of the Nigerian delegation, I\nconvey warm congratulations to the President on his\nelection to preside over the General Assembly at its\nfiftieth session. We are confident that in carrying out his\nduties he will bring his wisdom, competence and\ndiplomatic skills to bear on the work of the Assembly.\nWe congratulate his friendly country, Portugal, and\nreaffirm the warmth of the bilateral relations between our\ntwo countries.\nLet me also convey our sincere thanks to his\ndistinguished predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Amara\nEssy of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, for the outstanding manner in\nwhich he conducted the affairs of the General Assembly\nat its forty-ninth session. I also wish to express my\ndelegation\u2019s appreciation to the Secretary-General for the\ncourageous manner in which he is responding to the\nchallenges of his office.\nThe uniqueness of the current session is not lost on\nmy delegation. It is not only a solemn occasion to reflect\non the achievements and difficulties of our Organization\nduring the past 50 years, but also a golden opportunity to\nchart a new way forward. We therefore hope that the\nwork of this and future sessions of the General Assembly\nwill continue to be inspired by the purposes and\nprinciples of the United Nations Charter.\nThe establishment of the United Nations in the\naftermath of the Second World War marked a turning\npoint in the history of international relations. As an\nintergovernmental Organization whose principal tasks\ninclude the maintenance of international peace and\nsecurity, the promotion of international cooperation for\n7\n\n\ndevelopment and the progressive development and\ncodification of international law and respect for human\nrights, the United Nations best epitomizes the will of the\npeoples of the world to live together.\nWe in Africa attach great importance to this fiftieth\nanniversary, as in 1945 the vast majority of our countries\nwere not independent and therefore could not participate in\nthe processes leading to the signing of the United Nations\nCharter in San Francisco. It is gratifying, however, that\nfrom being represented by only four countries on that\noccasion, Africa has since grown to be the largest regional\ngroup within the Organization. This is in accordance with\nthe universalist aspirations of the United Nations.\nThe phenomenal growth in membership evokes happy\nmemories of the transition of a large number of Member\nStates, particularly from Africa and Asia, from colonial\ndependencies to nationhood. For many years the United\nNations was the catalyst in this process. Our continental\norganization, the Organization of African Unity (OAU),\nfrom its inception in 1963, similarly embraced this\nobjective as a primary preoccupation. It was my country\u2019s\nprivilege to be associated at the regional and global levels\nwith the struggle against apartheid and for freedom and\nself-determination on the continent.\nThe United Nations is perhaps best known for its\nendeavours in the maintenance of international peace and\nsecurity. This remains a major preoccupation, as events\nsince the end of the Cold War have demonstrated that civil\nconflicts and political instability in many countries,\nparticularly in the developing world, have become endemic,\nwith grave consequences for international peace and\nsecurity. These conflicts, which have their origins in,\namong other things, new nationalisms, ethnic differences\nand religious bigotry, constitute a test of the international\ncommunity\u2019s will to meet the new challenges and provide\nappropriate solutions.\nOn this occasion, therefore, it is the hope of the\nNigerian delegation that the Assembly will make sustained\nefforts to take decisions that will significantly enhance the\nprospects of global peace and security. We expect that\nfurther thought will be given to redefining the role of the\nUnited Nations and its perspectives on preventive\ndiplomacy, peacemaking, peace-keeping and peace-building\nas continuing imperatives in crisis management and conflict\nresolution.\nGiven that the maintenance of international peace and\nsecurity is a shared responsibility, the United Nations\nshould undertake to realign and strengthen its cooperation\nwith regional organizations and arrangements. This is not\nto underestimate the need for Member States to make\nserious efforts to prevent war and civil conflict through\nconfidence-building measures and the formulation and\nimplementation of appropriate domestic policies. In this\nregard, we cannot but reaffirm the continuing validity of\nthe peaceful resolution of disputes through mediation,\nconciliation, arbitration, judicial settlement and respect for\napplicable international laws.\nWe deplore the growing arms race and the\nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction, on which\nvast resources are now being wasted. The nuclear genie\nhas left the bottle and cannot now be led back into it; the\ntrauma of Hiroshima and Nagasaki persists and continues\nto haunt the international conscience. Let us therefore\nresolve that such a tragedy will never happen again. The\ntime for disarmament under effective international control\nis now.\nAlthough progress towards the achievement of\ngeneral and complete disarmament has been slow, we\nwould like to commend the United Nations for its role in\nthis sphere. Nigeria regards the agreements banning\nbiological and chemical weapons as landmark\narrangements. We must remain committed to the ultimate\ngoal of the total elimination of all weapons of mass\ndestruction.\nOn its twenty-fifth anniversary, in May of this year,\nthe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons\n(NPT) was extended indefinitely. Developments since\nthen have seriously undermined the confidence we have\nall reposed in the Treaty and its regime, and have\nregrettably cast major doubt on the commitment of\nMember States, particularly the nuclear Member States,\nto disarmament. In our view, efforts to achieve this must\nremain fundamental and include the conclusion of a\ncomprehensive nuclear- test-ban treaty by 1996, the cut-\noff in the production of fissionable materials for weapons\npurposes, and the granting of security assurances by the\nnuclear-weapon States to non-nuclear-weapon States in a\nlegally binding instrument.\nIn our continuing efforts to ensure a peaceful and\nsecure environment for the development of the African\ncontinent, Nigeria is delighted to welcome the successful\ncompletion of the negotiations on the Treaty of an\nAfrican Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone, which was endorsed\nby the Organization of African Unity (OAU) Council of\nMinisters in June 1995. By this action, African leaders\n8\n\n\nhave given concrete expression to their collective\ncommitment to make the continent a nuclear-weapon-free\nzone. It is our expectation that during this session the\ninternational community will respect this initiative through\nthe endorsement of the Treaty. We hope that the nuclear-\nweapon States will ratify the protocols to be annexed to the\nTreaty.\nThe framers of the Charter of the United Nations did,\nin fact, recognize that peace and development go together.\nAmong the high purposes of our Organization is the\npromise of economic and social achievement by all peoples.\nTo this end, a good deal of effort has been made by the\nUnited Nations and its agencies to support the\nimplementation of programmes of action initiated by\ndeveloping countries at national, subregional and regional\nlevels. We commend these agencies for their efforts in\ntackling the problems of social and economic development.\nIn discussing the general issue of development, we\nrecognize the primacy of the United Nations in promoting\ninternational cooperation for development. It is in this\nconnection that we have welcomed the contribution of the\nSecretary-General in his Agenda for Development. For us\nin Africa, development is a question of survival. We place\na particular premium on it as we confront the challenges of\npoverty and underdevelopment.\nWhile the unsatisfactory economic situation of Africa\nhas been the subject of many international conferences, the\nresulting programmes of action have remained largely\nunimplemented. Such programmes include the United\nNations Programme of Action for African Economic\nRecovery and Development 1986-1990 and the United\nNations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the\n1990s, adopted in 1991. The failure to implement these\nprogrammes has been due primarily to the lack of will and\nacceptance of a concept of economic interdependence by\nour development partners. Yet, it remains important that\ndevelopment should be seen as an integral and indivisible\nwhole, an objective to be pursued collectively in the global\neconomy.\nThe economic crises confronting the developing\ncountries are multifaceted. I would, however, like to stress\nthe pre-eminent need for the international community to\nresolve the external-debt crisis, which is a key impediment\nto growth and development in our respective countries.\nMost African countries devote a large proportion of their\nforeign exchange earnings to debt-servicing. It has,\ntherefore, been difficult for these countries to also pursue\nsustained economic development objectives. It is clear that\nNigeria \u2014 as, indeed, most other countries of our\ncontinent \u2014 faces limited possibilities for the\nimplementation of their economic reform programmes\nwithout urgent and adequate debt-relief measures.\nWe believe that development cooperation should\nengender genuine interdependence, mutual interest and\nbenefits in the context of global partnership. In the\nexpectation that the developed countries will support and\nindeed assist the developing countries in their\ndevelopment efforts, we call for fuller cooperation\nbetween the two sides. The initiative to hold the Asia-\nAfrica Forum in Bandung, Indonesia, in December 1994,\nas a follow-up to the Tokyo International Conference for\nthe Development of Africa, was bold and imaginative.\nThe conclusions and recommendations of these initiatives,\nwhich are also critical, need to be faithfully implemented.\nThe integrated approach to development being\npursued by the United Nations is right and deserves to be\ncommended. In this regard, we welcome the outcome of\nthe recently concluded World Summit for Social\nDevelopment and Fourth World Conference on Women.\nThese conferences have helped to promote women in\ndevelopment and to enhance their role in public affairs.\nWe acknowledge the interdependence of societies as\nunderscored by these conferences, and the fact that all\ncultures have a contribution to make at the crossroads of\ncivilization and development.\nWhile recognizing the achievements of the United\nNations, it is fit and proper, at this point, to identify also\nthose areas in which the Organization has not fully\nrealized its objectives.\nOn peace and security, it should be acknowledged\nthat the United Nations has a commendable record of\nsuccess. Since its founding, it is significant that there has\nbeen no global war and that the end of the cold war has\nenhanced the prospects for cooperation and the lessening\nof tension. However, new conflicts have emerged which\nhave defied solution by the United Nations. It is evident\nthat the challenges of peacemaking, peace-keeping and\npeace-building require new perspectives and commitments\nfrom Member States. Moreover, while seeking to provide\nsolutions to these conflicts, the United Nations must\naccept that it has a limit to its capacity. It should,\ntherefore, not micromanage the internal political\narrangements of countries in conflict. It is equally\nimportant that the United Nations be seen to be\ntransparent and even-handed in crisis management in all\nregions. Furthermore, the United Nations should do more\n9\n\n\nto cultivate and cooperate with regional organizations and\narrangements in conflict resolution.\nOn decolonization, the balance sheet of the United\nNations performance is largely positive. However, the\nlegacies of colonialism and the challenges of nation-\nbuilding have created difficulties for new States. These\ndifficulties have resulted in the inability of many of the new\nStates of the developing world to conduct their domestic\nand external relations in a manner consistent with the\nprovisions of the Charter. The experience of a number of\nthese States indicates that powerful members of the\ninternational community continue to insist on their models\nas standards for universal behaviour and application. The\npolitical and economic lives of the new States are further\ncircumscribed by international financial institutions\ndominated by the economically strong. These institutions,\nwhich are as old as our Organization, have yet to adapt to\nthe new economic realities and needs of the new States\nthey seek to serve.\nWith regard to development, the objectives of the\nCharter have remained largely unfulfilled in view of the\ngrowing economic disparities between a minority of\ndeveloped countries and the vast majority of countries\nwhich are classified as developing. Regrettably, dialogue\nbetween the North and the South, which is vital to\neffectively address this imbalance, has reached a deadlock.\nThis dialogue needs to be relaunched in order to achieve a\njust and equitable world order for sustainable development.\nSince joining the United Nations 35 years ago, Nigeria\nhas played its part in upholding the purposes and principles\nset forth in the United Nations Charter. It has also pursued\nits objectives with dedication and commitment. From\ndecolonization to peace-keeping, we have spared neither\nefforts nor resources in fulfilling our obligations under the\nCharter. Our record in peace-keeping speaks for itself.\nWithin the ambit of South-South cooperation, Nigeria\nhas extended assistance to other developing countries,\nparticularly in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific. In our\nsubregion, we are in active partnership with the countries\nof the Economic Community of West African States\n(ECOWAS) to accelerate development through cooperation.\nIt is our hope that ECOWAS will become an essential\ncomponent for continental integration as envisaged under\nthe Abuja Treaty on the African Economic Community.\nTo avoid any doubt, I wish to state that we in Africa\nhave long accepted that the primary responsibility for the\ndevelopment of our continent rests squarely on our\nshoulders. But the reality of our experience is that we\nhave had to fight on the two fronts of political and\neconomic reforms at the same time. Few regions of the\nworld have borne such excruciating burdens in their\ndevelopment process. This calls for understanding and\nencouragement rather than indifference and benign\nneglect. Consequently, in addition to regional integration\nefforts, we in Nigeria have undertaken bold economic and\npolitical reforms. On the economic front, the current\nAdministration in Nigeria has deregulated the economy\nand created new incentives for domestic and foreign\ninvestments.\nOn the political plane, Nigeria has embarked on\ncourageous reforms. In spite of unforeseen difficulties and\nthe complexities of the Nigerian situation, we have\ncontinued to make steady progress in our determined\nefforts to establish a veritable and enduring democratic\npolity. Indeed, only three days ago my Head of State,\nGeneral Sani Abacha, announced a comprehensive\nprogramme of transition to democratic rule and the final\ndisengagement of the military from power. This\nprogramme was carefully drawn up taking into account\nthe objective realities of our national situation to ensure\nnot only an orderly transition, but also the\ninstitutionalization of durable democratic structures of\ngovernance at all levels.\nWhile we recognize and appreciate the\nunderstandable concerns of our foreign friends and the\ninternational community at large, we hope that due\nsupport will be given to our endeavour in the full\nrealization that a democratic Nigeria, the most populous\nblack nation on Earth, is an asset to itself and has much\nto offer the international community.\nIn order that the United Nations might be better\nequipped to discharge its responsibility as a forum for\nharmonizing the actions of nations, it is essential that the\nongoing process of revitalization and institutional reforms\nbe intensified. This is necessary if the United Nations is\nto assert its central role in the establishment of a new\nworld order. It is also vital if the United Nations is to\ntruly reflect the equity and geographical balance that are\ncritical for its efficiency and authority.\nNigeria, therefore, reaffirms its support for the\nexpansion of the Security Council both in its permanent\nand in its non-permanent membership and, in this\nconnection, my delegation renews the offer made by our\ncountry to serve the international community as a\npermanent member in the expanded Security Council.\n10\n\n\nAs we look to the future, it is obvious that the\neffectiveness of the United Nations will depend on the\ncollective will and support of its entire membership. There\nare two levels of responsibility in ensuring a strong and\nvibrant United Nations. The first is what the United Nations\nitself must do; the second, and more important, is what we\nthe Member States accept to do to enable the Organization\nto respond effectively to our collective quest for peace,\nfreedom, justice and development. In pursuit of these\nobjectives, Nigeria is determined to continue making its\ncontributions.\n"

        "file_text": "I am\npleased to begin my statement by extending to you sincere\ncongratulations on your election to the presidency of the\npresent session of the General Assembly. I am confident\nthat your high competence and profound experience will\ncontribute effectively to the success of the work of the\npresent historic session.\nThis session coincides with the fiftieth anniversary of\nour Organization. There is no doubt that such an important\noccasion calls for examining the course the Organization\nhas taken in order to draw the best object-lessons that\nwould enable the international community to proceed to the\nbuilding of a better future in which peace and stability\nwould prevail on the basis of justice, the balance of\ninterests of all peoples and genuine international\ncooperation that would be free from selfishness and\nhegemony; a future which would open the doors towards\nthe solution of economic, social, cultural and humanitarian\nproblems that continue to cause suffering to the\noverwhelming majority of States, especially in Asia, Africa\nand Latin America.\nMembers of the international community welcomed\nthe end of the cold war. They view it as the harbinger of a\nnew age. However, many representatives of many Member\nStates did point out the dangers of imbalance in\ninternational relations. They warned that the supremacy of\none super-Power would make international life hostage to\nthat Power and, thereby, lead to the imposition of its views,\ninterests and policies on the rest of the world. The\ncorrecting of this imbalance in the international situation\nrequires a great deal of care in upholding equality between\nStates, restructuring the United Nations in line with well-\nbalanced formulas, revitalizing the work of its institutions\nin a manner that would ensure balance and genuine\nparticipation in responsibility, prevent hegemony by one or\ncertain parties over the international community and over\nthe United Nations with its institutions. Although these\nobjectives have not been achieved so far, to work towards\ntheir achievement and to develop an understanding of what\nthey involved continue to be urgent needs of the highest\npriority.\n\nWe believe that the imposition of a unipolar\nstandpoint on the work of the United Nations totally\ncontradicts the purposes and principles of the Charter.\nThe persistence of such attempts would lead only to more\nanxiety and deterioration in international relations.\nThis conviction stems from Iraq\u2019s actual experience\nover the past five years. It is an experience that relates to\nthe implementation of the resolutions of the Security\nCouncil on the so-called Gulf Crisis, and especially the\nimplementation of resolution 687 (1991).\nThat resolution imposed upon Iraq a number of\nobligations, as a basis for a comprehensive settlement of\nthe situation. A few days after the adoption of the\nresolution, Iraq informed the Security Council of its\nreadiness to comply with the provisions of the resolution\ndespite the harsh nature of the obligations imposed\nthereby. Since that date, Iraq has seriously taken upon\nitself the implementation of the resolution in order to\nnormalize the situation at the regional and international\nlevels. In fact, a great many steps have taken place in\nimplementing the resolution. Our people hope that what\nhas been achieved will be the subject of an objective and\nfair evaluation by the Security Council that would lead to\nthe lifting of the embargo imposed upon Iraq for more\nthan five years now.\nAllow me to review very briefly the steps\ntaken by Iraq in the context of implementing the\nobligations imposed by the Security Council in\nresolution 687 (1991).\nOn 10 November 1994, Iraq officially recognized the\nsovereignty, the territorial integrity and the political\nindependence of the State of Kuwait, and the international\nboundary demarcated by the United Nations Iraq-Kuwait\nBoundary Demarcation Commission. This was done in\nimplementation of resolutions 687 (1991) and 833 (1993).\nIraq has cooperated also with the representatives of\nthe United Nations in returning Kuwaiti property on the\nbasis of the lists presented through the United Nations\ncoordinator. In this connection, Iraq affirmed that it will\nreturn any item of property that would be found when it\nis established that it belongs to Kuwait.\nAs regards the prisoners of war and the missing\npersons, Iraq, in implementation of Security Council\n8\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\n\nresolutions 686 (1991) and 687(1991), released all prisoners\nof war and detainees who were in Iraq and repatriated them\nin cooperation with the International Committee of the Red\nCross (ICRC). As for investigating the fate of missing\npersons, we are cooperating fully within the framework of\nthe joint work carried out under the auspices of the ICRC\nby the Tripartite Commission and its Technical\nSubcommittee on Military and Civilian Missing Prisoners\nof War and Mortal Remains. Since the middle of 1994,\nwhen we found the appropriate modality for effective\ntechnical work in dealing with this humanitarian problem,\nwe have sought within the said framework to provide\nanswers to the questions raised in the individual inquiry\nfiles presented to us on the basis of the available\ninformation. Moreover, Iraq has been receptive to all the\ninitiatives of States and personalities to find a quick\nsolution to this humanitarian problem in accordance with\nthe Geneva Conventions.\nWith regard to the subject of compensation, Iraq\naccepted the principle of responsibility in accordance with\ninternational law to compensate direct damage resulting\nfrom the events in Kuwait as stated in resolution 687\n(1991).\nIraq has cooperated also with the United Nations Iraq-\nKuwait Observation Mission (UNIKOM) in carrying out its\ntasks and has extended every possible assistance to the\nMission with the aim of enabling it to perform its duties.\nIraq has affirmed its adherence to the 1925 Geneva\nProtocol for the Prohibition of the Use in War of\nAsphyxiating, Poisonous or Other Gases and Bacteriological\nMethods of warfare, and deposited the instruments of\nratification of the 1972 Convention on the Prohibition of\nthe Development, Production and Stockpiling of\nBacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on\ntheir Destruction, in implementation of paragraph 7 of\nresolution 687 (1991).\nAs for the implementation by Iraq of section (C) of\nresolution 687 (1991), that is the provisions relating to\nproscribed weapons, our relationship with the Special\nCommission and the International Atomic Energy Agency\n(IAEA) witnessed, in the middle of 1993, a turning point in\nthe field of positive and constructive cooperation in order\nto finalize the implementation of the said section.\nOn 26 November 1993, we presented the official\nresponse in regard to compliance with resolution 715 (1991)\nrelating to monitoring in the field of weapons.\nIn the process of work with the Special Commission\nand the IAEA, we have not hesitated to offer all possible\nassistance to facilitate the work, whether by presenting\ninformation, available documents, details relating to past\nprogrammes, the destruction of prohibited weapons, and\nthe setting up of an effective monitoring system. We have\nbeen able to achieve substantive progress in this area, as\nacknowledged by the Special Commission in its report to\nthe Security Council on 19 June 1995, and have taken the\nfinal steps to complete the desired work.\nThese facts are well established in the relationship\nbetween Iraq and the Special Commission and the IAEA.\nThe substantive nature of these facts cannot be distorted\nby the campaign waged against Iraq by well-known\nquarters because of special objectives of their own which\nare totally alien to the objectives of resolution 687 (1991).\nDespite all the propaganda, Iraq no longer has any\nproscribed weapons, equipment, devices or materials, and\nthis is the essence of resolution 687 (1991). We affirm\nour determination to continue our cooperation with the\nSpecial Commission and the IAEA to close the weapons\nfile in accordance with the relevant resolutions and have\nthe embargo against Iraq lifted.\nI should like to express here our deep regret\nregarding the a priori ill-intentioned exaggerations which\ncast a terrifying image of past Iraqi weapons programmes,\nand the deliberate distortion of the fact that these\nprogrammes were something of the past and that they no\nlonger exist. Raising fears in such a contrived fashion is\nnot an objective position at all. It is an attitude prompted\nby political objectives which are far removed from the\nconcern over security and stability in the region and the\nprovisions of resolution 687 (1991).\nIraq has taken all these steps even while it has\ncontinued to suffer the hardship caused by a total\nembargo, the most extended ever imposed by the Security\nCouncil in all its history. It is an embargo that embraces\neverything and every aspect of life with the exception of\nfood and medicine. However, the freezing of Iraq\u2019s assets\nwith foreign banks has prevented Iraq from using any of\nthose assets to purchase its needs of medicines and\nfoodstuffs and, thereby, has made the exception relating\nto food and medicine devoid of any practical content. The\nsituation in Iraq has been aggravated by the actual\npractice obtaining in the work of the Security Council\nCommittee established by resolution 661 (1990), which is\nin charge of the application of sanctions against Iraq.\nWork in the Committee proceeds along highly\n9\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\n\nbureaucratic lines and follows the rule of unanimity. This\nhas provided certain States with an easy way to object and\nthereby to reject a large number of export requests to Iraq\nto meet civilian humanitarian needs, from pencils and\neducational materials to automobile tyres and other simple\ncivilian provisions. All these matters are documented in the\nrecords of the 661 Committee.\nThe deliberate insistence on prolonging the embargo\nagainst Iraq is not linked to Iraq\u2019s implementation of its\nobligations. It is a systematic plan to inflict severe damage\nupon Iraq and to deliberately destroy its infrastructure and\nput paid to its developmental capabilities. This is a fact that\nis known to all. The reports of the competent United\nNations Agencies operating in Iraq and of\nnon-governmental organizations concerned with relief\nwarned against the deterioration of the situation as a result\nof the shortage of food and medicine, which threatens the\nlives of millions of Iraqis, including thousands of children,\nwomen and old people. In this connection, I should like to\nrefer to the last alert of the World Food Programme, issued\non 26 September 1995.\nThe report of the Secretary-General on the work of the\nOrganization, and his \u201cSupplement to An Agenda for\nPeace\u201d, refer clearly to the problem of sanctions. We\nshould like in turn to draw the attention of Member States\nto the fact that the application of sanctions against Iraq,\nwith such cruelty and bureaucratic complexity, calls for\nquestioning and scrutiny, in the interests of objectivity. We\nare not sure that all the representatives in the General\nAssembly know that the Security Council reviews the\nsanctions regime against Iraq every 60 days, and that 27\nreviews have been conducted to date without any easing of\nthe sanctions. The situation remains the same as it has been\nsince 3 April 1991, as if nothing had been achieved. Is this\na healthy situation?\nThe tragic consequences of the embargo have not been\nlimited to the food and health sectors in Iraq. The sections\nof agriculture, education and environment also have\nsustained grave damage, due to the shortages of materials\nand the basic requirements needed for work in such sectors,\neven at the minimum level required to satisfy the basic\nneeds of the civilian population.\nThe aggravation of this extremely difficult situation\nhas not prevented us from continuing to implement our\nobligations under the relevant resolutions of the Security\nCouncil. It is worth noting that, as is known to all, while\nwe were being called upon to implement our obligations,\nand while we were deploying persistent efforts to do just\nthat, we have not received in return any objective and\nequitable position that would have reduced sanctions\ncommensurately with the progress achieved by Iraq in\nimplementing the resolutions, or that would have given\nencouragement and hope and given confidence that the\nsituation would be normalized eventually, in accordance\nwith the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations.\nThe reality has been the very opposite. From the\nvery beginning and to date, we have been the target of\nmany threats; doubts have been raised about our\nintentions; and we have been, twice, the target of armed\naggression. There has been considerable deceit with\nregard to objectives. Pressure has been brought to bear on\nany party that even thought of treating us fairly, even if\nsuch fairness was not intended as a gesture towards Iraq\nbut as a means of safeguarding the credibility of the\nCharter system and of the resolutions of the Security\nCouncil. We have been accused of intermittent and\nselective cooperation and of a lack of peaceful intentions\nand lack of credibility, to such an extent that the levelling\nof accusations by certain parties has come to resemble a\nchronic pathological alignment. Such accusations have\nbeen accompanied by the continued pursuance on the\npractical level of policies aimed at interfering in the\ninternal affairs of Iraq in order to destabilize it; to\nundermine its security, stability, the freedom of its people\nand its sovereignty; and to try and change its political\nsystem.\nA super-Power has imposed upon my country two\nno-fly zones, in the north and the south, without any legal\njustification or authorization from the Security Council. It\nhas also exercised every means of pressure and deception\nto perpetuate the harsh conditions caused by the embargo\nagainst Iraq, while, at the same time, it conspires, quite\nopenly, to change the regime. Without any hesitation, its\nofficials declare that such is its intention. While all this\ntakes place, it is we who are asked to prove our peaceful\nintentions and credibility.\nIt is no secret that the Power that leads the onslaught\nI have spoken of against Iraq is the United States of\nAmerica. All the facts on the ground make it clear that it\nis the United States of America and no one else that\nshould be asked to demonstrate its credibility, to prove\nthat its intentions are peaceful, and to desist from its\ncontinuing acts of provocation, aggression and\ninterference in the internal affairs of Iraq and from\nfomenting tension in the Gulf region under the pretext of\nan illusory threat.\n10\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\n\nPresident Saddam Hussein noted that the American\nadministration\u2019s accusation that Iraq lacks credibility in its\nrelationship with the Special Commission is a false one,\nand that it is the United States that does not have credibility\nin dealing with States and international organizations.\nWhere is the credibility in the position of the United States\nwhen it declares its determination not to lift the sanctions\nagainst Iraq even if Iraq implements Security Council\nresolution 687 (1991), of which the United States was the\nchief author? Again, where is the credibility in the position\nof the United States when the American administration\nmasses its naval and military forces in the Gulf and in the\nMediterranean under the false pretext that Iraq is planning\nto attack Jordan, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia?\nI do not wish to enter into polemics with the\nrepresentatives of the United States in the General\nAssembly. But I find it necessary, with regard to the\nAmerican allegations about credibility, to raise certain\npoints of principle which call for serious thought and\ncontemplation. Before I do that, I should like to ask this\nquestion: if it is important that the implementation of the\nresolutions of the Security Council should be founded on\ncredibility, then how can allegations about the credibility of\nIraq be accepted at a time when the State which repeats\nthose allegations puts itself above the Security Council and\nabove the Charter and gives itself the right to interpret\nUnited Nations resolutions and to arbitrarily draw\nconclusions from such interpretations that agree with its\nown selfish interests which are far removed from any basis\nto be found in the provisions of the resolutions themselves?\nWhile on the subject of credibility, where are the\nefforts of the Security Council, and the United States in\nparticular, with regard to the implementation of paragraph\n14 of Security Council resolution 687 (1991), which aims\nat declaring the Middle East as a zone free from weapons\nof mass destruction? This is an objective that has to be a\nfundamental cornerstone of the edifice of peace, security\nand stability in the region if such an edifice is to be built\non sturdy, well-balanced and equitable foundations. It is an\nobjective that acquires great importance from the standpoint\nof the oft-mentioned credibility, since it is a known fact\nthat Israel possesses those weapons. Why does the United\nStates keep completely silent about paragraph 14, and why\nhas the Security Council not taken any action towards the\nimplementation of that part of its resolution? Does such a\nblatant double standard have anything to do with\ncredibility?\nIs it objective or even fair to imagine that the\nobligations stipulated in Security Council resolutions could\nbe implemented in a natural fashion in the context of such\ncircumstances, atmospherics, and hostile policies directed\nagainst Iraq?\nIraq is well aware of the fact that it is not in its\ninterest to conceal any information relating to past\nweapons programmes, and that its interest lies in working\nto lift as soon as possible the sanctions that are imposed\non it. Indeed, Iraq is acting in full conformity with this\nobjective. In this connection, we call upon member States\nof the Security Council not to jump to any conclusions on\nthe basis of any unjust accusations levelled at Iraq,\nbecause the right thing to do would be to wait for the\noutcome of the work of the Special Commission, which\nis responsible for evaluating the implementation by Iraq\nof the Council\u2019s resolutions concerning the proscribed\nweapons.\nWe do not call for anything more than the legally\nsound application of Security Council resolutions in\nconsonance with the purposes and principles of the\nCharter, and not in line with the whims and aims of\nunilateral policies of a certain State, which are founded\non the logic of naked power, opportunism, double\nstandards and the imposition of hegemony.\nWe believe that there is a collective duty to work\njointly with firmness in order to put things in the right\nperspective in order to ensure the sound application of the\nprovisions of the Charter. The first step in this direction\nrequires us to ponder the philosophy of the sanctions as\ncreated by the Charter. Is the sanctions regime a means\ntowards an end, or is it an end in itself? What is the\nnature of the said regime? Is it punitive, or is it a means\nwhereby the purposes of the Charter should be achieved\nwithout reference to the individual policies of individual\nMember States?\nIt is well known to all that the sanctions regime\ncreated by the Charter is nothing more than a means\naimed at achieving certain results which would ultimately\nlead to the realization of the purposes and principles of\nthe United Nations as elaborated in Articles 1 and 2 of\nthe Charter, and that the means should cease to be applied\nonce the end has been achieved.\nThe competence of the Security Council to impose\nsanctions is an exceptional means that is used when it is\nestablished, objectively, that all other means of peaceful\nsettlement of disputes have failed. Such a means should\nnot be, however, a tool in the hands of a super-Power or\nof a group of major Powers to achieve foreign policy\n11\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\n\ngoals at the expense of the common interest of Member\nStates.\nIt is now patently clear that the imposition of sanctions\non Iraq and the maintenance of the embargo against it, in\nthe well-known fashion, cannot be justified on the\nsubstantive basis of the provisions of the Charter, because\nit has become, in actual fact, an extension of the unilateral\npolicy of a super-Power that has made sanctions an end in\nthemselves and a vindictive means that serves its own\ninterests in the region.\nIn essence, the grounds for the imposition of sanctions\non Iraq no longer exist and, thus, the sanctions should be\nlifted. But a well-known State obstructs the process.\nWe should like to say to the United States that the\nsolution lies in dialogue, which provides a mechanism for\nthe achievement of interests on a balanced and equitable\nbasis. This is what Iraq has called for and continues to call\nfor. The policy of hegemony and of creating crises cannot\nbut fail, because it is illegitimate and because the\ninternational community rejects it. While this continues to\nbe our position of principle, we unfortunately find that the\nUnited States statesmen ignore the realities of the region\nand the needs and aspirations of its peoples, who yearn to\nlive in stability, peace and fruitful cooperation amongst\nthemselves and with the world as a whole.\nAt a time when we witness the tensions and internal\nconflicts that prevail in the states of the region, and the\nfeelings of bitterness amongst their peoples as a result of\nthe current short-sighted policies, which recall to mind the\npolicies of the old imperialist Powers, we in Iraq should\nlike, from this rostrum, to call for the promotion of\nrelations of dialogue, understanding and good\nneighbourliness amongst the States of the region, on the\nbasis of mutual respect, in accordance with the principles\nof the Charter of the United Nations.\nIraq is an ancient country with a very long history that\ngoes back 7,000 years. The Iraqi people, who have\ncontributed greatly to human civilization, will remain in\ncontrol of their affairs, independent in their choices and\ncapable of overcoming crises.\nWe hope that Member States, especially the permanent\nmembers of the Security Council, will make every effort to\ninterpret and apply the provisions of the resolutions of the\nSecurity Council in accordance with their normal legal\nmeaning and not on the basis of whims and the political\ninterests of this or that State. Any course of action that\ndeviates from this principled rule would lead only to loss\nof credibility and utterly undermine the principle of good\nfaith in the determination of international obligations.\nThe United Nations was established in order to\nachieve the common goals of preserving peace, security\nand stability in the world. The provisions of the\nOrganization\u2019s Charter, in letter and in spirit, are founded\non the balancing of rights and duties and aim at\nprotecting the common interests of the international\ncommunity. Therefore policies that are based on the logic\nof naked power and unilateral action outside the concepts\nof the Charter, and that aim at achieving individual\nobjectives, are bound to contradict the very raison d\u2019\u00eatre\nof the Organization and to contravene the letter and spirit\nof its Charter. Such policies would only lead to the\nmarginalization of the Organization\u2019s role in international\naffairs.\nIt behoves us as we are about to celebrate half a\ncentury of the existence of the Organization to rededicate\nourselves to honouring our undertakings as enshrined in\nthe Charter.\n"

        "file_text": "It is with great pleasure that\nI congratulate you, Sir, on your election as President of\nthe fiftieth session of the General Assembly. You bring to\nthe Assembly the wealth of your personal, political and\nacademic experience and the positive contribution which\nPortugal has given to the work of the Organization\nthroughout its 40 years of membership. At the dawn of\ndemocracy in your country, yours was a determining\ncontribution towards freedom based on fundamental\nhuman rights and a State built on the rule of law. Your\ncommitment to these principles required no mean measure\nof moral and physical courage.\nMay I join other speakers in saluting the Foreign\nMinister of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Mr. Amara Essy, who skilfully\nled the forty-ninth session and continued to promote the\nrevitalization of the General Assembly within a broader\nframework of strengthening the United Nations system.\nIt is with great pleasure that we are convinced that,\nunder your able leadership, Mr. President, Member States\nwill continue to strive to ensure that this Assembly\nreflects with immediacy and with clarity that which the\nworld community desires of the United Nations.\nThe maintenance of international peace through the\nadvancement of social progress and better standards of\nlife in larger freedom for all was 50 years ago, and\nremains today, the onerous but vital mission entrusted to\nthis Organization by the peoples of the United Nations. In\nlooking back at the past 50 years, we must exercise\nrealistic restraint. It would be a mistake to recall only\nthose instances when our efforts were crowned with\nsuccess. It would be equally erroneous if we were to\njudge the efficacy of the United Nations by highlighting\nonly those complex instances when results failed to do\njustice to our collective will and endeavour.\nThe determination to save succeeding generations\nfrom the scourge of war was what inspired nations and\nbrought them together to form this Organization towards\nthe end of the Second World War. We have managed to\n20\n\n\navoid a global conflict. This is in itself a great achievement,\none that inspires hope and confidence. Yet realistic restraint\nis particularly called for at this moment. Grief still echoes\nover the explosions of cannon fire aimed at villages and\ncities under siege.\nDuring its first 45 years the United Nations was held\nhostage to the prevailing cold war logic. Yet even during\nthose years, when world peace was strapped to the\nterrifying balance of nuclear destructive potential, there\nwere moments of great significance.\nThe process of decolonization, even if there was\nsuffering at times, remains a peak achievement in\nhumankind\u2019s history during the twentieth century. It\nreaffirmed faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity\nand worth of the human person and in the equal rights of\nmen and women and of nations large and small. That\nprocess paved the way for the achievement of independence\nby peoples spread around the globe, who today are\nrepresented in this Hall as sovereign nations.\nThe five years since the end of the cold war have\nwitnessed a world community subjected to the most intense\nperiods of instability. High expectations violently oscillated\nwith the doldrums of despair; the exuberant relief of\npeoples ridding themselves of totalitarian rule alternated\nwith the miserable anguish of occupation and \u201cethnic\ncleansing\u201d; rays of hope were paralleled by violent\nexplosions of civil strife; nuclear non-proliferation was\ncountered by a devastating spread in the traffic in\nconventional weaponry; peace for some was matched by\nwanton slaughter for others. Never have mankind\u2019s\naspirations been so great, yet never have they been so\nformidably challenged.\nSuch events cannot but impact on our concept of\nsecurity. The primary mandate of the United Nations is\n\u201cTo maintain international peace ..., and to that\nend: to take effective collective measures for the\nprevention and removal of threats to the peace\u201d.\nHow can we ensure and implement this commission?\nFive years ago, in the General Assembly, I had the\nhonour of calling on the United Nations to implement the\nprovisions of Chapter VIII of the Charter with regard to\nregional arrangements. Later, at the Helsinki follow-up\nmeeting of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in\nEurope (CSCE), Malta proposed that the CSCE declare\nitself a regional arrangement, in terms of Chapter VIII of\nthe United Nations Charter \u2014 which it did.\nIt is still too early to assess the impact and full\npotential of that development, particularly in view of the\ncomplex situations that already existed and continued to\ndevelop in the CSCE region. However, we are convinced\nthat the future ability and effectiveness of the United\nNations in containing, addressing and resolving situations\nof conflict is dependent on the creation and consolidation\nof such regional arrangements.\nThe world has witnessed communities rediscover the\noldest recipes for the generation of human misery. Most\nof us believed that tolerance was universally embraced,\nthat it was strong enough to have imbued the manner in\nwhich we view elements that give nations and ethnic and\nreligious groups their rightful identity. The abuse of these\nelements as a platform and weapon of war cannot but\ninstil in us determination to consolidate structures that\npromote a permanent confidence-building dialogue.\nDuring the darkest hours of the cold war the CSCE\nlearnt that confidence-building was the most effective\nguarantee in the promotion of a wider concept of security.\nThat conviction remains as we seek to identify the\nsupporting structures for a European security architecture.\nThe broad elements of the emerging European security\narchitecture are already in place.\nOn one hand, the CSCE, now changed into the\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe\n(OSCE), is transmuting the notion of confidence- and\nsecurity-building from a remedial measure of the age of\nantagonism to a tool of partnership in the new\ninternational environment.\nOn the other hand, the enlarging European Union, of\nwhich Malta expects to become full member in the near\nfuture, provides a unique and ever-deepening dimension\nof the process of regional cooperation. Malta has always\nseen membership of the European Union in terms that\nencompass not only economic but also much broader\npolitical dimensions. In this spirit, membership of the\nUnion constitutes for us both the natural culmination of\nour significant economic and social development of recent\nyears and \u2014 more important \u2014 the opportunity to\nparticipate in a collective endeavour that consolidates\nunion within Europe and stability within the region,\nthereby providing a solid anchorage for those fundamental\nvalues of democracy, the rule of law and the observance\nof human rights to which we are deeply attached.\n21\n\n\nComprehensive security is distinct from notions of\ndefence. It is much wider in scope. It is more appropriate\nfor treating issues not necessarily or immediately linked\nwith a military threat or outbreak of conflict.\nComprehensive regional security structures could be the\nmost effective instruments for identifying, analysing and\ncontaining the original root causes of potential conflict.\nSuch regional arrangements cannot operate in\nisolation. They must take into account the work of other\ninternational mechanisms that help signal developments\nwhich, in the short or long term, could destabilize regional\nor international security. Early-warning systems are an\nessential ingredient for success.\nTo save succeeding generations from the scourge of\nwar we must cultivate and nurture stability. Equilibrium in\nthe socio-political environment cannot be ensured through\nsuppression or imposition. It requires the development of\neffective rapid-response mechanisms to tackle problem\nareas that generate instability. A multifaceted approach\ndemonstrates an awareness of the manner in which different\nissues, if left unattended or unresolved, fester and spread to\nthreaten society.\nWeaving such vital areas as human rights, fundamental\nfreedoms and social justice into the broader network of\ncomprehensive security is the foundation for the launching\nof stability pacts which give peoples and nations the\nreassurance of peace, dignity and freedom.\nIn this respect Malta has been active in promoting\nsecurity and cooperation in the Mediterranean. The\nobstacles are enormous, but the perils that threaten to\ntransform this historic middle-sea into a permanent lake of\ninstability are even greater.\nThough aware of the difficulties in the way of its final\nimplementation, we have supported the idea of a conference\non security and cooperation in the Mediterranean, and\nwithin this concept of stability in the Mediterranean we\nhave ourselves proposed two distinct but correlated ideas,\nnamely, that of a council of the Mediterranean and a\nstability pact for the Mediterranean. Both are based on the\nnotion of dialogue in that region of turbulence.\nThe setting up of a council of the Mediterranean\nthrough an association of Mediterranean States at the level\nof Ministers of Foreign Affairs would facilitate cooperation\nat the highest political level. A parliamentary dimension to\nthat association further enhances this joint action and\nensures a wider spectrum of participation by the elected\nrepresentatives in the identification and solution of\nproblem areas of common concern.\nThe measured success of the Stability Pact for\nEurope, first launched by France, has underlined the need\nfor applying this notion to the Mediterranean region itself.\nWith this in mind, at the concluding conference on the\nStability Pact for Europe, Malta launched the concept of\na stability pact for the Mediterranean based on the round-\ntable system and not only bringing together parties to\ndisputes but also making possible the discussion of issues\nwhich can serve to pre-empt the development of new\nthreats to the security of peoples and States in the region.\nThe generally positive reception which this notion has\nencountered encourages us to pursue its development\nfurther.\nMalta welcomes the holding of a Euro-\nMediterranean Ministerial Conference at Barcelona in\nNovember to consider future economic and political\nrelations as a milestone in the consolidation of regional\ncooperation. The Mediterranean\u2019s wealth lies in its\nheritage of cultural, religious and social diversity. A\nforced mutation of this rich mosaic into uniformity would\nbe destabilizing. Confidence-building and mutual\nunderstanding create the route that leads to security and\ncooperation. We must walk that arduous path. Within\nmulticultural diversity we must discover the common\nvalues that help foster dialogue. This requires shedding\npreconceived notions. It requires strong political will. It\nrequires that we supplant instinctive mistrust with a spirit\nof mutual respect.\nThe key protagonists in the Middle East crisis have\ndemonstrated how political will and dialogue can\novercome obstacles that for decades appeared\ninsurmountable. We have supported the peace process and\nwill continue to support it, and we welcome the official\nsigning in Washington today of the agreements reached\nlast Sunday in Taba, Egypt, by Chairman Arafat and\nForeign Minister Shimon Peres on behalf of the Palestine\nLiberation Organization (PLO) and Israel, respectively. A\njust and long-lasting peace in the Middle East requires a\nsolution that takes into account both the right of peoples\nto self-determination and the right of States to secure\nboundaries. May this process of dialogue inspire others\nwho still resist this unique human tool of conflict\nresolution.\nIn particular, we are deeply concerned that the\ndivision of Cyprus has so far remained impervious to the\nefforts of the international community, especially those of\n22\n\n\nthe Secretary-General, to find a just and lasting peaceful\nsolution. We predict that persistent efforts in this regard\nwill eventually prevail.\nThe Mediterranean process is of great significance to\nthe fiftieth session of the General Assembly. The time that\nthe United Nations has dedicated over the years to defusing\nand resolving issues which threaten peace in the region\nillustrates the weight which we attach to the spill-over\npotential of current crises. More important, however, is the\nfact that a successful Mediterranean process could inspire\npatterns of cooperation in other areas characterized by\nmulticultural diversity.\nImportant as it is to create forums that make it easier\nfor political leaders to enter into dialogue on and identify\ncommon strategies, the essential ingredient for long-term\nstability, is the building of peace in the minds of all women\nand men. The United Nations and its agencies have had a\nmajor role in the effort to identify common strategies for\nfuture achievements built on knowledge of and respect for\nthe multicultural diversity of the world community.\nDuring the past 12 months three world conferences\nhave touched on the most crucial aspects of human rights\nand freedoms, the dignity of the human person and the right\nof all peoples to development. At Cairo, Copenhagen and\nBeijing we worked together, conscious of our cultural\ndifferences, yet aware that diversity need not and must not\nimpede our common endeavours if we are mindful of our\ncommon heritage, our common concern and our common\ninterest.\nThis respect for multicultural identities has been\nevident in the commitments undertaken by States and in the\nprinciples which inspire the platforms of action. It must\nremain ever-present in the mind of all United Nations\nofficials entrusted with its implementation.\nOne other area in which the United Nations has\ntraditionally been very active is that of arms control and\ndisarmament. Over the past 12 months the international\ncommunity has had the satisfaction of seeing a successful\nconclusion to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\nNuclear Weapons (NPT) Review Conference, with the\nagreement on the indefinite extension of the\nnon-proliferation regime. Malta is proud to have taken an\nactive role in helping to bring about this agreement.\nWe now look forward to an early agreement on the\ncomprehensive ban on the testing of all nuclear weapons.\nWe urge all countries, in particular the nuclear States, to\ntake all possible measures to ensure a successful\nconclusion, during the coming 12 months, of the\nnegotiations which have been taking place within the\nConference on Disarmament since 1994.\nAnniversaries encourage us to drink from the\noriginal source for inspiration. The United Nations\nCharter was forged at a time when the struggle against a\ntotalitarian world vision was nearly complete. The horrors\nof war were still tangible, but so also was the fear of\nwhat could have been the fate of humankind had a\ntotalitarian vision prevailed.\nThe Charter established within its principal organs a\ndelicate balance based on the equal rights of nations, large\nand small, and a pragmatic awareness of the particular\nrole which certain States had in ensuring international\npeace and security.\nDuring the past five years we have assisted in an\nintense discussion among Member States on whether or\nnot there exists the need to evolve, reform or restructure\nthe principal organs of the Charter. I am personally\nhonoured to have been the first President of the General\nAssembly to chair such a discussion within the\nOrganization and to make a presidential motion on this\nmatter approved by the Assembly which ensured\ncontinuity. This process was later to give fruit in the\nformation of the Working Groups which examined the\nrevitalization of the General Assembly and are still\nstudying the different options relative to the restructuring\nof the Security Council.\nIn this ongoing process of review and evaluation, we\nhave failed to take into account the future of the\nTrusteeship Council. Aware that the Trusteeship Council\nhad nearly completed its responsibilities for the Trust\nTerritories for which it was responsible, five years ago I\nproposed to the General Assembly a new, additional\nrole \u2014 that of trustee of the different areas of common\nheritage. It is because of the uncertainty as to the future\nof the Council and the diverse opinions on this matter that\nwe have requested the inclusion of an item on the agenda\nof the General Assembly at its fiftieth session entitled\n\u201cReview of the role of the Trusteeship Council\u201d.\nWe are confident that when the item is discussed by\nthe Assembly \u2014 first in plenary and later within the Sixth\nCommittee \u2014 Member States will bring and share their\nviews with that same openness and frankness that have\ncharacterized the discussion of the other two principal\norgans. Naturally we shall, on that occasion, expound\n23\n\n\nfurther our ideas on how the Trusteeship Council could\nevolve.\nThere is one aspect which I consider it opportune to\nunderline at this stage: the notion of the United Nations as\na trustee. The notion that the Charter envisages is unique to\nthe Trusteeship Council. It is a notion which, at the time,\nwas immediately explicable and applicable to the Territories\nplaced under its care. Today, in a world that has become a\nglobal community, we are aware that the different areas of\ncommon heritage protected by convention require\ncoordination by a trustee.\nTo avoid fragmentation, dispersal or duplication of\neffort in areas which are our common heritage, our\ncommon concern and our common interest, we should\nexplore the manner in which this principal organ of the\nUnited Nations can evolve that notion of trust, which was\nits major premise, to meet our present-day needs, an\nevolution that ensures that the Trusteeship Council holds in\nsacred trust the common heritage of humankind and acts as\na guardian of the interests of future generations.\nDuring the past months we have all invested much\ntime and energy in generating public awareness on the\nimportance of the fiftieth anniversary. The peoples of the\nUnited Nations are sensitive to what we do and decide in\nthis forum, not out of mere curiosity or an interest in\ninternational affairs, but because the decisions we take have\na direct bearing on their personal lives. They did so in the\npast, when decolonization brought sovereignty to States and\nfreedom to many millions. They do so at present, when the\nUnited Nations and its blue insignia represent the last\nbeacon of hope for those terrorized by the brutality of war,\nfamine or disease. Likewise, our decisions have a bearing\non the lives of those who serve the Organization in the\nfield, on the fate of the families of peace-keepers killed in\nUnited Nations operations and all those of whom we expect\nsacrifice to ensure the success of sanctions.\nWe pay a special tribute to all United Nations peace-\nkeepers, and in particular those killed while on mission.\nTheir dedication to duty, humanitarian concern and peace\nis honoured by the whole international community.\nOur deliberations this year have a particular\nsignificance. On them hinge the hopes of millions. As we\ntake decisions, may we continue to be inspired by that\ncommitment to the maintenance of international peace, the\nadvancement of social progress and better standards of life\nin larger freedom for all peoples, which is the platform of\naction set forth in the Charter. Only then will we rightfully\ndeserve to be regarded as trustees of the common\nconcerns, common interests and common heritage which\nthe peoples of the United Nations have charged to our\ncare.\n\n"

        "file_text": "Permit me at the outset warmly to congratulate Mr. Diogo\nFreitas do Amaral of Portugal on his election to the\npresidency of the General Assembly at this session, which\ncoincides with the fiftieth anniversary of the founding of\nthe United Nations. His election to the presidency of this\nimportant session reflects special appreciation for his\nwell-known diplomatic skills. It also reflects his country\u2019s\nrole in and contribution to the international community and\nto consolidating its security and stability in line with the\nprinciples enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations.\nNor can I fail today warmly to thank His Excellency\nMr. Amara Essy for his judicious management of the work\nof the General Assembly during its last session, and for his\ntireless role in restructuring the United Nations and\ndemocratizing its practices.\nSimilarly, I should like to reaffirm my country\u2019s\nappreciation of the role played by the Secretary-General,\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, and of his indefatigable,\ninvaluable work for international peace and security. We\nparticularly commend the Secretary-General\u2019s two reports,\nthe Agendas for Peace and for Development, which\nconstitute central pillars of the new international relations.\nThis session takes place half a century after the\nfounding of the United Nations. It therefore behoves us to\npause for reflection on how the Organization has developed\nover the past five decades, for identifying positive and\nnegative developments over that period and for working\ntowards promoting the positive elements. We must steer the\nOrganization in new directions that would spare us the\nnegative elements which accompanied the progress of the\nOrganization in the past.\nProceeding from this, the Republic of Yemen supports\nthe efforts aimed at developing the Organization\u2019s\nmachineries and principal organs in order for it to be able\nto rise to the challenges of the twenty-first century. My\ncountry, therefore, welcomes the introduction of structural\nreforms, especially with regard to expanding Security\nCouncil membership to reflect more accurately the new\nrealities and recent changes in international relations, while\nobserving the principles of equitable representation and\ngeographical distribution and ensuring transparency in the\nCouncil\u2019s work. My country is confident that these required\nreforms, when introduced, will contribute to the emergence\nof new international relationships that would be\ncharacterized by right, justice and equality.\nThere is no doubt that the international conferences\nthe World has witnessed since the end of the cold war on\nsocial, environmental and women\u2019s issues, have been\nimportant steps taken by the United Nations towards\nshaping a new, integrated system with human\ndevelopment as its goal, in order to develop a new way\nof life, ensure the future of the human race, establish the\nfoundations of equitable and sustainable development and\nwork towards eliminating the spectres of poverty,\nignorance and disease, dangers which continue to threaten\nhundreds of millions of the world\u2019s inhabitants.\nIn this context, my country wishes to express its\nsatisfaction with the work carried out by the Committee\non the Indian Ocean to make that region a zone of peace.\nWe call upon States members of the Security Council,\nmaritime users of the Indian Ocean and littoral countries\nto participate in the work of the Committee in view of the\npositive contribution it is making towards strengthening\npeace, security, stability and cooperation in the region, in\nthe light of General Assembly resolutions 48/82 and\n49/82.\nThere is no doubt that the world at the end of the\ntwentieth century is vastly different from what it was in\nthe past. Many fundamental concepts of peace,\ndevelopment and security are changing, side by side with\nthe developments that are taking place in international\nrelations. In the light of these changes, everyone is\nbecoming increasingly aware that human development\nshould become the focus of the activities of the United\nNations systems with a view to narrowing the gap\nbetween North and South, and to promoting economic and\nsocial integration on the basis of the common interests of\nStates.\nIf any achievement is to be made in this area, we\nwill need to rely upon international economic cooperation\nin facing up to such international problems as mitigating\npoverty and eradicating famine from developing countries,\nespecially the least developed among them. In this\ncontext, my country calls upon the international\ncommunity to commit itself to implementing the\nProgramme of Action for the Least Developed Countries\nfor the 1990s, in accordance with General Assembly\nresolution 45/206 of 1990. My country also welcomes the\nestablishment of the World Trade Organization (WTO),\nand the conclusion of the 1994 GATT agreements, which\naim at enhancing integration, promoting equitable\ncooperation in trade relations and reducing the intensity\nof unfair competition between different societies.\n14\n\n\nThe tragic situation of the people of Bosnia and\nHerzegovina has been the focus of the international\ncommunity\u2019s attention. It has become clear that\ninternational efforts in that region have not succeeded due\nto the absence of a genuine desire to put paid to the horrific\nmassacring of defenceless civilians in the Republic of\nBosnia and Herzegovina by the Bosnian Serbs, in open\ndefiance of the international will. Therefore, my country\nconsiders it imperative that the Security Council should\nhasten to lift the weapons embargo in order for the people\nof Bosnia and Herzegovina to be able to exercise the right\nof self-defence enshrined in Article 51 of the United\nNations Charter. It is not acceptable, in today\u2019s world, that\nwe should stand as spectators under whose eyes a\ntyrannical minority is allowed to impose by force its will\nover the majority\u2019s legitimate rights. While the Republic of\nYemen welcomes the peace efforts that are being deployed\nwith a view to putting an end to the suffering of the\nMuslim people of Bosnia and Herzegovina, it hopes for a\nconcerted international effort to find a just solution, which\nwould guarantee the freedom, sovereignty and territorial\nintegrity of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and\nensure the continued provision of humanitarian assistance.\nThe Middle East has witnessed developments which\ncould represent an historical turning-point in the lives of the\npeoples of the region, and could thereby reduce the\nintensity of hotbeds of tension that threaten international\nsecurity and stability. Special mention should be made of\nthe positive gains made on the Palestinian-Israeli track,\nwhich resulted in the signing in Washington last year of the\nAgreement on the transitional period, and the recent Taba\nAgreement on the expansion of Palestinian autonomy. My\ncountry looks forward to the day when the Palestinian\npeople will enjoy their full rights and establish their State\non their own territory, with Holy Al-Quds as its capital.\nDespite the tangible progress made on the Palestinian and\nJordanian tracks, we stress that just and lasting peace will\nremain contingent upon complete Israeli withdrawal from\nall the occupied Arab territories, particularly the Syrian\nGolan and South Lebanon, in accordance with United\nNations resolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973) and 425 (1978),\nand in line with the principle of land for peace, on the basis\nof which the Madrid conference was held in October 1991.\nThe civil war in Somalia and the tensions in the Horn\nof Africa which have exceeded the bounds of logic and\nreason, have caused serious trouble to the neighbouring\ncountries, and will cause endless social problems. The\nperpetuation of the situation of disruption, confusion and\ninfighting in Somalia is a source of grave concern to us all.\nGiven Yemen\u2019s Arab, regional and humanitarian\nobligations, it has suffered and continues to suffer the\nconsequences of the war in Somalia. We have borne the\nburden of receiving and accommodating tens of thousands\nof refugees, but our ability to continue to do so will\ndepend on whether or not the concerted efforts of the\ninternational community and the international and regional\norganizations will put an end to the suffering of the\nSomali people and stop the infighting between the\nwarring factions. A solution to this tragic situation must\nbe found and what has been destroyed by the war must be\nrebuilt, in order for the Somali people to resume a normal\nway of life.\n\nWhile my country affirms that Iraq should complete\nimplementation of the relevant Security Council\nresolutions, and cooperate fully with the International\nCommittee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to clear up the\nproblem of missing persons and prisoners, it reiterates\nthat Iraq\u2019s unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity\nshould not be infringed and that there should not be any\ninterference in its internal affairs under any pretext.\nYemen also repeats its call for the lifting of the economic\nsanctions against Iraq, in order to mitigate the suffering\nof the Iraqi people. This should be done without any\ndevious interpretations of the resolutions of international\nlegality and without the imposition of any new conditions\nrelating to the nature of the political system, as this is a\npurely Iraqi matter that should be decided only the Iraqi\npeople themselves. The Republic of Yemen wishes to\nexpress its satisfaction with the declaration made by Iraq\nto the Security Council, and made during the\nOrganization\u2019s Envoy\u2019s recent visits to Iraq, that Iraq is\nprepared to cooperate with the international inspection\nteam.\nThe Republic of Yemen urges the international\ncommunity and the Security Council to push for an end\nto the air blockade and other measures imposed against\nLibya, in response to the resolutions and decisions of the\nregional Organization in relation to the dispute, and in\nresponse to the positive initiatives calling for dialogue and\nnegotiations.\nThe Republic of Yemen also renews its appeal to its\nbrethren in the Islamic Republic of Iran and the United\nArab Emirates to reach a peaceful settlement to the\nproblem of the three islands \u2014 Greater Tunb, Lesser\nTunb and Abu Moussa \u2014 in accordance with the Charter\nof the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC), the\n15\n\n\nprinciple of good-neighbourliness and the precepts and\nprinciples of international law.\nThe continued acquisition by the world of weapons of\nmass destruction, endangers international security and\nstability and obstructs the search for solutions to the\nproblems of development. Disarmament and the channelling\nof a portion of military expenditure to development must be\nas fundamental steps towards the consolidation of\ninternational security and stability.\nPeace and development are two concomitant essentials\nfor the life of man and should lie at the heart of United\nNations future activities at the threshold of the twenty-first\ncentury.\nIn this context, my country commends the\nachievements of the Review and Extension Conference of\nthe Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\nNuclear Weapons in April 1995. However, the success of\nthe resolutions adopted by this Conference will depend on\nthe extent of commitment by all States to the contents of\nthose resolutions, the affirmation of the universal dimension\nof the treaty and its full, not its limited implementation on\nthe regional level, particularly in the Middle East. That will\nstrengthen the legal force of the Treaty, and create the\nappropriate climate for the functioning of the institutions\nand mechanisms which will play a principal and important\nrole in the process of its implementation.\nThe Republic of Yemen, having achieved reunification\non 22 May 1990, and having firmly consolidated the\nfoundations of this unity through the triumph of our people\nover the separatist conspiracy on 7 July 1994, is now\nengaged in strengthening its democratic approach of\npolitical pluralism, respect for human rights and freedom of\nthe press. Yemen is also engaged in effecting economic\nreforms that would enable it to achieve the qualitative\ntransformations required by Yemeni Society in the\neconomic life of the country, such as restructuring the\nnational economy. This will make Yemen a force for peace\nand stability in the region, and enable it to contribute more\neffectively to the maintenance of international security and\nstability.\nAs Yemen is one of the least developed countries, and\nin view of the damage done to its national economy by the\nseparatist attempt, we hope that the international community\nwill increase its support and assistance, in order to enable\nus to rebuild our social and economic structures and rid\nourselves of the effects of the failed attempt.\nIn the context of our foreign policy approach of\ndialogue and the settlement of problems by peaceful\nmeans, my country has resolved its border question with\nthe fraternal Sultanate of Oman, and is in the process,\nwith the same degree of sincerity and seriousness, of\nseeking a settlement to the border problem with the\nfraternal Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, through the work of\njoint committees, on the basis of the principles contained\nin the Memorandum of Understanding signed in Holy\nMecca on 26 February 1995.\nThe Republic of Yemen, as a member of the\ninternational community, has always performed and will\ncontinue to perform its humanitarian role in the\nframework of the United Nations. It will spare no effort\nin effectively participating with the international\ncommunity in working for the maintenance of\ninternational peace and security. Let us then make this\nsession a new point of departure, towards the renewal of\nthe concepts of inter-State relations, and towards making\nour Organization a universal arbiter.\n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of the Government\nand the people of Jamaica, I congratulate Mr. Diogo Freitas\ndo Amaral on his election to the presidency of the fiftieth\nsession of the General Assembly. As a distinguished\nrepresentative of Portugal, we are assured that he will be\nable to bring his undoubted skills to the affairs of this body\nat this important juncture in the life of the United Nations.\nAllow me also to express my appreciation to his\ndistinguished predecessor, Foreign Minister Amara Essy of\nC\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, for his very valuable contribution to the work\nof the forty-ninth session.\nI also wish to take this opportunity to extend a\nwelcome to the Republic of Palau, which was admitted to\nthe United Nations on 15 December 1994.\nLet me, on behalf of the Government and the people\nof Jamaica, express our sympathy to the peoples of our\nsister countries in the Caribbean who recently experienced\nthe ravages of devastating hurricanes. Most of these small\nislands suffered extensive damage to infrastructure and to\ntheir agriculture and tourism industries. Their task of\nreconstruction will require immediate assistance and\nsupport from the international community. I appeal to all\ngathered here to provide the required support to these\nCaribbean partners.\nOur general debate this year coincides with the\ncelebration of the fiftieth anniversary of the United\nNations. This historic occasion affords us the opportunity\nto reflect on the work and value of the Organization and\nto chart the way forward into the twenty-first century.\nThe establishment of the United Nations 50 years\nago irrevocably changed the course of world history. With\nits founding, a new framework for international relations\nwas created. Throughout the last five decades, the world\nbody, buffeted as it has been by the vagaries of an\nunpredictable and often tense international environment,\nhas achieved remarkable successes in a wide variety of\nfields, and in many ways and for many millions of people\naround the world it remains the greatest repository of\nhope, and the only viable option for ensuring international\npeace, security and development.\nToday we still inhabit an imperfect world where\npoverty, social and economic inequality between and\nwithin States, hunger, disease and environmental\n\n\ndegradation remain critical issues. Global solutions must be\nfound to what are inevitably global problems. At last we all\nnow agree that the major problems confronting our world\nare transnational in nature.\nAddressing these challenges is a daunting task.\nHowever, whereas less than a decade ago the cold-war\nideological divide hindered our ability to address them,\ntoday we are in a much more favourable position to do so.\nToday there is greater willingness and capacity to make\ncommon cause on a number of issues.\nThe priority task of our time is to eliminate the\nfundamental causes of instability and conflict in the global\ncommunity, a situation rooted in the social and economic\nconditions affecting the greater part of mankind. As we\nmove into the next century, our commitment to achieving\ndevelopment in all its aspects must be our priority\nobjective. In this regard, Jamaica continues to attach great\nimportance to the work of the United Nations in advancing\nthe Agenda for Development. We believe it provides the\nrudiments for constructing a sustained development\nstrategy. It is our hope that this historic session of the\nGeneral Assembly will recognize the importance of the\nAgenda and give the mandate for its implementation.\nThe Secretary-General has outlined five dimensions\nwhich provide the foundation for action to achieve\nsustainable development. These are: peace, the economy,\nenvironmental protection, social justice and democracy.\nIt is important that we accept these concepts as\nmutually reinforcing and interdependent. Development is\nnot possible in the absence of peace and stability.\nConversely, the absence of broad-based development and\nthe lack of opportunity to participate in the benefits of\nmaterial progress constitute a threat to peace and stability.\nEconomic growth is necessary for development. As the\nSecretary-General points out in his report,\n\u201cNew development approaches should not only\ngenerate economic growth, they should make its\nbenefits equitably available. They should enable\npeople to participate in decisions affecting their lives.\u201d\n(A/49/665, para. 5)\nFor sustainable development to be maintained it must\nbe people-oriented in its objective, scope and focus. It\nneeds an environment that gives priority to the promotion\nof social well-being, integration and advancement; an\nenvironment where there is emphasis on the eradication of\npoverty, on the enhancement of health and education and\non productive employment for all.\nThat is why it is vital that we honour the\ncommitments agreed at major international conferences\nand integrate them into a common framework for\ndevelopment. The declarations and work programmes of\nconferences, beginning with the World Summit for\nChildren in 1990, up to and including the recent Fourth\nWorld Conference on Women, provide the basis for\nforging a global consensus on new approaches to social\nand economic development. The United Nations\nConference on Human Settlements (Habitat II), to be held\nnext year, will further add to the global consensus.\nIt is in this context that I refer specifically to the\nWorld Summit for Social Development, one of the two\nmajor global conferences held this year. That Summit\nprovided a forum for discussion and commitment to\naction on issues of poverty, unemployment and social\ndisintegration. In Copenhagen world leaders recognized\nthe central and pervasive theme of poverty and its\nimpediment to social integration. The Copenhagen\nDeclaration and Programme of Action contain universal\ncommitments: a commitment to create a national and\ninternational environment conducive to the eradication of\npoverty; a commitment to enhance productive\nemployment; a commitment to promote social\ndevelopment and foster social integration. All these\nactions would be taken in a framework of sustainable\neconomic growth and development.\nNot only does the Declaration and Programme of\nAction contain commitments to accelerate economic,\nsocial and human resource development: it also\nspecifically sets targets for addressing the seemingly\nintractable problems facing developing countries. The\ncritical issue is one of resources. It is a daunting\nchallenge.\nAs part of national policy and consistent with the\ncontent of the Declaration and Programme of Action,\nJamaica has already committed itself to the alleviation of\npoverty as a matter of priority.\nPermit me to refer to the other important conference\nheld this year, the Fourth World Conference on Women,\nwhich was recently concluded in Beijing. Out of that\nConference emanated a comprehensive Platform for\nAction aimed at fostering greater empowerment of women\nand bringing them fully into the development process.\n2\n\n\nWe recognize that Governments have the main\nresponsibility for undertaking the commitments agreed at\nthese conferences. However, to achieve these goals national\nefforts must be complemented by effective international\ncooperation. We therefore join others in urging the\ninternational community to collectively fulfil the\ncommitments by channelling substantial new and additional\nfinancial and technical resources to developing countries. It\nis this mobilization of adequate financial resources for\ndevelopment purposes that will determine whether the\npoorest countries in the world remain excluded from the\nprogress enjoyed by others.\nThe positive trends in world economic growth cannot\nmask the dichotomy which persists in the international\neconomy. The efforts by developing countries to implement\nsound macroeconomic policies and structural adjustment\nprogrammes continue to be affected by adverse external\neconomic conditions characterized by protectionism in\ngoods-and-service trade, continuing decline in official\ndevelopment assistance (ODA), volatile financial flows and\nexchange-rate instability, and constraints in access to\ntechnology.\nAll this is convincing evidence that in the increasingly\nglobalized environment it is imperative that we give greater\nweight to the whole process of coordination of international\neconomic policy. Institutions such as the International\nMonetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank should further\nimprove their processes to take into account the critical\nneeds and peculiar circumstances of developing countries.\nThis process could be improved further through better\nconsultations between the Group of 77, the Group of 15\nand the Group of 7.\nMany developing countries have at great cost\nundertaken reforms in policy and regulatory framework\nresulting in the creation of a private-sector-led, market-\ndriven economy. These efforts will be rendered meaningless\nwithout the existence of a favourable international economic\nenvironment. In its absence, efforts to build self-sustaining\neconomies will be frustrated.\nWith the completion of the Uruguay Round and the\nestablishment of the World Trade Organization (WTO) the\nstage is set for a more open multilateral trading system. In\nconfronting this new and complex trade regime developing\ncountries require production and marketing assistance to\ngain the potential benefits from the new market\nopportunities.\nIt is therefore crucial that a degree of flexibility be\ngiven to developing countries to enhance our full\nparticipation in the multilateral trading system.\nRecent developments and institutional changes,\nincluding the establishment of the World Trade\nOrganization, reinforce the need for institutions such as\nthe United Nations Conference on Trade and\nDevelopment as a policy-oriented trade forum with a\nstrong development perspective. We should not fail to\nreflect on the valuable role that has been played by\nUNCTAD, as well as by the United Nations Industrial\nDevelopment Organization. Every effort should be made\nto preserve those organizations. They were designed to\nserve the development objectives of the developing\ncountries. They are not above change. They have shown\ntheir capacity to adapt to the new environment and to\ndevelop concepts and programmes relevant to the present\nneeds of the developing countries. We are therefore\nopposed to any attempt to undermine the contributions of\nthose bodies to the development objectives within the\ninternational system.\nIn our own region steps are being taken to improve\nthe conditions that will foster proper trading relations\namong our countries, thereby enhancing the productivity\nof our economies. The Convention establishing the\nAssociation of Caribbean States has now entered into\nforce. The new grouping of 25 States plus associate\nmembers represents a strong and viable economic base\nfrom which to seize the opportunities offered by the new\ninternational economic environment.\nIn this regard we continue to assert the need for the\ninclusion of all countries in the region in the integration\nprocess. To this end, we reiterate our concern at attempts\nfurther to complicate regional-trading arrangements\nthrough national legislation that has an overwhelming\nextra-territorial character.\nIf I have devoted a substantial portion of my\nstatement to issues of development and international\neconomic and trade policy, it is because Jamaica would\nlike to emphasize the fundamental importance of\neconomic and social development to the attainment of\npeace and security. We welcome the fact that the\nSecretary-General\u2019s Agenda for Development has rightly\nbeen acknowledged as an essential complement to \u201cAn\nAgenda for Peace\u201d. We remain committed to a continuing\nrole for the United Nations in the area of peace-keeping.\n3\n\n\nThe current regional and civil conflicts being waged\nagainst the backdrop of ethnic and religious antagonism\ndemand that greater emphasis be placed on preventive\ndiplomacy in order to diffuse tensions before they escalate\ninto the violence and bloodshed that we have witnessed in\nthe Balkans and in Central Africa. We must design\nmechanisms to deal with problems in their early stages and\nthus prevent the situation whereby the international\ncommunity finds itself expending more and more resources\nto deal with an ever-worsening situation. In this regard,\nurgent action to achieve a rapid-deployment capability\nshould be considered.\nIn Bosnia and Herzegovina the world has been witness\nto the tragedy of the forcible dismantling of a multi-ethnic\nand multireligious society. The situation has been a difficult\none for the United Nations. It is vital that all efforts be\nmade to bring an end to the fighting, and we hope that the\nmost recent attempts to reach a negotiated settlement will\nlead to a lasting and comprehensive solution. I wish at this\npoint to express on behalf of the Government of Jamaica\nour profound regret at the almost- daily loss of life. Our\nsympathies go to the families of United Nations peace-\nkeepers as well as to the families of the three American\ndiplomats who were engaged in brokering a settlement to\nthe conflict.\nWe are no less concerned and distressed by the\nsituation in Rwanda and Burundi. We continue to urge the\nfactions to pursue national reconciliation leading towards\nthe economic rehabilitation and reconstruction of their\ncountries.\nIn our own region, we can be justifiably proud of the\nrole of the United Nations in restoring the democratically\nelected President of Haiti, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, to the\nleadership of his nation. This was a critical element in the\ncomplex diplomatic effort to achieve a solution to the crisis\nin our sister country. Jamaica joined other countries in the\nCaribbean Community in contributing to the multinational\nforce in Haiti and subsequently to the United Nations\nMission in Haiti. The people of Haiti are now on the path\nto building democracy. Haiti\u2019s success in its efforts to\nrebuild the economy of the country depends in no small\nmeasure on the continued attention of the entire\ninternational community.\nThe success of the United Nations in Haiti leads us to\nreflect on the often-overlooked achievements of the\nOrganization in providing much-needed humanitarian\nassistance in situations of conflict.\nThere are a number of outstanding political issues on\nthe Assembly\u2019s agenda that require resolution, among\nthem the situation in the Middle East. We welcome the\nefforts of the parties to continue the peace process in a\nspirit of reconciliation in order to achieve a\ncomprehensive, just and lasting peace. We hope that the\nsame spirit of reconciliation will prevail in negotiations to\nresolve other long-outstanding issues, including that of the\nsituation in Cyprus.\nI wish to refer to a matter which we consider one of\nglobal concern. Four months ago, the Review and\nExtension Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) concluded\nwith a majority of States agreeing that the Treaty should\nbe extended indefinitely. Like other non-nuclear-weapon\nStates, we supported the indefinite extension on the basis\nof the declared intention of nuclear Powers to exercise\nrestraint in relation to vertical proliferation and nuclear\ndisarmament. In this sense, we view with great\ndisappointment and as a serious blow to the non-\nproliferation regime the recent decisions by some nuclear-\nweapon States to resume nuclear testing. Jamaica is\nopposed to the proliferation of weapons and wishes to\nreiterate the need for the completion of a comprehensive\nnuclear-test-ban treaty. In the meantime, we urge nuclear-\nweapon States to respect the moratorium on nuclear\ntesting.\nThe progressive development of international law\nhas been a fundamental objective of the United Nations.\nThe entry into force of the United Nations Convention on\nthe Law of the Sea and the inauguration of the\nInternational Seabed Authority in Kingston, Jamaica, in\nNovember last year, represent a major achievement in the\ncreation of a legal order for the management of the seas\nand oceans as the common heritage of mankind. We urge\nuniversal acceptance of the Convention. Jamaica being the\nhost of the Seabed Authority, I can assure the Assembly\nof its steadfast commitment to provide the enabling\nenvironment to ensure that the objectives of the\nConvention are met.\nThe establishment of the International Seabed\nAuthority represents the commitment of States parties to\nhave this new international regime operational in the\nshortest possible time. We are all very disappointed that\nthe first session was concluded without the requisite\nadministrative arrangements in place for commencement\nof the substantive work of the Authority. I take this\nimportant occasion to urge that States parties address the\n4\n\n\noutstanding issues with the same commitment that was\nevident in securing the acceptance of the Convention.\nWe believe the United Nations is now positioned to\nachieve the objectives of the Charter and to play an active,\ndynamic and catalytic role in maintaining international\npeace and security and promoting economic cooperation.\nNow, more than ever before, there is a real possibility for\nus to take decisive and universal action to fulfil the\npurposes for which the Organization was created. We must\ntake advantage of this opportunity. We are conscious of\nheightened expectations. For these reasons, the restructuring\nand revitalization of the United Nations system must be\nvigorously pursued. We are confident that a reformed and\nstrengthened Organization will be able to undertake the\ntwin tasks of promoting peace and assisting the\ndevelopment process of all members of the international\ncommunity.\nIn the Secretary-General\u2019s annual report to the General\nAssembly this year, he has emphasized, in the context of\nreforming the United Nations, that\n\u201cA crucial component of that larger reform\nprocess should be the achievement of a more dynamic\nrelationship among the main intergovernmental\norgans \u2014 the General Assembly, the Security Council\nand the Economic and Social Council.\u201d (A/50/1, para.\n20)\nThis is a point of view which I share. Jamaica firmly\nbelieves that the General Assembly should be allowed to\nfulfil its role as the Organization\u2019s highest deliberative and\ndecision-making body. We also believe that the role of the\nEconomic and Social Council should be strengthened.\nIt is relevant also to underscore the fact that the\nUnited Nations was conceived in an entirely different era.\nToday, with all the changes which have taken place in the\npast 50 years, it is indefensible that the same five\npermanent members of the Security Council can exercise\nthe same control as they did when they assumed that right\nafter the Second World War. For this and other valid\nreasons, Jamaica supports the call for the expansion of the\nSecurity Council, including its permanent membership, on\nan equitable geographical basis.\nNumerous initiatives have been undertaken by Member\nStates, independent groups and individuals on ways to\nimprove the functioning of the Organization. It is now time\nfor the seminal ideas generated by these initiatives to be\ndistilled into a comprehensive framework for designing the\nnew structure of the United Nations. In this regard,\nJamaica will participate fully in the High-level Open-\nended Working Group of the General Assembly, recently\nestablished to undertake a thorough review of the studies\nand reports relating to the revitalization and reform of the\nUnited Nations.\nThe agenda for this fiftieth session is indeed a\nchallenging one. Our goal is to ensure that the\nOrganization is well placed to discharge its\nresponsibilities effectively. There is enough evidence of\na disposition to do this, and this gives us hope. As\ncustodians of the future, let us therefore strive to make\nthis a more peaceful, just and prosperous world.\n"

        "file_text": "At the outset, allow me to express my best\nwishes to you, Sir, and to congratulate you on your\nelection. I assure you of Paraguay\u2019s most complete\ncooperation.\nI also wish to express my appreciation and gratitude\nto Ambassador Amara Essy of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire for the way\nin which he guided the work of the General Assembly at\nthe last session.\nAt the same time I am pleased to convey to the\nSecretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the\ncongratulations that I bring on behalf of the Government\nand people of Paraguay for the commendable efforts that\nhave been made. I wish to express once again, on behalf\nof Paraguay and the President of the Republic, Juan\nCarlos Wasmosy, our full support for the United Nations,\nof which Paraguay was one of the founders.\nWe are living in an exceptional year, an important\none, marking the first 50 years of the United Nations.\nI myself was one of the fortunate witnesses of the\nbirth of the Organization after the Second World War.\nLife then led me to work for 25 years as a staff member\nwithin the structure that was created. I believe that the\nUnited Nations has essentially fulfilled the aspirations\nplaced in it for peace, security, efforts to establish a more\nequitable international legal order, and the commitment to\ndevelopment for all the peoples of the world.\nUndoubtedly, we must admit that in spite of the\nefforts made, we cannot say that we have been as\n10\n\n\nsuccessful as we would have wished in the sphere of\npolitical achievements.\nOn the contrary, in the economic and social fields, in\nwhich the Secretary-General and the different agencies of\nthe United Nations system can take their own decisions,\nthere is an immense wealth of great achievements, some of\nwhich are truly extraordinary. By way of example we\nwould like to mention the United Nations Convention on\nthe Law of the Sea, successes as regards decolonization,\ninvariable and universal support for individual and\ncollective human rights, the openness and liberalization of\ninternational trade, the immense mass of statistical data\ncollected and published in the fields of demography,\neconomics, health, education, and so on.\nWithout attempting to be exhaustive I should like to\nemphasize our admiration for the world summits \u2014 for the\ndefence and protection of the environment in Rio de\nJaneiro; the International Conference on Population and\nDevelopment in Cairo; the World Summit for Social\nDevelopment in Copenhagen; the World Summit for\nChildren; the recently concluded Fourth World Conference\non Women in Beijing; and the equally hoped-for and\nawaited United Nations Conference on Human Settlements\n(Habitat II). The contribution that these summits have made\nto mankind is truly historic.\nI should also like to highlight my Government\u2019s\nappreciation for the report of the independent Working\nGroup on the future of the United Nations, many of whose\nobservations and recommendations we share.\nWithout attempting to elaborate on the immense\nagenda of this session we would like to emphasize the need\nthat Paraguay feels for a greater adaptation of the United\nNations to the new and changing realities at the same time\nwe support, where possible, the greater strengthening of the\nentire system, not only to preserve peace through law but\nalso to strengthen security with a view to the harmonized\nand integral development of all peoples the world over.\nIn this context Paraguay continues to support the\nreform of the organs of the United Nations, strengthening\nthe General Assembly, democratizing the Security Council\nwith the presence of more non-permanent members and\nrestricting the power of veto. Among the new permanent\nmembers it would be vital to ensure that there is equitable\nrepresentation for Latin America and other continents\namong whose representatives we mention by way of\nexample Japan, Germany and Brazil.\nAll this would be impossible if States in accordance\nwith agreed contributions were not to confront positively\nand conscientiously the serious problem of financing the\nsystem. In keeping with its means Paraguay is up to date\nin the payment of its assessment and we would like to\nemphasize the need to rationalize resources and improve\nthe administrative efficiency of the United Nations.\nWe have also said in the past that the allocation of\nfunds for programmes and projects in the world by the\nUnited Nations is unbalanced in that only 8.66 per cent of\nthe programmes are allocated to countries of Latin\nAmerica whereas other regions have 50.42 per cent and\n40.67 per cent respectively.\nParaguay is following closely the enormous efforts\nbeing made by the United Nations concerning peace and\ndevelopment.\nAs regards the maintenance of peace, Paraguay\nwishes to refer to a few specific points.\nRegarding agenda item 27, I am pleased at the\ncontinued economic openness in the sister republic of\nCuba. It is a pleasure to recall that the great hero, poet,\npolitical leader, writer and teacher, Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed was Consul\nGeneral of Paraguay in New York and that his\ncontribution to my homeland was at the time, and\ncontinues to be fruitful.\nIn this context Paraguay reiterates its full support for\nthe Rio Group as regards its declaration in favour of\nlifting the embargo on Cuba and we repeat our support\nfor the changes required in accordance with the will of\nthe people and with respect for the self-determination of\npeoples and the principle of non-intervention.\nRegarding the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina,\nParaguay supports the different courses of action\npromoted by the General Assembly and monitored by the\nSecurity Council through the efforts of the United Nations\nProtection Force (UNPROFOR) and the Office of the\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and\nother related agencies.My country has not lost hope that\nthe strength of reason and the inspiration of human\ncompassion will, in the near future, alleviate the\nenormous suffering and sacrifices of those peoples that\nare separated now by hatred and violence.\nParaguay shares the concern of the international\ncommunity regarding the conflicts in Rwanda and\nBurundi and other parts of the African continent.\n11\n\n\nThe very diverse actions of the United Nations in\nother parts of the world deserve our respect and our\nsupport. Without being exhaustive in our listing we would\nlike to refer to the problems that have existed in El\nSalvador, Haiti, Iraq, Kuwait, Angola, Mozambique,\nSomalia, Western Sahara, Liberia, and in Lebanon, Cyprus,\nCambodia, Georgia, Tajikistan, and so on. The United\nNations is contributing or has contributed actively with\nobserver missions or assistance missions and with peace-\nkeeping forces in a world that is experiencing so much\nupheaval.\nWe continue to be hopeful as regards the peace\nprocess between Israel and its Arab neighbours in the\nMiddle East. Paraguay is gratified by the recent agreements\nbetween Israel and Palestine and we hope that new progress\nwill soon be made in those lands which were the cradle of\nthree universal religions and their magnificent cultures.\nOf course Paraguay supports the work of the United\nNations with a view to achieving disarmament, whether it\nbe in regard to conventional, biological, chemical or nuclear\nweapons. In the same context, Paraguay expresses its\nconcern also at the nuclear tests being conducted in\ndifferent parts of the world.\nThe struggle against the terrible scourge of terrorism\nis one shared by Paraguay in an increasingly united\nframework of international cooperation to eliminate the\nproblem at its very roots.\nParaguay would like to mention its hope that as a\nresult of the talks between the two parties, a just and\nequitable understanding will be reached to resolve the\nsituation of the Republic of China, in keeping with the\nprinciple of universality enshrined in the Charter.\nRegarding agenda item 27, I am pleased at the\ncontinued economic openness in the sister republic of Cuba.\nIt is a pleasure to recall that the great hero, poet, political\nleader, writer and teacher, Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed was Consul General\nof Paraguay in New York and that his contribution to my\nhomeland was at the time, and continues to be fruitful.\nIn this context Paraguay reiterates its full support for\nthe Rio Group as regards its declaration in favour of lifting\nthe embargo on Cuba and we repeat our support for the\nchanges required in accordance with the will of the people\nand with respect for the self-determination of peoples and\nthe principle of non-intervention.\nRegarding the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina,\nParaguay supports the different courses of action\npromoted by the General Assembly and monitored by the\nSecurity Council through the efforts of the United Nations\nProtection Force (UNPROFOR) and the Office of the\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and\nother related agencies.My country has not lost hope that\nthe strength of reason and the inspiration of human\ncompassion will, in the near future, alleviate the\nenormous suffering and sacrifices of those peoples that\nare separated now by hatred and violence.\nParaguay shares the concern of the international\ncommunity regarding the conflicts in Rwanda and\nBurundi and other parts of the African continent.\nThe very diverse actions of the United Nations in\nother parts of the world deserve our respect and our\nsupport.

The\nUnited Nations is contributing or has contributed actively\nwith observer missions or assistance missions and with\npeace-keeping forces in a world that is experiencing so\nmuch upheaval.\nWe continue to be hopeful as regards the peace\nprocess between Israel and its Arab neighbours in the\nMiddle East. Paraguay is gratified by the recent\nagreements between Israel and Palestine and we hope that\nnew progress will soon be made in those lands which\nwere the cradle of three universal religions and their\nmagnificent cultures.\nOf course Paraguay supports the work of the United\nNations with a view to achieving disarmament, whether\nit be in regard to conventional, biological, chemical or\nnuclear weapons. In the same context, Paraguay expresses\nits concern also at the nuclear tests being conducted in\ndifferent parts of the world.\nThe struggle against the terrible scourge of terrorism\nis one shared by Paraguay in an increasingly united\nframework of international cooperation to eliminate the\nproblem at its very roots.\nParaguay would like to mention its hope that as a\nresult of the talks between the two parties, a just and\nequitable understanding will be reached to resolve the\n12\n\n\nsituation of the Republic of China, in keeping with the\nprinciple of universality enshrined in the Charter.\nUnited Nations cooperation in development implies an\nenormous restructuring and revitalization effort in the\neconomic, social and other related spheres. In this context\nwe view as very fruitful the cooperation between the United\nNations and the Latin American Economic System and\ncooperation between the United Nations and other regional\ngroups. Particular emphasis should be placed on horizontal\ncooperation.\nWe consider the question of convening an international\nconference for development to be of vital importance as\none of the measures needed to ensure long-term economic\ngrowth in all countries, particularly the developing\ncountries.\nRecent financial disturbances on our continent, where\ndebt, loans and speculative capital combined to create a\nwidespread and only recently resolved crisis, oblige us to\nreassert the fundamental demand for sustainable\ndevelopment and for effective and broad international\neconomic cooperation, as was highlighted in the\nconclusions of the Rio Group at its recent meeting at Quito.\nParaguay is pleased to affirm before the Assembly that\nits democratic process is continuing to grow stronger day\nby day. In accordance with the National Constitution, the\nGovernment has guaranteed and will continue to guarantee\nall freedoms and compliance with the covenants on civil\nand political rights we have signed.\nWe cannot fail to note that the United Nations\nCommission on Human Rights, in its 1995 conclusions with\nregard to our country, has recognized Paraguay\u2019s\nachievements in this field. At the same time, we cannot\ndeny the enormous needs to which we must respond.\nDemocratic transition in our country has not received\nthe hoped-for material support. Apart from the contribution\nof the European Community and Japan, we have had to\ndeal with our social and economic problems out of our\nresources. That alone explains why we have been unable to\nresolve all social conflict.\nIn shouldering the task of coming up with answers, we\nrepeat that we shall be doing so without digressing from the\nmoral principles of fairness and the principles of the United\nNations, but we do ask for greater support for our\ndevelopment from the international community. For that\nreason the people of Paraguay were shocked \u2014 and, we\nmust say, indignant \u2014 to learn of the attempts by certain\nEuropean and United States banks to bring before the\nSwiss courts claims of debts that were never sanctioned\nby Paraguay authorities and that arose out of fraudulent\noperations that were carried out in Italy and that are now\nbeing investigated and judged in those countries.\nParaguay has honoured and will continue to honour\neach and every one of its international commitments, but\nwe can never agree to the payment of debts unrelated to\nour legislation and contrary to every principle of law.\nThe recent Conference of the Rio Group at Quito\ncame out vigorously in favour of productive investment\nand discouraged speculation, which does not create\nemployment and which is unfortunately characteristic of\ntoday\u2019s climate. In this connection, our Government is\ncontinuing with its plans concerning the Paraguay-Paran\u00e1\nwaterway. This waterway is not a new project or design\nto be created from scratch but, on the contrary, something\nthat already exists as a work of nature and that must be\nimproved, without curtailing it, by means of river\nchannels that will be suitable for open navigation at all\ntimes for the transit of goods and persons. The ecological\nSummit at Rio de Janeiro strengthened Paraguay\u2019s\nawareness of the need to protect the environment, and\nsince this waterway already exists in its natural state, the\nenvironment \u2014 and I would emphasize this \u2014 will in no\nway be damaged.\nAs of 1 January 1995 the Southern Cone Common\nMarket, MERCOSUR, which is a customs union, has\ncomplemented and integrated the economies of Argentina,\nBrazil, Paraguay and Uruguay into a market covering\nover 200 million persons and 12 million square\nkilometres, the world\u2019s fourth largest regional entity. The\nTreaty of Asunci\u00f3n, which brought MERCOSUR into\nbeing five years ago, is based on two key principles,\nnamely, international democracy and international\nsolidarity. It is a flexible system of integration that seeks\nto include the economies of the sister Republics of\nBolivia and Chile and that may eventually be joined with\nthe Andean Pact.\nParaguay is very enthusiastic about the fruitful\nnegotiations under way with the European Union aimed\nat establishing a broad zone of free trade that would cover\nEurope and MERCOSUR. Under the outstanding\npresidency of Spain a broad framework agreement is now\nbeing studied in the European Union, and we hope it can\nbe signed in Madrid at the end of this year.\n13\n\n\nParaguay is firmly convinced of the need to move\nforward with the process of creating in MERCOSUR such\nsupranational entities as an administration commission and\na law tribunal.\nParaguay\u2019s pro-tem presidency of MERCOSUR saw\nthe entry into force of a customs union that has undergone\nsteady development, as well as the initiation of the\nunderstanding with the European Union. We have just\nhanded the presidency over to Oriental Republic of\nUruguay.\nWithin MERCOSUR, Paraguay is carrying out a free-\ntrade policy, the most open such policy in South America,\ncorresponding as it does to article 8 of the Charter of the\nInternational Monetary Fund, which provides for the totally\nunrestricted movement of capital.\nParaguay is aware that it must reduce the size of its\narmed forces so that the sums invested in it can be\ntransferred to the social sector, but without losing sight of\nits need for security and without impairing the efficiency of\nthose forces. Fortunately, there is understanding of the\nvarious mandates and the cooperation needed to make this\nchange. In Paraguay at the present time we are examining\nthe possibility of participation by our armed forces in\nUnited Nations peace-keeping operations, and we have\nbegun to send officers to participate in training courses.\nWe appreciate the financing of the programmes and\nprojects in our country by the United Nations Development\nProgramme (UNDP), the World Bank and the Inter-\nAmerican Bank for Development. We are grateful to the\nInternational Monetary Fund for its very effective guidance.\nDrug trafficking is not a problem in Paraguay, which\nis neither a centre of production nor a consumer market.\nThe only problem it causes is created by the transit towards\nthe industrialized countries, which is facilitated by our long\nborder. Through its own efforts, and without external\nassistance, Paraguay is combating this scourge and has\nachieved significant successes. Public and private corruption\nis the scourge of the whole world today, and it is being\ntackled by our Government. In this connection, Paraguay\nfirmly supports the draft inter-American convention against\ncorruption submitted by the Government of Venezuela to its\npartners in the Rio Group.\nParaguay is proud of its contribution to and\nmembership in the Rio Group. This is a flexible organ\ncreated as a way to resolve a precise conflict, and it has\nprovided such good results that it has continued to exist as\na framework for broad, political dialogue that is becoming\nincreasingly relevant and important. Its establishment by\nfounding members of the Organization of American States\n(OAS) has given it a particularly coherent and timely\npolitical standing. We are encouraged at the practical turn\ntaken by the Summit Meeting of American Presidents at\nMiami, especially at the Ministerial Meeting at Denver,\nColorado.\nBefore concluding my statement I wish to say that\nthe Government of Paraguay wants to highlight the\npositive understanding achieved with the Republic of\nArgentina for solving the ecological problem of the\nPilcomayo river. The sister Republic of Bolivia has now\njoined us in a tripartite agreement to redress this problem\nin an area ripe for regional development, thanks to the\ncooperation of the European Union.\nLast year we mentioned the need to create within the\nUnited Nations system a fund for progress in science and\ntechnology, particularly for the developing countries. In\nthis regard we would like to appeal especially to our\npartners from the South. Without science and technology\nfor our economic, social and political elites, development\nis impossible. The gap between the industrialized\ncountries and our own countries in this respect is so large\nthat it is a matter of fairness and necessity to reduce it.\nAbove all, it is question of bringing about a free transfer\nof agricultural and food technology that can make it\npossible for us to live in social peace.\nAs the United Nations completes its 50 years of\nexistence, it has passed many milestones in human\nhistory. Knotty problems that seemed insoluble yesterday\nhave now been left behind.\nA nuclear crisis, which threatened almost two\ngenerations of the human race, now seems unthinkable.\nThe world can no longer be explained from the standpoint\nof two ideologies whose triumph or defeat could be\ndecided only by a major war, which was fortunately avoided.\nThe contest between authoritarianism and freedom is\nover. Although there are large areas of the world where\nfundamental rights are not enjoyed, the benefits of\nfreedom enshrined in the declarations and covenants of\nthe United Nations are not at issue.\nWe cannot forget that since 1819 there have been\n353 wars, but none of them has been between well-\nestablished democracies.\n14\n\n\nThere is a widespread and growing awareness that\nmany major issues can be resolved only by pooling our\nefforts. The issues of the environment, women, education\nand children, as well as a large majority of the other issues\non this grand Assembly\u2019s agenda, are impossible to resolve\nthrough the efforts of one nation-State. This fact is\nconfirmed every day. Today we forget that not long ago,\nwhen our Organization already existed, there was no debate\nover the internal affairs of countries and that no\ninternational intervention was allowable. If the Charter were\nrewritten today it would be startling to see the changes\nArticle 2, paragraph 7.\nAll this happened in the era of the United Nations. We\nstill lack the perspective to assess it, but we are sure that\nthe result is positive. We have not gone backwards; we\nhave not even stopped.\nWe are again hearing voices that emphasize the\ndefects of the Organization. The criticism would seem true\nif we lost sight of the major changes for the good of\nmankind that have come about with the existence and the\nhelp of our institution. Through me, my country reiterates\nits support for vital and necessary reforms. This is our\nresponsibility, and it is the best tribute we can pay to those\nwho conceived, shaped and developed the Organization.\nBut these changes will be valid only if we remember\nthe principle of the sense of history, as Secretary-General\nBoutros Boutros-Ghali pointed out. In recent years we\nParaguayans, in setting out anew on the path of democracy,\nbelieved that we were impelled not only by a desire to\nimprove our living conditions, obtain the benefits of\nprogress and ensure well-being for all. We understood that\nwe were part of a shared adventure with universal roots,\nthat we were a nation that, in order to understand itself,\nneeded to understand others.\nFor this reason, we stand before you with a conviction\nthat I hope will last for ever: that the great majority of\npeople believe that with the United Nations it will be\npossible some day be possible, perhaps very soon, to find\nnew forms of cosmopolitanism. That sense of history\nobliges us to think once again in terms of the world \u2014 this\nwill, of course, be our new activity \u2014 so that morality may\ntriumph in politics and that the separation of the two will\nhave been but a moment in the history of our race.\nTo paraphrase Hegel, we can say, \u201cWhat are we?\nWhat shall we become?\u201d\n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of the\nGovernment and people of Thailand, I should like to extend\nmy warmest congratulations to His Excellency Mr. Freitas\ndo Amaral, upon his election to the presidency of this\nhistoric fiftieth session of the General Assembly. I am\nconfident that under his leadership the work and\nachievements of this session will be as momentous as the\noccasion we are celebrating.\nI should also like to take this opportunity to pay\ntribute to His Excellency Mr. Amara Essy, Foreign Minister\nof C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, President of the forty-ninth session of the\nGeneral Assembly. My delegation truly appreciates his\nleadership and his tireless dedication to the heavy\nresponsibilities entrusted to him during the past year. Under\nhis guidance, the forty-ninth session not only set the stage\nfor the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations but also\nhelped to reinforce its foundation and crystallized its agenda\nfor the years to come.\nAs this is the first time that I have had the honour to\naddress the General Assembly on behalf of my Government\nand the people of Thailand in my capacity as Foreign\nMinister, I should like to reiterate my Government\u2019s full\nand unflinching support for the purposes and principles of\nthe United Nations and its all-encompassing work and\nendeavours. As a representative of a democratically elected\nGovernment, I am particularly pleased to note the increased\nrole and involvement of the United Nations in promoting\nthe principles and practices of democracy. Thailand\nbelieves that, as a global organization, the United Nations\nhas an important role to play in advancing the concept of\ndemocracy and enhancing its principles in world affairs,\nas well as in the functions of the United Nations itself. It\nis with this conviction, therefore, that I should like to\npledge Thailand\u2019s fullest support for United Nations\nundertakings in this field.\nDuring the past few years, much has been said on\nthe need to strengthen and revitalize the United Nations\nfor the next 50 years, to prepare it for the challenges of\nthe new century which will soon dawn upon us. Through\nthe years, a number of useful proposals and\nrecommendations on ways to improve the structure,\nworking methods, efficiency and agenda of the United\nNations have been made by numerous experts,\npractitioners and enthusiasts, from both within and outside\nthe United Nations system. Yet much remains to be done\nif the United Nations is to be, in the words of the\nSecretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, a\n\u201cmission-driven and result-oriented\u201d Organization.\nIn this regard, Thailand believes that a number of\ncrucial ingredients are necessary to effectuate a successful\nreform of the United Nations system. Most important, the\nreform must be comprehensive and universal. The reform\nprocess should take place in all agencies within the\nUnited Nations system, encompassing all aspects of the\nwork and activities of the United Nations. A special effort\nshould be made to coordinate all reform initiatives,\nparticularly in three main organs of the United Nations,\nnamely the General Assembly, the Security Council and\nthe Economic and Social Council. For this reason,\nThailand fully supports the General Assembly\u2019s decision\nearlier this month to establish a high-level open-ended\nworking group on the strengthening of the United Nations\nsystem in order to review and make observations on\nreform proposals attained from various sources.\nIn line with this initiative, I should like to go a step\nfurther and propose that, in addition to the high-level\nopen-ended Working Group, a focal point could be\ndesignated to coordinate all reform initiatives in all\nUnited Nations bodies. However, such a focal point need\nnot supersede or subsume existing reform mechanisms,\nsuch as the High-Level Open-ended Working Group on\nthe Financial Situation of the Organization, the ad hoc\nopen-ended Working Group on an Agenda for\nDevelopment, and the Open-Ended Working Group on the\nreform of the Security Council. All these bodies should\n12\n\n\ncoexist and coordinate with one another, and complement\neach other\u2019s work.\nHaving been a United Nations Member since 1946,\nThailand shares the aspirations of all its fellow Members to\nsee a more consolidated, cohesive and efficient United\nNations system \u2014 one which would be able to fulfil the\nnoble purposes and principles of the Charter of the United\nNations; to deal urgently and effectively with threats to\ninternational peace and security; to respond effectively to\nthe world\u2019s economic, social and humanitarian needs; and\nto promote the goals of human security and sustainable\ndevelopment. Furthermore, Thailand is convinced that one\nmust also ensure that the United Nations of the twenty-first\ncentury is more equitable, representative, democratic,\ntransparent and accountable, allowing for the widest\npossible participation in all its decision-making and\nactivities and serving the interests of all mankind.\nWhen speaking of these qualities, one is inclined to\nponder the work on the reform of the Security Council. As\nthe main organ entrusted with the primary responsibility of\nmaintaining international peace and security, the Security\nCouncil must be restructured in such a way that it will be\nable to perform its duties effectively, while also ensuring its\nlegitimacy and accountability. To achieve this goal, the\nreformed working methods and composition of the Security\nCouncil should allow for the widest participation by\nMember States, particularly those that are developing\ncountries, while at the same time giving due recognition to\nStates whose present world positions reflect the current\nglobal shift in power and influence.\nHowever, to simply reform the Security Council\nthrough its composition and working methods alone is not\nenough. If the Security Council is to be truly efficient and\neffective, we also need to rethink the way in which we\nview the role of the Security Council. We need to be more\nrealistic in our expectations about what the Security Council\nshould do and should be able to accomplish in a conflict\nsituation. In other words, it is about time we considered\nlimiting the scope and depth of the peace-keeping activities\nof the United Nations to a level where its involvement\nwould be practical, meaningful and cost-effective.\nFor this reason, my delegation welcomes the point\nraised by His Excellency Professor Dr. Diogo Freitas do\nAmaral, President of the General Assembly at its fiftieth\nsession, on the need to re-examine the United Nations\ngeneral policy on peace-keeping. My delegation also\nwelcomes the efforts being made in the Fifth Committee to\nreform the process of approving peace-keeping budgets and\nappropriations, which would help improve the\nmanagement of the United Nations financial resources.\nMy delegation is convinced that it would make good\nmanagerial sense for us to try to curtail the dramatic\nincrease in the expenses of United Nations peace-keeping\nand related operations, which, in 1995, have grown to\nover $3 billion and are currently contributing to the\nUnited Nations financial difficulty.\nIt is one thing to discuss United Nations efforts in\nmaintaining international peace and security in financial\nand managerial terms and another to view them from the\nhuman perspective. The tribal, ethnic and religious\nconflicts that are the source of the ongoing hostilities in\nplaces such as Bosnia and Herzegovina, Somalia,\nLebanon and Cyprus existed long before the end of the\ncold war, many of them even long before the United\nNations came into existence. There is not much the\nUnited Nations can do as long as the peoples involved\nhave no desire to coexist in peace. That is why Thailand\nfully supports the United Nations continuing work on the\nAgenda for Peace, initiated by the United Nations\nSecretary-General in 1992. In particular, Thailand believes\nthat the concepts of preventive diplomacy and\nconfidence-building, as espoused by the initiative, could\ndo much to promote peace and understanding in all\nregions of the world.\nAlong this line, Thailand and the Association of\nSouth-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) have, since 1971,\ninitiated the concept of a Zone of Peace, Freedom and\nNeutrality in South-East Asia (ZOPFAN), the Treaty of\nAmity and Cooperation in Southeast Asia in 1976, and,\nmost notably, the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) in\n1994, involving 18 States from the Asia-Pacific region\nand the European Union. It is most gratifying that, after\ntwo years of existence, the ARF has increasingly proved\nto be a useful instrument of peace and understanding and\nhas made significant contributions to efforts towards\npreventive diplomacy and confidence-building in the\nAsia-Pacific region.\nDuring the past year, a number of important\ndevelopments have taken place within the realm of the\nglobal economy. The establishment of the World Trade\nOrganization (WTO), although still in its initial stage,\naugurs well for the eventual realization of a transparent,\nbalanced and effective world trading regime. Continued\nefforts should be made to integrate major trading\neconomies, as well as those in transition, into the WTO\nframework in order to more fully to globalize the norms\nand practices of free and fair trade.\n13\n\n\nSimilarly, the conclusion of the Uruguay Round\nagreements provided hope for a more equitable and open\nglobal trading system. It is essential that these agreements\nbe implemented in full as soon as possible. It is essential\nalso that States parties refrain from using unilateral and\narbitrary measures, which would be contrary to the spirit\nand provisions of the agreements and obstruct the free flow\nof trade between States and regions. The sad reality is that,\nin spite of the agreements, trading States, such as Thailand,\nstill suffer from unilateral and arbitrary measures in areas\nsuch as agriculture, textiles and light-manufacture products.\nFor this reason, Thailand believes that further\ndiscussions and negotiations on the accelerated\nimplementation of the Uruguay Round commitments and\nrelated issues are still necessary. Efforts should also be\nmade to ensure that the outcome of these discussions and\nnegotiations would make it possible to strike a balance\nbetween the interests and concerns of developing countries\nand that of their more developed counterparts. Thailand\nfurther believes that to this end, United Nations institutions\nsuch as the United Nations Conference on Trade and\nDevelopment (UNCTAD) can play a major role in\namalgamating, and giving expression to, the interests and\nconcerns of all involved, particularly those of the\ndeveloping, and least developed, members of the world\neconomy.\nGlobal trade agreements are not the only ones that\nbring countries closer together. Another welcome\ndevelopment in the international economy is the closer\ncooperation among regional and subregional economic\ngroupings. The linkages among these entities in various\nparts of the world have, in effect, created a network of\ninterdependence that has tremendous potential and would\nbenefit all concerned. However, continued care must be\nexercised to make certain that these groupings will not turn\ninward and become mutually exclusive regional trading\nblocs. Such a development would be detrimental to the\nspirit of multilateralism that has been fostered by this body\nfor the past 50 years and to the world\u2019s trading system.\nWhile economic cooperation within a regional context\nsuch as ASEAN has become commonplace, it is noteworthy\nthat cooperative frameworks now span the divide of North\nand South, East and West. Oceans are no longer a\nseparation. Efforts such as the Asia-Pacific Economic\nCooperation (APEC) and the ASEAN-European Union\npromise to forge closer economic cooperation across the\nregions, regardless of geographical distance and boundaries.\nAs these growing networks of cooperation extend their\nreach across the globe and transoceanic trade multiplies,\ngeographical and economic distinctions become\nincreasingly irrelevant. The sharp dividing lines between\nthe rich and the poor, the Western and the Eastern\nhemispheres, are indeed diminishing.\nSustainable economic development must go hand in\nhand with sustainable human development. There can be\nno prosperity as long as people are denied their basic\nrights and the satisfaction of their needs. As a country\nthat attaches high importance to the principles of social\nequity, social welfare and human rights, Thailand fully\nsupports the United Nations efforts in areas such as the\nalleviation of poverty, education, health care and the\ncombating of drug abuse and trafficking. Drug trafficking,\nin particular, has always received special attention from\nThailand. Geographically located near the so-called\n\u201cgolden triangle\u201d, Thailand has consistently supported, at\nboth the global and the regional level, international efforts\naimed at the prevention, control and suppression of\nnarcotic drugs. This support has been intensified in recent\nyears with the advent of the twentieth-century epidemic\nof Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS).\nThailand believes that like the drug problem, the disease,\nwith its devastating effects on mankind, is of global\nconcern and should be dealt with jointly by the\ninternational community. In this context, my delegation\nwould like to voice its support for the United Nations\nongoing work on initiatives relating to the Agenda for\nDevelopment, which would help us find more pragmatic\napproaches to development and address the\naforementioned economic, social and human security\nissues in all their dimensions in a more effective and\nfruitful manner.\nIn spite of the many achievements of the United\nNations during the past 50 years, in the year 1995, we\nstill find ourselves far away from what the authors of the\nUnited Nations Charter had hoped for and dreamed of in\n1945. Therefore, in this fiftieth anniversary year, it is\nmost appropriate that we, the peoples of the United\nNations, rededicate ourselves to the realization of the\nhopes and dreams of the framers of the United Nations\nCharter, for our own sake and for the sake of our\nchildren. Through the years, we have asked and taken\nmuch from the United Nations. We continue to do so with\nmuch greater intensity and in much greater multitude. It\nis now time for us to reinvest in the United Nations. We\nmust give back not only quantitatively but also\nqualitatively. Imperfect as it is, there is no substitute for\nthe United Nations.\n14\n\n\nThe generation of the Second World War created the\nUnited Nations for us. They lit for us all a beacon of hope.\nIt is now our responsibility to bequeath to our posterity a\nbrighter beacon, a revitalized and strengthened United\nNations which would withstand the test of time and help us\novercome the challenges of the next century.\n"

        "file_text": "Let me first extend my heartfelt\ncongratulations to Mr. Freitas do Amaral of Portugal on his\nelection to the distinguished office from which he will\nguide the work of the fiftieth session of the United Nations\nGeneral Assembly. I am confident that his experience and\ncommitment to the noble principles of the United Nations\nCharter will guarantee that this session will be marked by\nnew vigour, commitment and determination. I wish to\nexpress our gratitude also to his predecessor, Mr. Amara\nEssy, for the fine, skilful manner in which he presided over\nthe work of the last session of the General Assembly.\nThe world we live in has been deeply and positively\naffected by the end of the cold war and national\nemancipation in Central and Eastern Europe, and Western\nAsia. Many hotbeds of crisis have been extinguished or are\non the way to being resolved, from Eastern Asia and South\nAfrica to the Middle East.\nHowever, many problems having a negative impact on\ninternational relations remain unresolved, including the\ncrisis in south-eastern Europe. Most disquieting are the\ndangers of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction,\nespecially nuclear weapons. The world is still faced with\nvarious forms of terrorism. There is a grave danger\nresulting from the illicit trade in narcotics. Widespread\nabuses of human rights continue as do the problems of\nracism, anti-Semitism, xenophobia, and national and\nreligious intolerance. The solution to the problem of\nunderdevelopment requires more concerted and coordinated\nefforts.\nIn order to be able to deal with the many problems\nfacing the world, it is necessary to have a vital and efficient\nUnited Nations.\nFollowing the end of the cold war there was a period\nof optimism, renewed hope and expectation that the United\nNations would finally play the role which had been\nenvisaged for it at the time of its founding, almost 50 years\nago. However, we have recently experienced severe\ndisappointment at the inability of the United Nations to\nfulfil all these expectations; this has resulted in the loss of\ncredibility by the United Nations.\nThe causes for its loss of credibility are many and\nvaried, and among the most important is the failure of\nmany United Nations peace-keeping operations to achieve\ntheir assigned goals. This is not to say that there have not\nbeen successful United Nations peace-keeping missions; this\nis evident from the operations in Cambodia and southern\nAfrica.\nOne way in which the peace-keeping or\npeacemaking missions of the United Nations could be\nimproved is by the establishment of a United Nations\nmilitary force of a more permanent nature or one that\ncould be assembled quickly, consisting of contingents\nfrom specific countries or regional arrangements. Such a\nforce should be constructed in such a way as to make\nsure that its national contingents acted to implement\nSecurity Council resolutions and not to promote the\npolicies of their States. In this regard I wish to express\nthe Republic of Croatia\u2019s interest in providing troops for\nUnited Nations peace-keeping operations.\nHowever, in order to make the peace-keeping\nfunctions of the United Nations more effective it is\nnecessary to reform the body which is primarily\nresponsible for the maintenance of international peace and\nsecurity \u2014 the Security Council. It is also important that\nthe composition of the Security Council reflect the new\npolitical and economic realities which have emerged since\nits formation after the Second World War. Due regard\nmust also be given to proper geographical balance as well\nas to the increase in the membership of the United\nNations. Making the Security Council more representative\nand democratic will also enhance its credibility as it will\nthen be a more legitimate body representing the will of\nthe international community. This will no doubt serve to\nfacilitate the implementation of its resolutions.\nIn this regard, the Republic of Croatia supports an\nincrease in the number of both the permanent and\nnon-permanent members of the Security Council to a\npoint which will not negatively affect its effectiveness. I\nwish to reiterate Croatia\u2019s support for the admission of\nGermany and Japan as permanent members of the\nSecurity Council due to the actual, as well as potential,\ncontribution of these two countries to the cause of\ninternational peace and security and to other aspects of\nthe work of the United Nations. Additionally, serious\nconsideration should be given to the possibility of one or\nmore developing countries from Asia, Africa or Latin\nAmerica being granted permanent-member status.\nDespite the various setbacks which I have already\nreferred to, the United Nations still has a critical role to\nplay in resolving many of the world\u2019s problems,\nespecially in regard to the environment and sustainable\ndevelopment.\n17\n\n\nIn addition to economic well-being, equal attention\nshould be paid to respect for the human rights of each and\nevery individual. In this regard, Croatia reiterates its\nsupport for the work of the High Commissioner for Human\nRights, Mr. Jos\u00e9 Ayalo Lasso, and commends the manner\nin which he has been performing his duty. As a further\nmethod of combating gross violations of human rights and\ninternational humanitarian law, Croatia supports the\nestablishment of an international criminal court in the form\nof an apolitical legal organ of the international community.\nBy its geographical position, history, socio-cultural\nfeatures, and political and economic orientation, the\nRepublic of Croatia is a part of both Central Europe and\nthe Mediterranean. As a European country in transition,\nCroatia has already achieved significant progress in the\ndevelopment of democratic institutions and adherence to\ninternationally accepted standards concerning the rule of\nlaw and protection of human rights. It is also worth noting\nthat the economic situation has been stabilized and even\nimproved during the past two years, despite the extremely\ndifficult conditions caused by Serbian aggression. Our\nnational development strategy is outward-oriented, while the\nsocial policies and legal framework are based on the\nprinciples of pluralistic democracy, including an\nopen-market economy.\nAs a country of European civilization and tradition,\nCroatia\u2019s strategic, political, economic and social orientation\nis clearly focused on active participation in the process of\nEuropean integration. Croatia\u2019s harmonization with\nEuropean legislation and criteria represents a crucial part of\nits national development. While Croatia is already a\nmember of various European intergovernmental and\ninterregional organizations, the forging of closer relations\nwith the European Union, as well as full membership in the\nCouncil of Europe, are the basic pillars of Croatia\u2019s\nEuropean policy. However, Croatia will seek to adopt an\napproach to reflecting a balance between its European\norientation and its wider global cooperation on a\nmultilateral and bilateral basis.\nThe Republic of Croatia endeavours to contribute to\nlasting peace and durable stability in south-eastern Europe,\nwhich can be achieved only by the normalization of\nrelations among all States based on full and strict respect\nfor and adherence to the principles of the inviolability of\ninternational borders, the territorial integrity of all States\nand the rights of minorities.\nCroatia has effectively assumed its role as an\nindispensable factor in the search for peace, stability and\nsecurity. In this sense, Croatia will continue to cooperate\nconstructively with the relevant international forums and\nleading institutions or countries with a view to finding a\npolitical solution to the present crisis in the region.\nIn this respect \u2014 and bearing in mind the nature of\nthe crisis and that its underlying cause has been and\nremains Serbian aggression \u2014 Croatia will continue to\ncooperate closely and coordinate its political, military and\ndiplomatic activities with the Republic and Federation of\nBosnia and Herzegovina, on the basis of the Washington\nAgreements and other bilateral agreements and\narrangements such as the Split Declaration. This is\nbecause one of the prerequisites for ensuring long-term\nstability and progress for Croatia is the settlement of the\ncrisis in neighbouring Bosnia and Herzegovina.\nThanks to the clarity and transparency of its national\nagenda, the decisiveness of its political leadership and its\ncooperation with the international community in pursuit\nof its vital national interests, Croatia has succeeded over\nthe course of several years in reintegrating most of its\noccupied territories, paving the way for the return of\nsome 110,000 displaced persons and refugees to their\nhomes, as well as in revitalizing energy and transport\ncommunications throughout the country.\nCroatia has also managed in very difficult\ncircumstances to reach reasonable stability and to enjoy\nincreased prospects for further development and the\nstrengthening of the democratic system and institutions,\ncombined with a significant level of economic\nstabilization.\nSince the outbreak of the crisis in south-eastern\nEurope Croatia has constantly advocated a negotiated\npeaceful solution, with the active support and full\nparticipation of the international community, and on the\nbasis of the principles of the United Nations Charter and\ninternational law.\nSpecial emphasis has been placed on the imperative\nof fully regulating and normalizing Croat-Serb relations.\nFuture relations between these two States are of\nparamount importance for lasting stability in south-eastern\nEurope. At the same time, Croatia is actively contributing\nto the quest for a solution to the issue of the\nBosniac-Muslim people, one that would ensure their\nnational rights and provide stability for the region.\nFurthermore, in the interests of ensuring long-term\nsecurity and stability, Croatia has advocated the need for\nthe introduction of the confidence- and security- building\n18\n\n\nmeasures of the Organization for Security and Cooperation\nin Europe (OSCE).\nCroatia has always done its utmost to enable the\ninternational community to pursue its peace efforts and has\nconsistently demonstrated utmost restraint in resorting to the\nuse of force. When we had to use force, our military\nalways strove to minimize the loss of life and the extent of\ndestruction and to enable the international community to\npursue its peace efforts. Croatian military operations have\nalways been in self-defence and in response to the\nintransigence and non-cooperation of the rebel Croatian-\nSerb leadership, to the inability of the United Nations\npeace-keeping forces to fulfil their mandate, to complete\ndeadlock in international mediating efforts, or to direct\nprovocations and terrorist attacks against civilians from the\nrebel Serb side.\nIn the aftermath of the liberation of almost one fifth of\nour country in August, isolated instances of unlawful\nbehaviour and human rights abuses have been recorded. My\nGovernment strongly condemns all such individual acts and\nhas initiated proceedings against the perpetrators.\nCroatia believes that its military operations during the\nfirst week of August, on both sides of the Croatian-Bosnian\nborder, have substantially changed the balance of power\nand in so doing have created a window of opportunity for\nrevitalization of the ongoing peace process. Croatia is of the\nopinion that the joint effects of Operation Storm, the\ncoordinated activities of the army of Bosnia and\nHerzegovina and HVO (Croatian Defence Council) units,\nand the actions of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization\n(NATO) rapid reaction force against the Bosnian Serbs,\ncoupled with diplomatic efforts, have finally opened the\nway to serious and comprehensive peace negotiations,\nwhich will eventually lead to a realistic, balanced and\nlasting solution to the crisis.\nCroatia fully supports the current United States peace\ninitiative and the increased decisiveness of the international\ncommunity, manifested particularly by the United Nations\nand NATO rapid-reaction force operations and pressure\nagainst the Bosnian Serbs.\nCroatia\u2019s major interest with regard to Bosnia and\nHerzegovina is in achieving a lasting peace and just\nsettlement of the conflict that would be satisfactory to the\nconstituent peoples and that would ensure stability along\nCroatian borders; the survival, safety and dignified life of\nthe Bosnian Croats; and mutually beneficial relations and\ncooperation between the two friendly neighbouring\ncountries.\nTherefore, Croatia strongly supports the\nimplementation of the Washington Agreements and the\nSplit Declaration and the strengthening of the Federation\nof Bosnia and Herzegovina and its association with\nCroatia at various levels and in various areas of\ncooperation.\nThe prerequisites for lasting stability, security and\ncooperation in the region include a just and lasting\nsolution to the crisis, reconstruction and development of\nthe countries in the region, normalization of relations\nbetween all successor States of the former Yugoslavia on\nthe basis of equal succession and introduction of a new\nregional order as an integral part of the new European\nsecurity system.\nIt is Croatia\u2019s firm position that the solution for the\npeaceful reintegration of the remaining occupied\nterritories of Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western\nSrijem and the former United Nations Confidence\nRestoration Operation in Croatia (UNCRO) Sector East\nmust be an integral part of the overall peaceful resolution\nof the crisis in the region, in both Bosnia and\nHerzegovina and Croatia, within the time-frame of the\ncurrent peace initiative and the expiration date of the\nUNCRO mandate. Without progress in the solution of this\nissue, progress in the settlement of the crisis in Bosnia\nand Herzegovina cannot be envisaged, and neither can\nany real stabilization of the situation in south-eastern\nEurope.\nDeeply committed to peaceful reintegration, Croatia\nis willing to immediately open meaningful and\nconstructive talks with the representatives of the Serb\npopulation in Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western\nSrijem that should lead to the re-establishment of\nCroatia\u2019s full sovereignty, the return of forcibly displaced\npersons to their homes and respect, in accordance with\nhigh European standards, for the minority rights of the\nSerbs and other minority ethnic or national\ncommunities \u2014 Slovak, Hungarian, Ukrainian and\nothers \u2014 in this area.\nTo this end Croatia has already proposed to the local\nSerbs and the Government of the Federal Republic of\nYugoslavia, through the good offices of the international\nmediators, a comprehensive, elaborate and concrete peace\nplan in the form of a draft agreement on the peaceful\nreintegration of Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western\n19\n\n\nSrijem into the constitutional and economic system of the\nRepublic of Croatia.\nImplementation of the proposed agreement must begin\nwith the immediate withdrawal of all military and\nparamilitary groups not originally from this region, to be\nfollowed by the disarming and disbanding, under UNCRO\nsupervision, of the military and paramilitary groups\ncomposed of persons who reside in the area.\nUpon signing the agreement on the peaceful\nreintegration of the remaining occupied areas, the Federal\nRepublic of Yugoslavia and the Republic of Croatia would\nrecognize each other within their internationally recognized\nborders and diplomatic relations between these two States\nwould be established at the ambassadorial level. This would\nbe followed shortly by the reopening of the Zagreb-\nBelgrade highway and railways, the river traffic along the\nDanube and Sava rivers, the Adriatic pipeline\u2019s outlet to\nSerbia and telecommunications between Croatia and the\nFederal Republic of Yugoslavia.\nThe proposed draft agreement provides ample evidence\nof Croatia\u2019s sincere will and disposition to find a negotiated\nand just solution to the reintegration of the remaining\noccupied territories, providing for the legitimate rights of\nCroatia as a sovereign State and of all its citizens, including\nits minorities. Along these lines, Croatia participated in the\nContact Group negotiations in Geneva and New York.\nFollowing these negotiations, I am moderately optimistic\nthat the resolution of the crisis and peace in the region can\nbe achieved in the near future.\nHowever, there is no doubt that progress towards a\nlasting, just and comprehensive peace is contingent on the\ncontinued, determined and coordinated efforts of the\ninternational community in the maintenance of a global\napproach to the current peace initiative and the continuation\nof the international sanctions against the Belgrade regime.\nIn the next several weeks the parties and the international\ncommunity have to work out a framework, in the form of\na package, for the peace accord, which should include\nseveral interrelated steps: a solution for Bosnia and\nHerzegovina; a resolution of the issue of Eastern Slavonia\nleading to its reintegration into Croatia; mutual recognition,\nwithin their international borders, between Bosnia and\nHerzegovina, Croatia and the Federal Republic of\nYugoslavia; and changes in the sanctions regime against the\nFederal Republic of Yugoslavia as the international\ncommunity deems appropriate. Upon the acceptance of such\na plan, the road to lasting peace and stability will be\nopened.\nOn behalf of my Government, I would like to thank\nagain all the countries contributing troops to the UNCRO\noperations in Croatia and underscore our appreciation of\ntheir efforts to aid the peace process. Croatia deeply\nregrets the loss of life and the injuries sustained by\nmembers of the United Nations force during their mission\nin Croatia. Their noble sacrifice will always be\nremembered and cherished by the Croatian people.\nIn the name of my Government, I am particularly\nproud to thank the General Assembly for having\nsupported the cause of Croatia, most of all by adopting\nresolution 49/43, concerning the occupied territories of\nCroatia. I kindly ask the Assembly to remain steadfast in\nthe contribution it has made through this important\nresolution and through the individual and collective\nengagement of most Members\u2019 Governments to the search\nfor a just and lasting peace for Croatia and Bosnia and\nHerzegovina, as well as for the whole of south-eastern\nEurope.\n"

        "file_text": "\nAs I address the General Assembly on behalf of the\nGabonese Republic, I wish first of all to discharge the\nduty of sincerely congratulating you, Sir, on behalf of my\ndelegation and on my own account, on your unanimous\nelection to the presidency of the fiftieth session. The\nAssembly\u2019s choice reflects the appreciation of all States\nMembers of the United Nations for the contribution of\nyour country, Portugal, to the quest for solutions to the\nproblems besetting the world. Your election highlights\nyour talents as a diplomat and statesman and your wide\nexperience.\nIt gives me pleasure also to express our gratitude\nand admiration to your predecessor, Mr. Amara Essy,\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire. The\nGabonese Republic hails that fine diplomat and thanks\nhim for the dedication and readiness to act he placed in\nthe service of the world Organization at the forty-ninth\n12\n\n\nsession; his work was a source of pride for the entire\nAfrican continent.\nI cannot fail to mention the Gabonese Republic\u2019s\nstaunch support for the Secretary-General, His Excellency\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, in his tireless efforts in the\nservice of peace, security and development.\nI wish now to say a few words about the unique\nnature of this session, during which the Assembly will\nconvene in special meetings to mark the fiftieth anniversary\nof the Organization. At those special meetings, Heads of\nState or Government will have an opportunity to assess the\nimpact of some of the action we have taken pursuant to the\npurposes and principles of the United Nations. True, those\npurposes have not been completely fulfilled, but in all\nfairness we must acknowledge that there has been\nconsiderable progress, especially on respect for human\nrights, fundamental freedoms and peace, without which\nnothing is possible. Yet development remains a major\nconcern, despite the efforts that have been devoted to it.\nEvery nation represented here is a reflection of\nmankind, whose common values the founders of the United\nNations evoked. Among those values I would highlight\nthose of greatest concern at the end of the twentieth\ncentury: peace, freedom and development.\nGabon\u2019s dedication to the ideal of peace is a constant\nelement in its foreign policy and its diplomacy. The\ninclusion of that ideal in the Charter was most appealing to\nthe leadership of Gabon and eased our accession to\nmembership of the United Nations, on 20 September 1960.\nHence, as a Member of the United Nations we took our\nproper place alongside other nations, in the harmony of our\nrespective differences.\nI wish to pay tribute to the founders of non-alignment,\nwho were the first to reflect in deeds, through the doctrine\nof peaceful coexistence, the principles enshrined in the San\nFrancisco Charter. Twenty-five years later, the relevant\nresolutions of the General Assembly confirm that\ninterpretation. We are duty-bound to go back to the source\nin order to respond to the need \u2014 the urgent need \u2014 for\nnew, creative thinking in favour of peace.\nIt is an honour and a duty to recall that Gabon\u2019s\nexperience in the settlement of conflicts has its living roots\ndeep in Bantu civilization. Our view of solidarity among\npeoples gives a role to Gabon\u2019s commitment to cooperate\nwith all States Members of the United Nations whatever\ntheir ideology or the nature of their political regime. This\npromotes the virtues of dialogue and tolerance among\npeoples and nations, virtues we practice in our homes and\nwithin our families, virtues that, through the international\naction of President Omar Bongo, the Gabonese Republic\nhas built into a principle of our diplomatic and political\nculture.\nOur idea of peace, then, is primarily functional in\nnature. It reminds us every day that the state of peace\namong nations is a continuous process, one which\nrequires at all times vigilance, courage and consistency in\nour efforts. Gabon can state with pride that it is dedicated\nto the peaceful conduct of its relations with all the\ncomponents of the international community.\n\u201cWe are judged by our actions\u201d, a great thinker quite\nrightly observed. Those actions that we have been able to\ninscribe in the registry of peace, both bilaterally and\nmultilaterally, follow the path traced by the Charter of the\nUnited Nations. They illustrate, first of all, our\nunswerving loyalty to the Organization, which makes us\nautomatically involved in all the missions and all the\nactions it has undertaken anywhere in the world where\npeace has been threatened or might be threatened. The\nefforts made quite recently by the international\ncommunity to heal the open wounds in Rwanda have had\nour full support. The efforts made by the same\ninternational community in Angola have often been\nsupplemented by our direct or indirect involvement. It\ngoes without saying that with regard to these situations\nmy country appeals to the community of nations to\ncontinue its multifaceted assistance for the reintegration\nand rebuilding of those two countries. This appeal is\naddressed also to all the other areas of tension in Africa\nand in the rest of the world.\nThese actions are also illustrated by our appreciation\nof and satisfaction with the progress achieved in the quest\nfor peace in the Middle East with the signing of the Taba\nAgreement in Washington; and in Central Europe as a\nresult of the new atmosphere brought about by\ndiscussions that made it possible for all the parties\ninvolved in the situation in the former Yugoslavia to meet\ntogether in New York. In our view, all these factors bear\nwitness to the fact that the international community is\nprepared to attenuate as much as possible the anguish\ncaused our peoples by the risks of war in the world.\nNevertheless, every one of us would readily agree\nthat real threats to peace in international relations still\n13\n\n\nexist today. The outline of a new world order is still hard\nfor us to grasp; it shows us the paradoxical picture of a\nfragile peace. Yet our expectations of the establishment of\nthis new world order are not fruitless. For the time being,\nGabon gives due value to the dynamics which led, at the\nglobal and regional levels, to the creation of the\nmechanisms designed to prevent conflicts.\nWhile peace has the virtue of making us feel safer,\nfreedom can open up prospects for individual and collective\ndevelopment. In the view of the founders of the United\nNations, freedom is a decisive element for the establishment\nof an environment and an overall spiritual framework\nallowing for the emergence of social progress and the\nestablishment of better living conditions. Those who signed\nthe Charter received a mandate, as it were, to create the\nconditions for this, to the benefit of the people in their care.\nThe results of this commitment to implement the principle\nof the right of peoples to self-determination and the\nprinciple of respect for human rights are known to all, just\nas we all know of, and regard highly, the actions taken by\nour Organization to inspire, to support and even to initiate\npolicies undertaken in these fields. In this context, any\npolicy contrary to this which calls these achievements into\nquestion will give rise to the reactions necessary to preserve\nthe balance between States and to restore everyone\u2019s rights.\nTherefore, our dedication to the principle of the\ninviolability of borders in Africa is a guarantee of our\nindependence and our freedom, since it shows that we\naccept freedom for other States as well.\nMy country\u2019s experience in promoting and protecting\nbasic political, cultural and social human rights in recent\nyears has been outstanding. The establishment of a State\nbased on the rule of law with a transition from a single-\nparty system to a pluralist democracy has taken place\nsmoothly. The results of this transition, and the promises\nborn of this experience for democracy in our country,\nflowed from the fact that they dovetail with our cultural\nvalues, whose spiritual foundations favour the individual\u2019s\nplace in society, as the founder of and justification for our\ncities.\nIn Gabon, dialogue is valid only for human beings\nsince it is human beings who initiate it and carry it out for\ntheir own benefit. An example of this Gabonese practice of\ndialogue was the results achieved barely a year ago at the\nmeeting held by representatives of the majority and\nopposition political parties in Paris in September and\nOctober 1994 to define together the ways and means for the\nconsensual governance of our democracy that was then\nbeing threatened. These results will be reflected in the\nsigning of the so-called Paris Agreements in the presence\nof international observers.\nSocial conflicts and confrontations between opposing\npolitical forces can be overcome by rational discussions\nand tolerance of the opinions of others. We are truly\nconvinced that coups d\u2019\u00e9tat are not relevant in present\ntimes. That is why Gabon, through its President, Omar\nBongo, firmly condemned the unfortunate events which\noccurred in Sao Tome and Principe, and more recently in\nthe Comoros.\nFreedom, security and peace are in our view the\nvery bases of our democracy. To be sure, this democracy\nis only taking its first steps, but it will undoubtedly enable\nthe Gabonese people to reach a new stage in its history\nand its political life.\nAnother dimension of the political and social\nproblems in Africa and everywhere in the world is the\nstatus of women in society. In my country, women have\nthe same rights as men. Our educational system ensures\nfree access by all school-age children to instruction; that\nis in the interest of the entire Gabonese nation. In social\nterms, then, taking into account the recent concerns\nrelating to the status of women and children, as illustrated\nin the World Summit for Children in New York in 1990,\nand the Beijing Conference in 1995, the Republic of\nGabon has made choices that are in line with the spirit of\nthe actions initiated by the United Nations.\nOnce again, I would mention the founders of our\nOrganization and praise their generosity of spirit in\nplacing the happiness of peoples in the context of\nextending freedom.\nThe solidarity advocated for States as the absolute\nprerequisite for defining ensuing strategies was designed\nto discourage them from any inclination of selfishness in\nthe implementation of those strategies.\nUnfortunately, however, we must admit that this\nlegacy has, instead, come to look more like \u201cevery man\nfor himself\u201d, a standard that has been set up as providing\nthe ways and means to find happiness. The differences\namong nations have revealed the gaps between peoples\nthe world over at the level of their development.\nHowever, in this sphere, the United Nations has tried\nto create a range of instruments and mechanisms designed\nto provide our Governments with the assistance they\nexpect. Whatever the allegiance of the peoples represented\n14\n\n\nhere, each and every one of us will acknowledge and\nappreciate, for example, the role of UNESCO in education,\nscience and culture; of the World Health Organization on\nthe basis of its contribution to the eradication of major\nendemic and pandemic diseases; or that of the United\nNations Development Programme in carrying out\ndevelopment projects.\nNevertheless, the overall verdict is still mixed. We\nbelieve that although our actions have allowed humanity to\nsurvive, they have not fully succeeded in improving the\nquality of life for most people. In both the South and the\nNorth, our world is still littered, not just with pockets but\nwith vast tracts of poverty. All our States, small or large,\nare being eaten away, to various degrees, by the cancer of\nabject poverty.\nThe United Nations recent decision to hold a world\nsummit in Copenhagen devoted to social development was\nwelcomed by Gabon, which was an active participant.\nPresident Bongo himself said that that Summit was the\nresult of an in-depth analysis of the state of extreme\npoverty in which a large part of humanity was living today.\nConsequently, for our country, the programme of\naction drawn up at the end of the Summit \u2014 which, we are\npleased to say, follows up the major guidelines already\nfound in the United Nations programme of action for the\nestablishment of a new international economic order, on the\none hand, and the major principles of \u201cAn Agenda for\nDevelopment\u201d, on the other \u2014 should be translated into\naction, as hoped.\nWe are all aware that, by the same token, this\nendeavour will require the mobilized contribution of all of\nthe countries and bodies that constitute the international\ncommunity.\nAt the close of the twentieth century, Africa alone will\nhave broken all records for underdevelopment. By way of\nexample, it has three quarters of the least developed\ncountries; it has the lowest level of growth; it is practically\nnon-existent in international trade. Unfortunately, Africa is\ntoday a continent apart, despite its enormous potential.\nIt, nevertheless, accepts the fact that responsibility for\neconomic recovery is largely in its hands and that this task\ndepends above all on its own efforts. But it is still obvious\nthat the enormity of the crisis it is going through and the\nlevel of resources needed make international support for its\nefforts necessary.\nFor Africa in general and for Gabon more\nparticularly, a more appropriate approach to the debt\nburden would favour a solution to this issue, given the\nsubstantial inverse capital flows going to our creditors as\na result of paying back our debt.\nAfrica wishes to remind the world of its commitment\nto face its responsibilities with regard to debt and debt\nservicing. This was the position adopted by our Heads of\nState at the most recent Summit of the Organization of\nAfrican Unity. Gabon supports this. However, it looks to\nthe shrewdness of its creditors and in the understandable\ninterest of all parties concerned in this issue, to help us\nobtain favourable treatment in conditions for repayment.\nGabon effectively devotes more than half of its\nannual budget to debt repayment, thereby crippling its\ndevelopment efforts \u2014 this in spite of the fact that the\nmachinery for debt reduction advocated in recent years\nhas discriminated against us by excluding us from the list\nof beneficiaries. We suggest that the reason given, based\non the high per capita gross national product, is unfair.\nThis strange singling out of Gabon, which is still\nalmost the only country in the so-called middle-income\ncategory in the southern Sahara, is not justified in reality.\nThis situation places a burden on our economy and\nthereby affects our economic relations abroad.\nThis appeal to the international community for fairer\ntreatment of my country is not a case of begging \u2014 no\nmore for Gabon than for the rest of Africa \u2014 because, as\nOmar Bongo stated at the Copenhagen summit: \u201cAfrica is\nnot asking for charity\u201d.\nIn reality, helping our credibility and viability in\neconomic and financial terms, actually strengthens the\ninternational trading system for the common good. This\nis not a matter of philanthropy but rather of common\nsense: helping the South means helping the North, and\nultimately the entire world.\nAt the end of this rapid reading before this\nAssembly, dealing with the themes of peace, freedom and\ndevelopment, my appeals to our Organization will be\nclear to all. It is expected to respond to the concerns I\nhave just expressed.\nOn the eve of the special meeting to celebrate the\nfiftieth anniversary of our Organization, I hope that all of\nits Members will realize the enormous import of this\nopportunity, for the world is changing before our very\n15\n\n\neyes. The countries represented here are also changing, at\ndifferent rates. Obviously, I cannot accept the idea that the\nUnited Nations itself could fail to keep up with this trend.\nFor this reason, the measures advocated along these\nlines by the Secretary-General of the United Nations could\nbe supplemented by others that my country would like to\nsee, from the point of view of restructuring, and therefore\nreadapting the United Nations system to the realities of\ntoday\u2019s world.\nThe present context is conducive to this. An overall\nreform of the system is required, for the security of our\npeoples, and of the States that comprise it, and in the final\nanalysis, in the interest of renewing the United Nations\nitself.\nI conclude my speech, therefore, on this note of hope.\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me first of all, and with particular gratitude, to\nextend to the President\u2019s predecessor, His Excellency Mr.\nAmara Essy, our warmest compliments for the care and\ndiscipline he displayed during his presidency of the forty-\nninth session of the General Assembly. Our compliments\nalso go to the other officers who worked with him.\nAllow me also to extend the sincere congratulations\nof the delegation of the Principality of Monaco to the new\nBureau that has just been elected and say how pleased we\nare to see this fiftieth session of the General Assembly\nunder the esteemed authority of Mr. Freitas do Amaral.\n\nThe country he represents, a country that is open to\nthe world, tolerant, accessible, culturally rich and enriched\nby the cultures it has encountered throughout its history,\ndeserved to be given this recognition. Our General\nAssembly decided to give it and we are deeply gratified.\nHis personality and great political experience at the national\nand international levels, has recognized abilities and\ndynamism should all help to ensure the success of this\nimportant session.\nIts importance is first of all symbolic. Since man\ninvented calendars, anniversaries have been occasions for\ncelebration and rejoicing, and, as many speakers have said\nbefore me, for taking stock.\nSince its inception, our Organization has lived through\nhighly complex political, economic, social and cultural\nevents and phenomena which make any appraisal difficult.\nIt position and role have grown constantly and gained in\nimportance over the past fifty years. The expectations that\npeople have for it and the hopes they place in it can be\nmeasured by the depth of the disappointment and bitterness\nthat can be seen in cases of failure or difficulty.\nHas the United Nations not always tried to respond to\nthe constant and often conflicting appeals made to it? Its\nresponses are inspired by the fundamental values that\nprevailed when the Charter was drafted in 1945. Let us not\nforget that our States, by joining the United Nations,\nrecognized the universality of these values. We must remain\ntrue to them and provide assistance whenever they are\nendangered. Recent events, still fresh in all our minds, have\nreminded us that these values have not always been\nrespected and that faith in fundamental human rights, in the\ndignity and worth of the human person, and in the equal\nrights of men and women and of nations, large and small,\nhas not always been shared. And so, at this fiftieth\nanniversary of our Organization, these values must be\nrecalled forcefully and with conviction at every opportunity\nso that these same values can be the inspiration for each of\nour resolutions, and every text we adopt.\nAbove and beyond the States that we represent and\ntheir legitimate political interests, it is individuals \u2014 often\nvulnerable and adversely affected by poverty or war \u2014\nwho must be the recipients of international cooperation. It\nis our duty to live up to their expectations.\nWhen we look at the situation in this way, whether in\nterms of the Organization as a whole or in terms of certain\nof its organs, such as the Security Council, it becomes clear\nthat there is a constant effort at adapting on the part of the\ninternational community, and a need \u2014 widely\nanticipated \u2014 to make our Organization more\nperformance-oriented, more representative and closer to\nthe concerns of its membership.\nWe have followed with interest the work of the\nvarious Working Groups set up to that end. We have\nparticipated, and we have made suggestions, inter alia,\nwith regard to equitable representation within the Security\nCouncil and an increase in its membership.\nIn recent years, there has been a significant increase\nin the membership of the United Nations, and today it\nincludes all, or almost all, nations of the Earth. And so it\nwould seem quite normal that its decision-making bodies,\nincluding the Security Council, should reflect this new\nreality. As the famous French writer and philosopher Paul\nVal\u00e9ry wisely said, we have reached the stage when the\nend of the world is beginning. For this reason, we must\nnow redouble our efforts and heighten our vigilance so\nthat our Organization may be able to respond to this\nuniversality, in a relevant manner and in all its diversity\nand richness.\nAlong with reforming its decision-making bodies, the\nUnited Nations must continue to improve its functioning\nand restructure its operations. Major efforts have been\nmade. We would thank the Secretary-General for this, and\nwe would also thank the members of the Secretariat.\nImproving the functioning of this Organization must\ntake account of the need to strengthen its multilingual\nnature. Every staff member should know at least the two\nworking languages of the Organization. Using just one\nlanguage deprives the Organization of a rich resource. If\nwe wish to really enhance the effectiveness of the\nSecretariat, we should first of all concentrate seriously on\nimproving the language abilities of staff members so that\nthey have a truly international culture and dimension.\nAs can be seen from our history, the people of\nMonaco and the Government of our Principality, like all\npeace-loving peoples, follow very closely all initiatives to\nreduce armaments and transform the arms race \u2014 which\nhas gone on too long \u2014 into a race towards disarmament.\nLet us hope that with the end of the cold war, this\napproach will be strengthened and that despite technical\nand financial problems, disarmament processes will not\nonly continue but speed up.\nWe must more than ever ensure that respect for\ninternational treaties and agreements and for international\n14\n\n\nlaw shall replace the balance of terror, and that the law thus\nserve justice.\nIt is in this spirit that we wholeheartedly welcome the\nindefinite extension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation\nof Nuclear Weapons. Our Principality was in favour of this\nextension, and so once again we would thank the parties to\nthe Treaty for this courageous decision, which was inspired\nby trust and hope. We welcome the initiative of the Powers\nthat have already entered into a commitment \u2014 which had\nbeen expected for next fall \u2014 to ban, over the short term,\nall nuclear-weapon tests. This is a major advance.\nOur Government also welcomes particularly the\ndecisions taken at the meeting, currently under way in\nVienna, aimed at establishing a moratorium on the\nproduction of anti-personnel land-mines. We trust that this\nexample will be followed widely.\nSince joining the United Nations, the Principality of\nMonaco has been co-sponsoring the resolution on assistance\nin mine clearance. By contributing financially to the\nvoluntary fund created for that purpose, my country\u2019s\nhighest authorities wished to become involved, in a\nconcrete way, in the implementation of that resolution. The\ninternational community, quite rightly, was shocked by the\ndeath and mutilation caused by these mines, which afflict\nmainly civilian populations, and children in particular.\nOur delegation would hope that significant progress\ncould be made in strengthening security and cooperation in\nthe region of the Mediterranean, in the spirit of resolution\n49/81, which we co-sponsored and which was adopted on\n15 December 1994. Our Principality hopes that we will\nalways be involved in all the initiatives relating to the\nMediterranean countries.\nWe are also ready to support all initiatives in favour\nof international cooperation relating to the peaceful uses of\nouter space and those intended to develop, in collaboration\nwith the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural\nOrganization, education and information programmes in\nsupport of disarmament. Making young people aware of\nthis issue is a fundamental guarantee for peace in the years\nto come.\nWhile general and complete disarmament, no doubt\nstill far off, may today seem utopian to some, nevertheless\nthat goal must remain our ambition. For when weapons\nawaken, their might and their destructive power are\nlimitless.\nThis year, conflicts have been particularly\ndevastating. Wars of another age have become the wars\nof our age, attacking, brutally and without distinction,\nmen, women, children and defenceless old people.\nThe Government of the Principality is thus resolutely\nin favour of strengthening preventive diplomacy on the\npart of the United Nations. We would thank the\nSecretary-General for the initiatives he has already taken\nto promote the settlement of many disputes and to avoid\nthe eruption or continuation of conflicts. The \u201cSupplement\nto An Agenda for Peace'\u201d is an irreplaceable source of\nideas, suggestions and wise solutions.\nIt is no longer tolerable that the Blue Helmets be\nmistreated, humiliated, taken hostage and used as human\nshields with no means of defending themselves. Those\nmen and women are no doubt ready to sacrifice their life,\nbut not their dignity.\nThis is a particularly appropriate time to stress \u2014\nbecause recently the Organization has been criticized very\nsharply \u2014 how much it has contributed to the successful\nsolution of disputes, which have sometimes been very\ndifficult ones, and how much courage has been needed to\ntake certain decisions and to carry out certain operations\nsuccessfully.\nThe hopes for peace coming out of the Middle East\nand Bosnia and Herzegovina represent a significant\nrecognition of the courage that has been demonstrated,\nand they are an invitation to us to continue to persevere\nand to be optimistic. The report of the Secretary-General\non the work of the Organization reminds us, in a very\ntimely way, of this, mentioning the 24 operations\ncurrently under way in the areas of preventive diplomacy,\nthe restoration and maintenance of peace, and the four\nmajor operations, which he describes as multifaceted.\nCoordination within the Secretariat between the three\nDepartments involved in peace-keeping operations\nresponds to current needs and concerns, a fact we note\nwith great satisfaction.\nWhen diplomacy, at the end of its tether, cannot\nprevail and conflict erupts, then barbarism triumphs. No\nlaw of war, no humanitarian law, can control it. The most\nvulnerable human beings and those without weapons are\nnot spared. The only way to help them is by humanitarian\nassistance.\n15\n\n\nIn conditions that are always very difficult and\nsometimes dangerous, many humanitarian operations have\nbeen conducted in a most admirable way in the last few\nmonths. Men and women have lost their lives, and I pay\ntribute to their suffering and to their memory. I would pay\ntribute in particular to the \u201cblue helmets\u201d, the soldiers of\npeace, and to the Department of Humanitarian Affairs, the\nOffice of the United Nations High Commissioner for\nRefugees and to UNICEF, as well as to the many non-\ngovernmental organizations, some well-known, some less\nwell-known, that have all worked tirelessly, constantly and\nwith determination to protect, feed and provide medical and\nhealth care to populations that are adrift, assaulted by\nruthless armed conflict.\nThis year, the Principality of Monaco contributed a\nlarge percentage of its public efforts to financial\ncontributions in the humanitarian and social fields. We will\ncontinue to do so, hoping that the action that is taken to\nthis end can be completed as the conflicts themselves cease.\nWe would like to lend our support, and this is in the\nspirit of the suggestions made by the Chairman of the\ndelegation of Monaco, His Serene Highness, Crown Prince\nAlbert, to the General Assembly at its forty-ninth session,\nto the thinking now under way on the strengthening of the\ncoordination of emergency humanitarian assistance provided\nby the United Nations.\nThe international Tribunals created on the initiative of\nthe United Nations designed to prosecute those responsible\nfor crimes against international humanitarian law in the\nterritories of the former Yugoslavia and of Rwanda must be\nquickly established and enabled to function so as not to\ndisappoint the hopes that have been placed in them.\nThe idea of an international criminal court also\ndeserves consideration and support.\nHumanitarian actions and respect for international\nhumanitarian law are corollaries in a period of armed\nconflict to the struggle being waged by the United Nations\nto ensure general and universal respect for human rights.\nSince the 1993 World Conference on Human Rights\nin Vienna, significant progress seems to be under way.\nWith human and material resources that are far from\nsufficient to meet actual needs, the Centre for Human\nRights, thanks to the commitment and the extensive\nexperience of its staff, is successfully continuing its work.\nThe increase in the number and the quality of the\nconsultants and the technical assistance provided plays a\nmajor role in ensuring that human rights are no longer\njust a concept, but become a reality. The presence in\nmany countries of specialists working in varied areas,\nsuch as training, education, legislative reform and public\ninformation is one way of anchoring human rights and,\nthereby, the state of law in society on a day-to-day basis.\nThe dispatch of observers to certain troubled regions\nof the world today is also an excellent initiative. We hope\nthat it will continue, because it strengthens the moral\npresence of the United Nations. The creation of the post\nof High Commissioner is also in keeping with this\napproach, and we would encourage his actions.\nInternational cooperation in favour of the respect for\nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms, which is one of\nthe basic vocations of this Organization, is being\nstrengthened thereby.\nRights that are applied to certain categories but\nwhich should remain universal \u2014 as the Fourth World\nConference on Women in Beijing has just rightly recalled\nby describing women\u2019s rights as being inseparable from\nhuman rights \u2014 must be recognized and strengthened in\ntheir application.\nThe implementation of international Conventions\nrelating to those rights is an essential element in this\nstrengthening process. The committees set up pursuant to\nthose instruments are the focus of this process and of the\narrangements made to implement it. They must be given\nthe means to act and to react.\nThe Government of Monaco is particularly involved\nin the implementation of the Convention on the Rights of\nthe Child of 20 November 1989, and that of the\nInternational Convention on the Elimination of All Forms\nof Racial Discrimination of 21 December 1965, to which\nthe Principality of Monaco has just become a party.\nThe human condition in the twenty-first century will\ndepend to a large extent not only on respect for civil and\npolitical rights, but also on the promotion of economic,\nsocial and cultural rights.\nIt is in terms of human rights that we have to look\nat development, a point made in the 1993 Vienna\nDeclaration.\nThe recent World Summit for Social Development\nin Copenhagen also adopted this approach. My\n16\n\n\nGovernment noted with interest the conclusions of the\nFourth World Conference on Women, which has just ended\nin Beijing.\nAll of this leads us to think, as does the Secretary-\nGeneral, that development must first of all be recognized as\na primary task of our age.\nThe fundamental objective must be to improve the\nstandards of living of people throughout the world,\nincluding the developed countries, where an increasingly\nlarge part of the population is excluded from the benefits of\nprogress.\nThe satisfaction of basic needs and the elimination of\npoverty, hunger, sickness and ignorance must be goals that\nwe constantly seek to attain, using all available means.\nThe Government of Monaco devotes a major part of\nits resources to social assistance, particularly for women\nand children, those who are most in need.\nThe celebration in 1996 of the International Year for\nthe Eradication of Poverty will be an excellent occasion for\nstrengthening the implementation of these\nrecommendations.\nRecent work on the \u201cAgenda for Development\u201d has\nattracted close attention. For the Principality of Monaco,\ndevelopment must above all be sustainable and based on\nbalanced economic exchange and trade, harmonious\nregional integration and careful protection of the\nenvironment.\nThe implementation of Agenda 21, the Conventions\nand resolutions adopted at Rio de Janeiro in support of the\nenvironment and development, is in our view a priority.\nThe General Assembly has decided that 1998 shall be\nthe Year of the Oceans. The people of Monaco, like all\npeoples that love the sea, are eagerly awaiting this event.\nThrough our history, our traditions and our economy\nMonaco, like many other countries in the world, depends to\na large extent on the sea and its resources, whether these be\nliving, commercial, tourist or industrial.\nProtecting this valuable element of the environment\nagainst all kinds of thoughtless pollution and over-\nexploitation is a major concern. Enough must be done at\nthe regional and international levels to protect it. In the\nMediterranean, the Principality of Monaco is doing what it\ncan, along with its closest neighbours France and Italy,\nwithin the framework of international agreements with\npractical and specific goals.\nThe year 1998 must be an opportunity for us to\nbecome more aware and to launch new multidisciplinary\nand well-planned programmes so that the next century\nwill not see an irreversible worsening of the state of the\nseas and oceans. In this connection, we are glad that the\nUnited Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) is\nwilling to act as the secretariat for the world programme\nof action to protect the marine environment against land-\nbased pollution. The Government of Monaco will be\ninterested in this programme and any other action to\neliminate organic pollution from the marine environment.\nThe Oceanographic Museum of Monaco is involved\nin the international initiative to protect coral reefs. We\nhave organized an exhibition to make the public more\naware of the need to protect coral, which is particularly\nsensitive to all forms of pollution and which, to develop,\nrequires a healthy and protected environment. The UNEP\nprogramme on regional seas deserves encouragement.\nI cannot conclude my statement without mentioning\nthe very serious financial crisis that the Organization is\ngoing through. The measures taken by the Secretary-\nGeneral are mere palliatives. If all Member States were to\nlive up to their commitments there would be no problem;\nthere would be no need for working groups or committees\nof experts, which, after all, involve additional expenditure\nfor the Organization.\nIn conclusion, I should like to repeat something that\nwas said by a famous politician: the United Nations, like\nnations, shapes its own future; nothing good comes to it\nby chance; those that serve it are those that develop their\ninner strength.\n"

        "file_text": "At the outset I have pleasure in extending to\nMr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral and to his friendly country,\nPortugal, my sincere congratulations on his election as\nPresident of the General Assembly for this session, which\nmarks the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations, when\nthe Organization is celebrating its golden jubilee. In\nwishing Mr. Freitas do Amaral success in conducting the\nproceedings of this session, I assure him of my delegation\u2019s\nreadiness to cooperate fully with him towards achieving the\ndesired objectives.\nI should like also to take this opportunity to express\nmy thanks and appreciation to Mr. Freitas do Amaral\u2019s\npredecessor, Mr. Amara Essy, for his dedicated and sincere\nefforts in guiding the proceedings of the last session.\nIt is also a pleasure to express my deep appreciation\nto the Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for his\ntireless efforts to enhance the international Organization\u2019s\nstanding and role and to enable it to carry out its great\nresponsibilities and tasks.\nThe United Nations was established 50 years ago\nwith the purpose of becoming the effective means of\nsaving humanity from the scourge of war which had\nplagued the century. The Organization was also designed\nto serve as a mechanism aimed at developing a new\ninternational order based on justice and equality for all\nand the promotion of human and cultural interaction\namongst the world\u2019s various peoples in the framework of\na secure international community.\nStates and peoples, in their desire for security,\nstability and cooperation, supported the principles\nenshrined in the Charter, including those which call for\nensuring the sovereign equality of and mutual respect\nbetween States, refraining from the threat or use of force,\nentrenching the principles of settling disputes by peaceful\nmeans, respecting every State\u2019s territorial integrity, and\nrefraining from interfering in the internal affairs of others.\nGuided by these principles, the United Nations has\nachieved numerous accomplishments at the political,\neconomic and social levels. Many nations and peoples,\nwith the support of the United Nations, have been able to\nachieve political independence, attain their legitimate\nrights and implement development programmes.\nThe 50 year experience of the United Nations\nembodies profound indications of the future of a changing\nworld in which the enormous interacting developments\nhave not yet reached the limit. The most prominent\namong those signs is, perhaps, the end of the era of\nconfrontation between East and West at a time when the\nhuman race is on the threshold of a new century. The\nprofound significance of these developments is that the\nprevailing political climate has given rise to a situation\nthat favours the correcting of certain trends in\ninternational relations and their development in a manner\nthat takes into account the new circumstances and\nchanges in several regions of the world.\nIn the context of these historical premises, world\nPowers have been concerned that changes might lead\nthem to proceed in disparate directions which, it was\nfeared, would make it difficult for the international\ncommunity to check the unrestrained pace of the changes\nso engendered and control their effects on world peace\nand security. Thus it becomes essential to develop a\nbalancing strategy for joint international action, especially\nnow that interdependence and multilateralism must form\nthe basis of cooperation in international relations.\n18\n\n\nThis political reality was given expression on 31\nJanuary 1992, when the Security Council \u2014 for the first\ntime \u2014 held a meeting at the level of Heads of State and\nGovernment. The Council then requested the Secretary-\nGeneral to prepare a report containing analyses and\nrecommendations concerning ways of enhancing and\nstrengthening the capabilities of the United Nations in the\nareas of preventive diplomacy, peacemaking and peace-\nkeeping. Recently, on the occasion of the fiftieth\nanniversary of the United Nations, the Secretary-General\nhas submitted the important \u201cSupplement to An Agenda\nfor Peace'\u201d, in which he set out his views and thoughts as\na contribution to the continuous drive to enhance the\nOrganization\u2019s capability to face up to threats to\ninternational peace and security.\nThe significance of this new tendency was underscored\nduring the United Nations Conference on Environment and\nDevelopment, held in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 and its Rio\nDeclaration on Environment and Development, Agenda 21\nas well as in many other important international\nconventions relating to development and the environment.\nIt was further confirmed during the International\nConference on Population and Development, held in Cairo\nlast year. Both the World Summit for Social Development,\nheld in Copenhagen, and the Fourth World Conference on\nWomen, held recently in Beijing, confirmed the principle of\ninterdependence and recognized its importance.\nThese world conferences and meetings have made the\nUnited Nations a global forum for the international politics\nof multilateralism. Efforts are now being directed towards\naddressing the problems of the future, such as\nenvironmental pollution and population explosion, in\naddition to economic and social crises and other dilemmas\nof a universal character.\nThis increasing tendency to act in accordance with the\nprinciples of interdependence and multilateralism is\nundoubtedly a positive one that is in consonance with the\npurposes of the Charter. However, certain aspects of the\ncurrent international situation raise a number of\nfundamental questions concerning the role of the United\nNations and its influence on the current developments on\nthe international scene which serve as pointers to the shape\nof future relations between States.\nSuch questioning includes, for example: How will the\nOrganization steer a course amid the new features of the\nmodern political topography which is changing due to\nincessant strategic changes of international policies? How\nwill the major Powers identify the role of the United\nNations in the area of interdependence and international\nmultilateralism? And how will they deal with crises in\nareas of high tension around the world?\nIt is obvious that such questioning has to do, in\nessence, with two fundamental issues. The first is the\nfuture of collective security, as envisioned in the Charter,\nfor the remaining part of this century and during the next\ncentury. The second is the mechanism for international\neconomic and social cooperation to which the major\nindustrial States will agree.\nA search into the legacy of the United Nations\nduring half a century leads us to say that these two issues\nwill constitute the major characteristics of international\nrelations in the twenty-first century. The problem of the\nrealpolitik policies pursued by the Powers that influence\nthe formulation of international relations is that they do\nnot seem to be in harmony with the principle of collective\nsecurity. The problem of international economic and\nsocial cooperation lies in the fact that the concepts of\neconomic and social development held by the wealthy\nindustrialized countries are at variance with those of the\ndeveloping countries vis-\u00e0-vis the economic and social\naspects of development issues. In our view, this difference\nof outlook creates obstacles that not only impede the\nimplementation and development of international\ncooperation but also affect the manner in which economic\nand social problems are dealt with.\nThe two issues of collective security and\ninternational economic and social cooperation should be\naccorded an increasing importance since they embody the\nsolid foundation of stability and progress in a world that\nis in a state of flux. The need to attach such importance\nto those two issues arises from the fact that, for over 50\nyears, the international community has not been able to\nreach consensus on how to put into practice the principle\nof collective security in line with the vision of the\nCharter. In so far as international economic and social\ncooperation is concerned, the North-South dialogue has\nnot led to any positive result in over three decades.\nGiven this fact, the world has to evolve new\nperceptions on how to address the issues of collective\nsecurity and international economic and social cooperation\nin the context of a practical perspective that takes into\naccount the new changes that have taken place in the\nworld.\nIn our view, it is possible, once the international\ncommunity musters the necessary political will, to put\n19\n\n\ninto practice important aspects of the principle of collective\nsecurity along the following lines:\nThe creation of a mechanism that meets on a regular\nbasis within the framework of the Security Council to\nmonitor and detect threats to world peace and security.\nThe development and better use of the mechanisms of\npreventive diplomacy in preventing, containing or\npre-empting conflicts before they develop into serious\nhostilities.\nThe development, in all seriousness, of the ideas and\nconcepts embodied in Chapter VII of the Charter, in the\nlight of the international community\u2019s experience, to\nbecome the basis of dealing with aggression as it arises.\nThe utilization of the capabilities of regional\norganizations in the context of United Nations cooperation\nwith such organizations in the maintenance of world peace\nand security.\nAs regards international economic and social\ncooperation, this too requires the existence of the political\nwill, especially on the part of the wealthy industrialized\ncountries, to create an equitable global economic\nenvironment that may contribute to the achievement of\nstability and prosperity for all States and peoples.\nWe believe that the gap which exists, in the areas of\neconomic growth and social advancement, between the\nwealthy industrialized countries, with their enormous\neconomic resources, and the developing countries, is among\nthe most chronic and significant problems that face the\ninternational community.\nRegrettably, the commitments to implement the\ndevelopment policies and strategies agreed upon in the\nUnited Nations with a view to narrowing that gap have not\nbeen honoured. It goes without saying that the United\nNations will not be able to discharge its mandate in an\nenvironment fraught with disparities, because the poverty,\nunemployment and lack of productive employment that are\nrampant throughout the world are negative factors in the\narea of development. Proceeding from its awareness of this\nreality, the United Nations has convened the World Summit\non Social Development in Copenhagen to address the\nurgent and serious issues of social development that face\nmankind. We believe that the implementation of the\npolicies set out in the Summit\u2019s Declaration and\nProgramme of Action should take place within the context\nof the religious principles, national legislation, customs\nand traditions of every State.\nIt is essential at this stage to reopen the dialogue\nwithin the United Nations system between developed and\ndeveloping countries concerning all development matters,\non the basis of the commitments set out in the\nDeclaration on International Economic Cooperation and\nthe International Development Strategy for the Fourth\nUnited Nations Development Decade. To that end, a new\nand practical development plan has to be adopted with a\nview to ensuring compliance with the decisions of the\nvarious United Nations development conferences, so that\nthe desired objectives of those decisions may be achieved.\nWe are convinced that international cooperation\ncould be enhanced and strengthened through the adoption\nof policies leading to the activation of the United Nations\nrole in the area of economic and social cooperation by\nmeans of addressing such world problems as development\nand environment. Also, world trade mechanisms should\nbe developed in accordance with the common interests of\nStates and in an equitable manner that takes into account\nthe requirements of development and the economic\nproblems of the developing countries, accords due\nattention to the socio-political aspects of the economic\nproblems that beset those countries and aims at\nconsolidating the foundations of their economic security.\nNotwithstanding its accomplishments, on the one\nhand, and, on the other, the obstacles and failures it has\nencountered for reasons beyond its control, the United\nNations now finds itself facing a new challenge. This new\nchallenge forces it to deal with crises and problems\ncaused by ethnic, national and even religious and cultural\nconflicts and clashes between parties that belonged to\nStates and territories which had originally been unified in\naccordance with agreements reached in the wake of this\ncentury\u2019s wars.\nIn view of the tense regional and international\natmosphere caused by the eruption of those heretofore\ndormant volcanoes and the ensuing changes brought about\nby such eruption, it has become essential to enhance the\nrole of the United Nations and provide it with the\nnecessary means of dealing effectively with such crises\nand resolving them before they develop into devastating\nwars between the sons of this or that country such as\nthose we now witness in Afghanistan, Somalia, the\nBalkans and other parts of the world where peoples are\nsuffering destruction and destitution.\n20\n\n\nIn addition to the new issues that the United Nations\nnow faces in the wake of the cold war, there is a host of\nregional and international questions that continue to be\ncause for concern and require the attention of our\nOrganization. Top of the list is the situation in the Gulf\nregion which, in the recent past, witnessed two destructive\nwars whose consequences continue to affect adversely the\nregion\u2019s political and economic conditions and to jeopardize\nits security and stability. Proceeding from our eagerness to\npreserve security and stability in this vital region of the\nworld, we call upon all parties to pay heed to its\nimportance as an area where international interests criss-\ncross and as an area of strategic importance to world trade.\nIn the light of these facts, we stress the need for Iraq\nto comply with Security Council resolutions concerning the\nState of Kuwait and the release of Kuwaiti and other\nprisoners of war and detainees. While we call upon Iraq to\nrespond fully to the behests of international legality, we\nmust voice our concern over the territorial integrity,\nsovereignty and unity of Iraq which must be preserved and\nexpress sympathy with the brotherly Iraqi people who\nendure difficult economic and social conditions that should\nend once their causes cease to exist.\nThe persistence of the dispute between the United\nArab Emirates and the Islamic Republic of Iran over the\nquestion of sovereignty over the islands of Abu Mousa,\nGreater Tunb and Lesser Tunb is regrettable in view of its\nadverse effects on the Gulf region\u2019s security and stability.\nConsequently, Bahrain calls upon the Islamic Republic\nof Iran to respond to the United Arab Emirates call to seek\na solution to the question of the islands through serious\nbilateral talks, or by any of the other peaceful means that\nare available for the settlement of disputes between States\nby mutual consent.\nThe Middle East has embarked on a new historical\nphase wherein optimism holds sway with the adoption of\nthe principle of negotiation and respect for law as a means\nto settle disputes between States instead of war, violence\nand occupation of territories by force. The peace process in\nthe Middle East has taken significant steps since the historic\nWashington meeting 13 September 1993, which resulted in\nthe signing of the Agreement on Principles between the\nPalestinians and Israel. It was followed by the signing of\nthe Peace Treaty between Jordan and Israel on 26 October\n1994 and the signing of the second phase of the Agreement\nof Principles on the expansion of Palestinian self-rule\nbetween the Palestinians and Israel in Washington on 28\nSeptember 1995. The sparkle of optimism that has glittered\non the horizon should not be allowed to die out as a\nresult of the Israeli settlement policies that aim at\nchanging the demography of the occupied Arab territories,\nparticularly Al-Quds, in order to create a new reality.\nBahrain welcomes these steps and reaffirms its\nsupport for the Middle East peace process. It also\nsupports the endeavours and efforts that aim at reaching\na just, comprehensive and durable solution based on the\nprinciple of land for peace as well as Security Council\nresolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). Proceeding from\nthis, Bahrain reaffirms its support for the position taken\nby the Syrian Arab Republic regarding the restoration of\nits full sovereignty over its territories in the Syrian Golan\nthat has been occupied since 1967. It is also important\nthat the peace process should be reactivated on the\nLebanese track and that Israel should be compelled to\ncomply with Security Council resolution 425 (1978). For\nif peace is to prevail, it should include all parties without\nexception.\nWe appeal to all the parties involved in the dispute\nin Somalia to allow the creation of a secure climate that\nis conducive to the continuation of political efforts and\nhumanitarian activities. Such continuation depends on the\ncooperation of those parties and on their adherence to the\nprinciple of dialogue and understanding in order to\nachieve a political settlement that would ensure the\nrestoration of peace, security and stability to this sister\nnation.\nThe State of Bahrain has, from the beginning,\nfollowed with utmost attention and deepest concern the\nsituation in Bosnia and Herzegovina, along with all the\nhuman tragedies and injustices resulting from the policies\nof aggression and criminal acts, including killings,\ndeportations and ethnic cleansing, committed by the Serb\naggressors against the people of Bosnia. The crisis has\ntaken several turns and twists and has been accompanied\nby political moves by regional and international parties\nthat have almost deprived the international community of\ncredibility.\nBahrain has supported all United Nations resolutions\nrelating to Bosnia and Herzegovina. It has endorsed all\nthe efforts and initiatives undertaken by the United\nNations, as well as other organizations and all those who\ndesire peace and uphold justice.\nAs the Serbs have gone too far in their aggression\nand in defying the will of the international community in\npursuit of their expansionist and aggressive schemes that\n21\n\n\nhave been exposed to all and rejected by all, we see a ray\nof light on the horizon which gives cause for hope that, at\nlong last, a solution for this human tragedy may be at hand\nand might finally redeem the international community\u2019s\nsilence over the plight of the Bosnian people.\nBahrain supports the positive developments that are\ntaking place now in Bosnia and Herzegovina. It calls upon\nthe international community and the Security Council to\nmaintain pressure on the Serb aggressors towards\ncompliance with United Nations resolutions and accepting\na just and equitable solution for all parties. In particular,\nthe solution should be just and equitable for the Republic\nof Bosnia and Herzegovina, whose people have suffered\nmaterial losses and have been subjected to inhuman\nsuffering as a result of the occupation of parts of their\nterritories.\nWhile we voice deep concern over the ongoing\nconflict in Afghanistan, we should like to call upon the\nparties involved in the conflict to resort to reason and logic\nand, thereby, reach a cease-fire and work for peace,\nstability and national reconciliation.\nThe United Nations has deployed continuous efforts\nover the past few years towards the settlement of the\nCyprus problem. In this connection, we should like to\nreiterate our support for the efforts of the Secretary-General\nthat aim at reaching a just resolution of the problem in\naccordance with the provisions of the relevant Security\nCouncil resolutions.\nBahrain, having supported the Treaty on the Non-\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and the objectives\nthereof,is of the opinion that the Treaty, being an\ninstrument of international peace and security, should apply\nuniversally with no exceptions or special considerations.\nWe should like, meanwhile, to stress the need for upholding\nthe Treaty, adherence to its provisions and pursuit of its\nobjectives. Bahrain views Security Council resolution 984\n(1995), despite the limited nature of the guarantees it\nembodies, as a first positive step towards security\nguarantees that are applicable to all, for States which do not\npossess nuclear weapons.\nBahrain supported the initiative of making the Middle\nEast a zone free of nuclear and other weapons of mass\ndestruction on the basis of its belief in the importance of\npeace, security and confidence building amongst all States\nof the region. It has also endorsed the resolution adopted by\nthe conference of the parties to the NPT and the arms\nlimitations Treaty, despite its shortcomings. We are\nconfident that a Middle East zone free of nuclear and\nweapons of mass destruction would enhance the peace\nprocess and lead to a situation wherein enormous\nfinancial resources would be saved and channelled\ntowards the economic prosperity and social development\nof the peoples of the region.\nRegional cooperation has become one of the\nnecessities of our modern world in view of the\nintertwined interests of the peoples of the world. It is thus\na complementary part of, rather than a substitute for\ninternational cooperation. It serves today as an effective\nmeans for the promotion of economic prosperity and\nmutual understanding with a view to establishing strong\nrelations based on mutual trust, good-neighbourliness and\nnon-interference in the internal affairs of others.\nThe Arab Gulf States have long recognized the\nimportance of regional cooperation amongst them in\nenabling them to face the imminent risks that beset the\nregion. More than 15 years ago, they established the Gulf\nCooperation Council with a view to reinvigorating Gulf\njoint action and strengthening the historical and brotherly\nties between the Gulf States on the basis of the unity of\nobjectives and a common destiny. The Council\u2019s march\nhas witnessed positive developments in the fields of\ncoordination and cooperation amongst its member States.\nThe resolutions of the fifteenth summit which Bahrain\nhad the honour of hosting and presiding over have\nstrengthened this march. The summit had historic\nsignificance in that it addressed crucial Gulf issues by\nadopting resolutions that reaffirmed the determination to\nwiden the scope of cooperation, to surmount obstacles and\nto settle all outstanding matters within the Council and\nthe unified Gulf family. Brotherly and friendly States\nhave welcomed these steps and expressed the hope that\nthe same spirit would apply to all issues so that all the\nStates and peoples of the region may reap the benefits of\nsecurity, stability and prosperity.\nThe Governments of the States members of the\nCouncil have undertaken to continue to promote all\naspects of cooperation between their States and with other\neconomic groups, to look forward positively to the\nprospects of future work and to develop strategic visions\nthat take into consideration the interests and priorities of\nthe other members of the Council and those of other\nStates in the interests of peace, security and stability in\nthe region and in the world at large.\nThe strengthening of the United Nations role and\nincreasing its capabilities and effectiveness require the\n22\n\n\ndeveloping of its bodies, including the Security Council, the\norgan concerned with international peace and security. The\nneed to develop the work of the Council has become an\nimportant issue that has the unanimous support of Member\nStates in view of the current international changes. We\nbelieve that such development should reflect the equitable\ngeographic representation of all regional groups in order to\nincrease the effectiveness and level of efficiency of the\nOrganization and to achieve balance in the Council, so that\nits membership may be representative of the world\u2019s\ndifferent cultures. As member of this international\nOrganization, Bahrain looks forward to participating in the\nwork of the Council during the period of its membership\nscheduled for 1998-1999.\nWe all aspire after a world of security, cooperation\nand peace. Our international Organization, equipped as it is\nwith its membership\u2019s intellectual and cultural values and\nwith the high principles and noble objectives enshrined in\nits Charter, is quite capable of satisfying this aspiration.\nHowever, in order for the United Nations to do so, we, its\nMembers, must give the Organization our full support on\nthe occasion of its fiftieth anniversary so that it may\nachieve in our behalf what we all desire, namely, justice\nand peace.\n"

        "file_text": "It is only right to begin by thanking the\noutgoing President, Minister Amara Essy, who has done so\nmuch for our Organization during the past year, and by\ncongratulating the incoming President, Mr. Diogo Freitas do\nAmaral. On behalf of the people and the Government of\nAndorra, I wish him every success and good fortune in his\nimportant task. I have no doubt that this distinguished\npersonality from the Iberian peninsula, for whom I have\ngreat respect and fraternal esteem, will take the helm of this\nAssembly with a firm hand.\nFor the last 50 years Heads of State, Heads of\nGovernment, Ministers and Ambassadors have been coming\nbefore this General Assembly of the United Nations to set\nout, with hope and with passion, their desire for world\npeace and the development of our planet. Year after year\ndignitaries from all corners of the globe have met in New\nYork to reiterate the ideals conceived in San Francisco five\ndecades ago. It is thus an honour and a privilege for me to\ndo the same today, as Minister for Foreign Affairs of the\nPrincipality of Andorra, a very old and very small nation,\na State that is the fruit of 700 years of peace and\nindependence.\nThe celebration of anniversaries allows people to\npause briefly to look back on their past, to reflect, to draw\nconclusions and to try to better prepare their future. Fifty\nyears after the horrors of the Second World War, \u201cWe the\npeoples of the United Nations\u201d now have the task of\nreaffirming the importance of our Organization by\nconsolidating its founding principles and giving impetus to\nthe reform of the United Nations so as to make it a modern,\nefficient instrument for the new international order that has\narisen since the end of the cold war.\nThe founding principles of the United Nations could\nbe summed up as follows: equality of States, tolerance, the\npeaceful settlement of disputes and the promotion of\ndevelopment.\nThe principle of the equality of States is dear to all\nsmall States. The preamble to the Charter of the United\nNations refers to all nations, large and small. In the\nGeneral Assembly each State has one vote.\nA sovereign State is not only a group \u2014 whatever\nits size \u2014 of people; it is a history, a language, the will\nof a people, a sense of independence \u2014 in a word, a\ncommunity of human beings. Some States, like ours,\nAndorra, have only 60,000 inhabitants. Others have more\nthan a billion. But all have the right to speak and vote at\nthe United Nations. And, just as peace comes into being\nwhen the powerful respect the small, the rule of law\nbecomes reality in international affairs when all are\ntreated as equals and when parties can solve their\ndifferences at the negotiating table, not on the field of\ndevastation that results from the use of force.\nLast year, the Head of Government of Andorra\nstressed from this very rostrum that by their very nature,\nsmall States intrinsically and essentially maintain the\nvalues of respect for diversity and of peaceful\ncoexistence. To create a world balanced by the rule of\nlaw in a world of instincts, exchanges must be based on\nthe principle of equality between States.\nNevertheless, the principle of equality should not be\nreduced to the formula \u201cone State, one vote\u201d. The\nprinciple of equality springs from the desire to understand\nthe other, to allow diversity and to exchange different\nvisions of humankind and society. The principle of\nequality derives from the concept of tolerance. In this\nInternational Year of Tolerance, we must be particularly\naware of the central position of this idea. The United\nNations cannot exist without tolerance. It would surely be\nabsurd to meet in this Assembly if all that were to come\nout of it was the prevention and outlawing of the opinions\nof others. Though it is sometimes considered less heroic\nthan force, diplomacy is the supreme instrument we have\nin this forum, an instrument for respect and\nunderstanding.\nWe in Andorra have resorted to diplomacy from\nhistorical necessity from very early times; these 700 years\nof peace of which we are so proud are probably the\nresult. We have also had to be tolerant and to respect\nothers because, during the numerous conflicts that have\nshaken the European continent over the centuries, we\nhave sheltered on our territory those in search of asylum,\nfrom whichever side they came. We have learned, I\nrepeat, of necessity, being weak and humble like all small\nStates, how to differ without imposing ourselves.\n14\n\n\nLet us give tolerance the importance it deserves as a\nfounding principle of the United Nations. But tolerance\ndoes not mean laissez faire. Just as John Stuart Mill set the\nlimits of individual freedom at the point at which that\nfreedom infringed on the liberty of others, tolerance is\nlimited only by intolerance. The United Nations has the\npower to say \u201cno\u201d to those States and peoples who do not\nrespect the religious, political, moral and artistic convictions\nof others; \u201cno\u201d to those States and peoples who do not\nrespect minorities, be they national or of any other kind,\nand their languages, which are an essential element of\ncultural transmission; \u201cno\u201d, above all, when repression is\naccompanied by the use of force and by cruelty, torture and\nother unspeakable acts. That is why, since joining the\nUnited Nations, my country has attached such importance\nto the Third Committee of the General Assembly and to\nquestions of human rights. Last year, Andorra took an\nactive part in the debate on capital punishment, applying\nthe constitutional ideas approved by its people, which loves\nlife and believes in it.\nThe United Nations was not built in a vacuum of\nvalues \u2014 quite the contrary. When, in June 1945, the right\nwords were being sought in San Francisco for the United\nNations Charter, those that were found were based on a\nvery clear vision of the dignity of the human being with a\nuniversal vocation. The Universal Declaration of Human\nRights, adopted by the United Nations on 10 December\n1948, made clear once and for all what was, is and will be\nacceptable and desirable, and what is not, in order that the\ninalienable dignity of every human being should be\nrespected and the limits of tolerance demarcated by\ndefining what we consider to be intolerable.\nFor instance, we find intolerable the ethnic and\nreligious intolerance that leads to disasters like those which\nthe horror-struck international community has been obliged\nto witness in the territories that were once part of\nYugoslavia. To face up to these challenges, the United\nNations has made a considerable effort in recent years to\ncarry out large-scale operations to keep the peace. The\nSecretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, informed us\non 3 January this year in his supplement to \u201cAn Agenda for\nPeace\u201d of the considerable increase in the deployment of\nmilitary personnel since 1988. On 31 January of that year,\n9,570 \u201cblue helmets\u201d were engaged in peace-keeping\noperations; as at 16 December last year, there were 73,393.\nThe near non-use of the veto in the Security Council\nsince the end of the cold war has encouraged this growth in\ndeployment. Very often, unfortunately, we hear so much\ntalk of the failures of United Nations operations that we\nforget to mention the successes. When we now celebrate\nthe fiftieth anniversary of the Organization, we should\nproclaim it aloud: the role of the United Nations has been\nessential, and the results are highly positive. Let us not\nask the United Nations to do what the Organization\ncannot do, and has no vocation to do, making it the target\nof criticisms better levelled at the paralysis of Member\nStates. The United Nations is and will be what the\nMember States wish it to be, neither more nor less, and\nwithout miracles.\nThe complexity of the conflicts now afflicting the\nworld, as the Secretary-General has on several occasions\npointed out, lies in the fact that most of them are conflicts\nwithin the borders of States, or former States. This makes\nthem more complicated than the conflicts we were\naccustomed to during the years of the cold war, mainly\nbecause in many cases the target for destruction is the\ncivilian population, and secondly because the task of the\nhumanitarian organizations and the soldiers sent to keep\nthe peace is not respected by the parties to the conflict,\nwhich consider them as abetting the enemy.\nThe action for peace taken by the United Nations, an\nOrganization founded on the ruins of a ferocious war,\nmust be constant. It is our imperative duty to eliminate\nwar and to cut off conflicts at the root. We all know the\nrecommendations listed by the Secretary-General in his\n\u201cAn Agenda for Peace\u201d, so I shall not repeat them. But\nI will underline the importance in the opinion of my\nGovernment of preventive diplomacy. Precisely because\nAndorra came into being as a result of a peace agreement\nsigned in 1278, which made our territory completely\nneutral and which called for the destruction of all castles\nand warlike fortifications, we can well understand the\npossibility of stopping conflicts in time by means of\npeace agreements that neutralize the power to harm of the\ncontenders by removing both parties\u2019 access to\narmaments.\nBut the United Nations and we, its Members, must\nhave the courage to act when the first signs of a conflict\nlead us to suspect its existence. The world today needs an\ninternational authority to facilitate dialogue, to suggest\ncompromises acceptable to the parties to the conflict \u2014\nabove all, when the conflict is in its initial stages \u2014 and\nto confirm the agreements reached by negotiation. The\nUnited Nations has demonstrated that it is such an\ninstitution, and it would be unjust not to recognize this\ngreat merit during this anniversary. Let us imagine a\nworld without the United Nations, where force\npredominated over law, where there were no standard\n15\n\n\nuniversal values for which to strive, where the human\ncommunity, which is capable of the highest and most noble\nacts, fell into a vortex of egoism, war and destruction. The\nUnited Nations is not optional in this world of\ninterdependent States, but indispensable.\nPlease allow me at this stage to evaluate the relevance\nof Andorra\u2019s modern development in this regard. As I have\nsaid, Andorra is a land of peace, welcome and friendship.\nDuring the more than 700 years of its existence with its\nown national identity, particularly in this century, when\nwars have shaken our neighbour States and Europe,\nAndorra has been a place of refuge, of asylum and of\npeaceful coexistence. It is precisely now, when 50 years\nhave passed since the founding of the United Nations as a\nresult of the events of that tragic phase in human history,\nand when we must still regret that irrationality is sowing\ndeath and cruelty in many places throughout the world, that\nwe would like to recall, humbly, but with a firmness\ninformed by the realities of our history, the deep and\nsincere conviction that Andorra can bring to the world.\nThere can be no difficulty in peaceful coexistence if there\nis good will and understanding. There can be no\ninfringement of tolerance if there is respect for people and\nideas. In a word, magnanimity and indulgence will always\nbe more effective than ignominy and opprobrium.\nFrom Andorra we proclaim peace; we call for it and,\nif necessary, we demand it as a universal possession that no\none has the right to change or to violate. When there is\nserious aggression against nature and the environment,\nwhen materialism and speculation seek to obliterate\nhumanism and sensitivity, when the hypocrisy of interests\novercomes the reality of ideals, a generous-spirited common\neffort must be made to find the path of peace and\ncoexistence.\nThe Andorran Constitution enshrines respect for and\nthe promotion of freedom, equality, justice and tolerance,\nand the defence of human rights and individual dignity.\nWith that background, we forcefully insist before the\nGeneral Assembly that the primary purpose of mankind is\nto achieve peace, without reservation and without ulterior\nmotive. None of us here can be satisfied with the results\nuntil one day we can announce the great news that peace\nreigns on Earth. The near-universality of the Treaty on the\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, the spirit of which\nAndorra has always respected, is a positive example of that\ncommon task. It thus gives me pleasure today to announce\nthat the Government of Andorra has submitted the Treaty\nto its Parliament for ratification.\nPeace must be promoted. By every possible means,\nespecially through education, we must spread the word\neverywhere that only tolerance, common sense,\nunderstanding, good will, solidarity, respect for cultural\ndiversity with its intellectual and spiritual stimulation,\nvariety and the struggle for social progress and\nbrotherhood can lead to peace and can provide pride and\ndignity to all human beings while eliminating\nintransigence and racial, religious, social and political\nhatred, which are at the root of all conflicts between\npeoples and civilizations.\nThere must be an end to the horrors and atrocities of\nthe wars that continue to take place in our civilized world\namid alarming indifference. These threats affect us all; we\nmust find the means to prevent violence against society\nand against individuals. It is not enough to cry out in\ncompassion or frustration, or to make the excuse that we\nare the victims of modern times, as Anthony Burgess put\nit in his novel A Clockwork Orange. There must be\ndetermination if we are to be able to say that we all have\na future. There must be serious, unhesitating commitment\non the part of those bearing the heaviest responsibility,\nparticularly with respect to the economic consequences,\nwhich are in fact predominant in causing certain\nscandalous situations and in keeping them alive. We must\nact with morality if we are to be able to face repeated\naggression against human rights. It would be wonderful\nif we could all make an unstinting effort to emerge from\nthe shadows and if, with one voice, we could set up the\nmachinery that would make peace triumph forever, and\ncould understand \u2014 in the words of Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand,\nformer President of the French Republic and therefore\nformer Co-Prince of Andorra \u2014 that \u201cawareness of\ninjustice is not enough to combat injustice\u201d.\nAs we strive towards peace let us always remember\nthat we can never reach the development goals set by\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali in his \u201cAn Agenda for\nDevelopment\u201d without reducing the warlike and military\nactivities of the poorest countries. Let us face the facts:\ndevelopment makes for peace, but without peace, without\neliminating unnecessary spending on military equipment,\nwithout agreement among Governments that rightly\ndemand a better future for their citizens, there will be no\ndevelopment.\nBut this must not mean a relaxation of the\ndevelopment efforts that Member States and the\nOrganization itself have always promoted. Day after day\nin the field, the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund\n(UNICEF), the United Nations Educational, Scientific and\n16\n\n\nCultural Organization (UNESCO) and the World Health\nOrganization (WHO) carry out work that is far too\nimportant not to enjoy our sincere support. I take this\nopportunity to announce that during my stay in New York\nI signed, on behalf of the Government of Andorra, the\nConvention on the Rights of the Child, which reflects my\ncountry\u2019s recognition of the cause promoted by that great\ntext. Men and women like the late James Grant \u2014 who at\nUNICEF carried out such tasks and contributed to the well-\nbeing of so many children throughout the world \u2014\ndemonstrate the productive vitality of the United Nations.\nWe in Andorra are much concerned with questions of\ndevelopment. Despite our modest means and small territory,\nwe feel solidarity with victims of malnutrition, hunger,\nsickness and the lack of educational opportunities. Our\nforeign policy at the United Nations has been oriented in\nthat direction. Last March, the Andorran Head of\nGovernment brought to Copenhagen a message of\nsolidarity, and declared that poverty was not inevitable.\nAndorra is a small State; we are therefore convinced that,\napart from the importance of large programmes and their\ninevitable macro-amplitudes, social development is a more\naccessible goal when it is approached on a small scale, at\nthe level of the community or indeed of the family.\nHence, the Declaration of the World Summit for\nSocial Development includes a commitment proposed by\nAndorra, which we shall invoke in our work in the\nAssembly\u2019s Main Committees. This commitment urges us\nto\n\u201cAcknowledge and encourage the contribution of\npeople of all age groups as equally and vitally\nimportant for the building of a harmonious society,\nand foster dialogue between generations in all parts of\nsociety\u201d. (A/CONF.166/9, para. 29, commitment 4 (h))\nHuman beings, happily, are living longer, and their\nnumbers are growing. We must find new ways to guarantee\nthe balance of the social contract between generations, and\nmake social integration \u2014 one of the pillars of\ndevelopment \u2014 work. To that end, we need to devote\nspecial attention to the problems of unemployment and the\nsocial integration of young people, particularly this year as\nwe mark the tenth anniversary of International Youth Year.\nI have instructed our Permanent Representative to the\nUnited Nations to devote time and resources to initiating a\ndialogue with his counterparts on the question of youth.\nWe have recently seen how three great conferences \u2014\nthose of Cairo, Copenhagen and Beijing \u2014 focused the\nattention of the international community. Cairo addressed\nproblems of population, Copenhagen those of poverty and\nsocial development, and Beijing the question of women.\nIt is vital that the conclusions of these high-level meetings\nnot become a dead letter; all Member States must assess\ntheir results and consider their concrete applications, both\nat home and throughout the world. But Cairo,\nCopenhagen and Beijing must not overshadow other\nsimilar conferences. I am thinking of Rio de Janeiro and\nits impact on environmental policy. A country of the\nPyrenees, like Andorra, cannot shirk its environmental\nresponsibilities; that is why the office of Andorra\u2019s\nSecretary-General for the environment has drawn up\nvaluable initiatives to protect our ecosystem, our flora and\nfauna, our waters and the air we breathe.\nIn this statement I have tried to recall the founding\nprinciples that inspire the United Nations, and the great\nthemes on which the General Assembly will reflect over\nthe coming decades. Clearly, not everything has been\nperfect during the past 50 years; there have been\nsituations where we Member States have not been\neffective enough. Every day, we hear about hunger,\ndisease and lack of access to education, which affect the\npoor more often than the rich. But now, on this\nanniversary, let us take comfort from the work that has\nbeen achieved. As I said before, let us consider what the\nworld would be without the United Nations.\nNone the less, on the eve of the third millennium,\nwhen interdependence among the Earth\u2019s peoples is\nstronger than ever, we need the United Nations to be\nincreasingly nimble and flexible, able to process\ninformation quickly and to react rapidly to any crisis.\nMany reforms are needed: reform of the Security Council,\nnow under debate, and that of the Economic and Social\nCouncil, which may take place in the future, will not be\nthe last. We also need more effective methods for\nallocating resources and for evaluating the needs of each\ndepartment to avoid duplication of labour. The Secretary-\nGeneral has mentioned this on several occasions, and I\nhave no doubt that, given good will, we shall succeed.\nThe Principality of Andorra \u2014 in the words of our\nHead of Government \u2014 is a very old nation and a very\nyoung State. We are a newcomer to the United\nNations \u2014 the 184th Member. Nevertheless, it is to the\nUnited Nations that we have set up our first diplomatic\nmission. Our first Permanent Representative, who during\nthe next two years will be in charge of opening our\nMission and starting its activities, presented his\ncredentials to the Secretary-General just over a week ago.\n17\n\n\nWith the humility of a newcomer, but with the joy and\nenergy of the convinced, we are making progress in our\ntask of participating in the work of the Organization.\nI should like, on behalf of the people and Government\nof Andorra, to affirm our support for the United Nations.\nWe wish it long life and much success in its struggle for\ntolerance, peace and development, for the benefit of the\nworld and of generations to come. And we express our\nhope that humankind will guard those values that will allow\nus all to face the challenges of the future \u2014 love,\nbrotherhood and friendship.\nLet me end this statement by quoting Robert Kennedy:\n(spoke in English)\n\u201cIt is from numberless diverse acts of courage\nand belief that human history is shaped. Each time a\nman stands up for an ideal or acts to improve the lot\nof others, or strikes out against injustice, he sends\nforth a tiny ripple of hope, and, crossing each other\nfrom a million different centres of energy and daring,\nthose ripples build a current that can sweep down the\nmightiest walls of oppression and resistance.\u201d\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me first, on behalf of the Romanian\ndelegation, to congratulate Ambassador Freitas do Amaral\nof Portugal most sincerely, and all the members of the\nBureau of the General Assembly, on their elections.\nRomania is fully committed to the ideals and goals of\nthe United Nations Charter and, as an active Member,\ndeeply appreciates the activity of the United Nations at this\ntime of an anniversary celebration when it is in the process\nof redefining itself in order to meet the present international\nrequirements and to anticipate what will happen in the third\nmillennium.\nAllow me to convey to the Secretary-General,\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, our deep appreciation for his\nsustained efforts to adapt the United Nations to the ever-\nincreasing requirements of a totally changing world. I did\nthat already in Bucharest when he visited us last autumn.\nAt that time we had a very useful exchange of views on\nproblems concerning cooperation between Romania and the\nUnited Nations and concerning the availability and\nopenness of the Romanian Government to support, and\nactively participate in, the global efforts of the United\nNations.\nRomania is at present celebrating, not only the fiftieth\nanniversary of the founding of the United Nations, but also\nthe fortieth anniversary of its admission to this world\nOrganization. Despite its sacrifices and its important\ncontribution to shortening the Second World War and the\nvictory of the United Nations coalition, Romania was\nadmitted to the United Nations 10 years after the Charter\ncame into force. None the less, my country has proved its\nresponsible commitment and its active role in the most\nimportant debate on international matters and in promoting\nthe purposes and principles of the United Nations.\nIn the six years since December 1989 the legislative\nand institutional framework for a democratic society has\nbeen constantly under development in Romania. The broad\nconsensus of all political forces in my country eloquently\nproves that we as a nation have opted to become a law-\nabiding State with respect for political pluralism, for a\nmarket economy and for fundamental rights and\nfreedoms. The new institutions that have been established\nare now in operation and at the same time have been\nconsolidated, thus contributing to the democratization of\nour society and the acceleration of the process of\ntransformation, in keeping with the strategy for\nsocio-economic reform which my Government has.\nThe complex reform programme has been unfolding\nsuccessfully. In 1995 the reality in Romania differs from\nthat at the end of 1992. The success of macroeconomic\nstabilization, and the improvement in the macroeconomy\nin general are an important argument for the integration\nof Romania into the European Union as it is an argument\nfor other countries of central Europe.\nThat does not mean that reform in Romania is going\nalong smoothly and without obstacles. As is the case with\nother central European countries, its implementation\ninvolves large social costs which require permanent social\nsecurity measures.\nIn this sense, I should like to emphasize the support\nand encouragement that the United Nations has given to\nRomania and to other countries in transition, which show\nthe capacity of the world Organization to support the\nreform process.\nIn this context, my delegation wishes to welcome the\nSecretary-General\u2019s report entitled \u201cSupport by the United\nNations system of the efforts of Governments to promote\nand consolidate new or restored democracies\u201d. We feel\nthat a substantial debate on this subject could define a\nnew dimension for United Nations activity. Romania,\nwhich next year is to organize the Third International\nConference of New or Restored Democracies has decided\nto make that meeting an important event for the\npromotion of democratic values throughout the world.\nRomania\u2019s political objectives are determined not by\ncircumstances but rather by its decisive commitment to\ndemocracy, market economy, respect for human rights\nand the need to ensure the country\u2019s peace and prosperity.\nWe believe that Romania\u2019s integration into European and\nEuro-Atlantic economic, political and security\nstructures \u2014 the principal goal of our foreign policy \u2014\nwill stimulate our own efforts at democratization and\nreform. At the same time, this demonstrates the\nGovernment\u2019s willingness to make a noteworthy\ncontribution to the achievement of the goals of those\ninstitutions and to the creation of favourable conditions\n37\n\n\nfor stability and security in Europe as well as peace and\nsecurity in the world.\nBy openly and unequivocally stating its basic interest\nin becoming part of the Euro-Atlantic economic, political\nand security structures, Romania is in no way neglecting its\nrelations with its neighbours. Indeed, the furthering of\nrelations with our neighbours, on a new footing, is a\nprimary concern.\nIn this connection I would mention the recent initiative\ntaken by our President, His Excellency Mr. Ion Iliescu, who\ninvited Hungary to join in consecrating the historical\nreconciliation, on the Franco-German model \u2014 a\nremarkable example of success in the European spirit.\nRomania has solemnly stated its willingness to\nundertake all diplomatic steps to move beyond the stage of\npurely political statements and to make the notion of\nreconciliation a fait accompli. The direct and unconditional\ninvitation to Hungary to forge, with us, the future of our\nnations in a European spirit goes beyond a mere political-\ndiplomatic step, envisaging as it does the establishment of\na social and political framework based on greater\nconfidence and more intensive cooperation.\nTo put it another way, for Romania reconciliation\nmeans a consciously assumed and systematically pursued\nprocess. At the same time, it should constitute for our two\ncountries the surest way to achieve integration into the main\ninstitutions of the new Europe, thereby contributing to the\nconsolidation of stability and security in the region and thus\nin the rest of the continent.\nRomania\u2019s initiative in launching an appeal to\nHungary to enter together into the historical reconciliation\nthat is so greatly desired is the natural result of a policy of\ngood-neighbourliness and understanding that Romania has\nbeen constantly pursuing with all its neighbours.\nDialogue and pragmatic cooperation in various areas\nof activity with States from all regions of the world is,\nmoreover, another important direction of our foreign policy.\nThe disappearance of the iron curtain gave birth to a vast\nand complex process of international d\u00e9tente by creating a\ngenuine framework for dialogue and cooperation between\nStates.\nThe renunciation of confrontational policies and the\nlessening of the nuclear threat created the conditions for the\nindefinite extension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation\nof Nuclear Weapons. We are convinced that that success\nwill assist the negotiations aimed at the elimination of\nother weapons of mass destruction and lead to greater\ntransparency, both in the area of armaments and in the\narea of security guarantees, as well as to a complete ban\non all nuclear tests.\nIn recent years the United Nations has repeatedly put\nforward new concepts and mechanisms regarding\ninternational peace and security and economic and social\ndevelopment.\nIn that context, I am grateful for this opportunity to\nrecall the constant support Romania has given the Middle\nEast peace process by encouraging the continuation of\ndialogue and contacts among the parties concerned. In\nrecognition of its contribution to the positive results of\nthat peace process Romania was invited to participate in\nthe multilateral negotiations on the Middle East. It is\nprepared to participate in working groups on regional\neconomic cooperation, water resources, the environment\nand refugees. Totally convinced that reason will prevail\nand that the irreversible Middle East peace process must\nbe supported, in the future also Romania will encourage\nand support understanding and cooperation among all the\npeoples of the region. We sincerely hope that through the\ncommon efforts of all the parties involved, the United\nNations and the international community, new progress\nwill be achieved so that a comprehensive solution to the\nproblems of that region can be found.\nThe Yugoslav crisis continues to create deep concern\nin Romania, given its close proximity to the conflict zone.\nRomania has appealed many times to the parties involved\nin the conflict to refrain from any action that might lead\nto the deterioration of the situation and to halt military\nactions and resume negotiations. Faithful to its position of\nprinciple, Romania hails yesterday\u2019s adoption, at the\nUnited States Mission to the United Nations here in New\nYork, of a joint statement of supplementary principles for\na constitutional settlement in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\nRomania will actively support any proposal and any\nrealistic action that will accelerate the pacification process\nin the territory of former Yugoslavia, including its\npeaceful reconstruction.\nThe political and military crisis in former Yugoslavia\nshows that attempts to achieve ethnic separatism and to\ngain territorial autonomy on the basis of ethnic criteria or\nto establish ethnic enclaves are not viable solutions. To\nthe contrary, they may become sources of conflict and\ncreate enormous suffering for the population.\n38\n\n\nI should like to reaffirm from this rostrum the\nRomanian Government\u2019s decision to continue to strictly\nrespect the sanctions imposed on the Federal Republic of\nYugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro), despite the immense\neconomic losses to our country. We do hope, nonetheless,\nthat the competent international institutions will take a more\ncareful look at the effects of the sanctions on third States\nand that they will rigorously and realistically assess the role\nsanctions can play in the peace process. We hope that\nStates that are in a position to do so, international financial\ninstitutions, competent bodies and United Nations\nprogrammes and specialized agencies will all respond to the\nGeneral Assembly\u2019s appeal in resolution 49/21 A\nconcerning economic assistance to States affected by the\nimplementation of the sanctions against the Federal\nRepublic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro). At the\nsame time, we would be interested in seeing the Security\nCouncil take decisions, in line with the progress achieved\nin the political settlement of the crisis, with a view to\nlifting the sanctions.\nThe situation in the eastern area of the Republic of\nMoldova is still a source of some tension. We are\nconvinced that the immediate withdrawal of foreign troops,\nwhatever their form or denomination, from the territory of\nthat independent and sovereign State remains the key to the\nsolution of the conflict in the eastern regions of the\nRepublic of Moldova. Indeed, we note with satisfaction that\nthe international community shares that view. We welcome\nthe agreement reached between the Republic of Moldova\nand the Russian Federation on the withdrawal of Russian\ntroops from the territory of the former country. We view\nthis as a positive step that can contribute to increased\nstability in the area, and we express the hope that this\nagreement will become operational.\nThe United Nations has quite rightly been given a\nprincipal role in designing a new world order, one capable\nof responding to the hopes and aspirations of peoples. To\nachieve that goal, we believe, the United Nations must\nadapt its structures to the requirements of economic\ndevelopment and must pay increased attention to\nharmonizing commercial practices, technical cooperation\nand monetary policies of Member States and international\nfinancial institutions.\nRecent United Nations activity has been marked by an\nimportant series of summit conferences which have dealt\nwith topics of major interest to all mankind. These\nconferences have emphasized the urgency, the seriousness\nand the complexity of the topics they have dealt with and\nhave expanded the sphere of action of international\nconsensus regarding programmes throughout the world\nrelated to the environment, population, social\ndevelopment, human rights and the status of women. We\nfeel that the United Nations and Member States must\nfocus their efforts on the ways and means necessary to\nimplement the decisions adopted by those conferences.\nIn this sense, I should like to mention the Plan of\nAction adopted by the Cairo International Conference on\nPopulation and Development. The usefulness of this\ndocument was reconfirmed at a regional seminar on its\nimplementation in the countries of Central and Eastern\nEurope which was organized recently in Romania in\ncooperation with the United Nations Population Fund\n(UNFPA). At the same time, I should like to express my\nGovernment\u2019s readiness to organize a similar meeting in\nBucharest next year to consider the progress achieved at\nthe regional level in implementing the provisions of the\nPlatform for Action adopted by the World Conference on\nWomen, held in Beijing.\nIt is clear that the major global problems taken up\nby the United Nations cannot be resolved without\nadequate financial support. The unparalleled increase in\nthe number of major problems brought to the attention of\nthe United Nations has not been accompanied by an\nincrease in necessary resources. The United Nations is\ntoday faced with a severe financial crisis. One possible\napproach to this crisis should be to consider the more\neffective use of available internal resources, the\nelimination of duplication in activities, more effective\ndocument control, productive use of human resources,\nstrict financial monitoring and a permanent process of\ncost-benefit analysis.\nWith regard to the use of resources, peace-keeping\noperations deserve special mention. The unprecedented\nincrease in these operations indicates, among other things,\na more active involvement on the part of the United\nNations in the management of crises and in preventive\ndiplomacy. This new trend has necessitated an increase in\nresources. If we take into account that the great majority\nof present conflicts involving United Nations peace-\nkeeping operations are internal, we have to admit that the\ninternational community has very limited means for\nexerting pressure. Continuing ineffective operations does\nnot serve to achieve the goals of the United Nations\nsatisfactorily, and consequently the Romanian delegation\nsupports the trend towards a closer and more rigorous\nexamination of all decisions related to launching new\npeace-keeping operations or continuing existing ones.\n39\n\n\nRomania has made known its interest in limiting and\npreventing conflicts in different areas of the globe, not only\nby promoting and encouraging the discovery of political\nsolutions, but also by participating in United Nations peace-\nkeeping operations in Iraq and Kuwait, in Somalia, in\nRwanda and in Angola. Romania is determined to make a\nsubstantial contribution to such operations and initiatives.\nTo this end, a special programme has been adopted to\nincrease our capacity to react adequately to any request\nfrom the United Nations or other bodies while strictly\nrespecting the principles governing the activities of the\nUnited Nations.\nIf we look back over the long road the United Nations\nhas travelled during its half century existence and, in\nparticular, if we look at the efforts it has made to adapt\nitself to the dynamics of international life in the last five\nyears, we are convinced of the value and the historic\ndestiny of the United Nations. I should like to assure the\nAssembly that Romania, with its dedication to peace, its\ndesire to cooperate at all levels \u2014 bilateral, regional,\nmultilateral \u2014 its firm commitment to protect international\npeace and security, its commitment to democratic values\nand respect for human rights, is determined to support the\ncommon heritage of values of the United Nations. Our\npresence among the Members of the United Nations for 40\nyears is based on the prestige and the moral authority\nwhich the United Nations enjoys in the eyes of the\nRomanian people.\nFor this reason, we shall, with all our energy and our\navailable resources, remain committed to the noble duty of\nserving the ideas and principles of the Charter of the United\nNations.\n"

        "file_text": "The island State of Saint\nLucia shares the sense of history and the mantle of\nresponsibility that falls over the General Assembly on this,\nthe fiftieth anniversary of the birth of the United Nations.\nWe must exult in the realization that a vague dream of\npeace in the aftermath of a world war has in five decades\nfirmed into a solid commitment by 185 nations to shoulder\nthe burden of the global community, embracing every\naspect of life around the world.\nThe elevation of Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral of\nPortugal to the presidency of the General Assembly at its\nfiftieth session is a distinct honour to his country and a\ntimely recognition of the high esteem in which he is held\nby his colleagues in the international arena.\nDuring this dramatic and exciting half century the\nGeneral Assembly has had its task cut out for it as it has\nbeen called upon to deal with disruptions arising from\nhuman failing, and often from human folly, which have\nthreatened to obstruct the path towards the fulfilment of the\nideals of the United Nations. However, some of the\nOrganization\u2019s finest moments have occurred in this half\ncentury \u2014 none more historic than when we presided over\nthe liquidation of apartheid and saw established the\nmultiracial State of South Africa. We have seen the end of\nthe conflict in Namibia, with the hope that this brings for\nthe economic and social progress of its people. We have\nmonitored the collapse of the Berlin wall. We have seen\ndemocracy in Haiti. We have been able to deter aggression\naimed at fulfilling territorial ambitions, even while we have\nbeen able to encourage the prospects for peace in the\nMiddle East.\nAny inclination that we may have nurtured towards\nself-congratulation is, however, arrested by events like the\nslaughter in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Rwanda, the\n\u201cethnic cleansing\u201d operations in Bosnia and Herzegovina\nand the seeming difficulty of ending the conflict. We are\nreminded by these events of the task that still lies ahead of\nus in fulfilling the dream of a better world.\n\nWe take pride in speaking of the equality of Member\nnations irrespective of size, and indeed have gone a long\nway towards ensuring such equality. We have admired\nhow extremely large and very small nations have had the\nopportunity to contribute equally to the deliberations of\nthe Assembly and to its decision-making process. There\nare however a number of impediments which still militate\nagainst smaller nations such as ours.\nThe confrontational posture of the cold war had\ngiven a strategic prominence to small States, then useful\nas pawns in the global chess game between super-Powers.\nNow that the small States have outlived their usefulness\nas honest brokers in the super-Power game, the altered\npolitical circumstances have left them stranded and\nmarginalized.\nThe pious promises of the developed world to\nallocate a minuscule percentage of national income to the\nprovision of aid for the developing world have shrunk to\nnon-fulfilment; the thought of the strong economies\nhelping the weak has shrivelled like a raisin in the sun.\nSaint Lucia has experienced a dramatic decline in\ngrant assistance \u2014 by almost 50 per cent between the\nfinancial years 1993-1994 and 1994-1995; but we can ill\nafford to sit around and merely moan. We recognize and\naccept that we must use the fact of diminished aid to\nincreasingly spur on our own efforts towards greater\nefficiency and increased productivity. But in striving\ntowards the achievement of this end, we find ourselves up\nagainst multinational trading interests intent on adding to\nthe maw of their already well-nourished entities the\nmorsels of trade on which the survival of our economy\ndepends.\nThe European Union banana regime came into force\nin June 1993 as part of the process of creating a single\nEuropean market, replacing a series of long-standing\nnational arrangements between individual member States\nand traditional banana suppliers. The United States itself\nhas led the way in instituting various national and\ninternational arrangements in the interests of its own\nfarming community. The existing banana regime seeks to\nensure that demand for bananas across the European\nUnion is satisfied, while at the same time providing\ntraditional suppliers of bananas to Europe from\ndeveloping countries in Africa, the Caribbean and the\nPacific with continued access to the European market at\n5\n\n\nviable price levels. In doing so the European Union fulfils\na legal commitment under the Lom\u00e9 Convention, that is\nthat the introduction of the single market should place\ntraditional suppliers in no worse a position than in the past.\nThat is achieved by a combination of tariff quotas and\nlicences which ensure that suppliers from the African,\nCaribbean and Pacific States (ACP) maintain \u2014 but cannot\nincrease \u2014 their market share of approximately 15 per cent\nof the total European Union demand for bananas. This\nfacility is not aimed at victimizing United States firms or\nindeed firms of any particular nationality. This is clearly\ndemonstrated by the fact that over 60 per cent of the\nEuropean Union\u2019s market demand for bananas is satisfied\nby fruit imported from Central and South America,\nprincipally by three United States multinationals. It is\nimportant to note that the Caribbean\u2019s share of the world\nmarket for bananas is a paltry 3 per cent compared to the\nmore than 70 per cent share of dollar bananas, mostly\ncontrolled by these multinationals.\nThere is general nervousness and a creeping instability\nthreatening the Caribbean banana-growing States resulting\nfrom the decision of the United States Trade Representative\nto pursue Section 301 action in response to an application\nby Chiquita Brands International and the Hawaii Banana\nIndustry Association challenging the European banana\nimport regime. We have since been advised that the United\nStates Government is to pursue a complaint against the\nregime within the World Trade Organization (WTO). Since\nthe banana industry accounts for about 50 per cent of the\ndomestic exports of the Windward Islands and around 90\nper cent of all agricultural earnings in Saint Lucia and\nDominica, it is indisputable that the collapse of the industry\nwhich would accompany any tampering with the regime\nwould have a disastrous impact on the economies of these\nvery small countries.\nIn addition, the interdependence of Caribbean\nCommunity (CARICOM) trading arrangements would, in\nthe circumstances, produce a ripple of economic downturn\nand accompanying social unrest and political instability\nthroughout the CARICOM region. The resulting prospect of\nmassive unemployment, displaced family wage earnings and\nan escalation in criminal and drug activity is too horrific to\ncontemplate. The Caribbean must call on the good sense\nand high ideals of this body to use whatever influence it\nhas at its disposal to avert this looming danger. The United\nNations may well consider it useful to develop a framework\nof international review and regulation with respect to the\nactivities and policies of transnational corporations, which\nare becoming increasingly influential actors on the world\nscene.\nThere is little need to emphasize the openness and\nvulnerability of Caribbean economies. We are exposed to\nthe fury of natural disasters, as was evidenced by the\nhavoc wrought by Tropical Storm Debbie, from which\nSaint Lucia is still recovering; the recent demolition of\nAntigua and Saint Kitts by Hurricane Luis; and the\ndevastation of St. Croix, St. Thomas, St. Maarten and\nDominica by Hurricane Marilyn.\nWith severe limitations of size and resources, we are\nnow called upon to come to terms with changes brought\nabout by the process of liberalization and its requirement\nto be competitive globally; we are therefore forced to\ndiversify our interests in reaction to the liberalization and\nderegulation processes which are taking place in the\ninternational marketplace. The classical response calls for\nrestructuring aimed at economic diversification,\naccompanied of course by increasing efficiency and\nproductivity.\nIn terms of diversification the services sector holds\nattractions. In this context many of our countries are\nanxious to explore the field of offshore financial services\nto enhance the Governments\u2019 revenue base. We are,\nhowever, alert to the dangers associated with that sector\nand, while pursuing the benefits to be derived from such\ninstitutions, we must be ever on guard for white-collar\ncriminals who, as part of their everyday activity, launder\ntheir ill-gotten gains through the international financial\nsystems, using both public- and private-sector capital\nprojects for this purpose. Quite often the strategies\nemployed by quasi-investors to launder their wealth are\nboth innovative and sophisticated and require equally\nsophisticated systems to deal with their ingenious\nmalpractices. Our growing States are not yet able to\nacquire the kind of resources to engage in a full-fledged\nwar against such nefarious institutions.\nAdmittedly, the 1988 United Nations Vienna\nConvention has sought to criminalize the laundering of\nmoney derived from the illicit drug trade. But it is crucial\nthat our countries in the Caribbean area take a positive\nstand to enforce the law and protect our communities\nfrom these destructive practices. In this context,\ninternational financial institutions should use their\ninfluence, through moral suasion, to encourage member\ncountries, as a matter of urgency, to adopt the measures\nnecessary to achieve the objectives of the 40\nrecommendations of the Financial Action Task Force. In\n6\n\n\nthe Caribbean area our CARICOM colleagues will no doubt\nembrace the nineteen recommendations of the Caribbean\nFinancial Action Task Force.\nIn the course of the year, our country attracted some\nattention in respect of irregularities surrounding the use of\nthe P\u00e9rez-Guerrero Trust Fund. We did not flinch from the\ncostly decision to appoint a full commission of inquiry in\nour anxiety to ensure the fullest possible accountability. In\nthese trying times, when cynics are ready to decry the\nachievements of the United Nations and besmirch its\nidealism, it is the bounden duty of all Member States to\nwash off the stains of calumny and allow the ideals,\nprinciples and performance of this illustrious body to\ncontinue to inspire the world. The Phillips Commission\ncleared both the Saint Lucia Government and the organs of\nthe United Nations of any complicity or blame in the affair.\nThis experience, however, points to the need for being on\nconstant guard against those who without scruples would\nseek to compromise the traditions and the integrity of\ngovernment and of this body.\nThe end of the cold war has left many countries\nstranded on the beachhead of marginalization. In the\ncontext of the Caribbean, we are learning to deal with our\nisolation by exploring new internal alliances designed to\nfoster pride in our patrimony, reduce our vulnerability, pool\nour human resources and intensify our self-reliance. The\nlogic of this internationalization is to strengthen the links\nbetween us in the Eastern Caribbean, within the context of\nthe Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS), even\nwhile we consolidate the process of the closer integration\nof the Caribbean Community. The circle of integration\nexpands in a growing relationship with countries in the\nwider Caribbean basin and the countries of Latin America.\nThis new thrust of integration has found expression in the\nrecently established Association of Caribbean States, which\nlinks the countries of Central and South America, as well\nas other Caribbean countries such as Haiti, the Dominican\nRepublic and Cuba. We will, however, within the Lom\u00e9\nConvention, maintain our long and valuable historical links\nwith Europe even while, by implementing the decisions of\nthe Summit of the Americas, we seek to expand and\nconsolidate our hemispheric ties.\nThis new Caribbean initiative has much to recommend\nit. The concept cuts clear across the barriers of race,\nlanguage and culture to establish a market of 204 million\npeople with an annual trade volume of $180 billion and\nestablishes a regional base from which competitive strength\nmay be developed for dealing in the global arena.\nIn the case of Haiti, we can now look hopefully\nforward with new confidence to the restoration of\ndemocracy in an environment of peace and stability. The\nnew setting should pave the way for the Haitian people\u2019s\nachievement of economic, social and political well-being.\nThe re-establishment of democratic order leaves Haiti\npoised to play a greater role, in concert with its\nCARICOM colleagues, in helping shape the new\ninternational order. The United States of America, the\nCARICOM grouping and the United Nations itself can\nfeel satisfied over and take pride in the fact that their\nsustained interest and cooperation have led to the\npromotion of Haiti\u2019s rehabilitation and economic\ndevelopment. Saint Lucia renews its commitment to\nsupport the consolidation of the hard-won gains in Haiti\nin the hope that the country will finally enjoy the fruits of\ndemocracy, with full respect accorded the inalienable\nrights of its people.\nIn the case of Cuba, we are firmly convinced that\nthe cause of democracy can best be served by the\ndiffusion of its values through association and example\nand not in a process of isolation. That is why Saint Lucia\njoins its Caribbean colleagues in calling for an end to the\neconomic blockade of Cuba so as to allow that Caribbean\ncountry the flexibility to develop the creativity of its\npeople and pursue its Caribbean destiny.\nThe winds of change which blew across Africa in\nthe fifties were fuelled by a strong pan-Africanism. It is\ngenerally known that the ideas which generated the\nliberation struggles in Africa came out of the cross-\nfertilization of the ideas of African and Caribbean\nthinkers. Caribbean thinkers like Saint Lucia\u2019s Nobel\nlaureate, Sir Arthur Lewis, and others, such as C.L.R.\nJames and George Padmore, were strong influences on\npersons like Kwame Nkrumah, Jomo Kenyatta and S\u00e9kou\nTour\u00e9. This historic link between the Caribbean and\nAfrica must continue, especially at a time when the entire\ninternational community is deeply concerned about the\ncritical economic and political conditions in Africa as a\nwhole. Our Secretary-General has openly expressed his\ndeep concern for the problems of Africa and the need for\nthis body to give them its urgent consideration.\nAt its fiftieth session, the General Assembly must\nact in concert with the Secretary-General in giving high\npriority to programmes of action for African recovery and\ndevelopment. The United Nations New Agenda for the\nDevelopment of Africa in the 1990s must be pursued\nurgently and vigorously. In this anniversary year, Saint\nLucia will pursue a conscious policy of establishing\n7\n\n\ndiplomatic relations with a number of African countries,\nwith a view not only to stimulating trade and cultural\nexchanges, but, indeed, to recovering and stimulating that\nvital interchange of ideas.\nSaint Lucia is strongly supportive of the peace process\nin the Middle East, which started with the signing on\n4 May 1994 of the first implementation agreement of the\nDeclaration of Principles on Interim Self-Government\nbetween the Government of Israel and the Palestine\nLiberation Organization. The second phase of the agreement\nwas signed on 28 September this year. The agreement\nbetween Israel and Jordan has deepened the process\nconsiderably. It is our fervent hope that the skirmishes\nbetween the Palestinians and the Israelis will not derail the\npeace process in the Middle East. We further urge the\ncountries of the region to adhere to the Treaty on the Non-\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons for the long-term stability\nand development of the region.\nIn preceding sessions of the Assembly, my country has\ndrawn attention to the Republic of China on Taiwan\u2019s\nrequest to take its rightful place within this family of\nnations. Our support for this request in no way implies an\nattack on the sovereignty of the People\u2019s Republic of\nChina, nor is it meant to vitiate the intention of resolution\n2758 (XXVI).\nMy country is acutely aware of the need to protect the\nfundamental principles of our institutions, but it is not\nbeyond the creativity of the Assembly to play a catalyst\nrole in resolving the impasse between the Republic of\nChina and the People\u2019s Republic of China. Recent military\nmanoeuvres in the Taiwan Straits provide an eerie warning\nof the possibility of deteriorating relations between the two\ncountries. The Assembly should not wash its hands of the\nissues like Pilate, but should exhaust the possibilities of\npreventive diplomacy rather than live to bemoan the tragedy\nof inaction.\nSaint Lucia continues to be of the view that Taiwan\u2019s\npresence in the United Nations will help to further the goals\nand ideals of our Organization. Saint Lucia\u2019s support for\nTaiwan\u2019s bid for a seat in this body is in the knowledge\nthat this does not preclude the eventuality of reunification.\nAs we stand on the threshold of a new century, at the\nvery same time as we are presented with an anniversary\nopportunity to look back on a half-century of United\nNations activity, two vital processes loom large in the\nperception of small States. These processes are\ndisarmament and decolonization.\nIt is our wish that the process of arms reduction\ncontinue to gain momentum and to stabilize at a level that\nwill ensure the easing of tensions and conflicts whenever\nand wherever they are waged around the globe. Attention\nmust be focused on those countries which devote large\nslices of their national budgets to arms purchases and\nproduction while numerous areas of the world languish in\npoverty and disease. Civil and external wars could occur\nin regions where the possession of advanced weaponry,\nsuch as medium-range missiles with chemical, biological\nor even nuclear warheads, by ambitious and threatened\nregimes becomes a potentially lethal prospect. The search\nfor peace is the most compelling rationale for the\nexistence of the United Nations, and the indefinite\nextension of the Non-Proliferation Treaty, together with\ncomplete disarmament and the total eradication of\nchemical weapons, will be the greatest global contribution\nto a new world order. Saint Lucia has already ratified the\nTreaty of Tlatelolco for the Prohibition of Nuclear\nWeapons in Latin America and the Caribbean.\nWith regard to the process of decolonization, the\ntarget date of the year 2000 set by the United Nations for\nthe total eradication of colonialism is to be borne in mind.\nIn this context, the United Nations should continue to\npromote the idea that referendums and other forms of\npopular consultation on the future status of the Non-Self-\nGoverning Territories are appropriate means of\nascertaining the wishes of the people in this matter.\nAs the United Nations has grown in scope and\ncomplexity over these past 50 years, so too have the\nproblems and complexities assumed new dimensions. We\nhave seen floods of refugees escaping civil wars all over\nthe globe, but now we are faced with the prospect of\nenvironmental refugees fleeing from disaster areas and\nnatural catastrophes. Without wishing to sound like a\nprophet of doom, I must say that the possible effect of\nglobal warming upon agriculture in the developing world\nis a further cause of concern. In recent months we have\nfaced the relentless fury of hurricanes, rising sea levels\nand, in the case of Montserrat, one of our small\nCaribbean island neighbours, the threat of volcanic\neruption.\nWe appreciate that these unfolding problems have\nnot escaped the attention of the United Nations. The\nforty-second session of the General Assembly designated\nthe 1990s as the International Decade for Natural Disaster\nReduction, and a Plan of Action was adopted in May\n1994 by the World Conference on Natural Disaster\nReduction. Our small countries view the transfer of\n8\n\n\ntechnology in respect of early warning systems, monitoring\ndevices and up-to-date research on safer construction\nmethods as a matter of urgent priority. While we are\ngrateful for the short-term assistance given to such disaster\nareas, it is vital that we should also focus on the long-term\ngoals of preparedness and prevention.\nThe question of equitable representation and an\nincrease in the membership of the Security Council was\nincluded in the agenda of the thirty-fourth session of the\nGeneral Assembly, in 1979, the same year Saint Lucia\njoined this Organization, and the same year that the\nmembership of the United Nations was tripled, from 51\noriginal members to 152 members.\nDuring the 16 years since 1979 we have been calling\nfor an increase in the membership of the Security Council,\nespecially of developing countries, to reflect the increased\nmembership of the United Nations and the reality of its\ncomposition. Repetition is necessary to emphasize the\nimportance of the point that the policy-making arm of the\nUnited Nations should reflect the diversity and universality\nof the membership of this body and uphold the principle of\nequitable representation that the Charter embodies.\nSaint Lucia continues to support the recommendation\nthat the relationship between the General Assembly and the\nSecurity Council should be strengthened. We also support\nthe view that the process of briefing and consultation\nshould be institutionalized, that the privilege of veto should\nbe phased out and that the efforts at developing greater\ntransparency and predictability should continue. Saint Lucia\nwill work with and support the efforts of our regional group\nand of the Non-Aligned Movement to achieve these\nobjectives. It is our hope that, in this fiftieth year, we shall\nexercise the courage and willingness needed to bring about\nthe overdue changes and reform of the Council.\nSaint Lucia has taken the opportunity of the fiftieth\nanniversary to reflect deeply on the role of small\nmarginalized States in the family of nations. We have\nendured the ravages of a colonial past, been exploited by\nmultinational corporations, divided by the sea and\nhamstrung by a desperate shortage of resources.\nToday a new vision unfolds. We cannot hope to\nconquer worlds as the early Conquistadors did. There are\nno worlds to conquer, but worlds to recreate. In this\nrecreation of the post-cold-war world, there are\ndisappearing divisions between States once sworn enemies\nin a drive to adjust to the dictates of the new world\neconomic order. The interdependence of nations is\nhighlighted against the background of diseases which\nthreaten the world, and the potential for destruction of the\nvery environment which guarantees the survival of\nmankind.\nThese problems to be resolved must be approached\nthrough the collective means available within this body.\nHowever, solutions to be effective must take account of\ndifferences in size, in resources and in the cultural\ndiversity of those who are to benefit from them.\nPracticality must take precedence over mere dogma,\nand idealism must not be allowed to lose ground to a\nnarrowness of realism that pays little heed to\ncircumstances. Saint Lucia sees the United Nations as a\nsolid bulwark for the creation of a new order. Its\ncommitment to world peace, human rights, gender\nequality, racial equality and sustainable development for\nthe peoples of the world is the touchstone of our\naspirations.\nMy country stands prepared to assist in the retooling\nand reshaping of the organs of the United Nations to\nenable it to face the global challenges which lie ahead of\nus. These challenges are as demanding of Member States\nas they are of the organs of the United Nations. Our focus\nwill be to work in concert with our colleagues in the\nCaribbean Community and our colleagues in the\nAssociation of Caribbean States to increase our efficiency\nand productivity with a view to playing a full role in the\ninternational arena. We will explore with other Member\nStates ideas for fostering a new ethos in the international\nforum, in which size, wealth and influence will be\nsubordinated to the concourse of ideas.\nFinally, Saint Lucia will endeavour to join the global\nsearch for a more relevant and edifying system of values\nwhich will inspire generations of young people to\nembrace the concerns which five decades ago motivated\nthe founding fathers of this noble Organization.\n"

        "file_text": "You have the difficult and noble task, Sir, of guiding the\nwork of the General Assembly at a time when the United\nNations is celebrating 50 years of existence and\napproaching a decisive turning-point in its history. Your\nelection to this high office is cause for joy and satisfaction\nin the delegation of Benin, on behalf of which I have the\ngreat honour of speaking from this world-renowned\nrostrum.\nI am pleased to be able to add my voice to those of\npreceding speakers in congratulating you sincerely and\nwarmly and also in congratulating the members of your\nBureau. I am particularly glad in that you represent a\ncountry, Portugal, with which Benin is honoured to have\nexcellent relations and valuable cultural ties. It is my belief\nthat your experience and your qualities and abilities will\nhelp to ensure smooth proceedings and success here in our\ndiscussions.\nYou, Sir, are taking over your office from my brother\nAmara Essy of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, to whom I would like to\nextend the satisfaction and appreciation of my delegation\non the exemplary manner in which he presided over the\nwork of the forty-ninth session. In an international\nsituation marked by doubt, fatigue and an absence of\nresources, he endeavoured with lucidity, resolve and\nperseverance to reconfirm the central and irreplaceable\nrole of this Organization in attaining peace and social\nprogress.\nI would also wish fraternally to extend a well-\ndeserved tribute to the Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros\nBoutros-Ghali, whom I welcome here with us today, a\nman of conviction and humanism whom we should\nsupport and recognize for his efforts and initiatives to\ntranslate into action the purposes and principles of the\nCharter.\nOur world has changed considerably, and the wheels\nof history continue to turn inexorably, throwing up their\nshare of upheaval and change, which makes even clearer\nthe need for a universal forum and an instrument as\nvaluable as the United Nations. It has asserted itself as an\nessential catalyst for international cooperation based on\ninterdependence and an awareness of the common future\nof mankind.\nThe ceremonies commemorating 50 years of the\nUnited Nations give us an opportunity to evaluate what it\nhas done. I shall confine myself to just a few points.\nThere is a saying in my country that whenever we\nhesitate about how to proceed in life, we should look\n\n\nback over the road we have travelled. So, in that\ncontext, I would like to recall that there should be three\npillars supporting this Organization, namely: the\nmaintenance of peace and security; economic and social\ndevelopment; and respect for and protection of human\nrights.\nI think I am right in saying that, since 1945, peace has\nin general been maintained. Most States have now gained\ntheir sovereignty and their peoples are exercising their\nrights, and the fundamental nature of respect for human\nrights has been universally recognized.\nYet, there are such deep cracks in the second pillar\nthat the whole building may crumble. Hence the United\nNations is now at a critical turning-point in its history.\nIn a world in which economies and markets are being\nglobalized, a world that is almost entirely characterized and\nunited by the communications revolution and the progress\nmade in transport, we soon realized that peace does not\nsimply mean that weapons are silent. Increasing\ninterdependence has not really created a genuine feeling of\nsolidarity. Although this is often said \u2014 some of us\nspeaking before the international community every year\nfrom this rostrum \u2014 it has not prompted collective action\nto ensure prosperity for all.\nThe three pillars that symbolize the authority of the\nUnited Nations and its ability to carry out its mandate must\nall be strengthened if the building is to continue to stand.\nI did not mean to turn my back on Benin\u2019s tradition\nby allowing myself to turn the thoughts of this Assembly\ntowards symbolism, but rather to highlight the reality of the\nproblems we face and the scope of the challenges they\nthrow down before us. Human dignity is what is at stake\nhere.\nThe United Nations can become stronger only by\nstrengthening its second pillar, by promoting action in\neconomic and social areas, by focusing its concerns on\ndevelopment in order to achieve or maintain peace through\nthe promotion of social development.\nThe Organization therefore has a central role to play\nin preventing mankind from drifting towards new\nconfrontation and impoverishment, and in enabling man to\ngain greater control over his environment and his fate.\nThe new dynamic in international relations resulting\nfrom the end of ideological confrontation is characterized\nby a search for a new kind of inter-State relationship. As\na result, the hotbeds of tension and conflict that have not\nbeen quelled are now approaching a solution or are being\ncontained. And yet, there is still such upheaval in some\nparts of the world that international peace and security are\nbeing threatened.\nI am thinking here of the negotiations between Israel\nand Palestine. They are the result of resolute action. We\nknow how difficult was the road leading to the\nestablishment of lasting peace in view of the level of\ndistrust and the acute, accumulated suffering involved.\nYet, we have high hopes that bitterness and fear will be\novercome so that dialogue may continue. We must all\nencourage dialogue between Israel and the States of the\nregion, and to that end, the good will of all is essential.\nIn Benin, we welcomed the fact that the weapons\nhad finally fallen silent in southern Africa. For the first\ntime in several decades, the region seems to be able to\ndevote all its energies and resources to development\nactivities.\nHere, we wish to pay tribute to the maturity of the\npeople and leaders of Mozambique who have helped to\nestablish a State based on the rule of law and political\npluralism on the basis of free and democratic elections. I\ncan only congratulate the United Nations on what it has\ndone to promote peace in that country. We are all\nconcerned that peace should be strengthened through\nstability, reconciliation and national reconstruction. Faced\nwith this situation, the international community must,\nmore than ever before, support Mozambique by providing\nassistance that can recreate an environment conducive to\neconomic development.\nI also welcome the agreements signed at Lusaka\nbetween the Government of the Republic of Angola and\nUNITA, and on behalf of my delegation I should like to\nencourage them to live up to the commitments they have\nmade.\nThe positive developments in Haiti are also most\nwelcome. Benin applauds the reinstatement of the\nlegitimate Haitian authorities and the courage and sense\nof responsibility shown by the President, Jean-Bertrand\nAristide, who has engendered a spirit of reconciliation.\nWe appreciate the efforts made by the Government of\nHaiti to strengthen democracy in the country by\nestablishing institutions following free elections. We have\nhigh hopes that security and stability can thus be\nre-established and will help to promote economic and\n2\n\n\nsocial development, the only guarantee of lasting\ndemocracy.\nUnfortunately, however, in other regions, the course of\nhistory is still not running smoothly. This is the case in\nSomalia, Rwanda, Burundi and Liberia, where events would\nseem to suggest that the protagonists have learned\nnothing \u2014 but they have forgotten nothing either.\nIn Somalia, the absence of any viable State structure\nhas plunged the country into an impossible situation with\nmomentous consequences. The desire to secure\nadvantageous negotiating positions through the use of force\nhas led to continued suffering for the country. In expressing\nour sympathy for the people of Somalia, Benin wishes to\nremind the various factions that they must create the\nconditions for dialogue and national reconciliation and we\nwould urge them to be tolerant.\nIn Rwanda and Burundi, re-establishing the judiciary\nand establishing public order would seem to be the only\nmeans of putting an end to the spiral of violence and\nencouraging national reconciliation, which is a prerequisite\nfor establishing trust and encouraging the voluntary return\nof refugees. We cannot deny that the slow pace and the\nfragility of developments in the situation in those two\ncountries raise fears that the tragic events we so recently\ndeplored may recur at any moment.\nIn Liberia, we welcome the new situation that has\nemerged from the cease-fire and the establishment of the\nCouncil of State. We urge all parties to strengthen the\nrenewed peace by effectively disarming all the factions.\nThe former Yugoslavia is undoubtedly the world stage\non which new types of conflict and efforts to limit them are\nrunning at the same time. While taking what may seem a\ndispassionate look at the situation in the Balkans region, we\nare not insensitive to the fate of millions of women,\nchildren and elderly people who are the victims both of\nnew kinds of exclusion and of the irredentism of the\npeoples of the region.\nI should like to take this occasion to reiterate that\nBenin strongly condemns \u201cethnic cleansing\u201d, no matter who\nits perpetrators may be, all violations of humanitarian law\nand all attacks against United Nations personnel.\nBenin supports the idea of a comprehensive settlement\nwith respect to the consequences of the disintegration of the\nformer Federal Socialist Republic of Yugoslavia. For this\nreason, I appeal to all the protagonists to put an end to\nthe fighting and to attacks against innocent civilians.\nThe New York agreements of 26 September 1995\nbetween the three major protagonist groups constitute a\ndecisive step towards general and lasting peace in the\nregion, which, I trust, will soon cease to be the powder-\nkeg of today\u2019s world.\nThe deplorable, indeed tragic, situations that I have\njust described strengthen my conviction that the protection\nand promotion of human rights and of fundamental\nfreedoms still deserve our full attention. They justify the\ndrafting of new international instruments to complete the\nexisting legal arsenal, so that those who continue to\nperpetrate cruel and inhuman acts, genocide and \u201cethnic\ncleansing\u201d can be punished. In this spirit, Benin supports\nthe establishment of international tribunals for the former\nYugoslavia and Rwanda.\nBut what will all these efforts mean if we do not put\nan end to the production, accumulation and international\ntransfers of weapons, and if we do not progress towards\ngeneral and complete disarmament under international\ncontrol?\nIn this connection, Benin reiterates its unwavering\nsupport for all United Nations resolutions relating to the\nreduction, limitation and non-proliferation of nuclear\nweapons.\nOne of the mandates of this Organization is to make\ngeneral development efforts the focus of our concerns.\nChanges in international relations and the liberalization of\ntrade have made us more aware of the many different\nsectors and players involved in development. The\ndeterioration of our environment has alerted us to the\nneed to focus our behaviour and actions on ensuring the\nlong-term development of future generations.\nWe are both witnesses to and players in the changes\nwe are experiencing today. And yet we are not\nunequipped to implement the transition to another kind of\ndevelopment, because we have at our disposal the tools\nfor both diagnosis and prevention. There is only one\npossible approach: the political will to implement our\nrespective commitments.\nI should like to emphasize that as concerns\nimplementation of their commitments the developing\ncountries in general, and Africa and the least developed\ncountries in particular, have proceeded resolutely towards\n3\n\n\nqualitative political and economic changes. In so doing,\nthey have required enormous sacrifices on the part of their\npeoples in order to readjust and adapt to new world\nconditions.\nWe must acknowledge, however, that the commitments\nto carry out the duty of solidarity have not yet materialized.\nBenin, of course, fully appreciates the international\ncommunity\u2018s support for the developing countries, and\nparticularly for Africa and the least-developed countries in\ngeneral. However, the assistance provided is far from\nmeeting either the needs or the expectations.\nI sincerely hope that the results of the High-level\nIntergovernmental Meeting on the Mid-term Global Review\nof the Implementation of the Programme of Action for the\nLeast-developed Countries for the 1990s, which began here\nin New York on 26 September, will make it possible to\novercome these shortcomings.\nI urge the international community to live up to its\ncommitment to solidarity with Africa by contributing to the\nUnited Nations New Agenda for the Development of Africa\nin the 1990s. At the high-level meetings of the Economic\nand Social Council held in Geneva from 4 to 6 July last,\nthe international community reconfirmed its commitment to\ncontribute effectively to the development of Africa and to\nthe implementation of this New Agenda.\nIt is therefore urgent \u2014 and this cannot be said often\nenough \u2014 to reduce the debt burden to a level that would\nenable us truly to set development in motion. I should like\nalso to invite all States to speed up their respective\nconstitutional procedures for ratifying the United Nations\nConvention to Combat Desertification in those Countries\nExperiencing Serious Drought and/or Desertification,\nparticularly in Africa.\nThe demonstrations organized worldwide at the time\nof the first World Day to Combat Desertification and\nDrought bear witness to the commitment of peoples and\nGovernments to tackling seriously this worldwide\nenvironmental problem. This commitment must be backed\nby the depositing of the 50 ratification instruments needed\nfor the entry into force of the Convention in 1996. The first\nconference of the parties could thus take place in 1997, the\nyear earmarked for the mid-term review of Agenda 21 and\nof all the recommendations and conclusions of the United\nNations Conference on Environment and Development.\nMeasures must also be taken to speed up the\nintegration of Africa into the international trade system and\nto help in diversifying economies and encouraging\ninvestment. Only in this way will that continent, which\nhas suffered greatly throughout history, be able finally to\nemerge from the hellish cycle of poverty.\nBenin is prepared to contribute to making 1996, the\nInternational Year for the Eradication of Poverty, an\noccasion for us to strengthen the moral obligation and\nduty of solidarity that underlies the struggle against\npoverty. But our Governments\u2019 actions can be successful\nonly if they are supported by all our partners in\ndevelopment.\nThe year 1996 will also see the holding of the Ninth\nUnited Nations Conference on Trade and Development\nand the Second United Nations Conference on Human\nSettlements (Habitat II), which is being referred to as the\n\u201cCity Summit\u201d. These two major Conferences, whose\nimportance cannot be overemphasized, will provide to the\ninternational community an opportunity to assess the\nprogress made in the context of the commitment entered\ninto at Cartagena in February 1992 and of the Global\nStrategy for Shelter to the Year 2000. However, the\npreparatory committees for those two Conferences must\nfocus on finding specific solutions rather than short-lived\nmeasures and recommendations.\nI am convinced that development cannot be achieved\nsimply by transferring one model of production and\nconsumption from one region of the world to another. We\nmust go beyond that clich\u00e9 and base ourselves on a true\npartnership for development, in which responsibilities\nwould be shared equally. For this reason, Benin welcomes\nthe outcome of the World Summit for Social\nDevelopment and of the Fourth World Conference on\nWomen.\nBenin fully endorses the elaboration of an Agenda\nfor Development with a view to the effective\nimplementation of the programmes of action that have not\nyet been carried out.\nIn conclusion, I should like to express our firm\nconviction that this session of the General Assembly will\nmake it easier for us to achieve a consensus acceptable to\nall on ways and means of revitalizing and strengthening\nthe institutions and structures of the United Nations.\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me to congratulate the\nPresident on his election to his high office at the fiftieth\nsession of the General Assembly. The Government and the\npeople of the Republic of Malawi hold him and his great\ncountry, Portugal, in high esteem. His appointment to\npreside over the deliberations of the Assembly during this\nimportant session, as the United Nations commemorates its\nfiftieth anniversary, is an indisputable reflection of the\nrecognition of his eminence by the international community.\nMy delegation is confident that he will guide the\ndeliberations of the Assembly to a fruitful conclusion.\nAt the same time, allow me to pay tribute to his\npredecessor, His Excellency Mr. Amara Essy of C\u00f4te\nd\u2019Ivoire, who, in spite of the complexity of the issues and\nthe difficult constraints which confronted the United\nNations during his tenure, guided the work of the\nforty-ninth session with admirable skill, dignity and\nvision.\nIt is indeed very difficult to have to speak today\nafter His Holiness the Pope, lest those words which this\nmorning flew up to high rafters of this building be\nforgotten. We in Malawi feel that perhaps it was our fate\nto be scheduled to speak after him. The Assembly will\nrecall that the Pope talked about the moral aspects of\nnationhood, politics and relations between nations. The\nAssembly will also remember how he gave the word\nfreedom a new dimension and meaning, saying that man\nwill insist on it, whether small or big. The Assembly will\nalso remember the moral responsibility he put upon the\nhuman being, both as an individual and as a member of\nthe community of what is really a small planet. One need\nonly fly a few miles up in the air from this little planet,\nwhich we call Earth, to see that we all really look like\nlittle rabbits dashing from one foxhole to another.\nHowever, as human beings, we also resemble God, our\ncreator. To me it seemed as if our call to speak after him,\nthis afternoon, was an occasion to try to strengthen what\nHis Holiness the Pope left with us this morning.\nThe twentieth century is soon coming to an end.\nHistorians will remember and record it as the century of\nthree great phenomena, I think. The first was the\nestablishment of a power structure, as demonstrated by\nthe rise of the great experiments: the experiment in\ndemocracy built on capitalism and respect for individual\nrights and the experiment in socialism based on a social\ncontract for a community with a common purpose. The\nconflict of these ideas would lead to the emergence of\nwhat would dominate the world\u2019s political ways during\nthe first 45 years of this Organization\u2019s existence: the\ncold war.\nThe second great phenomenon that the Pope referred\nto was the fall of the empires built by the European\nPowers from Asia to Africa and the proud rise of\ncolonized people to independence. The third \u2014 and\nperhaps the most heart-rending \u2014 phenomenon of this\ncentury was that of racism. We saw it first in South\nAfrica and later began to see it rearing its ugly head in\nthe twilight of this century.\n15\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\n\nThe curtain of this act finally falls on the fiftieth\nanniversary of the United Nations. Let us remember the joy\nand ecstasy with which the former colonial countries\nemerged into independence as Members of this body. What\ngenius woke up to think of and, later, to found this\nOrganization? What idealism sustained it? Yet a dark\nshadow haunted it in its growth; and now, as the\ncelebration of the fiftieth anniversary is upon us, we\nsomehow realize that perhaps the cold war, that Iron\nCurtain, was used by the great Powers, in the name of\ndemocracy, human rights and justice for all, simply to keep\na balance of power.\nMalawi does not wish to seem bitter in expressing\nsome of these thoughts; but 50, even in a mere human life,\nis the age at which soul-searching is important. Along with\nmany others, Malawi sowed the seeds of its own gorgon 30\nyears ago \u2014 what the Pope referred to as the totalitarian\ntotem. The pattern of Presidents-for-life and one-party\nautocracies bred a series of dictatorships supported by the\ninterests of the cold war\u2019s great Powers.\nWhen perestroika knocked on the door, man heaved\na sigh of relief. The cold war had ended. We in Malawi\nwere not left behind. A new dawn broke in the land once\ndescribed by Africa Watch as a place where silence rules.\nLast year Malawi stood up in this Assembly to declare\nproudly that a people cannot be kept down for ever by\nman\u2019s inhumanity to man. Thanks to the action of the\nUnited Nations, Malawi fought, this time not for\nindependence, but for democracy. A referendum in 1993\nand a general election, supervised by this world body and\nother friends, on 17 May 1994, gave birth to a new country.\nThis is what the Pope referred to as \u201chope\u201d.\nToday, a year and five months later, the four estates\nof democracy are taking root in Malawi. We now have an\nelective executive and a pluralist parliament with one of the\nmost active and articulate oppositions slowly learning the\ncomplex art of debate and the art of give-and-take. In\naddition, we also have an independent judiciary protecting\nthe bastion of the rule of law from which all human rights\nare protected and nurtured and we have an independent and\nfree press.\nThese four estates are almost a novelty in Malawi\nafter 30 years of autocracy and a dictatorship responsible\nfor the most vicious abuse of human life. Above all, it is\nimportant to remember that pathological hero worship is the\nprice people pay for losing their self-respect. There is\ntherefore cause to celebrate the 50 years of the life of the\nUnited Nations \u2014 especially for Malawi for, from the\nland of the dead, we have come back to the land of the\nliving.\nWe are astonished, however, that at this moment of\nrebirth Malawi \u2014 and possibly other countries \u2014 seem\nto have been abandoned. Could this be what the Pope was\ntalking about \u2014 the small nations \u2014 those which have\npower, whether it be economic or military? Where are\nthose great friends of yesteryear, the great friends of the\ndays of the cold war? We are astonished that as we are\nrejoicing in our new democracy they are now standing\naloof watching our skeletons of hitherto silenced and\nabused citizenry feeding the flickering fires of democracy\nagainst the howling winds of poverty, hunger and disease.\nIn this wider breakthrough of understanding in the\nuniverse, let us be thankful that on this tiny planet there\nis on the East River in New York a piece of land where\npeople meet to discuss problems \u2014 some no bigger than\nan ant-hill and some larger \u2014 thankful that somewhere\nthere is a little hill called Everest near Kathmandu where\nlilliputian human ants can crawl up and become heroes!\nAfter 30 Years of educated leadership we are still\none of the least developed countries in the world, highest\nin the rate of illiteracy and the most highly indebted, but\nthe most beautiful in nature and the one best qualified,\nperhaps, for a Marshall Plan.\nMalawi is among those countries in the world that\nhave a high incidence of the HIV/AIDS infection. This\npandemic has seriously affected the young and active\nsegment of the population, which is the hub of\ndevelopment activity in all sectors of the national\neconomy. We commend the untiring efforts of the World\nHealth Organization and other institutions which, together\nwith my Government, are actively engaged in tackling\nthis pandemic.\nBut perhaps I might add that, above all, the\nConference on Women held in Beijing brought to the\nfore, at least for us, the entire issue of trying to\nunderstand the whole question of man\u2019s responsibility\ntowards man and the importance of the idea of hope and\nsustenance in recognizing the role of women, for in my\ncountry 70 per cent of the economy and 70 per cent of\nhuman love and care and 70 per cent of all that makes a\nnation admirable is in the hands of women.\nHow can one understand those who caused so many\nbombs and mines to be planted in Mozambique and\nAngola? How do they think of the women and children\n16\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\n\nwho wake up with new hope and who go to fetch water or\nplant their plantations and who find themselves blown up\nby those who should have cared much more than to play\nwith such weapons \u2014 such utterly senseless weapons of\ndestruction?\nUntil recently my country hosted a large number of\nrefugees from Mozambique when that country was\nexperiencing civil strife. The size of the refugee\ncommunity, which peaked at over a million, has now\ndecreased as refugees are returning home since the\nconclusion of a peace accord between the then warring\nFRELIMO government and the forces of RENAMO.\nHowever, despite the ongoing repatriation of the\nrefugees back to Mozambique, a strong legacy of\nenvironmental degradation is left behind. Deforestation,\novergrazing, and the destruction of roads used by relief\nsupply vehicles are some of the problems which resulted\nfrom the presence of the refugees.\nIn addition, Malawi is playing host to a number of\nrefugee communities from around Africa \u2014 from Rwanda\nand Somalia \u2014 although their numbers have grown\nnowhere near those reached by our brothers and sisters\nfrom neighbouring Mozambique.\nThe Government of Malawi would like at this juncture\nto express its most sincere gratitude and appreciation for\nthe kind and invaluable assistance received from the United\nNations system, particularly through the Office of the\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugees\n(UNHCR), as well as from donor Governments and\nagencies, and non-governmental organizations at a time\nwhen we most needed help.\nSince the region experienced severe drought in the\n1992 and 1993 crop seasons, with a mild recovery in 1993\nand 1994, rainfall has continued to be erratic in southern\nAfrica. The economy of Malawi, which is almost entirely\nagro-based, has been hard-hit, resulting in chronic food\nshortages. This season has not been any better. Once again,\nthe country faces severe food shortages, which the\nGovernment has to meet through importing grain, mainly\nmaize. Is this a test of our democracy? Can a democracy,\neven a classical Grecian one, grow on an empty stomach?\nAgainst this background is the programme for the\nalleviation of poverty, which the new Government of\nMalawi has enunciated in order to tackle the chronic\npoverty which it inherited from the previous regime. The\npoverty-alleviation programme seeks to target the rural\npoor, who are in the majority as the primary beneficiary.\nA poverty-alleviation fund has been set up, along with a\nMalawi social action fund, which is a component thereof.\nThe programme is multisectoral in approach and aims at\npromoting the education and health sectors among others.\nThe Government has, in this regard, introduced free\nprimary school education and has also tried to increase\nthe number of schools.\nMy Government would therefore like to thank the\nUnited Nations system and the donor community and the\nmany other institutions in the private sector \u2014 especially\nthe missionary sector \u2014 which have extended assistance\nin our development endeavours, for if our courage and\nhope had not been evoked by the Catholic bishops of\nMalawi I would not be speaking here today. I am a\nproduct of the 30 years of exile which totalitarianism\nimposed on my country.\nThe success of the poverty alleviation programme\ntherefore becomes a major aspect of our hopes and\nexpectations. The new culture of tolerance has created a\nhighly conducive climate for investment. We have\ntherefore opened the door to prospective investors to\ncome, explore and take advantage of the opportunities\nwhich exist in other areas such as tourism, irrigation,\nmining and other sectors of the economy.\nMalawi has noted with interest the ongoing efforts\nto reform the United Nations system. We have observed\nin particular the various proposals that have been put\nforward on the reform of the Security Council. The\nSecurity Council is, truly, an important organ of the\nOrganization. It is therefore proper and fitting that an\norgan of such high standing should operate in an\naccountable and transparent manner. In addition, Malawi\nsupports measures aimed at enhancing equitable\nrepresentation in an effort to reflect the existing\ninternational political configuration as well as the\ncomposition of the United Nations.\nAs Malawi consolidates genuine freedom and\ndemocracy it is pleasing to note that the rest of the\nsouthern African region has unwaveringly embraced this\nnew culture of political pluralism and tolerance. More\nimportant, those countries which have for long been\ndevastated by civil strife have either resolved or are in the\nprocess of resolving their misunderstandings.\nMalawi welcomes encouraging moves towards the\ndemobilization of combatants of both the Angolan\nGovernment Forces and the National Union for the Total\n17\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\n\nIndependence of Angola (UNITA) under the third United\nNations Angola Verification Mission (UNAVEM III). We\nfully commend the invaluable role which we, the United\nNations, are playing in Angola.\nIn South Africa, the post-apartheid Government of\nPresident Nelson Mandela is now firmly in place.\nIncidentally, I am glad I can pronounce it properly, for it is\nnot \u201capartheid\u201d but \u201capart hate\u201d \u2014 put apart and hate. The\ndemise of \u201capart hate\u201d brightened prospects for peace and\ncooperation in southern Africa. Malawi therefore calls upon\nthe international community to render unflinching support\nto the new and emerging democracies in the region so that\nthey do not slide back to anarchy and authoritarianism.\nThe Malawi Government is concerned about the slow\npace at which the identification of eligible voters is\nproceeding in Western Sahara. We appreciate the efforts of\nthe United Nations to extend its Mission for the\nReferendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO) as a show of\ngenuine commitment to resolving this long-standing issue.\nIt should, however, be noted that without the commitment\nof the principal players in the matter the current efforts will\nall be in vain. We therefore call upon the Government of\nthe Kingdom of Morocco to allow the United Nations\nMission a free hand in its operations so that the deadline of\nJanuary 1996 for the holding of a referendum can be met.\nMalawi has noted with a good deal of concern the\nhorrendous massacres of innocent people in the Central\nAfrican country of Rwanda. However, despite the continued\nexistence of ethnic tensions, the efforts of the United\nNations to ensure that peace finally descends upon this\ntroubled area have not faltered. To this end, my\nGovernment earnestly commends the role played by the\nUnited Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR),\nto which we have made a modest contribution of military\nobservers as a demonstration of Malawi\u2019s commitment to\nthe restoration of peace.\nThe militarization of the refugee camps outside\nRwanda is a source of great concern to Malawi. We\ntherefore call upon the international community to do its\nutmost to reverse the reported inflow of weaponry into the\nrefugee camps, and appeal to the people of Rwanda to\nexercise political maturity in order to avoid a degeneration\nof the situation into the tragedy of yesteryear, especially\nwhen the mandate of UNAMIR expires on 9 December\n1995.\nMy Government is encouraged by the progress being\nmade in the Middle East peace process. We commend the\ncourage and determination of the Government of the State\nof Israel as well as the leadership of the Palestine\nNational Authority to move ahead. The two players\ndeserve the unflinching support and applause of the\ninternational community to ensure that elements which are\nopposed to the peace process do not succeed.\nOn the other hand, we have observed with remorse\nthe tragedy which has unfolded in the countries of the\nformer Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Innocent civilians\nhave been the most hurt in the shifting fortunes of war in\nthe Balkan region. Understandably, the United Nations\nand the rest of the international community can play only\na limited role in the resolution of the conflict. My\nGovernment, therefore, calls upon the principal players in\nthe region to cooperate with the international community\nin finding a lasting solution to the conflict.\nIt is the hope of my Government that the Korean\npeople on both sides of the thirty-eighth parallel will\nsustain and strengthen contact, with the aim of breaking\nthe existing impasse in the reunification of the divided\npeninsula.\nIn the same vein, my Government favours any\nefforts the United Nations may undertake with the aim of\nresolving the issue of the international status of the\nRepublic of China on Taiwan in a manner which would\nbe acceptable to both the Government of the People\u2019s\nRepublic of China and the authorities in Taiwan.\nAs the United Nations celebrates 50 years of\nexistence, let us take full stock of the work of the\nOrganization since its birth. Let us retrace our steps and\nweigh our achievements and failures so that we may\napproach the twenty-first century with renewed vigour\nand commitment. Let us not lose sight of the ideals which\nthe Organization stands for as we continue to uphold the\nnecessary flexibility for its adaptation to current trends.\nLastly, to those who love and cherish democracy let\nthe word go out, lest we forget, that the name\n\u201cNyasaland\u201d at one time represented the biblical David\nand Goliath in the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland,\nwhich, if it had been given birth, would have made the\nscript for that region a different story. When the borders\nthat defined our nationhood opened again and we became\npart of Mother Africa and the rest of the world, our State\nPresident, Bakili Muluzi, burst out of a suffocated\nMalawi, which had become a prison, and invited the\nworld to come and rejoice with us. The silent Malawians\nwho had crept out of Malawi, cautious not to speak to\n18\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\n\nothers about the pain of imprisonment and death in their\nprison country, now saw a new leadership, not only in\nPresident Muluzi, but in the people of the country\nthemselves. If these 15 months of the new Malawi have not\nmeant much to the World Bank, the fatigued donors and the\nsceptical theoreticians, let them remember the following\ngreat words of Pliny:\n\u201cThere is always something new out of Africa. Its\npresence on this continent, like the great seas that\nsurround it, are legendary. Ignore Africa to your\nperil.\u201d (Pliny the Elder, Natural History, VII, 77)\nIn the same breath, we plead to you here again and\nagain: listen to what was said at the United Nations social\nsummit meeting, at the United Nations women\u2019s summit\nmeeting and during the International Year of the Child.\nThere is no hope for mankind in the twenty-first century\nand after without a United Nations based on those three\ngreat occasions. Malawi pleads to those great nations that\nhave grown up with the ideals and ideas of human giants of\nthe world not to jump off the ship that carries us all. No\none can say, \u201cStop the world, I want to get off.\u201d\nOn behalf of the people of Malawi, I thank Members\nof the General Assembly for their attention.\n"

Indeed, these new economic\nrealities have important implications for the survival of\nsmall and vulnerable economies such as Grenada\u2019s, which\nare so heavily dependent on a favourable external\nenvironment.\nIt can hardly be disputed that the traditional economic\nand trade relations on which Grenada relied for so long are\nnow being threatened and could shortly cease to exist. The\nprocess of adjustment to the new hemispheric challenges\nresulting from the entry into force of the North American\nFree Trade Agreement on 1 January 1994; the conclusion\nof the Uruguay Round agreements of the General\nAgreement on Tariffs and Trade; the establishment of the\nWorld Trade Organization; the call for the establishment of\na free-trade area of the Americas by the year 2005; and the\nformation of the Association of Caribbean States will\nundoubtedly pose challenges which will require adjustments\non the domestic level, particularly on the part of our\nmanufacturers.\nFurthermore, these recently formed and soon to be\nestablished trading blocs will significantly transform the\ntrade policy framework in which developing island\neconomies will have to operate into the twenty-first century.\nWhile these will offer us new trading opportunities,\nparticularly in the medium to long term, they will in the\nshort term cause us to face many transitional problems,\nmainly because of the erosion of preferential access that\nwe now enjoy in major markets of the developed world.\nIt is in this context, therefore, that Grenada issues a\ncall to the developed world to work with us as we\nformulate appropriate policy responses to realize the\nbenefits from and adjust to the changes in the global\ntrading system. It is to be emphasized that the new\nEuropean Union regime for bananas, though not in\nessence an effect of the Uruguay Round, will result in\nmajor losses in export revenue for all the Windward\nIslands in the Caribbean. Moreover, the challenge of this\nlimited preferential arrangement by some of our closest\nallies in the developed world is cause for serious concern.\nI must remind this distinguished gathering that the\nissue of bananas has much more than economic\nsignificance. Indeed, the heavy dependence on this\nagricultural commodity by thousands in our islands\nmust \u2014 I repeat, must \u2014 be underscored.\nIn fact, the destruction of the banana industry would\nlead to serious hardships and could constitute a threat to\nour traditionally sound democratic process. Sustainable\nhuman development in our small island States could be\nseverely threatened.\nMy delegation wishes to make it clear that, while\nGrenada embraces the philosophy of trade liberalization,\ntolerance and an understanding of our cause on the part\nof larger economies are necessary. We cannot hope to\ndevelop without a significant inflow of technical\nassistance, foreign capital and technology.\nWe therefore call on the countries in the developed\nworld to provide us with this much-needed assistance in\norder to ensure that we can participate effectively in this\nemerging \u201cNew World Trade Order\u201d.\nMy delegation will continue to argue that moves\ntowards global trade liberalization and reciprocity should\ncomplement and not obstruct the efforts of less developed\ncountries to implement positive structural reforms.\nGrenada, for its part, has already commenced the process\nof substantially reducing import tariffs and other barriers.\nWhat is now sought is a recognition of these\ninitiatives and a negotiating framework in which our\nability to achieve greater market access is enhanced,\nwhile our economic and financial restructuring can take\nplace in a manner and time-frame appropriate to our\nspecial circumstances.\n2\n\n\nGrenada continues to support the view that special and\npreferential treatment cannot continue in perpetuity. But it\nmust be recognized that the special needs of the relatively\nless developed countries must be taken into account. The\nchallenge, therefore, is how to design an acceptable\nreciprocal arrangement among unequal partners that will\npromote prosperity through free trade and integration in our\nworld without endangering the process of sustainable social\nand economic development. It is crucial, therefore, that the\ndeveloped countries assist the developing world to create\ndomestic capabilities that will enhance its capacity to draw\nbenefits from trade liberalization and will soften the burden\nof adjustment to the new requirements of global free trade.\nThe question of the environment and of sustainable\neconomic development remains at the heart of our concerns.\nIt is also a central issue for small island developing States\nin particular, and developing countries in general.\nIf we continue to reaffirm that human beings are at the\ncentre of sustainable development and that they have a right\nto a healthy and productive life in harmony with nature,\naction must be taken at all levels and, all the more so, at\nthe international level, to facilitate the process. This would\nensure that developing countries, and particularly small\nisland developing States, are provided with the know-how\nand the resources to enable the implementation of the\ndecisions and recommendations arising out of the United\nNations Conference on the Environment and Development\nin Rio in 1992, the United Nations Global Conference on\nthe Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing\nStates in 1994 in Bridgetown, Barbados and the many other\nsignificant global Conferences.\nThe vulnerability of small island States and the threat\nto our fragile ecosystems were recently manifested by the\npassage of hurricanes Iris, Luis and Marilyn. Our economic\nviability and sustainable economic growth are indeed at\nstake. In this regard, Grenada looks forward to the\nfulfilment of pledged commitments by developed countries\nto assist small island developing States achieve sustainable\ndevelopment.\nThe role of science and technology in development\nmust be underscored. My delegation calls upon developed\ncountries to provide developing countries with the necessary\naccess to biotechnologies to promote and facilitate\nsustainable economic growth.\nInformation technology and human resource\ndevelopment are key elements towards social and economic\nprogress \u2014 elements which would enable us to improve\nour productivity and competitiveness in priority areas as\nwe move into the twenty-first century.\nThe United Nations was created by men of vision,\ncourage and foresight who understood the need for\ncooperation among nations and for hope over despair.\nUndoubtedly, the United Nations, in its \u201cAgenda for\nDevelopment\u201d, has succeeded in bringing to the world\u2019s\nattention the need for a re-evaluation of the role of the\nUnited Nations in development, taking into account such\ncritical issues as the empowerment of women, the\nalleviation of poverty and hunger and the link between\ndevelopment and population, human rights and the\ncreation of an environment for world peace and security.\nThe social forces of poverty are among the leading\ncauses of environmental degradation and a significant\ncontributor to the loss of biological diversity. Poverty and\nunemployment also contribute to greater social problems,\namong which is the illicit traffic in narcotics. Efforts to\neradicate the traffic in illicit drugs can have little effect at\nthe national and international levels unless commitments\nare made and agreements are entered into to develop\nprogrammes aimed at the alleviation of poverty.\nMy delegation is hopeful that the follow-up to the\nWorld Summit for Social Development, held in\nCopenhagen in March this year, will embrace those\nprinciples which call for social inclusion and which\nfacilitate the development of strategies to ensure that\nyouth, the disabled and the elderly play a more\nmeaningful role in social and economic development.\nIndeed, the Fourth World Conference on Women,\nwhich ended only last month in Beijing, has given\nimpetus to the need for programmes that speak to the\nissues of women in development and, most critically, the\nempowerment of women in local communities, enabling\ntheir full participation at all levels in the process of\nnational development.\nGrenada is encouraged by the new spirit of\ninternational cooperation built on a shared partnership\nbetween multilateral financial institutions and\nGovernments. However, the models suggested for\neconomic development have not been sufficiently tested\nand are often ill-suited to meet the needs of the society in\nwhich they are applied, sometimes resulting in disastrous\nsocial and economic consequences.\nWhile we seek to put in place all the necessary\nmeasures to ensure the efficient and effective management\n3\n\n\nof our domestic affairs, we strongly urge multilateral\ninstitutions to include in these models for development a\ncomponent that provides skills training and, in particular,\ntraining in the use of technologies to enable young people\nto find productive employment in the private sector and to\nfacilitate the process towards equitable social and economic\ndevelopment.\nMy delegation also supports the United Nations\nresponse to security and international humanitarian needs\nand encourages greater emphasis on human-rights\nmonitoring.\nWe live in an era of changing norms and of emerging\nnations and democracies, where no institution or country\ncan stand alone. In this connection, the reforms currently\nbeing undertaken within the United Nations system should\nyield more positive results \u2014 greater collaboration and\ncooperation on issues, rather than confrontation and\ndisunity. New, emerging economic nations or Powers are\neager to take their rightful place in institutions and agencies\nonce dominated by traditional super-Powers.\nGrenada also believes that in this era of reform and\nrestructuring within the United Nations due consideration\nshould be given to a composition of the Security Council\nthat reflects the geopolitical and economic realities of our\ntime.\nOn this auspicious occasion, as we celebrate the\nfiftieth anniversary of the United Nations, let us reaffirm\nour commitment to the principles of the Charter which\nguides this Organization. Grenada not only wishes to\nemphasize adherence to these principles, but has worked to\nestablish conditions under which all peoples may exercise\ntheir equal and inalienable rights.\nIn his opening statement the President of the General\nAssembly at its fiftieth session stated:\n\u201cthe United Nations has ceased to be an\nintergovernmental organization with a limited\nmembership and has become the only international\norganization that is universal. Efforts must be made to\nensure that all States that are not yet Members should\nseek to be admitted in the near future. For the same\nreason, the most serious penalty imposed on a\nMember State should never be expulsion, but rather\nsuspension\u201d\nfor an indefinite period\n\u201c, for the United Nations must, as a matter of\nprinciple, include all the world\u2019s countries.\u201d (Official\nRecords of the General Assembly, Fiftieth Session,\nPlenary Meetings, 1st meeting, p. 7)\nBut as we meet today the Republic of China on\nTaiwan and its more than 21 million people remain\nexcluded from participation and representation in the\nUnited Nations. It is on the basis of that principle of\nuniversality that Grenada urges all Members to consider\nthat, in renewing our oaths, we should forthwith seek to\nright this wrong. The inclusion of the Republic of China\nwill be an added contribution to global cooperation in\nfields such as trade, economic development,\nenvironmental protection, sustainable development and\nmultilateral efforts to fight drug trafficking. Moreover, the\nRepublic of China is committed to the promotion of\ninternational development assistance to developing\ncountries.\nGrenada wishes to urge again that an ad hoc\ncommittee be set up at the earliest possible time to\nconsider the special case of the Republic of China on\nTaiwan and respond positively to its wish to join this\nworld Organization.\nMy delegation is confident that improved\ncooperation between developed and developing countries\nand the consolidation of related agencies and programmes\nwould lead to enhanced prospects for the discovery of\nsolutions to global problems and for the promotion of\nsustainable economic, social and cultural development.\nAs we look forward to celebrating the fiftieth\nanniversary of the Untied Nations, and as individual\nnations formulate plans and strategies to move into the\ntwenty-first century, which poses as many challenges as\nit presents opportunities, let us recommit ourselves to the\nnoble principles of the Charter, guided by the spirit of\npartnership and cooperation, ever united in our efforts to\nachieve peace, democracy and prosperity for all our\npeoples.\n"

        "file_text": "I wish first of all, on behalf of\nthe delegation of Nepal and on my own behalf, to\ncongratulate His Excellency Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral\non his election as President of the fiftieth session of the\nGeneral Assembly. He has been asked to guide our\ndeliberations at a time of historic importance. His\ndemonstrated abilities, experience and wisdom are an\nassurance for us that we have made the right choice. I\nassure him of the full cooperation of my delegation as he\nperforms his duties.\nI should like also to express my appreciation to His\nExcellency Mr. Amara Essy, Minister of Foreign Affairs of\nC\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, for the excellent manner in which he steered\nthe work of the forty-ninth session of the General\nAssembly.\nMay I also greet the Secretary-General of the United\nNations, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, to whom I wish to\nconvey the gratitude of His Majesty\u2019s Government of Nepal\nfor his tenacious and tireless efforts for peace. Since his\nelection to the office of Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros-\nGhali has succeeded in large measure in giving shape to\nUnited Nations debates through his proposals in the\nAgendas for Peace and for Development. We also share his\nvision for better management of the Organization. As a\nfunctional democracy with widened commitment to human\nrights and justice, we await with great interest his Agenda\nfor Democracy. These will be the areas of concern of the\nUnited Nations in the years to come.\nWe are meeting here at a very important juncture. The\nUnited Nations is celebrating its fiftieth anniversary, in\npreparation for our march into the next century. This\nprompts us to do some new soul-searching about what kind\nof world we want to shape and what role we want the\nUnited Nations to play in it. These questions do not lend\nthemselves to easy answers, but together, at this moment,\nwe can begin the search.\nFifty years ago the United Nations came into being\nwith a mission: to maintain international peace and\nsecurity, to forge friendly relations amongst nations and\npeoples, to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights\nand to promote economic and social progress in larger\nfreedom. Despite the immediate onset of the cold war and\nthe resultant debilitating Power rivalry, the United Nations\nhas since remained actively engaged in fulfilling the\nmission. It has had a great impact on the democratization\nof international relations. Its efforts to promote economic\nand social development have borne fruit. No less\nimportant has been its role in the broadening and\nstrengthening of international law. By helping to\naccelerate the decolonization process and ensuring the\npeoples\u2019 right to self-determination, it has facilitated the\nemergence of many independent nations worldwide. Nor\ncan we forget the Organization\u2019s contribution to the fight\nagainst apartheid. Today, South Africa has emerged as a\ndemocratic, non-racial nation \u2014 yet another proud\nMember of the world body, whose goal of universality of\nmembership is near attainment. My delegation extends its\nheartiest welcome and congratulations to our newest\nfellow Member, Palau.\nThe world is undergoing a transformation of\nmonumental proportions, generating fresh hopes and\naspirations for peoples all over the world. The pace of\ndemocratic reforms continues to surge and so do concerns\nfor the protection and promotion of human rights and\nindividual freedoms. A more liberal world-trade regime is\ntaking shape. Economic interdependence is being\nacknowledged as a fact of international life. The logic of\nconfrontation is increasingly giving way to the logic of\nconciliation and cooperation throughout the world. We\nbelieve that now is the time for us to seize this new-found\nopportunity to make the Charter\u2019s goal of attaining a\nworld of peace, prosperity, equality and justice\nirrevocable and timeless.\nThese positive developments notwithstanding, we are\nstill far from universal peace. Conflicts of enormous\ncruelty continue to plague the world. The scourge of war\nstill brings untold sorrow to large segments of mankind.\nWe have witnessed, day in and day out, hundreds and\nthousands of innocent people falling victim to hostilities\nand the all-but-forgotten phenomena of \u201cethnic cleansing\u201d\nand genocide. Thousands more are dying of starvation\n17\n\n\nand disease. Similarly, thousands are being forced to leave\ntheir homelands as refugees in different parts of the world.\nBosnia and Herzegovina, Somalia and Rwanda present a\nterrifying picture of what has taken place. These appalling\nsituations challenge the ability of the United Nations and its\nMember States not only to maintain peace and security, but\nalso to secure a minimum of basic human decency and\nneeds.\nThat having been said, let me hasten to add that the\ndisappointments we experience are not solely the results of\nthe Organization\u2019s failure, but are basically the reflection of\na fast-changing global environment in which our\nexpectations were unusually high. The United Nations was\ncalled upon to deal with situations for which it was not\npolitically and logistically prepared. We take comfort in the\nfact that for every failed peace operation there have been\nnumerous others of which we can be justly proud and in\nwhich, but for a United Nations presence, the fatalities\nwould have been vastly greater. The United Nations has\nhelped bring peace to Angola, Cambodia, El Salvador,\nHaiti, Mozambique and Namibia. Even in the territories of\nthe former Yugoslavia, the real good the United Nations\nhas done is being appreciated now. The 8 September peace\nplan advanced by the Contact Group of five Powers and\naccepted in principle by the concerned parties is a beacon\nof light at the end of the tunnel. My delegation supports the\nGeneva agreement on the principles of a settlement based\non the territorial integrity of the States of the former\nYugoslavia within internationally recognized borders.\nMy delegation also notes with great satisfaction not\nonly that the peace process in the Middle East is gaining\nmomentum, but that it has become irreversible. The signing\nof the Israeli-Palestinian agreement in Washington on 28\nSeptember by Prime Minister Rabin and Chairman Arafat,\nin the presence of President Clinton, King Hussein of\nJordan and President Mubarak of Egypt, is a turning point\nin the history of the Middle East. Nepal earnestly hopes\nthat talks will soon resume between Israel and Syria and\nbetween Israel and Lebanon so that a just and lasting peace,\nas envisaged by the United Nations, can be guaranteed\nthroughout the region.\nThe return of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to Haiti\nhas been a gain for the United Nations and democracy. The\nprocess of peace-building and strengthening of democracy\nis taking hold in that country. My country is proud to be a\npart of this process through our participation in the United\nNations Mission in Haiti.\nIn its primary function of maintaining international\npeace and security, the United Nations has peace-keeping\noperations as an important tool for conflict resolution. My\ncountry has a long history of participation in these peace\nefforts. From the United Nations Observation Group in\nLebanon in 1958 through the United Nations Emergency\nForce, the United Nations Operation in Somalia and\nseveral others to the current United Nations Protection\nForce in the former Yugoslavia, the United Nations\nInterim Force in Lebanon and the Mission in Haiti, Nepal\nhas committed its troops, military observers and civilian\npolice personnel to United Nations peace initiatives. Many\nof our peace-keepers have laid down their lives in the\nperformance of their duties. I stand here today to reaffirm\nNepal\u2019s continued response to any call for a contribution\nto the peace efforts of the United Nations.\nPeace-keeping operations have of late become\nmultifunctional. Their functions have extended beyond the\ntraditional role of monitoring cease-fire and truce\nagreements. They have been drawn into multifarious relief\nand humanitarian duties in excessively difficult and\ndangerous situations. Because of a lack of clarity in\nmandates and the absence of contingency plans and\nreinforcements, which should have been clearly foreseen,\nnot only have our Blue Helmets been forced to stand\naside as the posts they were manning were overrun: they\nhave also been held hostage, chained and humiliated in\ntheir dignity as men and soldiers. Such sorry spectacles\nshould not be seen again. The mandates for the new\ngeneration of peace-keeping operations must be clearly\ndefined. Above all, it is essential that the capacity of the\nUnited Nations to serve the interests of peace in a timely\nfashion be increased. In this connection, I should like to\nreiterate my delegation\u2019s support for the initiative\nconcerning the stand-by forces to be made available to the\nUnited Nations within pre-agreed response times for any\nnew or expanded peace-keeping operation.\nIn the final analysis, peace-keeping operations are\nonly a temporary arrangement. Real solutions lie in\ngetting at the root of the problem, which can best be\novercome by promoting economic development,\nprotecting human rights, securing social justice and\naffirming democratic principles. Without real progress in\nthese areas, international peace and security will remain\nan unattainable goal. It is therefore imperative to restore\nthe balance between the United Nations political and\nmilitary activities and its economic and social\nprogrammes.\n18\n\n\nThe 1990s have often been described as a period of\nunprecedented changes marked by the end of the cold war,\nthe cessation of Power rivalries, economic globalization and\ninterdependence, a greater flow of capital, goods and\nservices, and the widespread dissemination of ideas through\na revolution in communications. A huge peace dividend\nwas expected to accrue to the global economy. But these\nhopes have been dashed because the condition of the\nneediest countries, including the least developed and land-\nlocked, has actually declined in the past five years. A\nconstructive dialogue and partnership between developed\nand developing countries based on a mutuality of interests,\ninterdependence and shared responsibility has not\nmaterialized. Many developing countries have carried out\npainful structural reforms but the socio-economic outlook\nhas not been encouraging for them. Ironically, even the new\nworld trade regime, promising fresh trade and development\nopportunities for many countries, will have an adverse\nimpact on the economies of the least developed if\nsubstantial corrective measures are not taken in time.\nA number of important conferences in recent years\nhave underlined both the inadequacies and the promises of\ninternational cooperation. Agenda 21 of the Rio Conference\non Environment and Development remains largely on paper\nfor want of necessary resources. The central role of human\nbeings in development was affirmed last year by the\nInternational Conference on Population and Development.\nThe Copenhagen World Summit for Social Development\nrecognized three interrelated concerns of the United\nNations: poverty, unemployment and the disintegration of\nsocieties. The Fourth World Conference on Women, in\nBeijing last month, sought to address the basic Charter\nprinciple of absolute equality between men and women in\nthe contemporary world order.\nIndividual human beings and the improvement of their\nlots are at the centre of all development, as is emphasized\nso eloquently by the Secretary-General in his Agenda for\nDevelopment. Peace, economic growth, the environment,\njustice and democracy are now recognized to be the five\nintegral dimensions of development. Greater resources and\npolitical will are urgently needed to transform our promises\nand commitments into action. Strengthening rather than\nweakening the principal development arms of the United\nNations, such as the United Nations Development\nProgramme, the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund, the United\nNations Conference on Trade and Development and the\nUnited Nations Population Fund; a reformed Economic and\nSocial Council; reforms within the United Nations\nstructures; and increased cooperation between the United\nNations bodies and Bretton Woods institutions are key to a\nnew approach to meaningful international development\ncooperation in the next half century of the United\nNations.\nThe last decade of the century has also opened up\nexciting possibilities to prevent the proliferation of\nweapons of mass destruction and to decelerate the arms\nrace. As host to the United Nations Regional Centre for\nPeace and Disarmament in Asia and the Pacific, Nepal\nhas been a strong consistent believer in institutional\narrangements for the strengthening of the world\ndisarmament campaign. We believe in international,\nregional and subregional dialogues for the enhancement\nof openness, transparency and confidence-building and for\nthe promotion of disarmament and security. The major\nfocus of disarmament measures in 1995 was the Review\nand Extension Conference of the Nuclear Non-\nProliferation Treaty held in New York in April-May. Not\nonly did the Conference strengthen the nuclear non-\nproliferation regime by extending the Treaty for an\nindefinite period, it also adopted a widely hailed package\nof decisions, emphasizing the need for the establishment\nof a comprehensive disarmament regime to meet the\nsecurity concerns of all countries through the fulfilment\nof commitments undertaken by the nuclear-weapon States.\nThese commitments include the speedy conclusion of a\ncomprehensive test-ban treaty, legally binding security\nassurances to non-nuclear-weapon States against the use\nor threat of use of nuclear weapons, the unimpeded non-\ndiscriminatory transfer of nuclear technology for peaceful\npurposes, a cut-off in the production of fissile materials\nfor weapons purposes and the eventual elimination of all\nnuclear and other weapons of mass destruction. We\ntherefore express our deep disappointment at the\nresumption of nuclear testing. We sincerely hope that\nthese series of tests will not impede the conclusion of a\ncomprehensive test-ban treaty in 1996.\nNepal also extends its support for initiatives for a\ncomplete ban on chemical, biological and other inhumane\nweapons such as anti-personnel mines. I wish here to\npoint out that in the post-Second World War era, more\nthan these categories of weapons, conventional weapons\nhave caused the most misery to mankind. The\nconsideration of conventional weapons should also be a\npriority of United Nations efforts. May I take this\nopportunity to reiterate our position as to the utilization of\nthe resources released by disarmament measures for\ndevelopment, particularly in developing countries.\n19\n\n\nIt is entirely proper that the approach of the fiftieth\nanniversary of the United Nations should have spurred a\nvariety of serious studies on the future of the Organization.\nAmong these, the consensus resolution prepared and\nnegotiated by the President of the General Assembly at its\nforty-ninth session on the strengthening of the United\nNations system is of great relevance at the present time.\nWhile high-level working groups have been patiently busy\npreparing recommendations to improve the financial\nsituation of the United Nations and concerning the\nexpansion of the Security Council, Nepal believes more in\na coordinated and integrated approach to making our\nOrganization more efficient, effective and adaptable to the\nchanging times.\nThere appears to be universal recognition that the\nSecurity Council, the principal organ of the United Nations\nprimarily responsible for the maintenance of international\npeace and security, should more fully reflect the realities of\nthe contemporary world.\nThe perpetuation of exclusive rights may not be\njustified, especially without the proper accommodation of\nother pressing considerations. There is undoubted consensus\non the need for an increase in membership. If an increase\nhas to be effected in both the permanent and non-permanent\ncategories, the basic principles of regional and democratic\nrepresentation should not be vitiated. In the selection of\nmembers of the Security Council, due regard should of\ncourse be specifically paid to the contribution of Member\nStates to the maintenance of international peace and\nsecurity. However, particular consideration should be given\nto ensuring that no region should be under-represented or\nunrepresented, and that a minimum of balance is maintained\nin the overall membership between the industrial North and\nthe developing South.\nIt is painful to see the United Nations afflicted with\nfinancial problems. In our view, this is not due to faulty\nassessment systems. The non-payment of accepted\nobligations is largely to blame. The present deficit of more\nthan three and half billion dollars amounts in fact to more\nthan three times the regular budget of the Organization.\nWhile we are prepared for a review of the current\nassessment systems based on the doctrine of capacity to\npay, and while we believe that no one country should be\nasked to assume excessive burdens, we urge that Member\nStates pay their dues on time. We note that the Secretary-\nGeneral has been forced to resort to cross-funding of\nregular budget deficits from the peace-keeping budget. This\nis obviously not fair to troop-contributing nations, many of\nwhich are developing countries. The withholding of the\nreimbursements due to them shifts the burden from rich\ncountries to poorer ones.\nIn conclusion, I wish to touch briefly on the regional\ncooperation activities taking place in the South Asian\nregion. The South Asian Association for Regional\nCooperation (SAARC) will celebrate its tenth anniversary\nin December this year. Through the medium of SAARC,\nNepal is pursuing a policy of promoting regional\ncooperation in a pragmatic and result-oriented manner.\nWe have identified and are engaged in various areas of\ncooperation, from the suppression of terrorism to fighting\ndrug abuse and trafficking, from environmental\npreservation to poverty alleviation. The South Asian\nPreferential Trading Arrangement (SAPTA), which is\nentering into force this year, is one of our important\nregional cooperation measures. Nepal looks forward to\nworking together with our regional partners with greater\nvigour and determination to bring about regional peace,\nstability, progress and cooperation.\n"

We wish him well\nas he guides the work of this historic session, which\ncoincides with the commemoration of the fiftieth\nanniversary of the Organization. Knowing as I do\nMr. Freitas do Amaral\u2019s distinction as an educator and a\nstatesman, I welcome his election.\nMoreover, the President represents a friendly country,\nPortugal, whose involvement in Africa is of long standing\nand which shares with Cameroon a part of our history:\nWhen he alit on the coast of the Gulf of Guinea in 1472,\nthe Portuguese Fernando Po was much impressed with the\nabundance of shrimp in the waters off what is now the city\nof Douala and named the place \u201cRio dos Camar\u00f5es\u201d \u2014\nShrimp River \u2014 from which Cameroon takes its name.\nWe also convey our appreciation to His Excellency\nMr. Amara Essy, Minister for Foreign Affairs of\nC\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, for the way in which he carried out his\nresponsibilities as President of the General Assembly at its\nforty-ninth session.\nFinally, we pledge to the Secretary-General,\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, our constant support in his\ntireless efforts to enable the Organization to attain its\nnoble purposes.\nIt is of enormous significance that the present\nsession of the General Assembly should coincide with the\nfiftieth anniversary of the Organization. The United\nNations, which sums up and expresses the deep-felt\naspiration of the peoples and nations of the world to\npeace, freedom and progress, has become an\nindispensable conclave of nations. The Organization\u2019s\nuniversality makes it the ideal forum for governing the\nworld order.\nThe celebration of the fiftieth anniversary should\ntherefore be a source of satisfaction to the entire\ninternational community. It provides an opportunity to\ngauge how far we have come since the beginning and to\nconsider our views on the future of the Organization.\nWhen they created the United Nations after the Second\nWorld War, the founders affirmed their determination to\nsave succeeding generations from the scourge of war.\nFortunately, for more than half a century the\nNorth \u2014 once the epicentre of most of history\u2019s major\nconflicts \u2014 has been a place of peace and cooperation;\nand, despite the build-up of weapons of mass destruction,\nthe rivalry between the two great ideological and military\nalliances did not drag international society into a third\nworld war, which would have sealed the fate of mankind.\nAware of the danger to the world posed by the arms\nrace, the United Nations encouraged the conclusion of the\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and\nits indefinite extension; it has promoted the creation of\ndenuclearized zones, inter alia in Africa, and the\nconclusion of the Convention on the prohibition of\nchemical weapons; and it has given decisive impetus to\nmultilateral negotiations on disarmament.\nWe are glad that, in its ongoing quest for peace, the\nOrganization has been able when necessary to adapt the\nCharter to the realities, including by devising the notion\nof peace-keeping operations, which have defused many\nconflicts and created favourable conditions for dialogue\nand negotiation.\nBy awarding the Nobel Peace Prize to United\nNations peace-keeping forces on 29 September 1988, the\nNobel prize committee paid tribute to the devotion and\ncourage of the more than half a million men and women\n19\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\n\nwho since 1948 have served the cause of peace all over the\nworld.\nEven if in recent years peace-keeping operations have\nhad mixed results and have been accused of consuming the\nlion\u2019s share of United Nations resources to the detriment of\ndevelopment, it must be recognized that while the path has\nnot always been smooth, these operations have on the\nwhole yielded positive results. The \u201cAgenda for Peace\u201d,\nthen, remains relevant, and must continue to be the\nfoundation of United Nations peace-keeping operations.\nCameroon supports the recommendations of the\nWorking Group to strengthen these operations by defining\nin advance precise objectives, the timeframe for the\nintervention, and the resources needed for implementation.\nSimilarly, and as we have always said, the United Nations\nmust strengthen its cooperation with regional and\nsubregional organizations by making available the means\nnecessary to enable them to discharge their peace-keeping\nmandate. That is why we welcome cooperation between the\nUnited Nations and the Organization of African Unity in\nthe area of prevention, management and settlement of\nconflicts on a continent riddled with crises and conflicts of\nmany forms and many dimensions.\nThis applies also on the subregional level: to the role\nin the area of peace-keeping of the Standing Advisory\nCommittee on Security Questions in Central Africa, which\ndeserves support, as the Committee, which was created with\nthe assistance of the Secretary-General, brings together\n11 Central African countries which have decided to set up\nwithin their national armed forces units specializing in\npeace-keeping operations to be carried out under the\nauspices of the United Nations and the Organization of\nAfrican Unity. Cameroon trusts that the United Nations will\nshow greater interest in this available force of more than\n10,000 soldiers, which could serve as reserve forces for\npeace missions.\nAnother area where United Nations action has been\nparticularly significant is decolonization. Thanks to that\naction and to their own peoples\u2019 emancipation struggles,\nmany colonial Territories have gained independence and\nsovereignty; today they make up more than half of the\nmembership of the Organization. More than any other\ncontinent, Africa is proud to have unswervingly promoted\nthe process of its own total liberation, which was recently\ncompleted with the end of apartheid in South Africa.\nHere we recall with gratitude that it was under United\nNations auspices that Cameroon attained sovereignty after\nhaving been first a German colony, then a Territory under\nLeague of Nations Mandate, then a United Nations Trust\nTerritory. It is our hope that the few Territories remaining\nunder foreign administration will freely exercise their\ninalienable right to self-determination, so that the United\nNations objective of the complete eradication of\ncolonialism by the year 2000 may be realized.\nAlso to the credit of the Organization are the\npromotion of human rights, the ongoing development and\ncodification of international law, and achievements in all\nthe areas covered by the specialized agencies.\nThe promotion and protection of human rights in\ngeneral and those of the most vulnerable and\ndisadvantaged in particular are at the centre of our\nconcerns and those of the United Nations. The creation of\nthe Centre for Human Rights, the convening at Vienna of\nthe World Conference on Human Rights and the\nappointment of a High Commissioner for Human Rights\nall enable the United Nations to follow progress in the\narea of human rights throughout the world and to assert\ncertain principles by which States must abide. Cameroon\nwelcomes this, and attaches great importance to\nrecognition of and respect for all human rights, including\nthe right to development.\nAs regards humanitarian assistance, our Organization\nhas been active on all fronts where it has been needed,\nproviding aid to victims of catastrophes and natural\ndisasters and war.\nAt this stage, I would like to mention and welcome\naction taken in the field by the United Nations through\nthe United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF), the Office\nof the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees\n(UNHCR), the United Nations Development Programme\n(UNDP) and other organizations, such as the World\nHealth Organization (WHO), the United Nations\nEducational, Scientific and Cultural Organization\n(UNESCO) and the International Labour Organization\n(ILO).\nOn another matter, we would like to welcome\nprogress by the United Nations in the fight against the\nscourge of drugs. The United Nations International Drug\nControl Programme is a result of concerted efforts by the\nUnited Nations and Member States in the fight against the\nproduction, sale, demand for and traffic in, and the\nunlawful distribution of, drugs and psychotropic\nsubstances. Cameroon pledges and invites other States to\npledge unreservedly their support for the United Nations\n20\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\n\nConvention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and\nPsychotropic Substances in order to stop the scourge of\ndrugs.\nWe would like to emphasize the considerable efforts\nexerted by the United Nations to focus the attention of the\ninternational community, in the context of world\nconferences, on other questions of interest that require\ncollective action, which should be taken by the entire\ncommunity of nations. These concerns have been\nmanifested through the World Summit for Children, the Rio\nConference on Environment and Development, the World\nConference on Human Rights at Vienna, the International\nConference on Population and Development at Cairo, the\nWorld Summit for Social Development at Copenhagen, the\nCairo Conference on the Prevention of Crime, and Fourth\nWorld Conference on Women at Beijing. On the question\nof women, it is highly desirable that all States immediately\nfollow up on the decisions and recommendations of the\nBeijing Conference.\nBut these successes of our Organization that I have\njust mentioned may not have met the expectations of all\npeoples.\nFirst, in the area of international peace and security,\nthe Organization has not been able to prevent the spread of\nsources of tension and conflicts throughout the world. Until\nrecently, it has been practically powerless in the face of the\ntragedies of the former Yugoslavia, Somalia and Rwanda.\nIn the economic arena, the Organization,\nnotwithstanding the declaration of four United Nations\ndecades, has not succeeded in adopting declarations,\nprogrammes of actions and other strategies to bring about\nprogress and economic and social development in\ndeveloping countries. The proof is that conditions in these\ncountries are still unfavourable, and, in order to experience\ngrowth once again, they must engage in policies of\nstructural adjustment, the social burden of which has been\na source of major concern to their Governments. This is\ntrue also of the high price they must pay to join the\nmainstream of world trade in order to avoid further\nmarginalization.\nDevelopment is primarily the responsibility of States\nand the peoples concerned. Cameroon nevertheless believes\nthat the United Nations should, because of its universality\nand in the best interest of the international community as a\nwhole, help to ensure global solidarity and interdependence\nwith a view to promoting development for all. This means\nthat we must stop inveighing against Africa in uniformly\npessimistic, not to say doomsday, tones. This style is all\ntoo familiar and suggests that our continent is, in the\nhistory of the world, nothing but a passive onlooker. But\nwho, in all seriousness, can place at the sidelines of world\nevents an entire continent, with 700 million inhabitants\ntoday \u2014 800 million in the year 2,000 \u2014 and with\nimmense natural, human, cultural and spiritual wealth? In\nthis connection, the Holy Father, speaking of Africa, on\nthe occasion of his recent second visit to Cameroon,\nappealed in his post-synod apostolic exhortation for\navoidance of any blanket condemnations of an entire\npopulation, an entire nation or, still worse, an entire\ncontinent.\nIn spite of the serious difficulties that it must\novercome, Africa is determined to shoulder responsibility\nfor its future. The sweeping changes which it is\nexperiencing today are nothing but the forerunners of a\nnascent order whose purpose will be to integrate our\ncontinent into the world of the third millennium. This\nprocess of transformation is already yielding fruit in most\nof our countries.\nAs regards Cameroon, I would like in this\nconnection, to emphasize our irreversible pursuit of the\nprocess of democratization begun by Presidency Paul\nBiya at the very moment he assumed power in 1982.\nBetween now and the end of this year, there will be\nsignificant progress in this process with the adoption of a\nnew Constitution allowing for greater democratic\nparticipation by the citizens of Cameroon in the\nmanagement of their own affairs, and a better balance\namong the various powers of Government.\nI would like to mention the impact our measures of\nrecovery and economic liberalization have had on various\nsectors of activity. Cameroon is enjoying self-sufficiency\nin food, and is beginning to enjoy growth again. Inflation\nhas been halted and macroeconomic balance in major\nareas has been re-established. In a word, there are signs\nof life in economic activity. Strengthened by the\ncredibility confirmed \u2014 had that really been needed \u2014\nby the recent signing of the agreement with the\nInternational Monetary Fund, my country is widening its\naction for the acceleration of its economic recovery.\nOur Organization is confronted with a sudden and\nunexpected acceleration of history. Never has there been\nsuch an acute sense of upheaval. The same questions keep\ncropping up everywhere: Will the world in the future be\nmeaningless? What will the world order be like in the\nfuture? Will the Organization have a hand in this new\n21\nGeneral Assembly 21st plenary meeting\n\norder? And, finally, will it have the ability to be the melting\npot for this? But, when all is said and done, the end of the\ncold war has brought fair weather.\nHowever, it is clear that, 50 years after its creation,\nthe Organization needs to turn over a new leaf. That being\nso, might it not be highly desirable for it to re-think its\nrole, its tasks, its functions, with a view not just to adapting\nto this new context, but to responding better to the ever-\nincreasing and ever-more-insistent aspirations of the peoples\nto peace and well-being? In any case, this is the desire of\nCameroon.\nThese are the responsibilities we would like the\nOrganization to shoulder in order to ensure a better world\nand a better future for the generation of the next\nmillennium. In this connection, the manner in which the\nUnited Nations discharges its responsibilities, or rather the\nsuccess of United Nations missions, will depend on the real\ncollective political will of its Member States.\nFor its part, Cameroon feels that the current thinking\non the restructuring of the Security Council augurs well for\nthe revitalization of the Organization. The same is true of\nthe successful outcome of peace-keeping efforts made\npossible by United Nations action and the concerted action\nof the international community in Cambodia, Central\nAmerica, Angola, Haiti, Mozambique and Eritrea. On the\nsame lines, the new diplomatic deals that are evolving in\nthe former Yugoslavia and the Middle East are undeniably\nvery encouraging developments.\nIn the final analysis, then, there is no reason not to\nbelieve that in the near future the peoples of regions where\nconflicts are continuing will, like so many others, have their\nrendezvous with peace.\nIn all of these cases, Cameroon has the feeling that a\nlasting solution will have to come through a meeting of the\npolitical wills of the chief protagonists and the collective\nwill of the international community.\nIn spite of the difficulties that have impeded action in\nthe areas both of peace-keeping and of economic and social\ndevelopment, the balance sheet of the Organization \u2014\nthough certainly uneven \u2014 is not as negative as some\nwould have us believe. The celebration of the fiftieth\nanniversary of the United Nations gives the international\ncommunity an ideal opportunity to consider the ways and\nmeans available to our Organization to carry out the\ncollective work of ensuring peace, security and prosperity\nfor all.\nThis anniversary must also be taken as an\nopportunity for renewal, for highlighting and praising the\nwealth of universality in the diversity in our Organization.\nThis is an opportunity to renew our pledge and\ncommitment to the purposes and ideals of the Charter.\nThis pledge and this commitment must be translated into\na strengthening of our determination and our ability to act\ncollectively so that, as was the wish of the founding\nfathers, we can save future generations from anguish,\nfear, poverty, suffering and all sorts of uncertainty, and so\nthat we may finally move forward along the path of\ntransforming the tools of war into the tools of peace.\nCameroon, for its part, is prepared to contribute.\n"

        "file_text": "I congratulate Mr. Diogo Freitas\ndo Amaral on his assumption of the presidency of the\nfiftieth regular session of the United Nations General\nAssembly. We note his laudable accomplishments in the\ndiplomatic service of his country, and feel assured that\nthrough his stewardship of this historic session a new\nparadigm will emerge to direct intercourse among nations\nof the world.\nI also wish to convey the appreciation of the Liberian\ndelegation to his predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Amara\nEssy, a distinguished son of Africa, for the skilful manner\nin which he conducted the work of the forty-ninth session.\nWe commend our able and renowned Secretary-\nGeneral, His Excellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for his\nunrelenting devotion to charting a new course for the\nUnited Nations, in spite of formidable odds. Moreover, we\nare particularly pleased with the fervent attention that he\ncontinues to give to a peaceful resolution of the Liberian\ncivil conflict, as well as to the post-war reconstruction of\nLiberia.\nI stand before this body in celebration of the larger\nfreedom that is personified in the survival and success of\nthe United Nations and my country, Liberia. Both were\nborn out of the visions of individuals who dared to stand\non higher ground, while others wallowed in fear, hatred,\nracism, doubts and dismay. Half a century ago my\ncountry was proud to be one of three African nations\namong the 51 States that assembled in San Francisco,\nCalifornia, to participate in the creation of the United\nNations, culminating in the signing of its Charter.\nThe United Nations was born because \u201cWe the\npeoples\u201d from diverse cultural backgrounds, represented\nby our Governments,\n\u201cdetermined ...\nto reaffirm [our] faith in fundamental human rights,\nin the dignity and worth of the human person, in the\nequal rights of men and women and of nations large\nand small\u201d.\nTo demonstrate our commitment to these fundamental\nrights, the principle of sovereign equality was enshrined\nin the Charter of the Organization and later buttressed, in\n1948, by the adoption of the Universal Declaration of\nHuman Rights.\nOne and a quarter centuries before the birth of the\nUnited Nations, we the people, from diverse cultural\nbackgrounds represented by individuals and organizations\nwhich believed in the larger freedom as a measure of\nman\u2019s dignity and greatness, gave birth to the Liberian\nnation in times perhaps more vexing and troubling than\nthe birth period of our United Nations. But we the people,\ndetermined to escape the degradation to which we were\nexposed by the denial of the universality of human rights\nand the commonality of human nature, fled to freedom in\npursuit of the very principles for which this Organization\nstands.\nWe ought to celebrate the survival and success of\nthe United Nations and my country, Liberia.\nSymbolically, they represent the higher nature of man,\nwhich compels him to acknowledge that no human being\nis inferior or superior to another. Just as a man\u2019s life\n\u201cconsisteth not in the abundance of the things which\nhe possesseth\u201d, (The Holy Bible, Luke 12:15)\nthe greatness of any people or nation is not measured in\nthe abundance of things which they possess.\n8\n\n\nThe survival and success of the United Nations for\nhalf a century have destroyed the myth that it is Utopian to\norganize sovereign nations on a global level in the pursuit\nof international peace and security. Liberia\u2019s survival as an\nindependent State since 1847 also destroyed the myth that\nAfricans were incapable of self-governance. As one of the\nthree African founding Members of the United Nations,\nLiberia\u2019s independence and involvement in international\naffairs served as a beacon of hope for peoples of African\ndescent engaged in their legitimate struggle against colonial\ndomination. It lent diplomatic and moral support to the\ndecolonization of Africa and other regions of the world and\nforcefully voiced its opposition to apartheid in South\nAfrica.\nAs more nations of Africa became independent,\nLiberia offered them a hand of friendship, brotherhood and\nsolidarity. In particular, Liberia adopted and pursued a\npolicy of peaceful coexistence with its neighbours and was\na principal advocate of a functional approach to African\nunity. This led to the formation of the Organization of\nAfrican Unity (OAU), the Economic Community of West\nAfrican States (ECOWAS) and other entities fostering\neconomic cooperation between the African peoples.\nIn this connection, my delegation is immensely\npleased to celebrate the practical actualization of the vision\nof three distinguished sons of Africa \u2014 Kwame Nkrumah\nof Ghana, Ahmed S\u00e9kou Tour\u00e9 of Guinea and William V.\nS. Tubman of Liberia \u2014 as we note that an independent\nAfrica is observing and actively participating in the fiftieth\nanniversary of the United Nations.\nThe fiftieth regular session of the General Assembly\nis convening against the backdrop of tremendous changes\nin the international system. The peace euphoria which was\ninspired by the end of the super-Power confrontation has\nlong dissipated and the world is far from being a peaceful\nand just place. Simmering inter-State disputes, violent civil\nconflicts and resurgent nationalism, carried to the extreme,\nhave led to the disintegration of several States and\nthreatened international peace and security. The\nunfavourable consequences of this situation are the loss of\nmany innocent lives and massive refugee flows, particularly\nin Africa. Unfortunately, my country, Liberia, has not been\nspared from this onslaught.\nThe Liberian peace process must be viewed in the\ntotality of Liberia\u2019s history. From the Declaration of\nIndependence in 1847 to the present, the Republic of\nLiberia has been besieged and buffeted by internal and\nexternal forces which hold diametrically opposing views\nrelating to the universality of human rights and the\ncommonality of human nature, as well as to the\nappropriateness of political and economic utilitarianism,\nwhere powerful external forces \u2014 Governments,\nmultinational corporations, international organizations and\nso on \u2014 manipulate and exploit human and material\nresources in Liberia to the detriment of the country. This\nis a reality that cannot be wished away.\nAlthough these views may be based solely on\nignorance, it is this same ignorance which fuels the fire\nof war and destruction around the world, manifesting\nitself as racism, \u201cethnic cleansing\u201d, tribalism, religious\npersecution and so on. Thus, for those who believe that\nthe African is less than human or is incapable of\ngoverning himself, the existence for almost a century and\na half of a politically stable and peaceful Liberia with\nstrong economic potential is undesirable.\nLiberia, which was founded \u2014 about half a century\nbefore the Berlin Congress of 1884, which carved out\nAfrica and institutionalized colonialism \u2014 as \u201can asylum\nfor free people of colour\u201d fleeing the hot crucibles and\nbitter pangs of slavery, was threatened with partition and\ntrusteeship by the League of Nations, predecessor to our\nbeloved United Nations, half a century after that colonial\nCongress. Ironically, the charge was slave trading.\nAlthough the Liberian Government was grievously at\nfault, and while we roundly condemn slavery of any kind,\nthat attempt by the League of Nations to undermine\nLiberia\u2019s sovereignty was a sinister, hypocritical\nsubterfuge whose only purpose was to perpetuate a racist\nmyth rooted in a very destructive ignorance. This was not\nin the best interests of Liberia or Africa, for no nation,\ninternational organization or earthly Power can will\nLiberia out of existence.\nRoughly half a century after this unsuccessful\nattempt by the League of Nations, Liberia experienced the\nbloody overthrow of its constitutional Government. The\npolitical-legal structure had become too rigid and\ninsensitive to the cries of the overwhelming majority of\nthe people, who wanted to be included in the social,\npolitical and economic structures of the country. The\nerstwhile experienced leaders failed to provide the\nrequired navigational changes. The execution of these\npolitical leaders, who had navigated the ship of State in\nturbulent times, and the first imposition of military rule\naffected more than 13 decades of political stability. The\nattendant dislocations in our national fabric culminated in\nthe civil war that brings us here today.\n9\n\n\nOver the past six years, our country has been at war\nwith itself, trying to right injustices among the people of\nLiberia while maintaining the sovereignty of the nation,\nincluding the right to determine our own destiny. To some\non the outside, this war has appeared very senseless \u2014 and\nit may be so in the sense that most wars are senseless. On\nthe other hand, we believe that we will emerge out of this\nas a stronger and more united people in a nation where we\nwill regard ourselves as human beings first and foremost\nand where the national identity will take precedence over\ntribal or ethnic identity.\nThus, our efforts to seek peace when agreements are\nbroken should be lauded instead of ridiculed. This reflects\nour history as a peace-loving nation. We cannot apologize\nfor desiring peace more than war. The Abuja Agreement\nwill hold and usher in a new dawn for Liberia; but even if\nit did not hold, we would still pursue peace, ignore those\nwho prefer war to peace and strike another deal for peace\nand democracy. We are optimistic and will not give up on\nourselves. We ask the Assembly not to give up on us.\nWe have consistently maintained over the course of\nthis war that a military solution was neither desirable nor\nachievable; we have consistently advocated a balance of\nforces and a Government of inclusion.\nIn this connection, we commend ECOWAS for its\nhumanitarian intervention in the Liberian crisis. Although\nmandated to promote the economic integration of the\nsubregion, its action was a necessary concrete manifestation\nof unique African solidarity and has afforded Liberians the\nopportunity to resolve their differences through civil\ndiscourse.\nThe primary objective of the Liberian people has been\nthe attainment of a just, comprehensive and durable peace\nthrough a political settlement of the conflict. The basic\ncomponents of the agreements reached by the parties and\nsubsequent resolutions adopted by the Security Council\ncentred around the following objectives: combatants would\nbe disarmed and rehabilitated; sufficient security guarantees\nwould be established to facilitate the resettlement of\ndisplaced persons and the repatriation of hundreds of\nthousands of Liberian refugees; internationally supervised\nelections would be held in accordance with an agreed\ntimetable; a democratically elected administration would be\ninstalled; and the international community would lend the\nrequisite assistance for the economic and social\nrehabilitation of Liberia.\nThrough the sustained diplomacy of the Economic\nCommunity of West African States, complemented by the\nOrganization of African Unity and the United Nations,\nand the willingness of the parties to continue negotiations,\na final agreement was reached in Abuja, the Federal\nRepublic of Nigeria, on 19 August 1995.\nIn celebration of Abuja, we hereby announce our\nprofoundest gratitude to former President Jimmy Carter\nand current President William Clinton of the United\nStates of America, ECOWAS Chairman President Jerry\nJohn Rawlings and his Special Facilitator, Captain Kojo\nTsikata, both of Ghana, President Sani Abacha of Nigeria,\nPresident Nic\u00e9phore Soglo of Benin, the late President\nHouphou\u00ebt-Boigny and current President Konan-B\u00e9di\u00e9 of\nC\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, President Blaise Campaor\u00e9 of Burkina\nFaso, President Lansana Cont\u00e9 of Guinea, President\nAbdou Diouf of Senegal, President Ali Mwinyi of\nTanzania, President Yoweri Museveni of Uganda,\nPresident Zine El-Abidine Ben Ali of Tunisia, former\nPresident Sir Dawda Jawara, and current Head of State\nCaptain Yahya A. J. J. Jammeh of Gambia, former\nPresident Moussa Traor\u00e9, and current President Alpha\nOumar Konar\u00e9 of Mali, and former President Joseph\nSaidu Momoh and current President Valentine Strasser of\nSierra Leone.\nSpecial thanks also go to all the Presidents and\nForeign Ministers of the ECOWAS Committee of Nine,\nthe former Executive Secretary of ECOWAS, Mr. Abass\nBundu, and current Executive Secretary Mr. Edouard\nBenjamin, OAU Secretary General Salim A. Salim, and\nOAU Eminent Person, former President Canaan Banana,\nmembers of the United Nations Security Council,\nSecretary-General Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali and his\nSpecial Representatives, Trevor Gordon-Somers and\nAmbassador Anthony Nyakyi, all non-governmental and\nhumanitarian organizations in Liberia, the commanders\nand troops of the Cease-fire Monitoring Group of\nECOWAS (ECOMOG), the United Nations Observer\nMission in Liberia (UNOMIL), the member States of\nECOWAS, the OAU, the European Union, the United\nNations and all the friends of Liberia for helping us help\nourselves. We also congratulate the Liberian people for\ntheir patience, sacrifice, understanding and maturity as we\nnavigate through turbulent waters to peaceful waters.\nUnlike previous agreements, the Abuja Agreement\nto supplement and amend the Cotonou and Akosombo\nAgreements, as subsequently clarified by the Accra\nAgreement, provides for a six-man collective presidency\ncomprising the leaders of the principal warring parties and\n10\n\n\nthree civilian representatives. They are: His Excellency\nProfessor Wilton S. Sankawulo, Chairman, His Excellency\nMr. Charles Ghankay Taylor of the National Patriotic Front\nof Liberia (NPFL), His Excellency Lt. General Alhaji G. V.\nKromah of the United Liberation Movement of Liberia for\nDemocracy (ULIMO), His Excellency Mr. George E.\nSaigbe Boley of the Liberian Peace Council (LPC), His\nExcellency Mr. Oscar J. Quiah of the Liberia National\nCouncil (LNC), and His Excellency Chief Tamba Tailor,\njoint nominee of the NPFL and ULIMO, as Vice Chairmen.\nThe very fact that the present collective presidency is\nfunctioning and deliberating with unanimity of purpose is\nreason to celebrate. Each of the six is uniquely and pre-\neminently qualified to lead Liberia, but they have relegated\ntheir personal ambitions to work collectively as leaders of\nreconstruction.\nThe Agreement also retained two cardinal principles\nof the ECOWAS peace plan. The first requires the\nGovernment of Liberia to enter a Status of Forces\nAgreement with ECOWAS regarding the status of\nECOMOG in Liberia. This is being worked on at present.\nThe second forbids the Chairman of the Council of\nState from contesting any position in the ensuing elections.\nOther members of the Council, the Vice Chairmen of equal\nstatus, and officials of the Transitional Government may\nseek elective office, but are required to resign from the\nGovernment prior to the elections.\nThe first signs of adherence to the Abuja Agreement\ncame when, on August 26 1995, a general cease-fire was\nre-established. On 1 September 1995, the new Council of\nState was installed in office. Shortly thereafter, a new\ncabinet of the Liberian National Transitional Government\n(LNTG) was named and inducted into office. The National\nLegislative Assembly, the Supreme Court of Liberia and the\nElections Commission are functioning in accordance with\nlaw.\nAs disarmament is crucial to a complete and timely\nimplementation of the Abuja Accord, I am pleased to report\nthat ECOMOG has begun the deployment of its troops in\nmany parts of the country, and has taken over command of\nmost of the checkpoints hitherto controlled by the parties.\nAlso, most of the major highways and roads in the country\nare gradually and steadily reopening for the unimpeded\nmovement of individuals and goods.\nThe installation of the Council of State marks a new\nbeginning in the peace process. It points towards a final\npeaceful resolution of the Liberian crisis and has raised\nthe hopes of Liberians, who believe that the process is\nnow irreversible.\nNow we must confront the all-engaging task of\nfostering national reconciliation, unity and the economic\nrehabilitation of the country. There are clear signs that\nLiberians earnestly desire to turn the swords of\ndestruction and death into ploughshares of cultivation and\nrebuilding. They have placed much faith in the democratic\noption, which will empower them for full participation in\nthe affairs of their country through civil discourse, as\nopposed to armed confrontation.\nLike all countries which have had to make the\ntransition from conditions of war and utter deprivation to\nconditions of peace and development, Liberia now stands\nin urgent need of substantial assistance from the\ninternational community. Help is also required for the\nrehabilitation of children traumatized by the war and for\nthe reintegration of former combatants into civil society,\nwhere their energies can be redirected to productive\nactivities.\nBeyond these pressing needs the private sector,\nwhich is very vital to the long-term economic recovery\nand development of Liberia, must be revived. Therefore\nwe appeal to our investment partners to return with their\nexpertise and financial resources.\nWe welcome the Secretary-General\u2019s decision to\nhold a pledging conference for Liberia at the United\nNations on 27 October 1995 for the demobilization and\nreconstruction of Liberia, as well as assistance for\nECOWAS in the implementation of its mandate.\nAs we Liberians forge ahead in a determined effort\nto restore peace in our country and embark on the\nreconstruction programme, it is imperative that the\ninternational community should provide the requisite\nsupport and encouragement to the new Liberian\nleadership.\nIn this connection, we recall that earlier this year the\nCouncil of Ministers of the Organization of African Unity\nadopted resolution 1585 on Liberia which, inter alia,\ncalled on the international community to \u201crecognize and\ngive full faith and credence to the current Liberian\nNational Transitional Government and its successors\u201d.\nIt is my Government\u2019s firm belief that the full\nimplementation of this recommendation by Member States\n11\n\n\nwill serve to revive and strengthen the bilateral relations\nbetween Liberia and friendly Governments by accelerating\nthe reconstruction efforts of the country.\nTo my compatriots let me say that ours is a country\nthat went to war with itself. In the process, all Liberians\nhave suffered or experienced some loss. We empathize with\ntheir grief, pain, anguish and frustration. We must now\nassuage our hurt by rising above our differences and\ncoalesce into a strong, unified nation, determined to move\nforward to a better and prosperous future. No matter how\nwell disposed to help us our friends and sympathizers of\nthe international community may be, the challenge is ours\nto rebuild Liberia. I can only appeal to and plead with those\nfriends and sympathizers to be messengers of forgiveness\nand love. We have a unique opportunity to participate in\nthe redemption of our common patrimony \u2014 Liberia, a\nreality greater than our individual selves. Let us seize this\nhistoric moment.\nOur representation before this body would certainly be\nincomplete without a reflection of my Government\u2019s\nposition on the many difficulties and the prevailing sense of\nfrustration persisting on the international political scene.\nHowever, the recent efforts to reach a permanent solution\nto the seemingly intractable crisis in the Middle East\nrepresent a positive step in the right direction. In this\nconnection, we view the recent signing \u2014 on 28 September\n1995 \u2014 of the agreement reached between Israel and the\nPalestinian National Authority as a significant milestone.\nWe also salute Israel and Jordan for the Treaty signed on\n26 October 1994 regarding mutual reconciliation, and we\nurge other Arab States in the region to emulate this bold\ninitiative.\nOn the question of limiting nuclear and conventional\narmaments, my Government believes that nuclear non-\nproliferation is only the first step to the ultimate goal of\ncomplete prohibition. In this connection, we view the recent\nindefinite extension of the Non-Proliferation Treaty as an\nact that strengthens the international non-proliferation\nregime and enhances the maintenance of world peace and\nsecurity.\nThe conflict in the former Yugoslavia \u2014 especially in\nBosnia and Herzegovina \u2014 and the crises in Rwanda,\nSierra Leone, Somalia and Burundi continue to be a source\nof much concern to the international community. My\nGovernment welcomes the important role played by the\ninternational community \u2014 particularly the United Nations,\nthe Organization of African Unity and the Economic\nCommunity of West African States, the European Union,\nthe United States and the Russian Federation. We also\ncall on the parties to the conflict to refrain from further\nmilitary action and to opt for a negotiated settlement, to\nthe mutual satisfaction of all the parties concerned.\nWith respect to reform of the Security Council,\nLiberia calls for either expansion of the membership of\nthe Council or modification of paragraph 3 of Article\n27 \u2014 Chapter V \u2014 of the Charter to conform with\nparagraph 2 of the same Article, to enable the larger\nmembership of the United Nations to participate in the\nprocess of decision-making. We believe that either or\nboth of these steps would make the Council not only\nmore representative, but also more democratic and\ntransparent. The proposed reform is also intended to\nensure balance between the requirements of efficiency and\nexpansion, transparency in the Council\u2019s methods of work\nand optimum utilization of the resources of those States\nthat can contribute significantly to peace-keeping\noperations and development activities.\nThe rationale for our call lies in logic, democracy,\nequality and the Charter of the United Nations. When we\nsigned the Charter half a century ago there were three\nAfrican countries among 51 nations. Today the African\nmembership has increased to approximately 52 nations\namong a total of 185. The five permanent members of the\nSecurity Council are from three of the five continents of\nour world \u2014 Asia, Europe and North America. The\ncontinent of Africa ought to have at least one permanent\nmember, to be determined by the African countries\nthemselves.\nIn his inaugural address at this historic session the\nPresident of the Assembly averred that if the United\nNations is to maintain its unique character as an\ninternational Organization that is truly universal, efforts\nshould be made to ensure that all States which are not yet\nMembers can be admitted in the near future. My\ndelegation fully supports this position and recalls that\nwhen we signed the Charter of the United Nations the\nfive permanent members of the Security Council were the\nRepublic of China, France, the Union of Soviet Socialist\nRepublics, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and\nNorthern Ireland and the United States of America.\nContrary to the principle of universality, the People\u2019s\nRepublic of China was not included. We are happy that\n24 years ago the General Assembly restored the lawful\nright of the People\u2019s Republic of China to membership of\nthis Organization, in keeping with the Charter\u2019s principle\nof universality and the reality that that country is the\nworld\u2019s most populous nation.\n12\n\n\nTwenty-four years later, we note that 20 Member\nStates from Africa, Asia, the Caribbean and Latin America,\nin a letter to the Secretary-General, requested that the\nexceptional situation of the Republic of China on Taiwan\nbe examined by the General Assembly at its fiftieth session.\nMy Government firmly believes that the unification of\nChina should be peacefully pursued and that it is a matter\nfor the Chinese people themselves to determine at some\ntime in the future. However, we note that there were two\nGermanys in the United Nations until their reunification a\nlittle over five years ago and that there are still two Koreas,\nboth of which are now Members of the Organization. We\nhave confidence in the ability of the United Nations to deal\nproperly with this long-standing matter so that the\nunification of China may be peacefully pursued by the\nChinese themselves.\nWe wholeheartedly welcome the recent progressive\ntrends in the world economic spectrum. However, we also\nremain mindful of the persistent inhibitive factors that\ncontinue to account for the slow and unbalanced growth of\nthe global economy. In spite of the increase in the number\nof developing countries now participating as key players in\nthe world economy, the magnitude of increasing poverty for\nmore than 1 billion people of the world leaves much to be\ndesired. The gap between developed and developing\ncountries continues to widen, not only reflecting the\nmarginalization of the developing countries but also\nundermining efforts aimed at securing access to\ninternational trade, communications and the flow of vital\ninformation.\nMeanwhile, there is also a crisis of official\ndevelopment assistance, caused by stagnation and a\nreduction in assistance sources. It is worth noting that there\nis a need for increased cooperation if anything is to be\nachieved in addressing these distracting issues. One\napproach would be to reconsider the agreement regarding\nthe developed countries contributing 0.7 per cent of gross\nnational product to the assistance programmes for the\ndeveloping countries. The economic situation in most\nAfrican countries is critical and precarious. It is true that\nthe global economic situation affects all developing\ncountries, but its impact on sub-Saharan Africa is\ntremendous.\nWhile we recognize that the development of Africa is\nprimarily our responsibility, concerted efforts by the\ninternational community and donor countries will\ncomplement the national efforts of African Governments in\nreversing the negative trend of their economies.\nAs regards the role of women in development, we\nbelieve that the full and equal integration of women into\nthe development process at all levels is a central goal. We\nfully support the Conferences that were held in Cairo and\nAccra and in Taiwan earlier this year, and we are also\ncommitted to the successful implementation of the\ndecisions reached at the 1995 World Conference on\nWomen, held recently in Beijing, with the theme \u201cAction\nfor Equality, Development and Peace\u201d.\nLiberia \u2014 a Founding Member of the United\nNations \u2014 although encumbered by a fratricidal war, is\nproud of its modest contribution since the formation of\nthe Organization, particularly in respect of the\ndecolonization of Africa and its aspirations for economic\ngrowth and development. As the country emerges from\nwar, it pledges anew its commitment to the Organization.\nIt is our firm belief that the United Nations offers the best\nhope for a just and more equitable world. Member States\nare therefore challenged to pool their resources and work\ntogether, not as competitors but as equal partners aligned\nin a common pursuit.\nLiberia is determined to regain its rightful place, by\nvirtue of its long history and involvement in the struggle\nfor peace, cooperation and the prosperity of all peoples,\nin the comity of nations.\nDuring the past half-century of its existence, the\nUnited Nations has endeavoured to maintain international\npeace and security and remain responsive to the needs of\nthe public that it serves. Today, its responsibilities have\nincreased to cover urgent humanitarian emergencies which\nrequire the deployment of tremendous resources. It is\nhoped that the corresponding support will be forthcoming\nfrom Member States.\nWhen the United Nations succeeds, the great\nmajority, who depend on the services it provides, are\nlifted from misery, suffering and deprivation. That is the\nbasic principle we should bear in mind as the\nOrganization enters its fifty-first year of existence. The\nUnited Nations, in spite of its perceived shortcomings,\nwhich we must collectively seek to overcome, represents\nmankind\u2019s legitimate aspiration to be truly our brother\u2019s\nkeeper. Let us rededicate ourselves to this important\nobjective to ensure our survival and that of succeeding\ngenerations.\n"

        "file_text": "I should like first of all to\ncongratulate the President of the General Assembly,\nMr. Freitas do Amaral, on his election to that high position.\nTo guide the proceedings of the most representative organ\nof the United Nations in its jubilee year is a great privilege\nfor a politician and diplomat, as well as for the country that\nhe represents. We hope that his vision of the future of the\nOrganization, contained in his opening remarks, will find\nsupport among Member States.\nThe delegation of Ukraine also expresses its gratitude\nto Mr. Amara Essy for successfully guiding the General\nAssembly at its last session. Many years of close\ncooperation have bonded me with Minister Essy, whom I\nhighly respect for his diplomatic and human qualities.\nIn the historical calendar there are dates that can never\nbe forgotten. The year 1945 is one such memorable time.\nRecently, we all commemorated together the fiftieth\nanniversary of the end of the Second World War. The\ncalendar of international life is for ever interwoven with the\nhalf-century history of the United Nations.\nIn paying tribute to the founders of the United\nNations, Ukraine among them, our delegation would like\nto note the leading role of President Franklin Delano\nRoosevelt \u2014 one of the initiators of the creation of the\nuniversal Organization and the author of its very name \u2014\nthe United Nations. We are confident that the United\nNations can work out an appropriate way in which to pay\nrespect to this outstanding person.\nDuring the past half century the United Nations, as\nno other international organization, has acquired\ncredibility as a reliable instrument for maintaining peace,\nas a mediator and active participant in the peaceful\nsettlement of conflicts, and as a champion of human\nrights. The United Nations has played a decisive role in\nthe decolonization and self-determination of peoples. The\nUnited Nations has proved its viability, having\nexperienced the difficult decades of the cold war, when\nthe walls and the rostrum of its Headquarters often\nwitnessed the struggle of two opposing blocs. Ukraine \u2014\nwhose institutions of statehood were developing along\nwith the United Nations and were fully established after\nthe proclamation of independence in 1991 \u2014 feels the\nconsiderable support of the United Nations as well.\nWitness the dramatic events of the past quarter of\nthe twentieth century, the pinnacle of the philosophic\ntriangle of \u201cpeace-development-democracy\u201d is peace. And\nthe most illustrative example of this is the tragic conflict\nin the territory of the former Yugoslavia. This conflict, by\nits very nature, is due to all possible reasons: militant\nseparatism, ethnic confrontation, religious intolerance. The\nmost dangerous thing is the fact that, in terms of its scale,\ndevelopments and tragic consequences, this conflict has\nturned into a real threat to international peace and\nsecurity. I think that for all of us, Members of the United\nNations, the painful fact is that we are compelled again\nand again to return to this issue, even during the jubilee\nfiftieth session of the General Assembly.\nUnited Nations peace-keeping operations in this\nregion have revealed both positive and negative aspects of\ninternational efforts. The Yugoslav example demonstrates,\nin general, that rethinking the role of the United Nations\nand adapting the role to current realities are proceeding\nvery slowly. Sometimes it seems as if the Organization is\ncontinuing to live by the inertia of the old mentality,\nwhich does not allow it to use its potential effectively and\nmakes it appeal to other organizations for help. Besides,\nwe consider that most of the problems the United Nations\nis facing in the former Yugoslavia are rooted in the non-\n12\n\n\nobservance of at least a number of the major established\nprinciples of peace-keeping.\nIn particular, this may apply to the principle of\nimpartiality. Thus, a review of the discussions in the\nSecurity Council and the activities of the Contact Group\ndoes not, unfortunately, give a sufficient basis for talking\nabout real political impartiality in the positions of some of\ntheir members in regard to all parties to the post-Yugoslav\nconflict. As a result, international public opinion bases itself\non a policy of dual standards and biased assessments and\ndecisions, and this does not enhance the credibility of our\nOrganization.\nIt is universally recognized that success in the final\nsettlement of any conflict depends on the will of the\nbelligerents and their readiness to engage in a dialogue and\ninternational mediation. At the same time, the consent of\nthe conflicting parties to facilitate United Nations peace-\nkeeping efforts was not always given. The taking of peace-\nkeepers hostage by parties to the conflict in the former\nYugoslavia makes us think seriously of the need to\nestablish a comprehensive mechanism for the use of force\nand to enhance the protection of United Nations peace-\nkeeping personnel. In this connection, Ukraine, which\ninitiated the elaboration of the Convention on the Safety of\nUnited Nations and Associated Personnel, calls upon all\ncountries to expedite the ratification of this document.\nAt the same time, in spite of all the unprecedented\ndifficulties and some miscalculations in conducting United\nNations peace-keeping operations in the former Yugoslavia,\nwe find it necessary to keep United Nations forces there.\nAccordingly, we should continue to seek means to bring\nabout a peaceful settlement of the conflict. It seems that\ntoday everyone agrees that there is no alternative to a\npolitical settlement. We welcome efforts in that direction,\nparticularly the recent intensification of relevant activities\nby the United States. We also believe that Russia can play\na greater and constructive role in a peaceful settlement. For\nits part, Ukraine, as a major contributor to the United\nNations Protection Force, is ready to continue its\ncooperation with the United Nations in this field. I would\nlike to confirm that Kiev is ready, if necessary, to host a\nmeeting of the leaders of the parties to the conflict with the\nparticipation of all the countries and international\norganizations concerned. The President of Ukraine, Leonid\nKuchma, has sent letters with appropriate proposals to the\nleaders of Serbia, Croatia, and Bosnia and Herzegovina.\nThe process of settling the Yugoslav conflict could, in\nour opinion, be intensified by expanding the composition of\nthe Contact Group and studying new approaches. As an\nexample to follow, we note the international meeting on\nBosnia held on 21 July in London, in which the\ndelegation of Ukraine also took part.\nWhile highly appreciating the considerable personal\ncontribution of Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali\nto the philosophy of peace-keeping, we consider that new\napproaches in this field require further practical\ndevelopment, in particular the principle of utilizing the\nrapid reaction force, which has already been quite actively\ninvolved in the former Yugoslavia.\nThe question of implementing the idea of\nestablishing a United Nations stand-by force, in which\nUkraine is ready to participate, is still outstanding.\nWe consider preventive diplomacy, which has\ndemonstrated its potential in the former Yugoslav\nRepublic of Macedonia, to be one of the priority trends in\nthe development of United Nations peace-keeping\nactivities. In this context we are again proposing\nconsideration of the establishment within the United\nNations, and specifically within the Office of the\nSecretary-General, of a standing council of international\nmediators, whose membership would include\ninternationally recognized and authoritative political\nfigures.\nEconomic sanctions continue to be an important\ninstrument in United Nations conflict-settlement activities.\nIn this field, we believe it is necessary to elaborate a\ncomprehensive and detailed mechanism for the\nimplementation of sanctions which would also take into\nconsideration all their potential consequences, including\nthe negative impact on third countries. In our opinion, it\nhas now been demonstrated that the embargo regime\nagainst the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is\ncounterproductive and has not attained the main objective\nof promoting peaceful settlement of the conflict. Ukraine\nconsiders that, along with the process of further political\nsettlement, the Security Council should lift economic\nsanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia,\nwhich, in real terms, has already demonstrated its\nwillingness to assist in the restoration of peace. At the\nsame time, we proceed from the premise that mutual and\nsimultaneous recognition of the States that emerged in the\nterritory of the former Yugoslavia should be an important\ncondition for the lifting of sanctions.\nThe principle that no single State or regional\norganization can be granted the right to be the main\n13\n\n\nguarantor of peace and security in one region or another\nshould continue to be a cornerstone of United Nations\nconflict-prevention and crisis-management activities.\nAmong the international community\u2019s undertakings in\nthe past year we could list many important achievements\nwhich have become our common gains. Today, in\nWashington, the ceremony for the signing of the Israeli-\nPalestinian agreement is taking place, and we want to\ncongratulate sincerely both parties and all those who\ncontributed to this achievement.\nI would also like to dwell on one accomplishment\nwhich has significance for our country. The Conference on\nthe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons\n(NPT) was undoubtedly the main event since the last\nsession in the field of arms control and disarmament. It is\nsymbolic that this Conference took place within these walls.\nIts decision on the indefinite extension of the Treaty is\nreally a historic achievement. I do not think it would be\ngoing too far to say that Ukraine\u2019s accession to the NPT as\na non-nuclear weapon State, and our ratification of the\nSTART-1 Treaty and its entry into force played a\nsubstantive role in making this event a reality. Thus,\nUkraine made its tangible contribution to the global\ncause \u2014 freeing mankind from the most dangerous\nweapons of mass destruction. The voluntary renunciation by\nthe third largest nuclear State of this monster of the\ntwentieth century is unprecedented.\nThe NPT is undoubtedly a key treaty among all the\nexisting treaties on arms control and disarmament, since it\nprovides an opportunity to consistently coordinate policies\nin the field of nuclear disarmament, allowing non-nuclear\nStates to conduct a dialogue as equals with nuclear States.\nAt the same time, I would like to emphasize that in\nUkraine\u2019s opinion, in spite of the record-breaking number\nof NPT participants \u2014 179 countries \u2014 we cannot regard\na situation as stable when States that build their security on\nthe possession of nuclear weapons and States that have\nnever had or have renounced them exist alongside each\nother.\nIn this connection, Ukraine attaches great importance\nto the negotiations on a comprehensive nuclear test-ban\ntreaty. Unfortunately, the world community has not\nmanaged to mark the UN\u2019s fiftieth anniversary of the\nUnited Nations by concluding this treaty, but we share the\nhopes that the relevant talks will be successfully completed\nno later than 1996. In this context the necessity for all\ncountries to observe the moratorium on nuclear tests is of\nspecial importance. Recent nuclear tests have aroused\njustifiable concern in the world. Such actions are not\nconducive to enhancing the favourable international\nclimate that emerged after the end of the cold war.\nThe huge existing arsenals of conventional weapons\nand the danger they constitute for mankind put these\nweapons on a par with weapons of mass destruction and\nrequire the same close attention. As of today, Ukraine is\nfulfilling its obligations under the Treaty on Conventional\nArmed Forces in Europe. To support the initiative\nadvanced by the General Assembly, the Government of\nUkraine has declared a moratorium on the export of anti-\npersonnel mines.\nThe course of the development of history has vividly\ndemonstrated the interconnection and interdependence\nbetween the safeguarding of peace and security and\neconomic and social development. In spite of significant\nachievements in this field, the present-day picture of the\nworld is far from being ideal. Problems of unemployment,\nunderdevelopment, poverty, social disintegration and\nisolation require urgent solutions. These problems are\nespecially acute for economies in transition that are\ncarrying out fundamental reforms.\nUkraine, which inherited a heavy burden of problems\nfrom the former USSR, is undergoing a painful period of\nradical political and economic transformation. Having laid\nthe basic foundations of a democratic political system and\ncivil society over the past four years, Ukraine has entered\na new stage of development. Last October, the President\nof Ukraine, Leonid Kuchma, proclaimed a new economic\npolicy based on the implementation of fundamental\neconomic reform. Now, our main efforts are aimed at the\nfurther strengthening of democratic foundations, the\ncreation of a socially oriented market economy, and the\nimplementation of an open, predictable and consistent\nforeign policy. The reform of the State system of division\nof power is continuing. In contrast to most post-Soviet\ncountries, we managed, without violent confrontation, to\nfind a way out of the constitutional impasse. The\nimportant stage is ahead, namely the final drafting and the\nadoption of a new Constitution of Ukraine. A diversified\nsystem of external economic relations is being gradually\nestablished. The process of integrating the national\neconomy into the world economic space is being\nintensified.\nAt the same time, the Ukrainian economy continues\nto suffer from a crisis phenomenon. Having charted a\ncourse toward market reform and its rapid\nimplementation, Ukraine must seek its own national\n14\n\n\nmodel of market transformation. Today the establishment of\nan effective system of social protection is the Government\u2019s\nprincipal and most topical task.\nThe most important priority for President Kuchma and\nthe Government of Ukraine continues to be the preservation\nof civil peace and inter-ethnic harmony in the country. In\nits four years of independence, Ukraine has managed to\nsettle confrontational situations by peaceful political means.\nUkraine\u2019s achievements in the field of securing the rights\nof national minorities are especially evident against the\nbackground of the numerous conflicts that unfortunately\ncontinue to be a reality in the territory of the former Soviet\nUnion.\nUkraine\u2019s national legislation in this sphere has earned\nit high international marks, specifically from such\nauthoritative organizations as the Council of Europe, of\nwhich Ukraine hopes to become a member this year. But,\nat the same time, we have problems in this sphere,\nparticularly with regard to repatriating the deported Crimean\nTatar people and representatives of other nationalities.\nThe Government of Ukraine has developed a large-\nscale national programme aimed at safeguarding the rights\nof national minorities and indigenous peoples and has\nestablished a fund for the deported peoples of Crimea. But\nfor Ukraine, which faces conditions of economic crisis and\na complicated financial situation and lacks the necessary\ninfrastructure, services and mechanisms, the task of\naccommodating the hundreds of thousands of repatriated\npersons appears too complicated. Solving these problems\nrequires a complex approach: the mobilization and\nconsolidation of efforts at the national, regional and broader\ninternational levels.\nIn its international activities, Ukraine proceeds from\nthe premise that stable development is a guarantor of\nlasting peace.\nAt present, when economic reforms in Ukraine are\ngaining momentum, we are especially interested in the\nwidening of the activities of the United Nations and of its\nspecialized agencies in the social and economic fields,\naimed at establishing conditions for the integration of the\nUkrainian economy and other economies in transition into\nthe world economic space. The United Nations is an\nimportant instrument for promoting this process, and we\nappreciate the fact that the Members of this Organization\nshow a deep understanding of the problems of countries in\ntransition, including Ukraine.\nWe believe that creating internal preconditions for\nUkraine\u2019s steady and gradual development has an\ninternational dimension as well. Ukraine\u2019s geo-political\nsituation transforms its efforts to build an economically\nviable State into an important factor in promoting\nguaranteed peace, stability and security \u2014 including in\nthe field of ecology \u2014 on the European continent.\nIt was this deep understanding of global\ninterdependence that dictated, in particular, the political\ndecision of President Kuchma to decommission the\nChernobyl nuclear-power plant by the year 2000. Next\nyear marks the tenth anniversary of the Chernobyl\ncatastrophe, which not only left deep scars on the lives of\nthe present generation of Ukrainians, Belarussians and\nRussians, but also has a global perspective. We propose\nto declare 1996 the Year of the Commemoration of\nChernobyl and to organize special activities under the\nauspices of the United Nations. On the eve of this tragic\nanniversary, I should like once again to emphasize that\nnuclear-safety problems and the decommissioning of\nmalfunctioning and outdated industrial nuclear facilities\nare critical, and not only for Ukraine. We are convinced\nthat the time has come for a practical solution to the\nentire series of issues related to the accident, especially in\nview of the long-term nature of its aftermath. The sooner\nwe invest money in the solution of this problem, the\nsooner we will be able to overcome it, with fewer\nnegative consequences for humanity. We expect that the\ninternational community\u2019s support of Ukraine\u2019s efforts\nwill be directed not only at the decommissioning of the\nChernobyl power plant but also at solving the whole\ncluster of associated economic, social and ecological\nproblems. In particular, we would welcome wide\ninternational participation in establishing an international\nscientific-technological centre in Chernobyl.\nAt the same time, I should like to emphasize that\nUkraine retains a sense of realism with regard to the\ncapacity of the United Nations to solve our national\nproblems. We do not aim to compete with the less\ndeveloped countries for the limited resources of the\nUnited Nations development system. We are ready and\nwilling to cooperate with all interested partners, and we\nrely on the purposeful activity of the international\ncommunity aimed at creating favourable conditions for\nexpanding the access of Ukrainian exports to the world\nmarket. We expect that the World Trade Organization,\nwhich Ukraine is ready to join, will play an important\nrole in the expansion and diversification of international\ntrade and economic relations.\n15\n\n\nRecently the financial problems of the United Nations\nhave had an acute political resonance. There can be only\none conclusion: the existing financial system is incapable of\nguaranteeing the effective functioning of the Organization\nin the current situation and requires substantial reform.\nWe fully understand that the financial crisis of the\nUnited Nations has been provoked not only by political and\neconomic circumstances but also by the imperfect system\nof apportionment of expenses, which is based on outdated\nprinciples. Ukraine will actively support the adoption of\nprogressive changes to the methods of determining the scale\nof assessments and the special scheme of expenses for\nfinancing United Nations peace-keeping operations, with the\naim of reflecting the principle of capacity to pay.\nUkraine\u2019s full participation in United Nations activities\nis impeded by its excessive contribution and its existing\ndebt for financing United Nations peace-keeping operations.\nThe State, which for the benefit of the world community\nhas taken political decisions to voluntarily renounce nuclear\nweapons and decommission the Chernobyl power plant,\nshould be able to concentrate its resources primarily on the\nimplementation of those decisions. Ukraine, whose\neconomy is undergoing an extremely difficult\ntransformation and which is also suffering economic losses\nin the billions as a result of its strict compliance with the\nsanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, can\nby no means continue to be held hostage to the settlement\nof the financial problems of the United Nations.\nThe world is changing. The cold-war confrontation\nbetween blocs, as well as bloc discipline, has become\nhistory. The interdependence of States at the regional and\nglobal levels is increasing. Given the nature of modern\ninternational problems, we should be ready to face the\nchallenges of the new era. We need a strong and effective\nUnited Nations. Its renovation should encompass both the\nstructure itself and the character of its activities, in\naccordance with the requirements of the new epoch. In our\nopinion, a number of measures should be taken to\ndemocratize the Security Council\u2019s activity, in particular to\nincrease the legitimacy of its decisions and the transparency\nof its work.\nOn the whole, Ukraine supports the activity of the\nOpen-ended Working Group on the reform of the Security\nCouncil and hopes that the interests of all regional groups,\nincluding, I should like to emphasize, the Group of Eastern\nEuropean States, will be taken into consideration during the\nreform process. Ukraine also supports the proposals related\nto the improvement of the activities of the Economic and\nSocial Council. It stands for a reduction of the staff and\nthe enhancement of the efficiency of the activities of the\nSecretariat, and for a reduction in the number of items on\nthe agenda of the General Assembly.\nIn conclusion, I should like to paraphrase a point of\ncommon wisdom: when you criticize the reflection in the\nmirror, you are criticizing yourself. The United Nations\nneeds renovation \u2014 so we need to renovate ourselves.\nThis Organization will not become more effective and\ninstrumental unless its Members show enough eagerness\nfor practical efforts. I would not want this Assembly in\nthe twenty-first century to listen again to wishful thinking\nthat is not backed by our political will and readiness to\nwork hard.\n"

        "file_text": "The unanimous election of\nMr. Freitas do Amaral to preside over this historic session,\nthe fiftieth, of the General Assembly is a well-deserved\ntribute to his country, Portugal. Aware of his talent and his\nmany political activities at the national and international\nlevels, I venture to believe that under his guidance this\nsession of the General Assembly will be successful.\nOn this occasion, I also wish to pay tribute to, and to\ncongratulate, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the Secretary-\nGeneral of our Organization, for his vigorous efforts in\ncarrying out his very responsible functions for the\nmaintenance of peace and for the promotion of\ndevelopment throughout the world.\nThe international situation is still complex and in a\nstate of flux. Ethnic, religious and border conflicts still\nraging in various parts of our planet continue to haunt the\ninternational community. Despite numerous efforts to\nresolve those conflicts, there is no indication that we are\nanywhere near the goals we have set for ourselves. Bearing\nin mind past lessons and experiences, we should engage in\ninformed reflection, undertake appropriate actions and act\ntogether to find reasonable and peaceful ways to meet these\nchallenges. The realities of the world today show that it is\nnot easy to create an atmosphere where peace and justice\nprevail, because this involves a noble, difficult and long-\nterm duty, a duty that requires, at one and the same time,\npatience and resolution, which the international community\nas a whole is called upon to provide, is in the interest of\nthe nations and the peoples of the world.\nIn Europe, the conflict in the Republic of Bosnia and\nHerzegovina, which has caused great suffering to its people,\nremains without a final solution. The 60-day cease-fire\nagreement just concluded by the parties involved in this\npainful conflict is undoubtedly a new stage in the search for\na global peace. This agreement also requires that other\nefforts be made, with a maximum of wisdom and restraint\nand a readiness to restore peace and stability in this\nregion of the world.\nIn Africa, after long years of struggle, the apartheid\nsystem finally has been abolished. Like all other peoples\nthat love peace and freedom in the world, the Lao people\nare very happy about this event. We wish ever-greater\nsuccess to the new South African authorities, under the\nwise leadership of President Nelson Mandela, in their\ntireless efforts to build a new South Africa, united, non-\nracial, democratic and prosperous.\nStill on the subject of Africa, the Lao people hope\nthat the ethnic conflicts and violence still raging in some\ncountries of the continent will be peacefully resolved in\norder to preserve unity and to promote national harmony\nand development in their respective countries.\nIn the Caribbean, the overall situation is favourable\nto the promotion of mutual understanding as well as to\nthe development cooperation between the countries of this\nregion. In this context, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic\nRepublic believes that it is high time that the economic\nblockade decreed unilaterally against Cuba be lifted in\norder to contribute to the promotion of peace and stability\nand cooperation between the peoples of this region,\nwithout any discrimination whatsoever.\nIn the Middle East, the conclusion this past\nSeptember of the agreement between the Palestine\nLiberation Organization and Israel, which deals with the\nextension of autonomy to the West Bank region, marks a\nnew, positive step in the implementation of the\nDeclaration of Principles signed in Washington in 1993.\nThe Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic hopes that the\nMiddle East peace process will continue to move ahead,\nin the interest of lasting peace and of cooperation for\ndevelopment between the peoples of this region.\nIn the Asia-Pacific region, countries of that region\nhave exerted many laudable efforts to ensure the\nmaintenance of peace and security and promotion of\ncooperation for development. These efforts enjoy\nincreasing support from the various peoples of the world.\nThe initiative to create a Regional Forum for the\nAssociation of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) is\nanother important gauge of the depth and strength of the\nconfidence and cooperation in this part of the world.\nThe Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic welcomes\nthe positive results of the implementation of the\n15\n\n\nagreements which have been reached between the\nDemocratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea and the United\nStates of America and which have contributed to improving\nthe situation in that region. At the same time, the Lao\npeople fully support the ardent aspirations of the Korean\npeople to the peaceful and independent reunification of\nKorea.\nAs an integral part of the community of South-East\nAsia, one of the regions recognized for its activities in\nfavour of maintaining peace and cooperation in the region\nand in the world, my country, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic\nRepublic, has made a worthy contribution to that effort\ndesigned to make that region one of peace, friendship and\ncooperation as well as a nuclear-weapons-free zone. In its\neffort at national construction, my country has also had new\nsuccess. Last year, the economic-growth rate reached the\nlevel of 8 per cent. The volume of foreign investment has\nincreased, thus contributing to the improvement of the Lao\npeople\u2019s living conditions. More important still, political\nstability and social order in the country are now solidly\nguaranteed. At the present time, the Lao government is\nworking actively to carry out, under market mechanisms,\nthe development strategy to the year 2000, which would\npromote economic growth along with social development,\nthe development of human resources and sustainable rural\ndevelopment, while giving great importance to\nenvironmental protection and the protection of the rights\nand the interests of women and children.\nIn the international arena, the Lao Government will\ncontinue to apply its consistent policy of peace, friendship\nand cooperation with all countries. For the time being, it is\nconcentrating its efforts on establishing the necessary\nconditions for it to become, in the near future, a full-\nfledged member of ASEAN. We hope that the countries of\nthat organization, other friendly countries, and international\norganizations will provide assistance and support for our\nefforts.\nIn recent years, the world economic situation as a\nwhole has shown a somewhat positive trend. None the less,\nthe majority of the developing countries still face economic\ndifficulties stemming from many causes. The Lao People\u2019s\nDemocratic Republic believes, therefore, that in order for\ninterdependence to be of equal benefit to all, we should\nresume as quickly as possible North-South dialogue in\norder to promote cooperation for development. At the same\ntime, every effort should be made to find the means to\nsettle as quickly as possible the debt problem of the least\ndeveloped countries, in order to create conditions\nfavourable to their development.\nThe Government of the Lao People\u2019s Democratic\nRepublic attaches great importance to the implementation\nof the Programme of Action adopted by the Social\nSummit \u2014 the first of its kind \u2014 which was held last\nMarch in Copenhagen. My Government hopes that the\ninternational community will work together to implement\nthat Programme and to promote socioeconomic\ndevelopment, which would allow mankind to live in\nconditions of peace, security and justice.\nThe Government of the Lao People\u2019s Democratic\nRepublic believes that the success of the Fourth World\nConference on Women, held in Beijing this past\nSeptember, created a favourable political, economic and\nsociocultural atmosphere for the full participation of\nwomen in development. We will thus continue to promote\nand ensure rights to equality between men and women \u2014\nrights that are clearly specified in our Constitution. We\nwill also continue to mobilize and to help the women of\nethnic minorities to participate fully in the development\nprocess, as both players and beneficiaries of the fruits of\ngrowth.\nIn the current international situation, even though\nEast-West confrontation has ended, mankind none the less\ncontinues to be concerned by the danger posed by the\nexistence of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass\ndestruction. It is imperative that joint, effective measures\nbe taken to reduce this danger and eliminate it forever. In\nthis context, the Government of the Lao People\u2019s\nDemocratic Republic supports the initiative of the\ncountries of South-East Asia to make this region a\nnuclear-weapon-free zone.\nThe question of the promotion of human rights and\nof fundamental freedoms continues to have a high priority\non the international agenda. In considering this question,\na large number of countries are concerned at the trend to\ndeal only with the civil and political aspects of human\nrights and to use them to interfere in the internal affairs\nof other countries, which would violate the rights of\npeoples to self-determination. Bearing in mind the\nintrinsic characteristics of each nation, the Lao People\u2019s\nDemocratic Republic believes that only a global and\nbalanced approach to this sensitive question would serve\nthe cause of human rights and would meet the legitimate\ninterests of all peoples.\nWe are meeting today at a time when the United\nNations is actively preparing to celebrate its fiftieth\nanniversary. This commemoration should be for us all an\nunprecedented opportunity to review the Organization\u2019s\n16\n\n\nperformance over the past five decades, with the goal of\nenhancing the effectiveness of its role in the economic and\nsocial development of peoples and in the maintenance of\nworld peace. In a new international context, the United\nNations, and in particular its Security Council, should be\nrestructured and democratized in order to become a reliable\nand upright body enjoying the confidence of all nations and\ncapable of solving global problems. In this spirit, the\ndelegation of the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic will\ncontinue, together with other delegations, to make its active\ncontribution to the strengthening of our universal\nOrganization.\n"

        "file_text": "It is a pleasant duty for my\ndelegation to welcome the election of Mr. Diogo Freitas\ndo Amaral to the presidency of the General Assembly at\nthis especially solemn session. He will be presiding over\na session which for the first time will hear statements by\nvirtually all the world\u2019s leaders. We are convinced that\nhis experience will guarantee the success of our work.\nI wish also to convey our appreciation to\nAmbassador Amara Essy for the exceptional ability and\nefficiency with which he guided the work of the General\nAssembly at its forty-ninth session.\nNor can I fail to convey to the Secretary-General,\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, my Government\u2019s gratitude\nfor his tenacious efforts for peace during a time when his\noutstanding diplomatic talents have been put to a hard\ntest.\nAny institution tends to shape its own life, which is\nnot always consistent with previous models. Thus,\nhowever much those who carry out the provisions of a\nfounding document may venerate that document, they\ncannot prevent an organization from transcending to some\n45\n\n\nextent the founders\u2019 original wishes. Moreover, the older\nthe founding document the greater the disparities between\nthe original conception and the institution\u2019s functioning and\npractices. Obviously, the great changes that have taken\nplace and the new hopes for the end of a century can only\nintensify this phenomenon.\nFor the United Nations to have escaped this trend\nwould have been impossible, especially when it was\ndictated by circumstances. A half century has passed since\nthe founding of the United Nations; none of the founders\ncould have imagined the spectacular, dizzying changes that\nhave come about since the San Francisco conference. We\nmust remember that, as a legal constitutional instrument,\nthe Charter needs a contemporary purpose-oriented\ninterpretation in order to be properly understood.\nWith respect to the operational activities of the\nOrganization in the economic and social spheres, few could\nhave thought in 1945 that these would have acquired their\npresent scope. Nor would anyone have thought that\nArticle 2 (7) of the Charter would permit the Organization\nto become a legitimate champion of respect for human\nrights throughout the world.\nWe pay a well deserved tribute to the extraordinary\nskill of the representatives of Member States in devising\nnegotiated formulas that have made it possible to snatch\nfrom what seemed to be imminent failure global agreements\nof great importance \u2014 and all the more sound for their\nhaving been achieved through a balanced consensus.\n\nAlthough we might have certain reservations about\nsome specific elements of the functioning of the\nOrganization, in general my Government hails the United\nNations system\u2019s great ability to adapt to circumstances as\nit addresses problems calmly and with realism. While we\npay tribute to these noteworthy virtues of adaptability,\nproductive pragmatism and the ability to scale high political\nhurdles, our admiration should not blind us to the need for\nreform, a need we are already beginning to face up to. Such\nreform would enable us to remove the Organization\u2019s\nfailings and shortcomings and thus make it more efficient\nand democratic so it can resist the unilateral practices that\nwould supplant it.\nAmong the most striking features of today\u2019s world are\nnearly incredible disparities and paradoxes. Although\nspeaking of these is a commonplace here, we cannot fail to\nnote that the wealth of most inhabitants of a tiny minority\nof countries is in marked contrast to the great difficulties\nand deprivation endured by three quarters of the\ninhabitants of the planet, who are prevented from\ncompeting on the international market, even with their\ncommodities, by administrative restrictions, subsidies and\ndiscriminatory policies. There are places where the most\nsophisticated products of modern technology are the\ncommon tools of the worker; there are other places where\nyou can travel great distances without seeing any\ntechnology more advanced than that used in biblical\ntimes. It is hardly necessary to note the contrast between\nthe extreme poverty of so many human beings and the\nvast expenditures on weapons. As to democracy and\nhuman rights, we acknowledge the increasing world\nawareness of those ideals \u2014 although we share concerns\nabout the relativism with which they are applied and\nabout the way they are used to exert political pressure and\neven to trade in influence.\nIt will unquestionably be necessary to overcome\nthose contradictions. We are sure that if that goal is\nachieved, even partially, the credit will belong largely to\nthe United Nations, which by the terms of Article 1 of the\nCharter is\n\u201ca centre for harmonizing the actions of nations in\nthe attainment of ... common ends\u201d.\nNo Guatemalan can hear or utter the word that is at\nthe very core of this Organization \u2014 \u201cpeace\u201d \u2014 without\nimmediately thinking of the most important problem\nbesetting my country. Because of a fratricidal struggle\npromoted largely by a cold war that was alien to us, a\nstruggle that for more than 30 years harmed thousands of\nfamilies, endangered democracy and unleashed human\nrights violations by parties to the conflict, today the most\nfervent desire of the people of Guatemala can only be\nreconciliation and a firm and lasting peace. If this has not\nyet been achieved, it is not because of any lack of effort,\npatience and great tolerance by the democratic\nGovernment and, as is known, by the international\ncommunity, which has acted principally through the\nGroup of Friends and through the United Nations,\nspecifically through the Secretary-General.\nThe Government of Guatemala thanks all who have\ncontributed to the functioning of the machinery set up to\nhelp further our national goal of peace, reconciliation and\ndevelopment, especially the Secretary-General, the\nGuatemala Unit of the Department of Political Affairs, the\nUnited Nations Moderator and the United Nations\n46\n\n\nMission for the Verification of Human Rights and of\nCompliance with the Commitments of the Comprehensive\nAgreement on Human Rights in Guatemala. We are also\ngrateful to the six Governments that form the Group of\nFriends of the peace process in Guatemala for their\ninvaluable contribution to this arduous and painstaking\nwork.\nThe Government of Guatemala has spared no effort to\nrealize the aspiration of our entire nation to bring an end to\ninternal armed conflict. In the sphere of human rights, the\nGovernment of President Ramiro de Le\u00f3n Carpio is facing\na situation deriving from the armed confrontation that has\ngripped our country for three decades, so the tasks before\nus are intimately linked with peace-building. This prompted\nPresident de Le\u00f3n Carpio to sign the Comprehensive\nAgreement on Human Rights of 29 March 1994, by which\nhe reaffirmed his commitment to principles and norms\naimed at guaranteeing and protecting full observance of\nhuman rights by the parties, and his political will to ensure\nthat those principles and norms are respected.\nAs a result of that Agreement, the United Nations\nMission for the Verification of Human Rights and of\nCompliance with the Commitments of the Comprehensive\nAgreement on Human Rights in Guatemala (MINUGUA)\nwas set up in our country. It has been accorded the fullest\nfacilities and guarantees for its activities on our territory.\nThe implementation of some of the recommendations of\nMINUGUA has met with difficulties owing to institutional\nlimitations; we are endeavouring to resolve these, although\nit must be recognized that some provisions do not have the\nimpetus that would secure compliance in the short term.\nAlso, a Counsel for Human Rights is now at work in\nmy country; this is a post formerly filled by President de\nLe\u00f3n Carpio. This office retains and is enhancing its\nprestige within the country and its international credibility.\nThe Presidential Human Rights Committee (COPREDEH)\nis making ever greater efforts to ensure that the\nrecommendations are duly complied with. Reflecting my\nGovernment\u2019s political will, there are also preventive\nmechanisms to avoid human rights violations.\nI turn now to the process of Central American\nintegration, which gave rise to the signing of the\nTegucigalpa Protocol to the Charter of the Organization of\nAmerican States. The Central American Integration System\n(SICA), founded as an intergovernmental organization, has\nbeen working successfully since the beginning of 1993 with\nthe purpose of strengthening integration in the economic,\nsocial, cultural and political spheres.\nGuatemala hopes that \u2014 bearing in mind the\nimportance of the Central American Integration System,\nwhich encompasses virtually all activities of the\nGovernments of its member States and which covers a\ncontiguous area of some 425,000 square kilometres\ninhabited by nearly 30 million people \u2014 the General\nAssembly will accede to the request made by Guatemala\nalong with the other members of the System and Panama\nto grant SICA observer status in the General Assembly.\nThe Central American region founded the Alliance\nfor Sustainable Development to strengthen integration\nbased on democracy, improvement of the quality of life,\nrespect for and development of the vitality and diversity\nof the land, and the multicultural and multiethnic nature\nof our isthmus. We supported the establishment of the\nAssociation of Caribbean States, and we are participating\nin the World Trade Organization; these, we feel, are\nproper forums to foster values that enrich society and\npromote fair rules of trade. For similar reasons we shall\nattend the Ibero-American summit to take place at\nBariloche, Argentina, and the summit of non-aligned\ncountries to be held at Cartagena, Colombia. We will be\nat the upcoming Tuxtla II meeting and at talks between\nCentral America and other countries and regional\ngroupings.\nRecently, we attended the Fourth World Conference\non Women, where my delegation supported\nrecommendations promoting the material and moral\nadvancement of women in keeping with ethical concepts\nthat respect women and grant them dignity and\nparticipation with the right to complete equality.\nOur contribution to United Nations efforts towards\nthe democratic rehabilitation of Haiti have taken the form\nof a contingent of army specialists in peaceful operations.\nThis is the moment to refer to Guatemala\u2019s\ncontribution to two important General Assembly\ninitiatives with respect to the development of legal\nprinciples set out in the Charter: the well known\nDeclaration on Principles of International Law concerning\nFriendly Relations and Cooperation among States in\naccordance with the Charter of the United Nations, which\nwas adopted by the Assembly on the occasion of the\ntwenty-fifth anniversary of the entry into force of the\nCharter, and which my country introduced on behalf of its\n41 sponsors; and our second contribution aimed at\npromoting the use of conciliation as one of the means of\npeaceful settlement of disputes between States set out in\nArticle 33 of the Charter. Guatemala submitted the first\n47\n\n\nversion of these proposed rules to the General Assembly in\n1990. At its 1995 session, the Ad Hoc Committee on the\nCharter endorsed the final version of the proposed rules by\nconsensus and recommended that the General Assembly\nbring them to the attention of States.\nConsistent with our devotion to law and firmly\nconvinced of the benefits of peace and the importance of\nmutual cooperation, Guatemala gives priority to the\npeaceful settlement of disputes. Hence, in connection with\nthe territorial dispute with Belize, my country hopes that\nthere will be a decisive solution through a more realistic,\nconstructive and forward-looking dialogue, unconstrained\nby any limits other than the principles of good faith and the\ndignity of the parties.\nGuatemala is vastly pleased at the indefinite extension\nof the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons,\nand at the fact that this was achieved through a truly\nhistoric decision, without a vote. Together with our\nsatisfaction at the indefinite extension of the Treaty, we\nalso feel pride, because Latin America is the least heavily\narmed region in the world and, thanks to the Treaty of\nTlatelolco, is the only region that has become a nuclear-\nweapon-free zone forever. We regret the resumption of\nnuclear testing and therefore urge the adoption of new\ninitiatives to forge a new world order that would eliminate\nnuclear weapons and in which security would be overseen\nby international institutions sustaining the force of law.\nThat is why my delegation is among the sponsors of a draft\nresolution to be submitted to the General Assembly by\nStates parties and signatories of the Treaty of Tlatelolco\nand the Treaty of Rarotonga.\nGuatemala has had the tragic and painful experience\nof the laying of mines by outlaw groups, and we vigorously\ncondemn the use of mines and support all proposals\nintended to prohibit them.\nWe note with satisfaction that the Middle East peace\nprocess is moving forward. Guatemala hopes that wisdom\nwill prevail, which after so many decades of struggle and\nviolence will make it possible for peace to reign forever in\na land of such deep significance to three great religions.\nGuatemala is pleased that greater use is now being\nmade of the International Court of Justice than ever before.\nWe are pleased too at the wide geographical range of the\ncases before what can rightly be known as a World Court.\nRecalling the precedent-setting creation of a Central\nAmerican international court, which is now being restored,\nmy country will venture to propose the candidature of an\nexperienced Guatemalan jurist for a seat on the\nInternational Court of Justice; we are convinced that he\ncould make a most important contribution to the work of\nthe Court.\nFollowing careful consideration of the items on the\nagenda of the World Summit for Social Development,\nGuatemala participated in that conference with the\ngreatest interest and with high hopes; the Summit was\naddressed by President de Le\u00f3n Carpio.\nWe are convinced that unless the fundamental\nprinciple of universality is fully observed, our\nOrganization will be unable fully to attain its purposes.\nWe therefore urge consideration of the situation of the\nRepublic of China in Taiwan so that this country may\nhave a forum in which to discuss its future peacefully\nwith its historical brethren.\nFifty years after post-war statesmen conceived the\nplan for a world organization intended to save succeeding\ngenerations from the scourge of war, poverty and\nignorance, we must be optimistic in our assessment of the\nresults, for they have saved the world from the irreparable\nharm of total conflagration. Although it is true that at\ntimes the cold war flared up in local armed conflicts\nencouraged by the rivalry between opposing super-Powers\nwhich at the time seemed irreconcilable, today we breathe\na more tranquil atmosphere with respect to military\nsecurity. But that atmosphere is less secure with respect\nto cooperation for development, because the rules of the\neconomic order sometimes forget that economic weakness\nis not only an internal matter for States but is also a\nresponsibility for those who have achieved a more than\ndignified standard of living and who have an obligation\nto transfer resources and technology for the sake of\nworld-wide justice.\nWe close with the well known phrase of His\nHoliness Pope John Paul II, which we invite members to\nponder: \u201cThe new name for peace is development\u201d.\n\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me at the outset to express to the President my\nwarmest congratulations on his election to guide the\nfiftieth session of the General Assembly. We are\nconfident that his wealth of experience will make it\npossible for this session to achieve its noble goals. I\n9\n\n\nshould like to pledge the full support and cooperation of\nSudan to that end.\nAllow me also to express my great appreciation to his\npredecessor, the President of the forty-ninth session of the\nGeneral Assembly His Excellency Mr. Amara Essy,\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, for his\nimmensely valuable contribution to the work of the United\nNations. I would also like to commend the Secretary-\nGeneral for his continuous endeavours in fulfilling his\nfunctions.\nThis session of the General Assembly acquires a\nspecial importance because half a century in the lifetime of\nthe Organization calls upon us to pause for contemplation\nand self-criticism. We should do that because we look\nforward to the United Nations becoming the body that\nguarantees peaceful coexistence amongst States, the light\nthat guides States in important issues and the effective\ninstrument for consolidating international cooperation.\nThe philosophy upon which the United Nations was\nestablished was one that aimed at reflecting the progress\nhumanity had achieved towards the state of civilization.\nHowever, actual experience has fallen short of that\naspiration. In our view, this falling short has been due to\ncertain practices by means of which some have tried to use\nthe Organization as a tool to impose their hegemony and\ninfluence, so that their own outlook and values may become\nthe sole, compulsory statute of the international community,\nregardless of any diversity of cultures, beliefs, or heritage.\nIt behoves us to agree, however, that our world is made up\nof a fabric of diversity, and that such diversity, at no time\nin history, has been a source of conflict but, rather, a source\nof rich and valuable contributions to the gains made by\nmankind. Instead of undermining that diversity or using it\nas a pretext for strife and conflict, it would have been wiser\nto make it a basis for constructive dialogue and the\nconsolidation of tolerance and justice in the world.\nThe United Nations has led humanity towards new\nhorizons in the half century that has elapsed since its\nestablishment. This necessitates a reconsideration of its\nsystem and mechanisms, given the vast expansion in its\nmembership, its new responsibilities and the emergence of\nnew international economic and political blocs and systems\nthat were not in existence when the United Nations was\nfounded. Top priority in such an endeavour should be\naccorded to the need to reform the Security Council, in\nview of the role expected from it in maintaining\ninternational peace and security.\nThe considerations we have mentioned are\ncompelling reasons for expanding Security Council\nmembership in order to ensure equitable representation of\nthe developing countries. It is also necessary to reform\nthe procedures of the Council, to ensure transparency and\nclarity in its work, to reform its decision-making\nmechanism and to develop equitable criteria that would\nguide its policies and safeguard it against the pitfall of\ndouble-standard and the effects of the ambitions of\nhegemony and domination of any of its members.\nThe reform of the United Nations should also\ninclude reform of the Bretton Woods institutions, which\nhave come to be used as tools for the implementation of\nstrategies that are designed to entrench hegemony over\nthe developing countries. Therefore, the Bretton Woods\ninstitutions are required to return to their mandate, which\nstipulate their role in the promotion of a balanced\ndevelopment and support for the monetary and financial\npolicies of all countries without exception or\ndiscrimination. We also concur in the call for a review of\nthose institutions in the light of the economic and\nfinancial factors which have come to prevail in today\u2019s\nworld as a result of the emergence of new groups and\ncountries whose economic weight enables them to exert\nconsiderable influence on international trade and on the\nflow of financial resources and capital.\nToday\u2019s world also faces a number of economic and\nsocial crises as a result of the fractious economic relations\nbetween North and South, the inequitable terms of trade\nand the ever-expanding gap between rich and poor\ncountries. Those crises are exacerbated by the dominance\nof consumerism and the undermining of the moral values\nthat uphold the dignity of man and preserve the social\nfabric. Those are moral values which inspired all cultures\nand civilizations. Accordingly, the objectives of balanced\ndevelopment should be formulated on a basis of respect\nfor those values and principles in order for these\nobjectives to be conducive to resolving the crises and\nmaintaining balance in social, political, cultural, and\neconomic relations in the world community.\nIn this regard, we should mention the debt problem\nthat has become a major concern for developing\ncountries, especially the African. The indebtedness of the\nAfrican countries had doubled in the past 10 years to a\nrecord $270 billion, with a debt-servicing tag that\nconsumes about 35 per cent of the gross national product\nof those countries. As expected, the heavy debt burden\nand debt-servicing tag have had serious consequences\n10\n\n\nwhich impede development efforts and obstruct economic\nstructural reforms.\nOn the other hand, the industrial countries have taken\nno responsible initiative to address this problem. Instead,\nthey called for a case-by-case approach on a bilateral basis.\nThis reinforces the impression that the purpose is the\nimposition of a political agenda. The result has been\nparalysis of the economies of African States, collapse of\ntheir infrastructures, and, consequently the eruption of\ninternal and regional conflicts all over the continent, which\nhave impeded Africa\u2019s efforts to achieve growth and\ninternal stability. Therefore, the linking of peace-keeping,\nhumanitarian assistance and long-term sustainable\ndevelopment is a principle that we welcome and support.\nSudan has been following with deep concern the\nsituation in Bosnia and Herzegovina, where the Bosnian\npeople have continued to be victims of \u201cethnic cleansing\u201d\nand extermination. While we reiterate our support for the\npeople and the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina, we\ncall upon the international community to continue its efforts\nto put an end to the genocide that targets this people and\nwe commend the efforts deployed by all those countries\nthat support or are engaged in the search for a just, lasting\nand comprehensive settlement to this problem.\nThe situation in the Gulf is of special importance to us\nnot only because it affects our peace and stability, but also\nbecause of the deeply rooted historical and cultural ties and\nrelationships which strongly bind my country to that region.\nWe look forward to the return of peace amongst our\nbrothers in the Gulf. In this respect, we have welcomed\nIraq\u2019s official recognition of the sovereignty and territorial\nboundaries of the State of Kuwait in accordance with the\nrelevant Security Council resolutions and Iraq\u2019s undertaking\nto cooperate in resolving the outstanding problems between\nthe two States, on the one hand, and between Iraq and the\nSecurity Council, on the other. We call on all parties to\nabide by these measures in order to guarantee Kuwait\u2019s\nlegitimate right to existence and sovereignty and the right\nto security and stability to its people and leadership. By the\nsame token, we call for the lifting of the embargo imposed\non Iraq, which no longer has any legal justification as the\ngrounds it was built on no longer obtain. The embargo has\nnow become a political ploy aimed at starving the Iraqi\npeople, humiliating it and fragmenting its territory.\nIn the same context, Sudan has been following, with\ngreat dismay and disapprobation, the continuation of the\nunjust sanctions imposed on the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya,\nwhile the Jamahiriya has spared no effort in trying to deal\nwith the dispute over the Lockerbie crisis by every\nacceptable legal means. It is our opinion that the initiative\nby the League of Arab States, to which the Libyan Arab\nJamahiriya subscribes, is a practical basis for addressing\nthe situation in a manner that would lead to the lifting of\nthe sanctions.\nAs for the Palestinian question, it is our belief that\npeace should be based on the criteria of justice and full\nrespect for all the rights of the Palestinian and Arab\npeoples of the region. Consequently, the return of all the\nSyrian Golan Heights to Syria, and Israel\u2019s full and\nunconditional withdrawal from southern Lebanon,\nAl-Quds and all the other occupied Arab territories, are\nessential requirements for the achievement of any stable\nlasting settlement.\nWe are advocates of peace, stability and good-\nneighbourliness. Our abiding conviction has been that the\nHorn of Africa is a region that has suffered most, without\nany objective justification from internal civil strife and\ninstability. We concur with the view that the peoples of\nthe subregion should focus on the need to achieve\nsecurity and stability. Indeed, this is an objective that we\nhave worked for through many a practical initiative that\nwe put forward as members of the Organization of\nAfrican Unity (OAU) and of the International Authority\non Drought and Development (IGADD). Notwithstanding\nthe high hopes we had in that direction, the results have\nfallen short of the very minimum of our aspirations,\nbecause some have been seduced by grand strategies\nwhose aim has been the destabilization of the region. It is\nregrettable that some seem to find it difficult indeed to\nabide by the behests of international legality or even to\nrespect the norms of international law. It is equally\nregrettable that such quarters find it difficult to abide by\nthe principles of good-neighbourliness and peaceful\ncoexistence and turn, instead, to subversion and terrorism\nagainst my country publicly embrace and give haven to\nelements of armed opposition.\nMy country supports the initiatives aimed at\npromoting and strengthening regional organizations and\nmechanisms for conflict prevention and settlement, and\nurges that such mechanisms should adhere to the\nobjectives they were introduced to achieve and abide by\nthe rules that govern their activities. It is our opinion that\nthe functions of such mechanisms should be, above all\nelse, preventive and that they should discharge such\nfunctions impartially. They should intervene in conflicts\nonly when it is necessary to do so, with the consent of\nthe parties concerned, and their activities should be\n11\n\n\nlimited to peaceful handling. They should also preserve\ntheir regional nature, so that they do not become extensions\nof other parallel mechanisms or tentacles of strategies that\naim at international hegemony.\nAs regards our immediate neighbours, allow me to\nreciprocate, and to extend similar greetings to the brotherly\npeople of Egypt, and to express our conviction that only the\ntruth will prevail and that the situation in Egypt will return\nto its normal course, away from all policies of repression,\ndomination and terrorism. There is no doubt that relations\nbetween Sudan and Egypt, inevitably, will return to normal\naway from the policy of imposition of fait accompli, away\nfrom the policies of occupation of territory by force and\novert support for organized armed terrorism and away from\nthe legitimization of rebellion and sedition.\nIt is our conviction that the ties of brotherhood and\nsolidarity that, historically, have linked our two peoples,\nwill remain as strong and as enduring as the Nile that flows\nfrom Sudan to Egypt. Sudan has very clearly supported the\nintegrity of Egypt within its borders. This has been the\nposition of principle adopted by Sudan towards Egypt, not\nin words but in deeds that are recorded in the eternal annals\nof history as when the sons of Sudan gave their lives in\ndefence of Egypt.\nAs we are renewing the commitment to and desire for\npeace and coexistence, we call for the resolving by\nnegotiation of all boundary disputes and all problems\nrelating to sovereignty over territories that arise between\nStates. Failing this, there would be no alternative but to\nseek arbitration by neutral parties.\nThe word \u201cIslam\u201d is derived from the Arabic word\n\u201csalam\u201d which means \u201cpeace\u201d. Islam is a religion based on\nthe principles of peace, equality and justice. I do not\nbelieve that Islam needs anyone to defend its record: it is\nhistory that bears witness to the greatness of the\ncivilizations it gave rise to while the present attests to its\ncontribution to the moral and social progress of men.\nGod honoured man by making him with His own hand\nand by ordaining that this fact should for ever be a\nfundamental reason for honouring man and for upholding\nhis rights. Thus the concept of human rights, which was\nrecently blazoned by some as if it were something that they\nhave just recently discovered, has been part of Islam\u2019s\nteachings for centuries upon centuries. Islam made it part\nof its charter which guides the believers long before that\nconcept found its way into modern charters.\nIt is indeed regrettable that such a religion should\nbecome the target of a malicious onslaught that aims not\nonly at distorting its image, but also at trying to question\nits origins and roots. It is all the more disturbing that\ncertain major Powers and societies have found it fitting to\nparticipate in this onslaught, without paying heed, it\nwould seem, to the devastating confrontation between the\nWest and Islam the onslaught is trying to provoke. We\nparticularly urge the United Nations not to allow itself to\nbe dragged into such a campaign.\nWe were pleased by the constructive approach\nadopted by His Holiness Pope John Paul II in his address\nto this Assembly and by his call for coexistence amongst\ndifferent cultures so that they might complement each\nother in building a healthy human society.\nIn that connection, we also applaud the statement by\nthe Minister for Foreign Affairs of Germany before this\nAssembly and by his rejection of any linking of Islam\nwith terrorism. We hope that other Western leaders will\nfollow suit and ensure that policies on the ground should\nreflect such a posture. Moreover, the need to avoid\nattempts at misrepresenting Islam and provoking\nconfrontation with it requires that such positive positions\nshould not be confined to leaders and Governments but\nshould extend also and become reflected in their societies,\ntheir mass media and their legal, security and\nadministrative systems.\nIn conformity with our values and beliefs, which\nrespect women, the State has promoted the position of\nwomen in Sudan, has granted them their full rights and\nhas enabled them to reach the highest levels in the\nconstitutional, legislative, and executive branches of\nGovernment. In today\u2019s Sudan, women constitute\n50 per cent of the Government\u2019s working force. The\npercentage of females in the universities and institutions\nof higher education is more than 60 per cent. Sudan was\na pioneer among the countries of the region in the area of\nempowering woman. Women have been appointed not\nonly to govern provinces, but also to hold leading posts\nin a number of the ministries of central Government and\nin the provinces.\nOur option in Sudan has been that economic and\nsocial development should be founded on our spiritual\nvalues, our historical background and our social traditions.\nSelf-reliance has been the major underpinning of this\nendeavour to achieve development. Although our opting\nfor this path has been under conditions of an inauspicious\n12\n\n\nworld climate, yet we have managed to provide food,\nclothing and various basic services for our citizens.\nThe participation of the Sudanese citizen in the\ncountry\u2019s public affairs underscores the approach we have\nopted for, namely the prevalence of the spirit of\nconsultation \u2014 shura \u2014 so that our citizens may be able\nto participate actively in the decision-making organs within\nthe federal system. In this context, Sudan has witnessed\npublic elections for various legislative bodies in more than\n20 of its 26 provinces. Upon completion of elections in all\nprovinces, elections for the members of the National\nAssembly will be held, and eventually, the election of a\nPresident of the Republic will take place.\nAt the moment, Sudan hosts about one million\nrefugees, and despite its meagre resources, its Government\nprovides them with material assistance. It is unfortunate that\nthe international community has discontinued its assistance\nto those refugees, thus leaving the country to bear the brunt\nof this essentially international responsibility. We call upon\nthe international community to increase its financial\nassistance to the Office of the United Nations High\nCommissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to meet the essential\nneeds of refugee projects and programmes in Sudan. Failure\nby the international community to do so will be quite unfair\nto Sudan, as it would mean that the country is expected to\ncontinue to host such a number of refugees while the\ninternational community fails to discharge its responsibility\ntowards them.\nWe come to this session of the General Assembly\nmotivated by good faith, and determination to play fully our\nrole in cooperation with the international family of the\nUnited Nations. In so doing, we are inspired by our\ncommitment to the purposes and principles of the United\nNations Charter and by our desire to put our capabilities at\nthe service of the common good of mankind and to work\nfor the realization of our aspirations after a new world\norder that would be characterized by liberty, equality and\njustice. We hope that the principles set forth in this\nstatement would point the way towards the attainment of\nthe noble goals which the United Nations was created to\nachieve.\n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of my\nGovernment and on my own behalf I wish to congratulate\nMr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral upon his unanimous\nelection as President of the General Assembly at its\nfiftieth session. I am particularly gratified that, for the\nfirst time since the creation of the United Nations, a son\nof Portugal \u2014 a country with which Mozambique\nentertains special ties of friendship and cooperation \u2014 is\n17\n\n\npresiding over our deliberations. Mr. Freitas do Amaral\u2019s\nelection to this important office bears testimony to his\npersonal qualifications as an enlightened scholar and\nstatesman, a man who has served his country with\ndistinction and has contributed in the dissemination and\ncodification of international law. My delegation, therefore,\nhas no doubt that he will lead our work to a successful\noutcome. I pledge him our full support and cooperation.\nI also wish to avail myself of this opportunity to put\non record my delegation\u2019s appreciation of the manner in\nwhich Mr. Freitas do Amaral\u2019s predecessor, Mr. Amara\nEssy, Minister of Foreign Affairs of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, presided\nover the deliberations of the General Assembly at its forty-\nninth session. His performance during the last session of\nthis very important gathering brought additional pride not\nonly to his country but also to the African continent.\nI wish to commend the Secretary-General of the\nUnited Nations, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for his\ncontinued commitment to the ideals of international peace\nand security. The people and Government of Mozambique\nare indebted to him for his dedication to the cause of peace\nin my country. He was, indeed, a key contributor to the\nsuccessful outcome of the United Nations Operation in\nMozambique (ONUMOZ).\nFifty years have elapsed since the establishment of the\nUnited Nations. There could not be a better opportunity for\na collective assessment of its achievements and of the\ndifficulties and challenges faced in its daily operations, as\nwell as of its future prospects on the threshold of the\ntwenty-first century.\nThe creation of the United Nations following the end\nof the Second World War represents, in our view, the most\nsignificant step forward in modern history, symbolizing a\ncollective effort aimed at preventing the eruption of another\nglobal conflict and at making our world a much safer place.\nThe shape of today\u2019s world is therefore a clear\ndemonstration of the contribution of the United Nations in\nits 50 years of existence.\nWhile it is true that we are still faced with numerous\nimperfections, uncertainties and challenges, one cannot deny\nthe fact that significant achievements have been made by\nthe Organization. Owing to the United Nations, it has been\npossible, to a great extent, to prevent global conflicts.\nThanks to the efforts of the United Nations, virtually\nall peoples of the world are today free from colonial\ndomination. From this body, guided by the principle of self-\ndetermination, liberation movements, through the Special\nCommittee on decolonization, aroused awareness of their\nindividual fate. Today, the majority of those countries are\nhere assembled as independent nations, fully exercising\ntheir inalienable right to self-determination. This is why\nthe quest for peace and sovereign equality among nations\nhas turned peace-keeping and economic development into\ntwo fundamental challenges before the Organization. All\nthis progress has been possible owing to respect for and\ncommitment to the purposes and principles enshrined in\nthe United Nations Charter.\nEver since its independence, my country has attached\ngreat importance to respect for and adherence to\ninternational law. Mozambique was only nine months old\nas an independent nation when, in early 1976, its new\nGovernment decided to abide by Security Council\nresolution 253 (1968) of 29 May 1968 regarding the\nimposition of sanctions against the minority regime in the\nthen Southern Rhodesia.\nDespite the very high price our people have paid for\ntheir commitment to the purposes and principles of the\nCharter, we feel honoured today to have contributed, to\nthe best of our ability, to the implementation of\ninternational obligations. These facts were duly\nrecognized in Security Council resolution 386 (1976) of\n17 March 1976, which, inter alia, emphasized that the\napplication of sanctions by my Government, in full\ncompliance with the decision of the Security Council,\nconstituted an important contribution to the realization of\nUnited Nations objectives in Southern Rhodesia, in\naccordance with the purposes and principles of the\nCharter. Indeed, four years later Zimbabwe attained its\nindependence.\nThe same applies to the common struggle for the\neradication of apartheid. Mozambique was one of the\ncountries most adversely affected by apartheid and its\ndestructive policies in southern Africa. As will be\nrecalled, within a few years following its independence\nMozambique gained international admiration for its\nsignificant achievements in raising statistical indicators in\nkey areas of national development \u2014 in particular, health\ncare and education. Our economy was among the most\npromising and vibrant in the southern African region.\nThe situation of impoverishment we are facing today\nis a direct consequence of the war which ravaged our\ncountry for so many years. Our present difficult situation\nis a direct consequence of the price we paid for our\ncontinued commitment to the struggle against apartheid.\n18\n\n\nBoth the war situation and the situation of impoverishment\nin my country were created and promoted by the old racist\nregimes of former Southern Rhodesia and apartheid South\nAfrica.\nThe peace that has prevailed in Mozambique since the\nsigning of the Rome Agreement three years ago and the\nvisible improvements in our economic situation underline\nclearly that with positive support and encouragement by the\ninternational community Mozambicans can find appropriate\nsolutions to their differences and problems.\nAs I speak on this subject, I am reminded of a\nstatement made by President Chissano in response to the\nSpeaker of the Parliament of the Republic of South Africa,\nMr. Freme Ginwala, during a State visit made to that sister\ncountry in February this year. On that occasion, the Speaker\nhad apologized in moving terms for the horrible crimes\ncommitted against the people of Mozambique by successive\napartheid Governments in Pretoria in an attempt to\ndiscourage the Government of Mozambique from\nsupporting the cause of freedom and peace in the southern\nAfrican region. In his reply President Chissano stressed that\nin so far as he was concerned the people of South Africa\nhad nothing to apologize for because Mozambicans were\naware of the consequences of their determination to support\nthe struggle for justice and peace, not only in South Africa\nbut also in the whole region. The President emphasized that\nin reality all the peoples of the region were victims of the\nsame disease, apartheid, the elimination of which called for\nsacrifices.\nToday, we all rejoice at seeing a free, united and\nnon-racial South Africa, poised to fulfil its domestic and\ninternational responsibilities in efforts for regional peace,\nstability and cooperation among southern African nations.\nWith the eradication of apartheid and with our country\nsurrounded by friendly and peace-loving neighbours, peace\nand stability are now a reality in Mozambique. Southern\nAfrica is now a region of flourishing democracy. Together,\nwe are fulfilling our collective responsibilities for regional\neconomic development.\nLast January, at the end of the peace-keeping\noperation in Mozambique, I came to New York and spoke\nto the Security Council about the progress made since the\nholding of the first multiparty general elections in my\ncountry. I indicated then that peace was indeed a tangible\nreality in Mozambique. Today, I am once again honoured\nto reiterate, before this body, my Government\u2019s high\ncommitment to national reconciliation, so as to ensure that\nthe peace we have all worked for is there to stay, forever.\nIndeed, the advent of peace in my country has paved\nthe way for Mozambicans to pull together for the\neconomic development of the country. Accordingly, the\nGovernment that emerged from last year\u2019s general\nelections has drawn up a Five-Year Programme, from\n1995 to 1999, in which the maintenance and further\nstrengthening of peace, stability and national unity and\nreduction of absolute poverty, with emphasis on\neducation, health, rural development and job creation, are\nour main objectives. Our Programme also aims at\nensuring the resettlement of returnees and displaced\npersons and promoting the social integration of\ndemobilized soldiers.\nIn addition, we are addressing other pressing issues\nbefore us. To this end I should like to emphasize my\nGovernment\u2019s resolve to continue working towards a\nlasting pluralistic democracy in our country. Accordingly,\nwe deem it essential to ensure the normal functioning of\nour Parliament, the Assembly of the Republic. We believe\nits normal functioning constitutes one of the key factors\nfor the consolidation of democracy in our society.\nWithin this perspective, my Government has recently\nestablished an institution which will be dealing with\nelectoral issues on a permanent basis. The creation and\nconsolidation of a new institution which will supervise\nour future elections will serve, in our view, as an\nimportant confidence-building measure for society and all\npolitical parties, for it will ensure confidence in future\nelections. As a matter of fact, we are preparing to begin\nnext year the holding of municipal elections, which will\ncomplement the process that was initiated by the general\nelections in 1994.\nThe upgrading of the technical capacity of the\nnational police is another Government key priority. As\nwill be recalled, ONUMOZ was unable meaningfully to\naddress the issue relating to the collection of weapons and\ntheir subsequent destruction. Needless to emphasize, those\nweapons represent a great danger not only to our own\nstability but also to that of our neighbours.\nIn this context, and on the basis of existing\nagreements between Mozambique and South Africa, joint\noperations are currently taking place between police\nforces of the two countries. As a result, thousands of\nweapons and explosives have already been collected and\ndestroyed. Moreover, my Government is working harder\n19\n\n\nin order to ensure that our police force is better prepared\nand equipped to deal more efficiently with transboundary\ncrimes, particularly drug-trafficking and money-laundering.\nOn the other hand, my Government considers it to be\nof the utmost importance that the upgrading of police\ntechnical capacity should go hand in hand with similar\nprogress in the strengthening of the judicial system, in order\nto support the work of the police effectively by prosecuting\nviolators of our domestic laws and regulations. All possible\nsupport for our national efforts in this regard will be greatly\nappreciated.\nAnother area of paramount importance in efforts being\nundertaken by my Government is that of de-mining. In this\nregard I am happy to tell the Assembly that the National\nDe-mining Commission has been established. We are\ncurrently engaged in final steps which will lead to the\napproval of our national de-mining policy and programme.\nEven before the formal approval of such a policy and\nprogramme, national de-mining efforts are already visible\nin the field throughout the country. With sufficient\nresources I believe we can make greater progress in getting\nrid of land-mines nationwide.\nI wish at this juncture to thank all countries and\ninstitutions which have contributed to the de-mining\nprogramme in Mozambique, and I look forward to their\ncontinued support in the years ahead.\nIn this connection I should like to take this opportunity\nto voice my Government\u2019s full support for the initiatives\nunder way to eliminate and ban these horrible weapons\nworld wide.\nIn spite of all the difficulties, we see ourselves as a\nnation determined to build a better future for our people.\nOur economy has grown by over 6 per cent during the first\nsix months of this year. On the other hand, negotiations\nhave been concluded recently between the Government and\ntrade unions in order to find a common platform for the\nhardships deriving from the implementation of the\nEconomic Rehabilitation Programme that has been under\nway since 1987. In an attempt to address the increasing cost\nof living our people are enduring in this process we have\nagreed to raise the minimum wage.\nThis is why we launch a sincere appeal to our partners\nto abide by their commitments to a timely and\nunconditional disbursement of pledged funds within the\nframework of the Paris Consultative Group. Without\nfulfilment of those obligations, plans for a better future in\nour country may be in jeopardy, with all the concomitant\nnegative consequences for the consolidation of the\nongoing democratic process, particularly given the\nconcerns over the growing drought threat to our region.\nWe, for our side, are committed to deepening further\nour economic and political reforms and to improving the\nsystem of tax collection, transparency and accountability\nin the management of public affairs.\nA lot has been said about the prospects of the United\nNations. I agree that our future will depend on the\nmanner in which we address the needed reforms of our\nOrganization. As my predecessor, the now-Prime Minister\nDr. Pascoal Manuel Mocumbi, emphasized last year in his\naddress to the Assembly, Mozambique shares a genuine\ninterest in seeing a more representative Security Council.\nAs previous speakers have stressed, the legitimacy and\nefficiency of that body will greatly depend on its\nrepresentativeness. Efforts must therefore be made to\nensure that the needed expansion of the Security Council\nnot take place merely to accommodate the interests of\nthose who are already privileged by the Council\u2019s current\ncomposition at the expense of the majority of nations. A\nrealistic and innovative approach is essential to ensure\nthat, in keeping with current new realities, the interests of\ndeveloping countries are fully respected, both qualitatively\nand quantitatively.\nThe reform exercise must also take into account the\nneed for every nation to abide by its financial obligations.\nIn that connection my Government, despite the well-\nknown economic difficulties, has fully honoured its\ncommitments regarding assessed contributions to the\nUnited Nations regular budget. We are now taking\nmeasures to ensure that all outstanding contributions to\npeace-keeping activities are settled as soon as possible.\nWe cannot expect a well-functioning and dynamic United\nNations unless we provide it with the needed funds. It is\nonly through determined, concrete action that we can all\ndemonstrate our individual seriousness and commitment\nto the purposes and principles of the Charter.\nThe end of the cold war has given rise to mixed\nfeelings about our efforts to address regional conflicts.\nIn Angola, the signing of the Lusaka Protocol\nbetween the Government and UNITA, coupled with the\nsubsequent progress made by the parties to the peace\nprocess, has paved the way for a renewed hope in that\nsister country. I believe that Angola is closer to reaching\na political settlement that will ensure the attainment of a\n20\n\n\nlasting peace and tranquillity. My delegation encourages the\nSecretary-General to continue his efforts towards the full\ndeployment of a peace-keeping contingent within the\nframework of the United Nations Angola Verification\nMission (UNAVEM III).\nThe attainment of a lasting peace and tranquillity in\nAngola will be the best contribution to the regional stability\nand economic development we have long sought in\nsouthern Africa within the framework of the Southern\nAfrica Development Community (SADC). In this\nconnection, I am happy to recall that our Heads of State\nand Government, meeting last August at Johannesburg,\nwelcomed the admission of Mauritius as a new member of\nour organization. With peace, democracy and growing\npartnership among its members, SADC is gradually\nbecoming a vibrant and viable market ready to cooperate\nwith other regions in a variety of fields of mutual interest.\nOur efforts within SADC go beyond mere economic\nintegration. In addition to discussions on peace-keeping and\npost-conflict peace-building mechanisms, we are also\naddressing concrete issues aimed at preventing possible\nconflicts between our nations. It is within this perspective\nthat we view the ongoing discussion on such matters as the\ncommon utilization of international water courses,\ntransboundary movements of people and goods, and crime\nprevention and control.\nMy delegation looks forward to a political settlement\nto the threatening situation in Burundi. It is our hope that\nthe momentum created by the Secretary-General\u2019s recent\nvisit to that country, as well as other important initiatives,\nwill encourage the parties to work for reconciliation in the\ninterest, not only of Burundi, but also of the Great Lakes\nregion as a whole.\nThe need to stabilize the political situation in that\ncountry is strictly linked to the future prospects of the\nongoing political stabilization in neighbouring Rwanda,\nwhere mankind has recently witnessed horrible crimes and\nthe untold suffering of innocent civilians. No one would\nwish to see it repeated ever again.\nGiven what the Secretary-General in his annual report\ndescribes as the\n\u201ccombination of ethnic polarization in Burundi and\nRwanda, massive circulation of arms, porous borders\nand transborder movements of refugees\u201d (A/50/1,\npara. 888),\npolitical settlement in either country, coupled with the\nearly return of refugees and displaced persons, is vital to\navert a greater tragedy in the Great Lakes region. My\nGovernment therefore urges all the parties concerned to\nwork towards this noble goal.\nWith regard to Liberia, my delegation welcomes the\nentry into force of the cease-fire on 26 August as a result\nof an earlier agreement by the Liberian factional leaders.\nSimilarly, we view the swearing in of the State Council\non 1 September 1995 as an important contribution to\npeace in that country. We believe that with tolerance and\ncooperation among the parties, elections in Liberia can\ntake place within a year as the first step towards a lasting\npeace and tranquillity in that country.\nThe prospects for peace in Liberia open new hopes\nfor the settlement of the conflict in neighbouring Sierra\nLeone. My delegation encourages the parties concerned to\nwork together in the search for a negotiated settlement\nwith a view to bringing about a lasting peace and\ntranquillity in that country.\nIn the Middle East, we welcomed last year, the\nimplementation of the Peace Accords between Israel and\nthe PLO, which resulted in autonomy for Gaza and\nJericho. Today, we note with satisfaction that further\nprogress has been made in this peace process, culminating\nin the recent signing in Washington of new and promising\nagreements between the parties. This is, indeed, a step\nforward which we must encourage and support. My\nGovernment looks forward to similar progress in future\nnegotiations on outstanding issues, including the Golan\nHeights, the status of Jerusalem, and other equally\nimportant issues for the final settlement of the deep-\nrooted conflict in the Middle East.\nThe situation in East Timor continues to be a matter\nof concern to my Government. In this context, my\ndelegation takes note of the Secretary-General\u2019s\nassessment of the progress made so far in the negotiations\nbetween Portugal and Indonesia with a view to finding a\npolitical settlement to the conflict in that country. It is our\nhope that the forthcoming ministerial meeting scheduled\nto take place in London in January 1996 will lead to\nmeaningful results.\nDialogue, not war or use of force, is the best choice\nfor solving conflicts. It is through dialogue that nations\nand peoples of the world can effectively promote the\ninternational peace and security for which we are all\nlonging in the years ahead. Therefore, dialogue must be\n21\n\n\nfurther encouraged and supported wherever it is sought, be\nit in the countries of the former Yugoslavia, Somalia or\nelsewhere around the globe.\nOn the threshold of the twenty-first century, the quest\nfor peace and economic development must be viewed\nwithin the context of the principles enunciated by the\nSecretary-General in his report entitled \u201cAn Agenda for\nDevelopment: recommendations\u201d, where he rightly\nunderlines that development, in its numerous dimensions,\n\u201cshould be recognized as the foremost and most far-\nreaching task of our time.\u201d (A/49/665, para. 4)\nDuring the last few years the developing countries in\ngeneral, and the least developed countries in particular, in\nspite of the existing hurdles, have made significant\nprogress in their continued struggle to reverse economic\nand social stagnation. Within this framework, they have\nundertaken far-reaching political and socio-economic\nchanges through the implementation of tough structural-\nadjustment programmes, the promotion of human rights\nand fundamental freedoms and good governance. In\naddition to renewed commitments to conflict resolution,\npeace-keeping and post-conflict peace-building\nmechanisms, the efforts undertaken by developing\ncountries should be supported and encouraged by the\ninternational community if we are to succeed in our\ncommon endeavours for peace and development in our\nrespective countries.\nAs indicated by the President of the General\nAssembly in his inaugural address, quoting Pope Paul VI,\n\u201cDevelopment is the new name for peace.\u201d (Official\nRecords of the General Assembly, Fiftieth Session,\nPlenary Meetings, 1st meeting, p. 9)\nAll peoples and nations of the world must be committed\nto peace and development and pursue them with\ndetermination in the new international setting if we are to\nbuild a better and safer world for all. This is our\nchallenge for the next century.\n"

        "file_text": "\nAt the outset, it gives me great pleasure to congratulate\nHis Excellency Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral on his\nelection to the presidency of this historic fiftieth session of\nthe General Assembly. His election reflects the esteem in\nwhich Member States hold his country, the friendly country\nof Portugal, and the confidence that his diplomatic talents\nwill make possible the successful culmination of the work\nof this important session.\nI should also like to express my delegation\u2019s esteem\nfor his predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Amara Essy, for\nthe competent way in which he conducted the work of the\nforty-ninth session.\nIt is also my pleasure to express Qatar\u2019s full\nconfidence in and esteem for the Secretary-General, Mr.\nBoutros Boutros-Ghali. In fact, he is doing a great deal to\nserve this international Organization, and has been\nextremely assiduous in implementing its noble principles\nand strengthening its role in the maintenance of\ninternational peace and security.\nI should like to congratulate the Member States that\nhave recently joined the Organization. We hope that those\nStates will be active participants in and will contribute\nconstructively to the activities of the United Nations and to\nthe defence of its principles.\nThis fiftieth session is being held at a historic and\ncomplex turning point in history, where extreme complexity\ncharacterizes the concepts relating to international relations.\nThese concepts, because of their diversity and the erratic\ncourse they follow, create a number of serious difficulties\nand obstacles that face the emergence of the desired\ninternational order. All this has taken concrete form in the\nresurgence of inter-ethnic and inter-racial extremist conflicts\nthat threaten the very foundations of international society,\nwhich should continue to be based on tolerance and the\nprinciples and values of the United Nations. Hence the need\nto redouble our efforts to put an end to such conflicts and\nto contain their consequences and the threats they pose to\nthe international community. While expressing our\nappreciation for the efforts that have been made by this\nOrganization to cope with the deplorable events that have\ntaken place in Somalia, Rwanda, Burundi and Bosnia and\nHerzegovina, we are mindful of the difficulties that\nobstruct such efforts and make it difficult for the\nOrganization to find the desired solutions to those\nproblems.\n\nOn top of all this, it is patently clear that the\nSecurity Council, which has adopted pertinent resolutions\nto solve these problems, has come face to face with\nobstacles that hampered the achievement of the desired\nsolutions. The continued presence of such obstacles has\naffected the credibility and standing of the United\nNations. In the post-cold-war period, the United Nations\nhas been put to the test in the areas of peace-keeping and\nthe maintenance of international peace and security.\nHence the urgent need during this fiftieth anniversary to\nmake every effort to fundamentally reform the United\nNations to enhance its effectiveness and its standing. I\nthink we all aspire to the goal of reforming the United\nNations, and my country attaches particular importance to\nit; it would strengthen the effectiveness of the\ninternational Organization and enhance its image.\nWe know that the obstacles facing the Security\nCouncil have been the reason behind the demand for\nreforming that principal organ with the Charter\nresponsibility for the maintenance of international peace\nand security. A high priority is given to this reform of the\nSecurity Council which tops the list of the desired\nreforms of the United Nations. As for the State of Qatar,\nit attaches particular importance to efforts to reform the\nCouncil and to increase its membership proportionately\nwith the increased membership of the United Nations\nitself. We must also bear in mind the need to increase the\nnumber of permanent seats to ensure balanced\nrepresentation. The great challenge the international\ncommunity faces as it strives to reform the Security\nCouncil is to achieve a balanced membership and to\nensure that the changes will make for increased\neffectiveness. We should also speed up reform of the\nworking methods and procedures of the Security Council.\nWe must review the right of veto and rein in its use as\nthat right has frequently been used against the interests of\nthe international community and in favour of individual\nStates.\nProceeding from its conviction that international\npeace can be achieved only through disarmament and\nrestraining the arms race, particularly with respect to\n18\n\n\nweapons of mass destruction and that halting the\nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction is one of the\nmost important foundations of international peace and\nsecurity, the State of Qatar welcomed the Convention on\nthe Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling\nand Use of Chemical Weapons and on Their Destruction,\nand supported the extension of the Treaty on the Non-\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), even if it\nconsiders that the indefinite extension of the Treaty will\nnever achieve the desired result unless all States accede to\nit. We therefore hope that all the States which have not yet\nacceded to the Treaty will do so.\nQatar continues to believe that Israel should accede to\nthe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons\nand should place its nuclear installations under the\nsafeguards regime of the International Atomic Energy\nAgency (IAEA) as a prelude to the implementation of the\nGeneral Assembly\u2019s resolution establishing a nuclear-\nweapon-free zone in the Middle East. This would contribute\nto equitable, balanced peace and stability in that vital region\nof the world.\nSince His Highness Sheikh Khalifa Bin Hamad Al-\nThani became Emir, he has stressed Qatar\u2019s adherence to\nits regional and international obligations, and has\nemphasized that Qatar will act through international and\nregional organizations in strengthening international peace\nand security. By joining our brethren in the Gulf\nCooperation Council, we have set a course towards the\nachievement of the noble goals that reflect the aspirations\nof the peoples of the Gulf after peace, stability, cooperation\nand prosperity.\nThe security of the Gulf is one of the major concerns\nof its peoples. Our region has witnessed two major wars,\nduring which our peoples have made great sacrifices that\nhave taken the shape of financial burdens which we\ncontinue to shoulder at a time when we move towards\ndevelopment and modernization. We are determined to\novercome the negative effects of those two wars and to\nspare the region any further conflict. Moreover, Qatar is\nmaking efforts to establish good relations with all States of\nthe region on the basis of good-neighbourliness, mutual\nrespect, non-interference in the internal affairs of others,\nrespect for international legality, and the settlement of\nproblems by peaceful means through dialogue, mediation or\nrecourse to the International Court of Justice.\nProceeding from this, we support resolution of the\ndispute between the United Arab Emirates and the Islamic\nRepublic of Iran with respect to the three islands by\npeaceful means.\nWith regard to Iraq, our position remains unchanged:\nIraq\u2019s unity and territorial integrity must be preserved.\nIraq must implement all Security Council resolutions.\nIraq\u2019s recognition of the sovereignty and territorial\nintegrity of the State of Kuwait, and of its international\nboundaries, in accordance with Security Council\nresolution 833 (1993) is a very important step in the right\ndirection towards full implementation of all Security\nCouncil resolutions, a fact that should speed up the\nmitigation of the suffering of the brotherly Iraqi people\nwho continue to face an acute shortage of essential goods,\nespecially foods and medicine.\nInspired by the guidelines established by His\nHighness Sheikh Khalifa Bin Hamad Al Thani, Qatar has\nbeen participating, to the best of its financial and human\nabilities, in addressing the major issues of the Gulf region\nand of our Arab and Islamic nation. Qatar, therefore, fully\nsupports the activities of the Gulf Cooperation Council,\nwhich are in the interest of the well-being of all our\npeoples. It is our hope that security and stability will soon\nreign in our region, for this is an integral part of the\nsecurity and stability of the Middle East at large. To that\nend, Qatar is continuing its good offices and its efforts to\nimprove the situation in the Arab world and to\nconsolidate Arab solidarity, which will make it possible\nfor the nation to pursue its special role in the history of\ncivilization.\nIt is on the basis of these principles that we have\nwelcomed the Middle East peace process. We hope that\nit will prove successful and that it will at long last bring\na just and lasting peace to the region and lead to Israel\u2019s\ncomplete withdrawal from all the occupied Arab and\nPalestinian territories, including the Golan Heights,\nsouthern Lebanon and, particularly, Al-Quds Al-Sharif.\nThis will make it possible for the Palestinian people to\nregain its right to establish a State of its own, on its own\nsoil, with Al-Quds as its capital.\nQatar welcomes the expanded autonomy of the\nPalestinians under the agreement signed last Thursday at\nWashington between the Palestinians and the Israelis. We\nhope this agreement will open the doors that lead to peace\nand stability in the region and will prove to be an\nimportant step towards full implementation of the\nDeclaration of Principles signed by the two parties in\nSeptember 1993.\n19\n\n\nBy the same token, Qatar wishes to voice its deep\nconcern at the fact that talks between Syria and Israel are\nlagging behind. We hope for substantial progress on that\ntrack so that the Israeli occupation of the Syrian Arab\nGolan may come to an end. We hope also that there will be\nprogress on the Lebanese-Israeli track, so that southern\nLebanon may be freed from the Israeli presence under\nwhich it has been the victim of much aggression and\noppression.\nIt is our hope that a just and lasting peace will be\nestablished on the basis of the Madrid formula and the\nrelevant Security Council resolutions 242 (1967), 338\n(1973) and 425 (1978) and on the basis of the land-for-\npeace formula. We therefore call on the General Assembly\nto reaffirm all prior resolutions on the question of Palestine\nand the situation in the Middle East, so that the goal of a\njust, comprehensive peace can be achieved.\nMy Government follows with great concern\ndevelopments in Afghanistan, Somalia and Chechnya. We\nappeal for the intensification of international efforts to bring\npeace, justice and stability to those areas.\nWe also reaffirm \u2014 as we have frequently done, both\nofficially and in public statements \u2014 our solidarity with the\npeople of Bosnia and Herzegovina. We are concerned over\nthe continuing bloodshed, four years after the outbreak of\nthe war. Together with many other States, we have\ndeplored the savage practices of ethnic cleansing pursued\nby the Serbian forces under the eyes of the entire world.\nThose practices are totally against the most elementary\nrules and norms of humanitarian law and the Charter of the\nUnited Nations.\nWe welcome the military action undertaken by the\nNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), in cooperation\nwith the forces of the United Nations, to put an end to\nSerbian aggression. We hope that those measures of\ndeterrence will make it possible for peace to be achieved at\nlong last and that the international community will take a\nvery firm and resolute stand, both through the United\nNations and through the major Powers that are actively\ninvolved, to guarantee the safety of the people of Bosnia\nand Herzegovina. By the same token, we hope that the\nweapons embargo will be lifted, in order for these people\nto defend themselves, to preserve the independence of their\ncountry and to ensure the triumph of the principles of the\nCharter. The Serbian barbarity they have endured has\nengulfed even the safe areas.\nQatar also supports the stance of the Contact Group\nof the Organization of the Islamic Conference, which\ndeems the embargo on weapons to be illegal and supports\nthe fraternal Muslim people of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\nWe are now at a critical stage in the conflict in the\nformer Yugoslavia. The international community must, of\nnecessity, act to restore a just peace in the Republic of\nBosnia and Herzegovina and to ensure that that country\nmay enjoy stability, sovereignty, independence and\nterritorial integrity and get down to the business of\neconomic and social development. We hope that the\nSerbian war criminals will be duly tried and that this will\nbe a lesson to all such criminals.\nQatar is profoundly convinced that peace and\ndevelopment follow the same path, that development is as\nnecessary for the international community as is peace. It\nis possible to ensure continuous development only if there\nis peace, and vice-versa. Since sustainable and long-term\ndevelopment is one of the cornerstones of genuine peace,\nit is a high priority for the United Nations and the\ninternational community to focus on development,\nparticularly in the developing countries.\nA commitment to development in all its aspects is,\nindeed, the very bedrock of the international economic\norder \u2014 the new order that we all look forward to and\nhope that it will be based essentially on interdependence.\nThe international community has already started to move\nin that direction, through the General Agreement on\nTariffs and Trade and the establishment of the World\nTrade Organization. This will help to strengthen the\nmultilateral trade system, which is based on the\nliberalization and expansion of international trade.\nAs confirmation of this, His Highness the Emir of\nthe State of Qatar has extolled the merit, from Qatar\u2019s\npoint of view, of particular political groups, saying that,\ndespite the fact that ours is a small country, we are trying\nto react favourably to the new international situation in\norder to find our proper place in it. We are also taking\naction to strengthen the ways and means available to us,\nfor the achievement of that goal.\nOur economic objectives are the following: to\nexploit our own natural wealth; to export our products on\nthe best possible terms; to strengthen our industrial base\nby consolidating and developing our current industries\nand by creating new ones on the basis of our natural\nresources, particularly petroleum and gas; to strengthen\nand encourage investment in all areas, making it possible\nfor private capital to be involved in economic\n20\n\n\ndevelopment; and to emphasize infrastructure projects, as\nthese are the main requirements for socio-economic\ndevelopment.\nAll this highlights the reason why we attach such\nimportance to economic and social development as a\nmainstay of international peace and security. That is why\ndevelopment has become a common goal for the\ninternational community. Having taken shape in a number\nof international conferences, it should be adopted by all the\nnations of the world. We attach particular importance to the\nresults of the conferences that have been held in recent\nyears in the context of the importance accorded by the\ninternational community to this common goal, namely, the\nUnited Nations Conference on Environment and\nDevelopment, in Rio de Janeiro; the International\nConference on Population and Development, in Cairo; the\nWorld Summit for Social Development, in Copenhagen;\nand the Fourth World Conference on Women, held in\nBeijing, to emphasize the role of women in development\nwith due consideration of the cultural differences between\npeoples and the various noble ideals of the Islamic faith.\nIt is our hope that the matters that were debated will\nnot be used as a pretext for interference in the internal\naffairs of other States or as justification for discriminatory\ntreatment and the imposition of conditions on the provision\nof economic assistance or development aid.\nI should like to refer in this context to the tendency to\nimpose, unilaterally or collectively, a carbon tax, for the\npurpose, it is alleged, of protecting the environment. The\ntruth of the matter is that the tax is a purely economic\nmeasure, which will impact negatively on the economies of\nthe petroleum-exporting countries, particularly the Gulf\nStates.\nThe threats that face mankind at present and will\ncontinue to do so in the future are not all political or\nmilitary. Such threats as the deterioration of the\nenvironment on a global scale, poverty, underdevelopment,\ndrugs, epidemics of fatal diseases, terrorism and violations\nof human rights which are becoming more and more\nserious day by day, are not of a military or political nature.\nRegardless, they need to be addressed urgently and global\nsolutions have to be found for them if they are not to\nbecome untreatable and threaten all humanity.\nIn just a few days we shall be celebrating the fiftieth\nanniversary of the United Nations. This is an extremely\nimportant occasion, reflecting as it does a genuine desire on\nthe part of the peoples of the world to preserve the United\nNations as a strong and active Organization whose\npurpose is to achieve noble goals and safeguard the future\nof mankind. As we celebrate the anniversary, at the\nthreshold of the twenty-first century, it is our hope that\nwe shall build a new United Nations that will lead us in\nthe direction of a new world of genuine peace, security,\nunder an effective international order that would\nguarantee the well-being of all people and preserve the\ndignity of man, a world where the strong will not\ndominate the weak or the rich exploit the poor; a world\nwhere tolerance and well-being would not be far-fetched\ndreams.\nIf we mobilize the full potential of mankind we shall\nbe able, under the guidance of the United Nations and its\nagencies, to usher in such a brave new world.\n"

        "file_text": "It is\na privilege to speak to the General Assembly today on\nbehalf of the United States.\nA half-century ago the General Assembly first met\nhere in New York, across the river in a converted skating\nrink at Flushing Meadows. In those modest surroundings\nour predecessors began to put in place an ambitious\nframework that they hoped would keep the peace as\nsuccessfully as they had prosecuted the war.\nIn the years since, the United Nations has helped\nbring peace, prosperity and hope to countless people\naround the world. Technological change has brought\nnations closer together than the founders of the United\n9\n\n\nNations could possibly have foreseen. The United Nations\nitself has been challenged in unforeseen ways. It has had to\nmanage complex humanitarian emergencies, from civil wars\nto mass movements of refugees to health epidemics. This\nevolution has placed great strains on the Organization and\nhas revealed the necessity for far-reaching changes in how\nit is run.\nThe Clinton Administration has vigorously made the\ncase to our Congress and our people for continued\nAmerican leadership at the United Nations. The United\nStates made a commitment to the United Nations Charter\n50 years ago, and we are determined to keep our\ncommitment, including our financial obligations.\nWe will always remember that for millions of people\naround the world, the United Nations is far from a faceless\ninstitution. It is, as Harry Truman once said,\n\u201ca case of food, a box of school books; it is a doctor\nwho vaccinates children; it is an expert who shows\npeople how to raise more rice and more wheat.\u201d\nTo millions more around the world, it is the difference\nbetween peace and war.\nEconomic and social development, as well as the\nprotection of human rights, remain central to the United\nNations mission. But the United Nations must change to\nmeet new needs more effectively. When money is wasted\nin New York, Geneva or Vienna, when time is lost in\nbureaucratic inertia, the people who pay the price are those\nmost vulnerable to famine, disease and violence.\nIt is time to recognize that the United Nations must\ndirect its limited resources to the world\u2019s highest priorities,\nfocusing on the tasks that it performs the best. The United\nNations bureaucracy should be smaller, with a clear\norganizational structure and sharp lines of responsibility.\nEach programme must be held to a single simple standard:\nit must make a tangible contribution to the freedom,\nsecurity and well-being of real people in the real world.\nIn the last year, under the leadership of Secretary-\nGeneral Boutros-Ghali, the groundwork for substantial\nchange has been laid. The United Nations has an office\nwith the functions of an inspector general and a mandate to\ncrack down on waste and fraud. Under-Secretary-General\nJoe Connor has embarked on an aggressive campaign to\nimprove the United Nations management culture, and we\nfully support his good work. The United Nations Secretariat\nhas moved in the right direction by submitting a budget that\nbegins to restrain spending, and now this momentum for\nreform must accelerate.\nLet me propose a brief, concrete agenda for reform.\nFirst, we must end United Nations programmes that\nhave achieved their purpose, and we must consolidate\nprogrammes that overlap, especially in the economic and\nsocial agencies. The United Nations has more than a\ndozen organizations responsible for development,\nemergency response and statistical reporting. We should\nconsider establishing a single agency for each of these\nfunctions. We should downsize the United Nations\nregional economic commissions. We should ensure that\nthe functions of the United Nations Conference on Trade\nand Development do not duplicate those of the new\nWorld Trade Organization (WTO), and we should adopt\na moratorium on big United Nations conferences once the\npresent series is completed, concentrating instead on\nmeeting the commitments of those conferences that we\nhave already held.\nSecondly, we need to streamline the United Nations\nSecretariat to make it more efficient, accountable and\ntransparent. Each part of the United Nations system\nshould be subject to the scrutiny of an inspector general.\nThe United Nations must not tolerate ethical or financial\nabuses, and its managers should be appointed and\npromoted on the basis of merit.\nThirdly, we should rigorously scrutinize proposals\nfor new and extended peace-keeping missions, and we\nshould improve the United Nations ability to respond\nrapidly when new missions are approved. We must agree\non an equitable scale of peace-keeping assessments that\nreflects fully today\u2019s economic realities. And we should\nhave a unified budget for peace-keeping operations.\nFinally, we must maintain the effectiveness of the\nSecurity Council. Germany and Japan should become\npermanent members, and we should ensure that all the\nworld\u2019s regions are fairly represented, without making the\nCouncil too large and unwieldy.\nWe welcome the formation of the high-level group\non reform, initiated under the leadership of the outgoing\nPresident of the General Assembly, Mr. Essy. Our goal\nmust be that of a practical blueprint for United Nations\nreform and to ensure that it is adopted before the General\nAssembly finishes the work of its fiftieth session next\nfall. The way forward is clear; we have already seen and\n10\n\n\nstudied countless studies and reports. Now the time has\ncome to act on the best proposals.\nAs the Assembly knows, in my country there have\nbeen serious efforts to curtail our support for the United\nNations. The President and I, and our entire Administration,\nbelieve it would be reckless to turn away from an\nOrganization that helps mobilize the support of other\nnations for goals that are consistent with American and\nglobal interests. But to sustain support for the United\nNations among the American people and among the people\nof other nations, it is not enough that we defend the\ninstitution. The best argument against retreat is further\nreform. Tangible progress in that direction will help us win\nthe battle for United Nations support that we are waging in\nthe United States.\nThe United Nations must emerge from the reform\nprocess better able to meet its fundamental goals, including\nthe preservation of peace and security. From Korea to the\nPersian Gulf to Haiti, the United Nations has provided a\nmandate to its Members as they carried out their\nresponsibilities. The United Nations own Blue Helmets\nhave helped nations create the basic conditions of peace in\nsome of the most difficult situations imaginable around the\nworld, even though they have not always achieved their\nintended purpose.\nRecently, a young Haitian father was asked what the\npeace-keeping forces had achieved in his country. He\nanswered,\n\u201cWe walk freely. We sleep quietly. There are no\nmen who come for us in the night.\u201d\nIn Haiti, as, for example, in Cambodia, Mozambique and El\nSalvador, the United Nations has shown that peace-keeping,\ndespite its limitations, has been an enormously useful\ninstrument.\nOne region where United Nations forces and the\ninternational community have played a critical role is the\nMiddle East. Another historic milestone will be marked this\nThursday, in Washington, when Israel and the Palestinians\nsign their agreement to implement phase two of the\nDeclaration of Principles. That agreement will bring to life\na goal first set many years ago in the Camp David accords:\nto protect Israel\u2019s security and to give Palestinians\nthroughout the West Bank control over their daily lives.\nThe international community and the United Nations must\ncontinue to support this process, both diplomatically and\neconomically.\nThere is no question that the United Nations has\nnever undertaken a mission more difficult than the one in\nthe former Yugoslavia. The limitations of that mission are\nall too well known, but we all must recognize that it has\nprovided relief for hundreds of thousands of people and\nhas saved literally thousands of lives. Today, diplomacy\nbacked by force has given the United States and the\ninternational community an opportunity to move forward\non a track that is producing genuinely hopeful results. The\nUnited Nations and the North Atlantic Treaty\nOrganization (NATO) are working effectively together to\ntry to bring peace to the region. On 8 September in\nGeneva, the parties to the conflict accepted the\nfundamental goal that the Security Council has often\nexpressed: the continuation of the Republic of Bosnia and\nHerzegovina as a single State within its internationally\nrecognized borders. I will be meeting with the Foreign\nMinisters of Bosnia, Croatia and Serbia later today, and\nat that time I will urge them \u2014 implore them \u2014 to\nmaintain the momentum towards peace and to establish\nconstitutional structures for Bosnia.\nThe framers of the Charter of the United Nations\ncreated this institution to meet threats to peace and\nsecurity posed by aggression and armed conflict. Those\nthreats are still, unfortunately, very much with us. But\ntoday, the world also faces a new set of security\nchallenges, including proliferation, terrorism, international\ncrime and narcotics, as well as the far-reaching\nconsequences of damage to the environment. These have\nassumed a new and dangerous scope in a more\ninterdependent world. As President Clinton said in San\nFrancisco in June, the\n\u201cnew forces of integration carry within them the\nseeds of disintegration and destruction\u201d.\nWhile, as I said earlier, new technologies have\nbrought us closer together, they also have made it easier\nfor terrorists, drug dealers and other international\ncriminals to acquire weapons of mass destruction, to set\nup cocaine cartels and to hide their ill-gotten gains. The\ncollapse of communism has shattered dictatorships, to be\nsure, but it has also left the political and legal institutions\nof newly liberated nations even more vulnerable to those\nwho seek to subvert them.\nAlthough these threats are sometimes sponsored by\nStates, they increasingly follow no flag. Each of us must\nvigorously fight these enemies on our own, but we will\nnever be truly secure until we effectively fight them\ntogether. That is the new security challenge for the global\n11\n\n\ncommunity, and it must be the new security mission for the\nUnited Nations.\nThere is no single area in which the United Nations\ncan make a more significant contribution than in that of\nnon-proliferation. Fifty years ago, the United States was the\nonly country capable of making a nuclear bomb. Today\nmany countries have the technology that would enable them\nto turn a fist-sized chunk of plutonium into a bomb as\nsmall as a suitcase. That is one reason why more than 170\nnations agreed, at a conference held here last May and\neffectively chaired by Ambassador Dhanapala, to extend for\nall time the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\nWeapons. That is an achievement we must rejoice in but\nalso build on.\nI should like to outline some steps in the field of\nnon-proliferation. First, we should have a comprehensive\ntest-ban treaty ready for signature by the time we meet here\nnext September. As President Clinton announced last\nmonth, the United States is committed to a true zero-yield\ntest ban. We urge other nations to join us in that\ncommitment.\nSecondly, we should immediately start negotiations on\na fissile material cut-off treaty. Those who have been most\nvocal in calling for nuclear disarmament should recognize\nthat it is essential to ban future production of fissile\nmaterial for nuclear weapons.\nThirdly, we should push forward with the historic\nreductions of the nuclear arsenals of the United States and\ncountries of the former Soviet Union. I call on the United\nStates Senate, as well as on the Russian Duma, to approve\nthe treaty on further reduction and limitation of strategic\noffensive arms (START II) so that we can lock in deep cuts\nin our strategic nuclear arsenals. In addition, Presidents\nClinton and Yeltsin are working together to ensure the\nsafety, transparency and irreversibility of nuclear-arms\nreductions.\nAs part of this process, President Yeltsin will host a\nnuclear safety and security summit in Moscow next spring.\nThis summit should have a very ambitious agenda,\nincluding a declaration of principles on nuclear safety. We\nlook to this summit to address the worldwide problems of\nnuclear-waste management, including those of ocean\ndumping. The summit should also promote a plan of action\nto safeguard nuclear materials, a plan that should include\nnew measures to prevent criminals and terrorists from\nacquiring nuclear materials for use in weapons.\nFinally, we should push for the earliest possible\nentry into force of the Chemical Weapons Convention.\nPresident Clinton has urged the United States Senate to\nact promptly on its ratification, and to stop holding the\nSTART II Treaty and the Chemical Weapons Convention\nhostage to unrelated issues. The world has witnessed the\neffects of poison gas too many times in this century \u2014 on\nEuropean battlefields during the First World War, in\nEthiopia and Manchuria during the 1930s, and against\nIranian soldiers and innocent Kurdish civilians in the\n1980s. The Chemical Weapons Convention will make\nevery nation safer, and we need it now.\nThe United Nations is also playing an invaluable\nrole in focusing attention on pressing regional\nproliferation problems. In Iraq, the United Nations Special\nCommission (UNSCOM) and its Chairman, Rolf Ekeus,\ncontinue to uncover horrific details about Saddam\nHussein\u2019s weapons of mass destruction.\nUnder Saddam Hussein, Iraq developed a deadly\nbiological-weapons capacity hidden from view. It was\nconducting research to turn some of the most toxic\nsubstances known to man into weapons of war. We know\nthat Saddam succeeded in putting anthrax and botulism in\nbombs and missile warheads. In December 1990, he\ndeployed these weapons, with every intention of using\nthem against the international coalition and innocent\ncivilians. He was dissuaded from doing so only by the\nsteadfast determination of the United States and the\ninternational community.\nIn the light of what Ambassador Ekeus has\nuncovered in Iraq, we can conclude only that for the last\nfour and a half years, Saddam Hussein has lied about the\nfull scope of Iraq\u2019s weapons programmes. There should\nbe no easing of the sanctions regime against Iraq until its\nGovernment complies with all the demands of the\nSecurity Council and clearly demonstrates that it has\nchanged its ways.\nThe United Nations should also promote\nresponsibility and restraint in the transfer of conventional\nweapons. At last year\u2019s session of the General Assembly,\nPresident Clinton proposed, and the Assembly approved,\nthe eventual elimination of anti-personnel mines. On my\nrecent trip to Cambodia, I saw the terrible damage these\nhidden killers can do. This year, we will again call on\nother countries to join us in putting an end to the export\nof land-mines.\n12\n\n\nTwo years ago, President Clinton called on the\ninternational community to devise a true international\nsystem governing the transfer of conventional weapons and\nsensitive dual-use technologies. I am pleased that the\nRussian Federation has joined with the United States and 26\nother countries to agree on a common principle to control\nthe build-up of dangerous conventional arms. We hope to\nactivate this global regime, which is called the New Forum,\nby the end of this year.\nThe proliferation of weapons worldwide has added a\ndisturbing dimension to another threat we all face: the\nthreat of international terrorism. Indeed, this year\u2019s sarin\ngas attack in Tokyo is a grim warning of what can happen\nwhen terrorists acquire weapons of mass destruction.\nMore nations are joining the fight against those\nindividuals and groups that attack civilians for political\nends. The United Nations has supported this effort in\nimportant ways. The Security Council recognized the\nimportance of countering State-sponsored terrorism by\nimposing sanctions against Libya for the bombing of Pan\nAm 103 and UTA 772.\nTerrorists must be treated as criminals and there must\nbe no place where they can hide from the consequences of\ntheir acts. States that sponsor terrorists should feel the full\nweight of sanctions that can be imposed by the international\ncommunity. Let us not deceive ourselves: every dollar that\ngoes into the Government coffers of a State-sponsor of\nterrorism such as Iran helps pay for a terrorist\u2019s bullets or\nbombs. Iran\u2019s role as the foremost State-sponsor of\nterrorism makes its secret quest for weapons of mass\ndestruction even more alarming. We must stand together to\nprevent Iran from acquiring such threatening capabilities.\nThe United States has taken a leading role in meeting\nthe international terrorist threat. We have intensified our\nsanctions against Iran. Last January President Clinton issued\nan Executive Order prohibiting financial transactions with\nterrorist groups and individuals that threaten the Middle\nEast peace process. We are urging our Congress to tighten\nour immigration and criminal laws to keep terrorists on the\nrun or put them behind bars.\nThe United States strongly supports the counter-\nterrorism measures the G-7 and Russia announced at the\nHalifax Summit, and we expect the G-8 Ministerial Meeting\non Terrorism in Ottawa to produce a concrete-action plan\nto implement these measures that were adopted at the\nHalifax Summit.\nOther kinds of international crime also threaten the\nsafety of our citizens and the fabric of our societies. And\nglobalization brings new and frightening dimensions to\ncrime. The threat of crime is a particular menace to\nyoung democracies. It weakens confidence in institutions,\npreys on the most vulnerable in our societies and\nundermines free-market reform.\nOf course, every country must take its own measures\nto combat these criminal threats. The Administration that\nI represent is now completing a review of our approach\nto transnational crime, a review that will lead to a\nstronger, more coordinated attack on this problem.\nTo help other States deal with criminal threats, the\nUnited States and Hungary have created the International\nLaw Enforcement Academy in Budapest to train police\nofficers and law-enforcement officials from Central\nEurope and the States of the former Soviet Union. We are\nproviding similar help bilaterally, and through the United\nNations International Drug Control Programme, to those\ncountries whose laws are challenged by international drug\ncartels.\nA particularly insidious form of crime and corruption\nis money-laundering. All nations should work together to\nimplement the recommendations of the Organization for\nEconomic Cooperation and Development (OECD) to\nattack this insidious money-laundering. The nations of this\nhemisphere should also advance the anti-money-\nlaundering initiative introduced at last December\u2019s\nSummit of the Americas. Together, we must work to\nsqueeze the dirty money out of the global financial\nsystem.\nThrough the United Nations conventions on drugs\nand crime the international community has set strong\nstandards that we must now act to enforce. We call on\nMember States which have not already joined the 1988\ndrug Convention to do so promptly, and we call on those\ncountries which have approved the Convention to move\nquickly to implement its important provisions.\nWe are also increasingly aware that damage to the\nenvironment and unsustainable population growth threaten\nthe security of our nations and the well-being of our\npeoples. Their harmful effects are evident in famines,\ninfant mortality rates, refugee crises, and ozone depletion.\nIn places like Rwanda and Somalia, for example, they\ncontribute to civil wars and emergencies that can be\nresolved only by extremely costly international\nintervention. We must carry out the commitments we\n13\n\n\nmade last year at the Cairo Conference, as well as the\nimportant commitments made at the Rio Conference three\nyears ago.\nNever have our problems around the world been more\ncomplex. It has never been more evident that these\nproblems affect all nations, developed and developing alike.\nOnly by working together can we effectively deal with the\nnew threats we all face that I have outlined here today.\nThat is why in this fiftieth anniversary year we must\nshape the United Nations agenda as if we were creating the\ninstitution anew. Just as the founders of the United Nations\ndevised a new framework to deter aggression and armed\nconflict, the United Nations, in particular the Security\nCouncil, must now assign the same priority to combating\nthe threat posed by proliferation, by terrorism, by\ninternational crime, by narcotics and by environmental\npollution. We should dedicate our efforts in the United\nNations and elsewhere to turning our global consensus\nagainst these threats into concrete and effective action. We\nmust renew and reform the United Nations not for its sake,\nbut for our own.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, I wish to\nextend to you, on behalf of the South African delegation,\nmy sincere congratulations on your election to the\npresidency of the fiftieth session of the General Assembly.\nYour election demonstrates the high regard in which the\ninternational community holds your country. I should also\nlike to express our deep gratitude to your predecessor, His\nExcellency Mr. Amara Essy, a brother from Africa and the\nForeign Minister of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, who presided over the\nforty-ninth session with great wisdom. I should also like to\nexpress to the Secretary-General, His Excellency\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, our continued confidence in\nhis guidance of the Organization.\nA half century ago representatives from 50 countries\nmet at San Francisco to draft the United Nations Charter,\nthe Declaration of Human Rights and the Statute of the\nInternational Court of Justice. For the United Nations to\nhave survived for a period of 50 years in an imperfect\nworld is indeed a milestone and a tribute to the visionary\nsteps taken half a century ago towards the creation of a\nbetter world.\nSouth Africa\u2019s involvement with the United Nations\ngoes back to the very conception and birth of this\nillustrious body. The then-Prime Minister of South Africa,\nField Marshal J. C. Smuts, helped to draft the Preamble\nto the Charter of the United Nations. In the Preamble\nmany lofty ideas were expressed, among which were the\nfollowing:\n\u201cto reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in\nthe dignity and worth of the human person, in the\nequal rights of men and women and of nations large\nand small\u201d.\nHow ironic that those in power in South Africa since\nthen, and until last year, acted in a precisely contrary\nspirit. The United Nations contributed significantly in\nbringing about change in South Africa. Through\nperseverance and commitment, the United Nations\nassisted us in our struggle to achieve democracy. Our\nGeneral Assembly 22nd plenary meeting\nFiftieth session 13 October 1995\nreward is its reward. I should like again to express the\ngratitude of both the people and the Government of South\nAfrica for its foresight and courage.\nJust over a year ago, on 23 June 1994 to be precise,\nI had the honour to address the Assembly on behalf of the\npeople and the Government of the Republic of South\nAfrica. On that occasion, which marked South Africa\u2019s\nresumption of its participation in the work of the General\nAssembly of the United Nations, we were filled with joy\nand pride at the peaceful transition of South Africa into a\nunited, non-racial, democratic and non-sexist society.\nIn the intervening months I have travelled to many\ncountries, visited with many foreign ministers and met with\nseveral Heads of State or Government. We spoke of the\nmiracle that is South Africa. We shared our thoughts and\nexperiences on the road to that miracle. In that context, we\ncontinue to encourage those who seek change for a better\nlife to stand fast in their belief.\nAs the representative of a Member of the United\nNations, I should like to reassure you of our belief in and\nsupport for the purposes and principles of the Charter of the\nOrganization.\nThe events in April 1994 in South Africa marked a\nbreak with the past as well as a commitment to the future,\nplacing a heavy burden on us. As a young democracy, we\nare ready to meet the challenge. South Africa will meet this\nchallenge with a firm commitment to the promotion of\nnational welfare, prosperity and security, with a firm\ncommitment to the strengthening of cooperation in the\npursuit of the economic development and security of the\nsouthern African subregion, with an active commitment to\npeace, stability and good governance within the African\nregion and elsewhere, with a firm commitment to South-\nSouth cooperation and with a commitment to responsible\ninternational citizenship.\nThe Southern African Development Community\n(SADC) was conceived in the struggle for freedom in\nsouthern Africa and born of the courage of its leaders in\nsetting out to create a new reality.\nThe liberation of South Africa and the end of southern\nAfrica\u2019s destabilization brought great opportunities for the\ndevelopment of our subregion. We must now translate those\nhopes into reality. In accordance with the Abuja Treaty, we\nmust transform the southern African region into one of the\nreliable building blocks on which Africa\u2019s economic\nregeneration will be built.\nOur greatest need today is to eradicate the scourge\nof poverty afflicting the great mass of our people. Only\nthen can we fulfil the dream of Africa\u2019s liberation in the\nhealth, happiness and well-being of its children.\nThe mission of SADC reflects the reality that\nsouthern Africa has long since passed the stage of\nlamenting the privations of the past. The challenge is to\nfind within ourselves the resources to overcome this\nlegacy, with the cooperation of the international\ncommunity. We need to adapt to the demands of a rapidly\nchanging world economy and to develop the skills needed\nto compete internationally.\nSouth Africa\u2019s main objective is to play a\nconstructive role in bringing peace and stability to the\nregion. We are totally committed to the utilization of\npreventive diplomacy, peace-keeping and peacemaking,\nthrough the use of regional and multilateral mechanisms.\nIn this context, South Africa participated with others\nin the resolution of the conflict in Lesotho and provided\nlogistical support for the elections in Mozambique. Our\nsupport for United Nations resolutions and actions\nregarding Angola and the Western Sahara should also be\nseen in that light.\nAs an elected member of the Central Organ of the\nConflict Resolution Mechanism of the Organization of\nAfrican Unity (OAU) from June 1994 to June 1995, we\nparticipated in several missions to Burundi. South Africa\nwas part of a special four-member ministerial mission\nelected to assess the nature and the scope of the Burundi\nconflict with a view to encouraging and assisting the\nBurundians to resolve their differences and end that\nconflict. We continue to participate in the Mechanism as\nan invited observer.\nIn view of the desperate situation in the former\nYugoslavia and in Rwanda, it has become imperative for\nStates to cooperate as far as possible with the respective\nad hoc criminal tribunals that have been created for those\nterritories. In that regard, my country has made available\nsome of its most talented jurists to assist.\nThese situations have demonstrated anew the real\nneed for the establishment of a permanent international\ncriminal court. This issue has been revitalized in the past\nfew years, and a window of opportunity now exists to\nfinally bring the court into existence. It is my sincere\nhope that significant progress will be made in that regard\nduring this session of the General Assembly.\n2\nGeneral Assembly 22nd plenary meeting\nFiftieth session 13 October 1995\nAs we celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the United\nNations, mankind is still faced with political instability,\ndictatorship, corruption, civil war, millions of refugees and\ninternally displaced persons, persistent economic decline\nand continued impoverishment.\nIn the past year, the international political climate has\nexperienced a succession of changes which have brought\nboth hope and a certain measure of despair to mankind.\nHope has, however, remained a beckoning beacon bringing\nabout a sense of confidence in the future. We were\nsaddened by events in Somalia, but rejoiced at the transition\nin Haiti and El Salvador. We despair at the tragedy that is\nBosnia, yet hope that the emerging signs of a solution will\ncome to fruition.\nIn this spirit, allow me to congratulate the peoples of\nIsrael and Palestine on having reached yet another landmark\nin their journey towards a lasting settlement. We encourage\nand support the Middle East peace process.\nThe issues of proliferation and disarmament, in\nparticular nuclear disarmament, are among the major\nquestions that have been facing the international community\nin recent times. At the historic 1995 Review and Extension\nConference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), all those present\nagreed to exercise the utmost restraint pending the entry\ninto force of a comprehensive test-ban treaty. We are of the\nview that the recent tests conducted by two nuclear-weapon\nStates are retrogressive steps in the international\ncommunity\u2019s endeavour to ban nuclear testing. We believe\nthat these tests will negatively affect the outcome of work\non a comprehensive test-ban treaty. The South African\nGovernment is strongly opposed to these and any further\nnuclear tests being conducted, and calls upon those States\nto cease testing, so as to enhance international efforts\ntowards non-proliferation and disarmament. We call upon\nthem to honour both the letter and the spirit of the\nPrinciples and Objectives which they agreed to and helped\nnegotiate at the NPT Review and Extension Conference.\nSouth Africa has dismantled its nuclear capability. South\nAfrica, for its part, has proven its commitment to nuclear\ndisarmament. Now it is the turn of others to manifest a\nsimilar commitment.\nSouth Africa notes with great satisfaction the progress\nachieved thus far towards the establishment of an African\nnuclear-weapon-free zone. We have been actively involved\nin trying to find solutions to the outstanding issues, and we\ntrust that these hurdles can be overcome and the draft treaty\nof Pelindaba can receive due consideration during this\nsession of the General Assembly. The draft treaty is\nimportant as it would expand the non-nuclear-weapon\narea of the globe considerably and would be a further step\ntowards the final goal of complete nuclear disarmament.\nSouth Africa appeals to the nuclear-weapon States to\nensure that the draft treaty is concluded and the relevant\nprotocols signed.\nSince the 1986 declaration of the Zone of Peace and\nCooperation of the South Atlantic, significant progress has\nbeen made in the political, economic, scientific, technical\nand cultural spheres to further the objectives of the Zone.\nOnly relatively few obstacles remain. We hope to advance\nthis endeavour when the next meeting of participating\nnations takes place in Cape Town in March 1996.\nOn 13 September 1995 South Africa became the\nthirty-seventh State party to the Convention on the\nProhibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling\nand Use of Chemical Weapons and on Their Destruction.\nOn the same day South Africa also acceded to the\nConvention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of\nCertain Conventional Weapons Which May Be Deemed\nto Be Excessively Injurious or to Have Indiscriminate\nEffects. The ratification of the chemical weapons\nConvention again underlines the commitment of the\nGovernment of National Unity to the non-proliferation of\nweapons of mass destruction. South Africa\u2019s accession to\nthe Convention on certain conventional weapons\nunderlines my Government\u2019s commitment to the\nelimination of the suffering that is caused by the scourge\nof war. South Africa has, for this reason, decided to\nextend its moratorium on the export of land-mines by the\nintroduction of a permanent ban on the export or sale of\nlong-lived anti-personnel land-mines. Furthermore, on\n30 August 1995 the Government of National Unity\napproved the draft of a new conventional-arms-control\npolicy. A National Conventional Arms Control Committee\nhas been established and will function in accordance with\npredetermined guiding principles and criteria to ensure\nthat arms trade and transfers conform to accepted\ninternational practice.\nAs previously mentioned, the principal role of the\nUnited Nations is to safeguard international peace and\nsecurity in order to implement universal respect for\nhuman rights and to create conditions necessary for\nsustainable development. Without peace, security and\nhuman rights, sustainable development will be difficult to\nachieve. Without development and respect for human\nrights, international peace and security will continually be\nthreatened.\n3\nGeneral Assembly 22nd plenary meeting\nFiftieth session 13 October 1995\nAs President Mandela stated in 1992,\n\u201cOur common humanity transcends the oceans\nand all national boundaries. It binds us together in\ncommon cause against tyranny, to act together in\ndefence of our very humanity. Let it never be asked of\nany one of us what we did when we knew that\nanother was oppressed.\u201d\nMankind should learn to act against all tyranny in a\nunified manner through the United Nations. This should be\nour basic aim for the future.\nSouth Africa also wishes to call attention to the\nactivities of mercenaries, irrespective of their origin and\nobjectives. Their destabilizing activities cannot be tolerated.\nWe call on the international community and the United\nNations to be seized of this problem of mercenaries.\nThe women of South Africa have lived, in varying\ndegrees, under three forms of oppression, relating to race,\nto class and to gender. One of the first steps towards\ninitiating positive change in the lives of all South African\nwomen was the entrenchment of gender rights in our Bill\nof Rights. It was with much pride that the South African\ndelegation took their seats at the Fourth World Conference\non Women, in Beijing. That was the first time South Africa\nparticipated in a conference on women which focused on\nthe eradication of poverty, and equal access to education\nand to health services. South Africa is fully committed to\nimplementing the Platform for Action adopted at that\nConference, which will serve as the impetus for a world of\nequality, development and peace for all. In addition, our\nParliament has most recently approved South Africa\u2019s\nratification of the Convention on the Elimination of All\nForms of Discrimination against Women, without any\nreservations.\nYears of apartheid rule have bequeathed the\noverwhelming majority black population with a heavy\nlegacy of poverty, social disintegration and political\ncleavages based on colour and ethnic animosities. It\ntherefore became the priority task of the South African\nGovernment of National Unity to devise a national strategy\nto address this catastrophic situation. A comprehensive and\nmulti-pronged developmental strategy known as the\nReconstruction and Development Programme is now being\nimplemented. The implementation of this Programme relies\nprimarily on the mobilization of domestic resources through\nprioritization of budgetary resources, with a view to\naddressing the huge material inequalities in such areas as\neducation, health, housing, infrastructure development and\nland reform. It is a unique people-centred and people-\ndriven Programme, which seeks to translate into economic\nbenefit the political miracle in our country. At the very\nheart of this Programme is the acknowledgement of the\ninextricable interdependence between the need for\ntransparent, accountable and democratic governance of\nour society and the imperative of dynamic economic\ngrowth and sustainable development.\nSouth Africa will host the ninth United Nations\nConference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD IX)\nfrom 26 April to 11 May 1996. This is an event which all\nSouth Africans are looking forward to with great\nexpectation. Indeed, it is my pleasure to announce that\nour preparations are well advanced and on course.\nWe attach great significance to UNCTAD IX for a\nnumber of reasons. We believe that the rapid progress of\nglobalization and liberalization of the world economy has\nunderscored the relevance and importance of UNCTAD\nas a United Nations institution with a strong development\nmandate and perspective. We also believe that the\nsuccessful completion of the Uruguay Round of\nnegotiations and the resultant creation of the World Trade\nOrganization not only has stressed the validity and\nrelevance of UNCTAD, but has also reinforced the need\nto retain and strengthen UNCTAD\u2019s mandate as a policy-\noriented global intergovernmental forum on trade and\ndevelopment issues. It is a forum where a strong\npartnership for development between the developed and\nthe developing countries can, and must, be forged. While\nthere may be a need to streamline certain UNCTAD\nactivities, this should not lead to its demise. Without\nUNCTAD, our world, especially the developing world,\nwould be the poorer.\nI would like to take this opportunity to express my\nGovernment\u2019s satisfaction with the intergovernmental\nprocess at the United Nations to draw up a United\nNations Agenda for Development. We believe that the\nUnited Nations is the appropriate forum for the\nelaboration of the Agenda for Development. The Agenda\nfor Development could open great possibilities for\ndevelopment and for partnership between the developed\nand the developing countries. It is for this reason that\nSouth Africa is taking great interest in the work of the Ad\nHoc Open-ended Working Group of the General\nAssembly on an Agenda for Development.\nMy Government has been following with great\ninterest the ongoing High-level Intergovernmental\nMeeting on the Mid-term Global Review of the\n4\nGeneral Assembly 22nd plenary meeting\nFiftieth session 13 October 1995\nImplementation of the Programme of Action for the Least\nDeveloped Countries. In this connection, I join others in\ncalling on the international community to devise a global\nstrategy to effectively address the debt question confronting\nthe least developed countries, and to use innovative\nmeasures \u2014 whether it be official development aid, foreign\ndirect investment or multilateral financial assistance \u2014 to\narrest the decline of resources destined for the least\ndeveloped countries.\nI would also like to call upon the international\ncommunity to vigorously pursue measures required to\nsuccessfully implement the United Nations New Agenda for\nthe Development of Africa in the 1990s. We are pleased in\nthat regard by the progress registered during the Economic\nand Social Council\u2019s session in Geneva, especially the high-\nlevel segment, which was devoted to the aforementioned\nAgenda. Of course, the challenge before the international\ncommunity is to find adequate resources to translate this\nAgenda into tangible results. It is our hope that this issue\nwill be treated with the required urgency, given that next\nyear there will be a mid-term global review of the New\nAgenda for the Development of Africa.\nRecognizing the importance of cooperation between\ndeveloping States, South Africa has acceded to an\nagreement establishing the South Centre. The South Centre\nwill effectively operate as a policy research unit for the\nNon-Aligned Movement and the Group of 77, and will draft\npolicy-oriented position papers on issues of critical\nimportance to the South. It will, in addition to this basic\nfunction, generate ideas and proposals for consideration by\nGovernments of the South and other institutions.\nThe United Nations Conference on Environment and\nDevelopment engendered a process of environmental action\nand awareness centred on the relationship between\neconomic development and the sustainable management of\nthe environment. It is our duty to carry this process forward\nin an integrated manner and reconfirm our commitment to\nthe implementation of international agreements which seek\nto manage and preserve the world\u2019s environment.\nSouth Africa is very conscious that the capacity of\ndeveloping countries to implement sustainable\nenvironmental strategies will have to be strengthened. The\nresources pledged towards the attainment of goals set out in\nAgenda 21 will have to be made available if we are to\nsucceed in achieving the imperatives of development,\nsustainable use of the environment, and democracy in the\nworld.\nIn Africa, in particular, the ravages of drought and\nthe advances of desertification require urgent attention.\nThe global community\u2019s concern for the environment\nshould be reflected in a common approach to the\nmanifold environmental pressures threatening our global\nheritage.\nThe United Nations also has an important role to\nplay in assisting States threatened by natural or man-made\ndisasters. Preventive diplomacy can contribute towards\neliminating man-made disasters. However, the results of\nboth man-made disasters and natural disasters can be\nameliorated by effective international humanitarian\nassistance coordination through the United Nations. This\nwill naturally require more coherent programmed delivery\nand coordination by the Office of the United Nations\nHigh Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the Food\nand Agriculture Organization of the United Nations\n(FAO), the World Health Organization (WHO), the\nUnited Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF), the United\nNations Department of Humanitarian Affairs (DHA) and\nother international institutions. The United Nations will\nhave to ensure that the necessary capacities and\nmechanisms are created. Recent international action,\nespecially the follow-up to the Tokyo Conference, has\ndemonstrated that sufficient international will exists to\nperform this function.\nWe welcome the adoption on 14 September 1995 of\nGeneral Assembly resolution 49/252, on the strengthening\nof the United Nations. I wish to assure the Assembly of\nour intention to work constructively with the President in\nthis endeavour.\nThe world in which we find ourselves today is\ngreatly changed from just 10 years ago. The cold war has\nended, the scourge of apartheid has been removed from\nour common society and peace has come to Mozambique\nand now Angola. We have also seen the membership of\nour United Nations increase to 185, a substantial increase\nsince the time the Security Council\u2019s membership was last\nincreased. As a result of these, and other, factors the\ninternational community faces a window of opportunity\nwithin which the Security Council can be successfully\nrestructured and reformed.\nWithin the overall effort to reform the United\nNations, South Africa believes that the structure and\nfunctioning of the Security Council should be reformed to\nmake it more representative, democratic and transparent.\nThe product of these efforts must be a Security Council\nthat is effective and legitimate, and that reflects the\n5\nGeneral Assembly 22nd plenary meeting\nFiftieth session 13 October 1995\nrealities of our modern world. This result can be achieved\nonly if reform and restructuring is dealt with as a package.\nOne of the products of this reform process must result in\nAfrica having equitable representation on any enlarged\nSecurity Council.\nIt would be appropriate for me to conclude by\nreferring to the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations.\nThe people of South Africa will celebrate this fiftieth\nanniversary in concert with the rest of the world. Our\nNational Committee organizing the events in our country\nhas adopted the following as its Declaration of Intent:\n\u201cTo create an awareness among the peoples of South\nAfrica of the role which the United nations can play\nin their daily lives, and to assist the United Nations in\nresponding to the challenges of the twenty-first\ncentury.\u201d\nPresident Mandela looks forward to joining his fellow\nworld leaders in a few weeks\u2019 time to celebrate the\nvisionary step taken half a century ago towards the creation\nof a better world. Building on the successes and victories\nof the past, we now embrace the future. We can face the\nchallenges ahead, inspired by a vision of a new world\nwhere peace and respect for human dignity are the standard.\n"

        "file_text": "It is a great\nhonour for me to extend to you, Sir, warmest\ncongratulations, on behalf of the delegation of Trinidad and\nTobago, on your election as President of this session of the\nGeneral Assembly. The celebration of the fiftieth\nanniversary of the United Nations and the urgent need to\nrespond to a number of major questions facing the\nOrganization make this a singularly important year. We are\nconfident that with your vision and leadership you will\nguide this historic Assembly session to a successful\nconclusion.\nMy delegation would also like to express its deep\nappreciation to your predecessor, His Excellency\nMr. Amara Essy of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, for the able manner in\nwhich he presided over the forty-ninth session of the\nGeneral Assembly.\nWe are also particularly pleased to welcome the\nsmall island State of Palau as the one hundred and eighty-\nfifth Member of the United Nations.\nMost States represented in this Hall were not present\nat the historic signing of the United Nations Charter in\nSan Francisco 50 years ago, but on gaining independence\nthey applied for membership in this Organization as an\nessential part of their quest for a secure and stable\ninternational environment and improved standards of\nliving. Trinidad and Tobago, a small democratic State,\nwhich gained its independence in 1962, was no exception.\nSince 1962, when we became a Member of the\nUnited Nations, there have been profound changes in\ninternational relations and consequent increases in the\nresponsibilities of this Organization. The most dramatic of\nthese changes was the end of the cold war, which\nengendered a certain optimism that there would be an\nanticipated peace dividend which would provide impetus\nto international cooperation for development.\nUnfortunately this was not to be. The end of the cold war\ntriggered an almost unprecedented surge of ethnic and\nnationalist conflict, which proceeded to consume much of\nthe attention and resources of the international\ncommunity.\nOur Organization has had to adapt quickly to meet\nthese challenges. There was a sudden and meteoric rise in\nthe volume and, indeed, the complexity of United Nations\npeace-keeping activities. The Organization has had its\nshare of successes and disappointments. However, despite\nthe failure to meet growing expectations, the United\nNations can be justly proud of many of its achievements\nin the field of peace-keeping, in the restoration of\ndemocracy, and in its response to emergency situations.\nThe successes in Central America, Cambodia, Namibia,\nMozambique and South Africa bear ample testimony to\nthe effective role the United Nations can play in the\nadvancement of peace, justice and security.\nIn our region, the cooperation between the United\nNations and the Organization of American States in the\n9\n\n\nrestoration of the democratically elected President of Haiti\nshows what can be accomplished once the necessary\npolitical will exists in support of such actions. In this\nregard, we welcome the recently held legislative and local\nelections in Haiti, which, in spite of difficulties, saw\nthousands of Haitians assemble peacefully and safely to\ncast their ballots. We are confident that these developments\nwill serve to enhance Haiti\u2019s efforts to consolidate\ndemocracy, and will assist in the process of national\nreconciliation. The international community must continue\nto assist the Government and people of Haiti in the post-\nemergency period and in their long-term efforts to achieve\neconomic and social reconstruction.\nIn the Middle East, Trinidad and Tobago welcomes\nthe interim agreement between Israel and the Palestine\nLiberation Organization on the expansion of Palestinian\nself-rule in the West Bank, which was signed in\nWashington, D.C. on 28 September 1995. It represents\nanother significant advance in the process towards lasting\npeace in the region.\nAs for the former Yugoslavia, we are encouraged by\nthe efforts on the part of all sides in the conflict to come to\nthe negotiating table, and we express the hope that this\ndevelopment will significantly advance the process towards\npeace and stability in that war-torn region.\nOn the African continent, the spirit of reconciliation\nwhich has prevailed in some areas of conflict gives us hope\nthat some of the seemingly more intractable problems can\nalso be resolved. The international community must fulfil\nits responsibilities in assisting the process.\nEarlier this year the States parties to the Treaty on the\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons decided to extend\nthe Treaty indefinitely. The Conference also adopted a\nnumber of principles and objectives, one of which called\nfor the completion of a comprehensive nuclear-test-ban\ntreaty no later than the third quarter of 1996. It was also the\nunderstanding of the international community that there\nwould be no further nuclear tests, pending the entry into\nforce of that treaty. Trinidad and Tobago has joined other\nparties to the Tlatelolco and Rarotonga Treaties in rejecting\ncurrent nuclear testing by some nuclear-weapon States, and\nappeals to those States to heed the mounting requests to\ncease nuclear testing.\nRelated to our environmental concerns over nuclear\ntesting is the equally critical issue of the marine transport\nof irradiated nuclear fuel, plutonium and high-level\nradioactive wastes. These shipments continue to take place\ndespite the potentially catastrophic effects on small island\ndeveloping States, whose fragile and vulnerable\neconomies are overwhelmingly dependent on their marine\nand coastal resources, and who possess neither the\nresources nor the capability to deal with possible\naccidents of this nature. My delegation would therefore\nlike to reiterate the priority concern which we attach to\nthis issue, and to urge the shipment countries to respect\nthe wishes of the small island developing States and other\nen route States, which have called for an end to these\nshipments through their archipelagic and territorial waters\nas well as their exclusive economic zones.\nThe fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations will\nbe a time for reflection and re-examination of the\nactivities of the Organization, not only as they relate to\nconflict situations but, equally, in the field of\ndevelopment as a necessary precondition for peace and as\nthe best guarantee of long-term stability.\nAt the national level, Trinidad and Tobago has\nundertaken a programme of economic reform and\nrestructuring of the economy, which is almost complete.\nOur development focus has been on the pursuit of a\nsound macroeconomic policy based on a number of\nmeasures, which include a disciplined fiscal stance and\nthe consistent implementation of an orderly and broad-\nbased divestment programme, the enactment of structural\nand legislative reforms designed to provide an\nenvironment for the growth of a resilient and\ninternationally competitive private sector and one\nconducive to greater foreign investment, the liberalization\nof the trade and exchange-rate regimes aimed at\nenhancing our competitiveness and a comprehensive\nprogramme of reform of the domestic financial system.\nEmphasis has also been placed on the reform of the\npublic sector and the provision of basic infrastructure in\norder to ensure the efficient delivery of reliable, high-\nquality services, the progressive restructuring of our\neducational system so as to put in place a sustainable\nhuman-resource development programme which would\nrespond to the new challenges and needs of our\ndevelopment, and the employment of social policies\naimed at protecting the most vulnerable in our society. In\norder to succeed, however, these measures must be\ncomplemented by a supportive regional and international\nenvironment.\nFor small States, regional integration is an\nimperative, and, increasingly, regional cooperation\nsystems are seen as providing the essential building\nblocks on which to construct hemispheric and wider\n10\n\n\ninternational cooperation. At the last Conference of the\nCaribbean Community (CARICOM) Heads of Government,\nheld at Georgetown from 4 to 7 July, Trinidad and Tobago\nwas pleased to welcome Suriname as the fourteenth\nmember of the Caribbean Community.\nThe successful inaugural summit meeting of the\nAssociation of Caribbean States, which was held at Port of\nSpain from 17 to 18 August 1995, has also opened a new\nchapter in the history of cooperation among countries of the\nwider Caribbean. The adoption of the Declaration of\nPrinciples and Plan of Action on Tourism, Trade and\nTransportation provides a practical blueprint to foster\ndevelopment and enhance economic integration among all\ncountries of the Caribbean. In this context, Trinidad and\nTobago reiterates the importance we attach to the full\nreintegration of Cuba in the Western Hemisphere.\nI have already alluded to the need to achieve greater\nbalance in United Nations activities in the fields of peace-\nkeeping and development. The need for such a balance\nassumes even greater urgency when one recognizes that to\nan increasing extent the nature, scope and complexity of\ndevelopment challenges today are beyond the limits and\ncontrol of the nation State.\nTo the traditionally elusive development problems of\npersistent poverty, debilitating debt, declining levels of\nofficial development assistance, unemployment,\ndemographic pressures and the worsening income gap and\nterms of trade between developed and developing countries,\none must add the new and additional challenges of\nenvironmental degradation and globalization. Some of these\nwill continue to require a national approach, but the great\nmajority of them are beyond the limits of national action\nand thus require a common commitment, a common\napproach, and a call to global neighbourhood action.\nThe notion of shared responsibilities and the\nrecognition of the need for mechanisms for collective action\nare the raison d\u2019\u00eatre of the United Nations system. A\ncoordinated and integrated United Nations system that is\nfocused and adequately funded thus remains the best hope\nfor effectively dealing with these myriad and complex\ndevelopment challenges.\nI can think of no better way to refocus and recommit\nthe United Nations to the goals of development and global\nsecurity for all than through the formulation and\nimplementation of a comprehensive action-oriented agenda\nfor development. An agenda which continues to address\ntraditional development problems while simultaneously\ntackling the questions of protectionism, capital flows,\nreform of the international economic decision-making\nprocesses and management of the global economy must\nbe the focus of our efforts.\nAt the recent Fourth World Conference on Women\nat Beijing, the international community recognized the\ncrucial role that women play in the development process\nand acknowledged that effective international cooperation\nfor development will remain an elusive goal unless\nwomen can participate fully in the political, economic and\nsocial life of their respective societies. The Beijing\nConference, along with the other global conferences held\nat Rio, Barbados, Cairo and Copenhagen, have served to\nbuttress the case for an integrated approach to sustainable\ndevelopment, which must be informed by environmental,\nsocial, demographic, gender and human- resource\nconsiderations. The agenda for development must\ntherefore seek to implement and fulfil, in an integrated\nmanner, the commitments arising out of these\nConferences.\nWithin the agenda for development particular\nconsideration must also be given to assisting developing\ncountries, especially those with small and vulnerable\neconomies in advancing their economic transformation\nand in facilitating their greater participation in the world\neconomy.\nTrinidad and Tobago is committed to free trade and\nto placing its economy on a development path compatible\nwith the demands of the new global order. However, as\nthe challenges of globalization have demonstrated,\nnational policies are not enough. To achieve sustained\neconomic growth and sustainable development we need a\nsupportive and favourable international economic\nenvironment as well as a fair, open and non-\ndiscriminatory trading system, one which recognizes that\nsmall and vulnerable economies like our own are at a\nparticular disadvantage because of our size and the lack\nof economies of scale. No effort must therefore be spared\nto ensure that we are provided with the necessary market\naccess so critical to our trade-expansion and development\nobjectives. Indeed, to do anything less within the agenda\nfor development would be a denial of the fact that\nglobalization has now placed an even greater\nresponsibility on the major developed countries to ensure\nthat their macroeconomic policies are favourable to\ngrowth and development in the rest of the world.\nTrinidad and Tobago is also of the view that the\nagenda for development offers an opportunity to develop\n11\n\n\nthe global partnership for sustainable development and to\npromote the implementation of the agreements reached at\nthe Earth Summit at Rio de Janeiro in 1992. In this process,\nthe special situation and needs of small island developing\nStates and the recognition of their environmental\nvulnerability must receive priority attention. Trinidad and\nTobago therefore wishes to reiterate the particular\nimportance we attach to the implementation of the Barbados\nProgramme of Action for the Sustainable Development of\nSmall Island Developing States.\nIn the Caribbean, recent devastating hurricanes have\nonce again dramatically demonstrated the fragility of the\necosystems and the vulnerability of the economies of small\nislands. We are grateful to those Member States which have\njoined CARICOM countries in providing emergency\nassistance, and we appeal to the international community to\ncontinue its support for reconstruction efforts in the affected\ncountries.\nThe General Assembly will be called upon at this\nsession to make several critical decisions relating to the\nfuture of the United Nations system. Trinidad and Tobago\nis of the view that the elements of the reform exercise\ncurrently before the Assembly constitute a good basis for a\nmore effective United Nations.\nIndeed, Member States must use the momentum\nprovided by this fiftieth-anniversary session to reach an\nagreement to expand the Security Council so as to enhance\nits legitimacy and effectiveness, to resolve the critical\nfinancial situation of the United Nations, to complete an\naction-oriented and comprehensive Agenda for\nDevelopment with adequate and predictable resources for its\nimplementation, and to strike a reasonable balance between\nresources for peace-keeping and for development.\nReform, however, cannot be an end in itself. It is but\na means to an end, and it will only be meaningful if we are\nunited in the view that a strengthened and revitalized\nUnited Nations is an imperative, given the inescapable\nreality of today\u2019s global village; that the world of the future\nwill need more, not fewer, effective international\ncollaborative mechanisms to confront common threats; and\nthat the United Nations remains the only available\ninstrument for the necessary global effort required to tackle\nthese challenges.\nThe critical financial situation of the United Nations\nmust be a source of concern to all Member States. The\nSecretary-General has described with increasing urgency\nand frustration the difficulties he is facing in carrying out\nthe tasks entrusted to him because of a lack of the\nnecessary resources. The failure, in particular, of the\nlargest contributor to pay its legally assessed contributions\nhas placed the Organization on the brink of insolvency.\nThere must therefore be a greater commitment on the part\nof all Member States to meet their obligations, as well as\na greater manifestation of will to resolve the overall\nfinancial situation of the United Nations. Unless we\ndemonstrate this commitment, the paeans of praise with\nwhich we celebrate the fiftieth anniversary will have a\nvery hollow ring.\nAt this fiftieth anniversary of the Organization, let us\nrecall the opening words of the United Nations Charter:\n\u201cWe the peoples of the United Nations ... have\nresolved to combine our efforts to accomplish these\naims.\u201d\nIn a spirit of global partnership, we must renew our\nresolve, in accordance with the principles and purposes of\nthe Charter, to ensure the realization of the objectives for\nwhich the Organization was established: peace, equality,\njustice and development for all. Trinidad and Tobago\npledges to work with others to confront the challenges\nthat face our Organization as we move towards the\ntwenty-first century.\n\n"

        "file_text": " I wish to extend to the\nPresident the sincere congratulations of my delegation on\nhis election to the presidency of this historic session of\nthe General Assembly. Botswana and Portugal have\nenjoyed the best of relations over the years. It is therefore\nwith great pleasure that I assure him of Botswana\u2019s\nsupport and cooperation as he conducts the deliberations\nof this body. Let me also take this opportunity to pay a\nspecial tribute to his predecessor, my dear brother and\ncolleague the Foreign Minister of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, His\nExcellency Mr. Amara Essy, for the skilful manner in\nwhich he guided the work of the forty-ninth session. His\nwas a most successful presidency, of which, as Africans,\nwe feel proud.\nWe salute our indefatigable Secretary-General, His\nExcellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, and his team of\ndedicated staff for their selfless service to the\ninternational community at the most difficult and trying\nperiod in the history of our Organization. The Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s tenacity of purpose and his untiring efforts in\nthe search for peace are crystallized in his comprehensive\nand thought-provoking report on the work of the\nOrganization.\nFive decades ago no one could have predicted with\nany degree of certainty the future course of events in the\naftermath of the most devastating war on the face of the\nEarth. It was therefore a feat of wisdom and vision that\nthe founding fathers of our Organization accomplished\nwhen they conceived and established, from the ravages of\nthat tragic war, a global Organization that has had such a\nprofound impact on the conduct of international relations\nand diplomacy. That the Charter of the United Nations\nhas been amended only thrice in its 50 years of existence\nbears testimony to their foresight and diplomatic skill.\nThe formation of the United Nations captured the\nimagination of peoples across continents, not only because\nits Charter promised to protect succeeding generations\nfrom the scourge of war, but also because it championed\nthe right of the colonial countries and peoples to self-\ndetermination and independence, at a time when that was\nconsidered antagonistic to the national interests of the\n21\n\n\ncolonial Powers. In addition, the Organization made a\ncommitment\n\u201cto promote social progress and better standards of life\nin larger freedom\u201d.\nThis historic session of the General Assembly offers\nus a unique opportunity to evaluate the achievements and\nprogress made in the fulfilment of the ideals so brilliantly\nand boldly expressed by the founding fathers in the Charter.\nIt is time for introspection and reflection on the work of the\nOrganization and a time to institute reforms, as necessary,\nto attune the Organization to a changed world and the\nchallenges ahead.\nIt is regrettable that the military and ideological rivalry\nbetween East and West should have hamstrung the role of\nthe United Nations in the maintenance of international\npeace and security during the first four and half decades of\nits existence. Although the world was spared the possible\ndestruction that could have been visited upon it by a third\nworld war, the cold war led to the loss of many lives in\nregional conflicts across continents \u2014 on the Korean\nPeninsula and in Cambodia, Angola, Ethiopia, Mozambique,\nVietnam and the Middle East, to mention only a few. In\ncolonial countries, and in Africa in particular, the struggle\nfor self-determination and national independence was\nperceived through the prism of super-Power rivalry, which\nperception resulted in bitter liberation wars.\nThe past five years have, however, seen the birth of a\nnew era, an era of hope for the United Nations,\ncharacterized by general goodwill and cooperation in\ninternational relations. In other words, we are celebrating\n50 years of the existence of the United Nations in a new-\nfound atmosphere of relative peace and stability in the\nworld. We should therefore commit and rededicate\nourselves to the purposes and principles of the Charter as\nwe draw the road map for the Organization in the next 50\nyears.\nThe unity and resolve of the United Nations,\nparticularly as reflected in the facility with which, in the\npost-cold-war era, the Security Council takes decisions\npertaining to the maintenance of international peace and\nsecurity, has dramatically enhanced the efficacy of the\nUnited Nations, a United Nations which has been freed\nfrom the shackles of ideological confrontation. The Security\nCouncil has indeed scored remarkable successes in the\nmaintenance of international peace and security over the\npast few years. We have witnessed successes in Cambodia,\nNamibia, Mozambique, El Salvador and, more recently,\nHaiti. And this very day an agreement of great import has\nbeen signed in Washington, D.C., between Israel and the\nPalestinians.\nThis new atmosphere of international cooperation\nhas, however, not been without problems and setbacks.\nThe tragedies of Somalia, Sierra Leone and Liberia\nremain a thorn in the flesh and conscience of the\ninternational community. The internecine tribal wars in\nthe former Yugoslavia and in the Abkhaz region of\nGeorgia have remained intractable, and the traumatic civil\nwars in Afghanistan and Tajikistan continue with total\nabandon. These problems attest to the fact that all is not\nwell in international affairs. The United Nations must\nintensify current initiatives aimed at addressing these\nconflicts. The international community can never be at\npeace when part of its body politic is being ravaged by\nconflict and war.\nAs we approach the next millennium, the\nresponsibility falls on the generations that have benefited\nfrom 50 years of relative peace, 50 years of the United\nNations, to prepare the ground for an even better\nOrganization to serve future generations in the next 50\nyears and beyond. We should establish a new system of\ncollective security in which unilateralism and the\npursuance of narrow national interests for undue\nadvantage should give way to multilateralism and\ncollective responsibility in addressing international\nproblems. Complex peace-keeping operations can succeed\nonly where there is multilateral cooperation and the\npursuit of policies which can yield long-term results.\nConcerted efforts must be made to adopt consistent\ncriteria for the resolution of global problems.\nThe question of equitable representation on and\nincrease in the membership of the Security Council has\ngained currency in recent years, and for good reason. The\nUnited Nations of 50 years ago was definitely different\nfrom the United Nations of today. The number of\nMember States has swelled over the years, bringing in\ncountries of divergent national character and historical\nbackgrounds; and membership in the Security Council\nmust reflect this reality. In other words, the Security\nCouncil should be a concentrated reflection of the cultural\nand philosophical diversity represented in the General\nAssembly. After all, democracy is about numbers, and the\nUnited Nations, including the Security Council, ought to\nbe the best school for the teaching and practice of\ndemocratic principles.\n22\n\n\nWe should exercise great care, however, in addressing\nthe question of the expansion and restructuring of the\nSecurity Council, lest we create new problems in our zeal\nto solve old ones. We should guard against the Security\nCouncil\u2019s remaining or becoming an exclusive club for the\npursuance of the policies and strategic national interests of\nthe rich and powerful nations. At the same time, we should\navoid making the Security Council a big and unwieldy\nenterprise which would crumble under its own weight. We\nshould strike the right balance between equitable\nrepresentation and efficiency and effectiveness.\nThe report of the Secretary-General clearly shows that\npeace-keeping operations are very expensive. Over the past\nfive years the budget of United Nations peace-keeping\noperations has grown from an annual figure of\napproximately $600 million to a staggering projection of\n$3.6 billion by the end of this year. The United Nations\ncannot hope to sustain this kind of budgetary escalation.\nGreater attention must be given to preventive action.\nHere we agree entirely with the Secretary-General when he\nstates in the \u201cSupplement to An Agenda for Peace\u201d that\n\u201cIt is evidently better to prevent conflicts through\nearly warning, quiet diplomacy and ... preventive\ndeployment\u201d. (A/50/60/para. 26)\nA multifaceted approach is required to develop a capability,\nincluding substantial human and material resources, that\nwould enable regional organizations to detect potential\nconflict situations and prevent them from breaking out.\nIn this context, the Organization of African Unity\n(OAU) Mechanism for Conflict Prevention, Management\nand Resolution was established in response to the many\nchallenges facing the African continent in the field of\npeace-keeping. It is an expression of Africa\u2019s readiness to\ntake effective measures aimed at solving conflicts within\nthe continent. We welcome the support of the Member\nStates, international organizations and individuals that have\ngenerously made resources available to the OAU\nMechanism, and we urge the international community to\nmake similar contributions.\nWe also welcome the conclusions of a series of\nconferences on conflict prevention and peace-keeping in\nAfrica sponsored by the British Government, the latest of\nwhich was held in Gaborone, the capital of my country, on\n7 and 8 August 1995. Botswana is convinced that training,\nplanning and preparation, an effective early-warning system\nand logistic support are fundamental to the OAU\u2019s capacity\nto predict and defuse conflicts and, once they have\nerupted, to undertake peace-keeping operations. The\nfinancial support of the international community is crucial\nif the peace-keeping capability of the African countries is\nto be realized.\nThe United Nations, in general, should be placed on\na firm financial foundation if it is effectively to tackle the\nmammoth tasks facing the world today, including\nassistance to regional arrangements in conflict prevention\nand peace-keeping. The question of the financial\nemergency in which the United Nations so often finds\nitself, because of failure by Member States to honour\ntheir financial obligations to the Organization, should not\nbe allowed to fester into the next century. It seems\nlogical, at least to Botswana, that the decisions and\nresolutions which we adopt as Member States, and which\nhave financial implications, should be accompanied by a\ncommitment to make prompt and regular contributions to\nthe various budgets, programmes and funds of the\nOrganization. Otherwise there is no sense in adopting\nsuch decisions and resolutions. As stated earlier, the\nresources needed for peace-keeping operations alone are\nsuch that every Member State must make its contribution\nif we seriously expect results from the Organization.\nWe cannot talk about the maintenance of\ninternational peace and security without reference to\nnuclear proliferation, because of all weapons of mass\ndestruction, nuclear weapons pose the greatest threat to\ninternational peace and security. In this regard, Botswana\nis satisfied with the outcome of the Review and Extension\nConference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). The States\nParties not only agreed to extend the Treaty indefinitely,\nbut also adopted the principles and objectives for nuclear\nnon-proliferation and disarmament and committed\nthemselves to strengthening the review process for the\nTreaty. We were disappointed that some nuclear Powers\nresumed testing immediately after the conclusion of the\nConference.\nThe States Parties further committed themselves to\ncomplete negotiations, no later than 1996, on a universal,\nlegally binding and internationally and effectively\nverifiable comprehensive nuclear test-ban treaty. The onus\nnow rests on nuclear-weapon States to honour their end\nof the deal. My delegation firmly believes that the only\nway to protect the world from the scourge of nuclear\nweapons is through their complete elimination.\n23\n\n\nThe contribution made by the United Nations and its\nspecialized agencies in the field of health, especially in the\ndeveloping countries, has been most impressive. Life-\nthreatening diseases such as polio, tuberculosis, smallpox,\nmalaria and river blindness, to name but a few, have largely\nbeen eradicated in most parts of the world. The other\nvisible benefit of the work of the United Nations in\ndevelopment has been the transfer of technology, especially\nto the developing countries, resulting in improved\nsanitation, education, human resource development and food\nproduction and storage.\nCurrently, the United Nations is spending millions of\ndollars on research and related expenditure on the AIDS\npandemic, which is threatening the very existence of\nhumankind and is posing a serious threat to the economic\ndevelopment of many nations. It is our sincere hope that the\nworld will quickly find a cure to save humankind from the\nscourge of this pandemic.\nWe are concerned that in recent years the resources\navailable to some specialized agencies of the United\nNations have been declining. This has negatively affected\ntheir contribution to economic development in the\ndeveloping countries. It is clear from the report of the\nSecretary-General that the core resources of the United\nNations Development Programme (UNDP) have been\ndecreasing since 1992, and this has resulted in national\nindicative planning figures in developing countries being\nreduced by 30 per cent from their original levels. This is an\nunfortunate trend indeed for developing countries,\nconsidering that the UNDP is the agency of the United\nNations charged with responsibility for the financing and\ncoordination of technical and development assistance. And\nthe negative impact this trend has had in the execution of\ndevelopment projects and programmes in the developing\ncountries cannot be overemphasized.\nIt is imperative that the ongoing dialogue on the\nreform of the United Nations give due consideration to the\nimportant role that these agencies and programmes play in\nthe improvement in the living standards of peoples in the\ndeveloping countries. The reduction of the administrative\ncosts and the rationalization of the operations of these\norganizations should be carried out at the expense neither\nof their capacity to deliver the goods and services nor of\nthe quality of their product. In this regard, I wish to\nreaffirm the decision the African Ministers of Industry took\nin Gaborone, Botswana, on 8 June 1995, in which they\nappealed to the international community, particularly the\ndeveloped countries, to support the maintenance and\nstrengthening of the United Nations Industrial Development\nOrganization (UNIDO) to enable it to continue\nparticipating actively in the industrialization of Africa.\nThe past five years have witnessed major\ndevelopments in the social and economic fields. The\ninternational community has made great efforts in\naddressing issues of international concern in these areas.\nIn this regard, the successful holding of the World\nSummit for Children, the United Nations Conference on\nEnvironment and Development, the World Conference on\nHuman Rights, the World Summit for Social\nDevelopment and, most recently, the Fourth World\nConference on Women are illustrative. While the holding\nof these conferences in itself deserves commendation, the\ninternational community should not be satisfied merely\nwith summitry. It should strive to adopt declarations and\nplans of action which are realistic and implementable.\nAbove all, there should be a genuine commitment to\nproviding the necessary resources for the implementation\nof these declarations and plans of action.\nIt is now four years since the General Assembly, in\nrecognition of the difficult social and economic situation\nprevailing in Africa, adopted the United Nations New\nAgenda for the Development of Africa. At its high-level-\nsegment meeting held in Geneva from 3 to 6 July this\nyear, the Economic and Social Council concluded that\nprogress in the implementation of the New Agenda had\nbeen slow and insufficient, and reaffirmed that success\ndepended on the full support of the international\ncommunity. It is clear that while the primary\nresponsibility for economic development in Africa rests\nwith the African Governments and peoples themselves,\nthere is still an absolute need for the support of the\ninternational community.\nOne of the priority areas of the United Nations New\nAgenda for the Development of Africa is regional\ncooperation and integration. In this connection, we in\nsouthern Africa are engaged in efforts to ensure\ndevelopment through regional cooperation. The Southern\nAfrican Development Community (SADC), after 10 years\nof rehabilitating and developing infrastructure, has\nembarked on closer cooperation and integration aimed at,\ninter alia, free movement of goods, capital, services and\npeople.\nOne of the recent major developments in the\nbuilding of the community was the accession of the\nRepublic of Mauritius to SADC at the organization\u2019s\nsummit in August 1995 in Johannesburg, South Africa,\nthereby bringing the membership of SADC to 12. We are\n24\n\n\naware that we have set ourselves a difficult task as a\nregion, but there is no alternative to this path of collective\nself-reliance if our region is to survive in the current\ncompetitive international economic environment. We\ntherefore call upon the international community to continue\nits support for SADC and its programme of action.\nTo conclude, I wish to reiterate that this historic\nsession of the General Assembly offers us an opportunity\nto evaluate the achievements, review the lessons of the past\nand chart a course for the future of our Organization. An\nimportant component of this introspection and reflection on\nthe work of the United Nations should be the improvement\nof public awareness of the United Nations, building a wider\nconstituency and demonstrating that the Organization will\ncontinue to be relevant in the years to come.\n\n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of the delegation of the Islamic\nRepublic of Mauritania it gives me pleasure to convey to\nMr. Freitas do Amaral of Portugal, our warmest\ncongratulations on his unanimous election to the presidency\nof this session of the General Assembly of the United\nNations. We are convinced that his well-known personal\nskills are the best guarantee for the success of the work of\nthis session which acquires special significance as it\ncoincides with the commemoration of the fiftieth\nanniversary of the establishment of the United Nations.\nI should also like to pay tribute to his predecessor,\nMr. Amara Essy, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the sister\nrepublic of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, who led the work of the forty-\nninth session in an excellent and praiseworthy manner.\nI should also like to take this opportunity to reiterate\nto Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, Secretary-General of the\nUnited Nations, the confidence of my country and our\nsupport of his efforts so that the Organization may fully\nperform its proper role and succeed in defusing hotbeds of\ntension throughout the world.\nWe have clearly stated, on previous occasions, that the\ndeteriorating economies of the developing countries and the\nwidening gap between the rich and poor countries are the\ntwo principal causes of the proliferation of hotbeds of\ntension and bloody wars that, more often than not, wipe out\nevery economic achievement, plunge the peoples of\ndeveloping countries into cruel suffering and deprive them\nof the right to lead a decent life of security, stability, and\ndevelopment towards a better future.\nAs we have noted in the past, the fact that structural\nadjustment programmes neglect the necessary assessment of\nthe social cost of such adjustment and focus on correcting\nthe macroeconomic balance, has had the effect of causing\nsuch programmes to fall short of achieving the desired\npositive results. In this connection, we had voiced concern\nover the possibility that the deterioration of the economic\nconditions of developing countries would limit the impact\nof such international instruments as environmental\nconventions and programmes that promote the rights of\nchildren and women, and human rights in general.\nToday we note that despite the convening of numerous\ninternational conferences such as the World Summit for\nChildren in New York, the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro,\nthe World Conference on Human Rights in Vienna, the\nInternational Conference on Population and Development\nin Cairo, the World Summit for Social Development in\nCopenhagen, and the Fourth World Conference for\nWomen in Beijing, there is nothing on the horizon yet\nthat may give cause for hope that radical solutions to the\nmany problems besetting the most vulnerable peoples in\nthe poorest countries throughout the developing world are\nbeginning to emerge.\nWhile these international conferences, in addition to\nthe Agenda for Development of the Secretary-General of\nthe United Nations have drawn the broad outlines of\nfuture policies that would deal with such problems, no\nspecific formulae for putting those policies into practice\nhave emerged yet. On the contrary, we note that the\ndeterioration of the terms of trade and the reduction in\nofficial development assistance (ODA) have continued\nand have been the two principal causes that aggravate the\nstifling economic crises which have so many third world\ncountries in their grip.\nThe Islamic Republic of Mauritania which, since\n1984, has been engaged in a determined battle that aims\nat restructuring the Mauritanian economy despite difficult\ndomestic, regional and international conditions, has made\ntangible progress towards restoring the macroeconomic\nbalance and reducing its foreign debt, a fact that is\nattested to by international financial institutions.\nIn striving for these objectives, my Government,\nunder the wise guidance of His Excellency the President\nof the Republic, Mr. Maaouya Ould Sid\u2019 Ahmed Taya,\nhave pursued liberal economic policies that neglect not a\nsingle aspect of economic and social development.\nThese economic policies that we pursue encompass\nthe following broad sectors: road building, the\nelectrification of cities, combating desertification,\ndevelopment of water networks, combating illiteracy, the\nempowerment of women and development of the child,\neducation for all, and health coverage for the whole\npopulation. In seeking to achieve these objectives, the\nGovernment of Mauritania focuses on developing the\nagricultural, mineral and fisheries sectors which form the\nbackbone of our economy.\nIn view of the nature of such development plans and\nsocial policies the Government of the Islamic Republic of\nMauritania have participated in all the negotiations that\nled to the adoption of the United Nations Convention on\nthe Law of the Sea, which entered into force on 16\n14\n\n\nNovember 1994, and participated also in the negotiations\nwhich culminated in the conclusion of the United Nations\nConvention to Combat Desertification in Those Countries\nExperiencing Serious Drought and/or Desertification,\nParticularly in Africa, signed in Paris on 14 October 1994.\nIt is our fervent hope that the international community will\nmake available the resources required for the\nimplementation of this Convention which will benefit\nprincipally the African countries that are most affected by\ndrought and desertification.\nThe United Nations, which will commemorate its\nfiftieth anniversary, in a few days\u2019 time, is now required to\nadapt to the realities of the age in order for it to be able to\nface up to the challenges of a world that is being torn apart\nby regional conflicts and whose progress towards prosperity\nis obstructed by very complex social and economic crises.\nSuch a situation requires us to undertake the necessary\nstructural reforms and to make available to the Organization\nthe necessary material means and moral support that would\nenable it to discharge the tasks entrusted to it.\nWe have indicated here in the past that the spread of\ndemocracy and respect for human rights constitute the most\nimportant gains made by the international community. We\nhave indicated also that democracy should not be limited to\nthe national framework of any individual State but must\nextend to the relations between States.\nProceeding from this, we have reiterated, on many\noccasions, that we support increasing the membership of the\nSecurity Council in consonance with the behests of\ndemocratic transparency, the principles of equality of\nStates, and in accordance with Article 24 of the United\nNations Charter, which stipulates that in carrying out its\nduties the Security Council acts on behalf of all the\nMember States. In view of this, it is essential that the\nCouncil should reflect the universal nature of the\nOrganization.\nWe also consider it necessary to restructure the\nSecretariat in order to revitalize it and enhance its\nefficiency. The Economic and Social Council must be\nrestructured so that it can discharge the tasks entrusted to\nit. The activities of the Secretariat and the specialized\nagencies must be coordinated so that efforts may not be\nwasted and the modest resources available for resolving\ndevelopment problems could be put to optimum use.\nAs our overriding concern will always be the search\nfor peace, my country spares no effort in supporting the\ninternational endeavour to replace war and tension with\npeace and stability throughout the world. We have\nencouraged and continue to encourage the use of\npreventive diplomacy in order to avoid new human\ntragedies. This is an approach that has always led to\nsatisfactory results.\nIn the Middle East, there is stronger hope that the\ninternational efforts which have been deployed since the\nMadrid Conference will put an end to the tragedy of the\nPalestinian people and restore to that people its legitimate\nright to establish its own independent State. The signing\nof the Declaration of Principles on the autonomy of the\nGaza Strip and Jericho, on 13 September 1993, the Cairo\nagreement, on 4 May 1994, the agreement between Jordan\nand Israel and, finally, the Taba accord, which was signed\nin Washington on 28 September 1995, on the\nimplementation of the second phase of the Declaration of\nPrinciples, gives us hope that peace in the Middle East is\nnow on the horizon. We do hope that there will be\nprogress on the tracks of the peace process initiated with\nSyria and Lebanon and that solutions to all the unresolved\nhumanitarian issues related to this conflict may be found\nin order for a just and lasting peace that would be based\non the principles of mutual respect to promote fruitful\ncooperation and brotherly relations between all the\npeoples of the region.\nIt is fitting here to congratulate the parties directly\nconcerned and all the countries that, from near or far,\nhave supported the efforts for peace. We also encourage\nall the parties concerned to keep moving forward so that\nthe opportunities for peace which are available today may\nnot be wasted. If those opportunities are frittered away,\nthe situation is bound to become more complicated.\nIn that same region of the world, the residue of the\nGulf war, unfortunately, are still taking their toll. The\nIslamic Republic of Mauritania, which, from the very\nbeginning, given its commitment to international legality,\nhas totally rejected any infringement of the independence\nand territorial integrity of fraternal Kuwait, and called for\nresolving the question of Kuwaiti prisoners and detainees,\nnow wishes to declare its rejection of any infringement of\nthe unity and territorial integrity of Iraq. Mauritania\nbelieves it is now time to put an end to the suffering of\nthe brotherly Iraqi people.\nIn the same context, the fraternal State of the United\nArab Emirates continues to claim its legitimate\n15\n\n\nsovereignty over the islands of Greater Tunb, Lesser Tunb\nand Abu Moussa. Mauritania reiterates its support for the\nUnited Arab Emirates in this respect.\nIn the Maghreb, the United Nations continues to\ndeploy efforts towards organizing a referendum on self-\ndetermination in Western Sahara. We hope that the United\nNations, which has enjoyed our country\u2019s full support, will\novercome the remaining obstacles and succeed in\norganizing the referendum within the time-frame set by the\nSecurity Council so as to achieve a just and definitive\nsettlement of the Saharan question.\nAs we did last year, and as we have done on every\noccasion, we call for the lifting of the embargo imposed on\nthe fraternal people of Libya, in the light of the Libyan\nArab Jamahiriya\u2019s stated readiness to cooperate with both\nthe United Nations and the other parties concerned, since\nthat embargo is detrimental to the interests of all the\npeoples of the Maghreb.\nIn Africa, we are still concerned over the continuance\nof armed conflicts in several brotherly African countries.\nWhereas our Liberian brothers have succeeded, through\ndialogue, in concluding the Abuja Agreement and setting\nout plans that we hope will restore peace to that country.\nThe situation in Somalia, regrettably, has not changed, and\nthe afflicted Somali people is still threatened with\nextermination by fratricide and famine.\nWe also hope that our Rwandan brethren will succeed\nin resolving their problems at the negotiating table. We\nwelcome the progress achieved by our Angolan brethren,\nwhose efforts have led to the signing of an agreement for\npeace and for the settlement of their political problems. We\nhope the sustained efforts of the United Nations and the\nOrganization of African Unity will continue until these\nbrotherly countries can enjoy peace so that their peoples\nmay devote themselves to rebuilding all that has been\ndevastated by civil wars.\nWe note with satisfaction that in Europe the member\ncountries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization have\nadopted a new posture vis-\u00e0-vis the Serbian aggression\nagainst the Muslims of Bosnia and Herzegovina. I should\nlike to voice the hope that in future greater determination\nwill be shown in dealing with this problem increasingly\nsternly until such time as the Serbs agree to a just and\ncomprehensive solution that would guarantee all the peoples\nconcerned the right to sovereignty on their territory and the\nright to live in peace within secure, internationally\nrecognized borders.\nThe many humiliations suffered by the United\nNations forces at the hands of the Serbs and the\nmassacres of innocent Muslims perpetrated by the Serbs\nin Bosnia and Herzegovina make it necessary for the\ninternational community, particularly the permanent\nmembers of the Security Council, to impose respect for\ninternational legality and to restore the credibility of the\nUnited Nations by putting an end to the bloodshed that\nhas gone on for several years in that part of the world.\nThe commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the\nUnited Nations affords an opportunity for giving deep\nthought to finding the best means of facing up to the\nchallenges of our times and to equipping our Organization\nwith the military capability and material resources that\nwould enable it to address problems at the international\nlevel with a single standard based on the principles of\nequality and justice. The same should apply to the\nOrganization\u2019s activities in the areas of peace-keeping and\naid for development, as well as in its endeavours to\nensure that the world will enjoy prosperity, peace and\nbrotherhood and to promote freedom, democracy and\nrespect for human rights.\n"

        "file_text": "I\nshould like at the outset to convey to you, Sir, my most\ncordial and sincere congratulations on your election as\nPresident of the Assembly. Both Spain, Portugal\u2019s sister\ncountry, and the European Union, on behalf of which I\nhave the honour to address the Assembly today, are\nconfident that your work will meet with the greatest\nsuccess. I am firmly convinced that your experience as an\neminent professor of international law and your thorough\nknowledge of international relations will contribute\ndecisively to the Assembly\u2019s achieving its ambitious goals.\nI should like also to thank Minister Amara Essy of\nC\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire for the excellent manner in which he\nconducted our deliberations during the previous session of\nthe Assembly.\nLikewise, I wish to express my appreciation to the\nSecretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, together\nwith my congratulations on the work he has accomplished\nthroughout his mandate.\nIn order to speed up the work of the Assembly, I\nintend to shorten my statement, the complete text of\nwhich will be published in a separate document.\nI am addressing this Assembly on behalf of the\nEuropean Union, whose membership has increased to 15\nStates since the beginning of this year, thereby reinforcing\nits capacity to fulfil its commitment to the purposes and\nprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations. The\nEuropean Union, fully aware of the complex challenges\nfaced by the international community, wishes to reiterate\nits full support for our Organization as a universal forum\nfor realizing humankind\u2019s aspirations to peace and\nsecurity and economic and social progress.\nAgainst this background, the European Council, at\nits meeting in Cannes on 26 and 27 June, paid tribute, in\na solemn declaration, to the work of our Organization and\nto the half-century\u2019s activities of the United Nations.\nIn a few weeks the Heads of State and Government\nof the entire world will solemnly commemorate the\nfiftieth anniversary of the founding of our Organization.\nAlthough this occasion will give us an opportunity to\nassess the work accomplished by the Organization over\nthe course of its already long history, we must above all\nreflect on the best way of preparing the United Nations to\nmeet effectively the challenges facing us at the end of this\ncentury. Let me recall, with regard to this moment in the\nexistence of the United Nations, a thought expressed by\nJean Monnet in respect of the European Community,\nwhen the latter was taking its first steps:\n\n\n\u201cThis is only a stage towards the forms of\norganization of the world of tomorrow.\u201d\nIndeed, the disappearance of old rivalries has not\nmeant the end of conflicts. Today we are witnessing ethnic\nand nationalistic conflicts and humanitarian crises of\nfrightening proportions; a worsening of economic\ninequalities; contempt for human rights; the systematic\nviolation of the rules of international humanitarian law;\ngenocide; the risk of the proliferation of weapons of mass\ndestruction; and the alarming deterioration of the\nenvironment. These are some of the most serious problems\nwe face today. They affect us all, and we must all make a\ncommitment to solve them.\nAlthough, as usual, a number of issues of concern to\nthe European Union are dealt with in detail in the\nmemorandum distributed as an integral part of this\nstatement, I should like to highlight some questions that are\nespecially important to us: the situation in the former\nYugoslavia, developments in Africa and the peace process\nin the Middle East.\nThe European Union continues to attach priority\nimportance to reaching a negotiated, just and lasting peace\nin the conflict that is ravaging the territory of the former\nYugoslavia. In this regard, we express our full support for\nthe diplomatic process currently under way and our\nsatisfaction at its initial results at the meeting held in\nGeneva on 8 September last.\nWe believe that the United Nations forces in the\nterritories of the former Yugoslavia have played, and\ncontinue to play, a fundamental role. Member States of the\nEuropean Union are among the main troop contributors to\nthese forces. I wish here to pay tribute to the United\nNations forces and pay homage to the soldiers who have\nfallen in the cause of peace, many of them citizens of the\nEuropean Union.\nThe European Union has contributed substantially to\nalleviating the tremendous suffering that the war in the\nformer Yugoslavia, and particularly in Bosnia and\nHerzegovina, has inflicted upon the population. I wish to\nexpress our firm commitment to continue providing\nhumanitarian assistance, both bilaterally and through the\nrelevant United Nations organs and agencies.\nAfter more than three years of bloody conflict, the\nlatest developments in the peace process allow us to look\nahead with more hope. In this process, which we hope is\nnear at hand, the European Union intends to play a role\ncommensurate to its commitments in all aspects of the\nimplementation of the peace process, and in particular\nwith regard to reconstruction efforts. Violence has\ndestroyed property, but above all it has taken human lives\nand destroyed peaceful coexistence. Our main task will\nthus be to restore hope and offer decent living conditions\nto those who are still suffering the consequences of this\ncatastrophe.\nThe European Union is aware of the great challenges\nfacing Africa. Proof of our concern is that we are\nworking to find peaceful solutions to the conflict in\nRwanda and to the conflict in Burundi, beginning with the\npriority problem of the return of refugees. We support the\nurgent convening of a conference, under United Nations\nauspices, aimed at peace and stability in the Great Lakes\nregion.\nLikewise, we support the initiatives for social and\npolitical reconstruction in countries such as Angola and\nMozambique, and we welcome the work accomplished by\nour Organization in Angola, which, following the Lusaka\npeace agreement, has allowed for the establishment of the\nthird United Nations Angola Verification Mission\nUNAVEM III.\nWe also favour a more active role for the\nOrganization of African Unity in the prevention and\nsolution of conflicts in Africa, and we are considering\nways of supporting the establishment of effective\nmechanisms for preventive diplomacy and peace-keeping.\nThe European Union is also following the spread of\nand respect for human rights throughout the continent,\nand we are very much aware of the dire need of some\nAfrican countries. Since the revision of the Fourth Lom\u00e9\nConvention, the European Union has attached particular\nrelevance to humanitarian and food assistance, and we\nhave made an effort to update our various development\ncooperation programmes.\nThe European Union has always strongly supported\nthe peace process in the Middle East, initiated at the 1991\nConference held in Madrid. We warmly welcome the\nInterim Agreement reached recently by Israel and the\nPalestinian National Authority, which represents a new\nand important milestone in this process, and we look\nforward to the signing of the Agreement this coming\nThursday. Likewise, we are confident that in the coming\nmonths we will see significant progress in the Syrian and\nLebanese negotiating tracks, and that the whole region,\nwhich has already suffered enormously, will finally enter\n2\n\n\ninto the dynamics of a comprehensive, just, stable and long-\nlasting peace.\nThe European Union attaches paramount importance\nto the work carried out by our Organization in general, and\nin particular by the Assembly, in favour of peace in the\nMiddle East. That is why one of our objectives in the\nsession now beginning is to ensure that the various\nresolutions adopted by the Assembly on the situation in the\nMiddle East contribute directly to the peace process,\nfollowing the guidelines established in previous years.\nI do not wish to conclude this first part of my\nstatement without a reference to the work of the United\nNations in Latin America. Its presence in Nicaragua\nthrough the United Nations Observer Group in Central\nAmerica (ONUCA), the United Nations Observer Mission\nfor the Verification of Electoral Process in Nicaragua\n(ONUVEN) and the International Commission for Support\nand Verification allowed for national reconciliation and the\nholding of elections.\nThe mediation between the parties and the work of the\nUnited Nations Observer Mission in El Salvador\n(ONUSAL) led to the historic achievement of ending the\nlong and terrible civil conflict in El Salvador, which\nculminated in the Chapultepec Agreements of January 1992.\nToday the presence of the Mission, which has the support\nof the European Union, contributes effectively to\novercoming the obstacles that still persist.\nIn Haiti, the multinational force and the United\nNations Mission in Haiti (UNMIH) played a fundamental\nrole in the restoration of democracy and in the\nreconstruction of the country.\nIn Guatemala, the United Nations role as moderator\nand the work of the United Nations Mission for the\nVerification of Human Rights and of Compliance with the\nCommitments of the Comprehensive Agreement on Human\nRights in Guatemala (MINUGUA) have brought about\nsubstantive agreements on such important issues as human\nrights, displaced persons and indigenous populations, which\nwe are confident will lead to a speedy solution to the\nconflict. The participation of international observers in the\ncoming elections in November, supported by the European\nUnion, seems to us an effective formula. All these\nachievements have been realized with the invaluable help\nof the various Groups of Friends and the support of the\ninternational community.\nConscious of the universality of the challenges that\nlie ahead for the Organization, the European Union\nattaches fundamental importance to the adoption of\nmeasures allowing for the success and proper functioning\nof the United Nations in implementing the mandates\nentrusted to it by the Member States.\nIn this respect, the Organization\u2019s serious financial\ncrisis, unprecedented in its history, seriously endangers\nthe United Nations capacity for action and is a source of\ngreat concern for the European Union. Our Organization\nwill become powerless if it does not receive the necessary\npolitical support from its Member States and the resources\nprovided by them, particularly through the full, punctual\nand unconditional payment of their financial contributions,\nin accordance with the obligations established by the\nCharter.\nTherefore, resolving the Organization\u2019s financial\ncrisis is a priority objective for the European Union,\nwhich overall is the main contributor, both to the regular\nbudget and to the peace-keeping operations budgets.\nThis constructive attitude is what led to the\nparticipation of the European Union in the work of the\nHigh-level Open-ended Working Group on the Financial\nSituation of the United Nations. Our objective is to reach\na consensus as soon as possible \u2014 preferably during this\nsession \u2014 on the adoption of specific measures to bring\nabout an improvement in the Organization\u2019s financial\nsituation.\nThe European Union wishes to underline the\nincreasingly urgent need to adopt a global package of\nmeasures to solve the United Nations grave financial\nsituation. These measures should contemplate, inter alia,\na possible review of the scale of assessments so that it\nwould reflect as accurately as possible the principle of the\ncapacity to pay, as well as the establishment of incentives\nand disincentives to encourage all Member States to\ncomply with their financial obligations.\nThe Agenda for Development (A/48/935), submitted\nlast year by the Secretary-General, identified the five\ndimensions of development: peace as the foundation, the\neconomy as the engine of progress, the environment as a\nbasis for sustainability, justice as a pillar of society and\ndemocracy as good governance.\nThe European Union attaches the greatest importance\nto the completion, before the end of the session that is\nnow beginning, of a substantial and innovative agenda for\n3\n\n\ndevelopment, in which it is made clear that peace cannot be\nbuilt without at the same time promoting the social and\neconomic progress of the poorest people. Through the\ndecisions taken by the European Council held in Cannes, to\nwhich I have already referred, the European Union has\nmade clear its determination to contribute yet greater\nfinancial resources for development aid, within the\nframework of both the Lom\u00e9 Convention \u2014 in the case of\nthe African, Caribbean and Pacific countries \u2014 and through\nfinancial cooperation with our Mediterranean partners and\nfriends.\nThroughout this session of the Assembly we shall pay\nspecial attention to the results of the important cycle of\nmajor conferences held over recent years under the aegis of\nthe United Nations for discussion of various subjects linked\nto development and human progress.\nWe need the Economic and Social Council to play a\nmore vigorous and more central role within the system; we\nmust ensure that the work of the Assembly and of the\nCouncil are complementary, avoiding all duplication.\nDuring this session the results of the World Summit\nfor Social Development, held in Copenhagen, will be\nsubmitted to the Assembly. The European Union firmly\nintends actively to consider these results, with a view to\nidentifying appropriate measures to ensure the follow-up\nand implementation of the commitments undertaken at\nCopenhagen. We must not allow the platforms of action\nadopted at United Nations conferences to remain\nunimplemented.\nThe Fourth World Conference on Women ended in\nBeijing only a few days ago. The Declaration and Platform\nfor Action adopted at the Conference are a step forward,\nbacked by the results of previous United Nations\nconferences, on the road towards the achievement of\nequality, development and peace. These objectives were set\nout in the strategies for the advancement of women adopted\nin Nairobi 10 years ago.\nThe European Union has worked actively to achieve\nconsolidation of the results of the Vienna Conference on\nHuman Rights, in the field of human rights and\nfundamental liberties of women, and of the Cairo\nConference on Population and Development. The Platform\nfor Action adopted in Beijing as a result of such concern\nincludes important progress in human rights, notably the\nright of women to control and decide freely and responsibly\non matters related to their sexuality, including sexual and\nreproductive health, without coercion, discrimination or\nviolence.\nOnly three years before the fiftieth anniversary of\nthe Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the\ninternational community cannot yet be entirely satisfied\nwith the progress achieved. This session will provide us\nonce again with an opportunity to take stock of the\nsituation regarding human rights and fundamental\nfreedoms in the world, two years after the important\nheadway made at the Vienna World Conference.\nIt is increasingly evident that respect for human\nrights and fundamental freedoms plays a critical role in\navoiding potential conflicts. We must therefore\nacknowledge the value of human rights in preventive\ndiplomacy. Some of the serious conflicts which have\nrecently darkened the international scene are inflicting\ngreat suffering on the civilian population, as illustrated by\nthe alarming number of displaced persons and refugees.\nIn this regard, the European Union wishes to reiterate its\nsupport for the immense task being performed by the\nOffice of the United Nations High Commissioner for\nRefugees (UNHCR) in this field. At the same time, we\nare conscious of the harmful effects of ethnic and\nreligious discrimination on the emergence and\ndevelopment of such conflicts, and we reaffirm our\nconviction with regard to the need to move further in the\nadoption of measures to fight racism, racial discrimination\nand xenophobia.\nThe level of resources assigned by the Organization\nto the promotion and protection of human rights \u2014 today\na mere 1.7 per cent of its regular budget \u2014 continues to\nbe totally inadequate. A significant increase in those\nresources would have a positive impact on related areas,\nespecially on activities designed to assist development. It\nis increasingly clear that development, human rights and\ndemocracy are interlinked, as was stated in the 1986\nDeclaration on the Right to Development.\nFurthermore, the European Union attaches great\nimportance to the role and activities of the Office of the\nHigh Commissioner for Human Rights and wishes once\nagain to draw the Assembly\u2019s attention to the pressing\nneed to provide that Office with the human and financial\nresources required for the proper accomplishment of its\ntasks. We likewise support the Organization\u2019s efforts to\nenhance the role and functions of the Centre for Human\nRights in Geneva, under the supervision of the High\nCommissioner.\n4\n\n\nThe International Tribunal for the Prosecution of\nPersons Responsible for Serious Violations of International\nHumanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of the\nFormer Yugoslavia and the International Tribunal for\nRwanda are essential factors in the struggle against the\nimpunity of those who violate human rights. The experience\nof these ad hoc tribunals will undoubtedly help the work of\na future international criminal court, for which a draft\nstatute was drawn up by the International Law Commission\nand submitted to the Assembly\u2019s Sixth Committee at its last\nsession.\nMankind is facing a growing number of humanitarian\nemergencies that require an effective response from the\ninternational community in order to alleviate the tragedy\nbeing suffered daily by tens of thousands of human beings.\nThe establishment of the Department of Humanitarian\nAffairs has been an outstanding contribution to the\ninternational efforts for humanitarian assistance, a field in\nwhich the often hazardous work of non-governmental\norganizations is also of paramount importance. We deem it\nessential to implement the decision taken this year by the\nEconomic and Social Council on the need to review and\nreinforce the capacity of the United Nations system in the\narea of humanitarian assistance.\nThere is a need to enhance cooperation between all\norganizations and people, in such a way that their\nrespective contributions may be mutually complemented\nand strengthened, duplication of work avoided, and a\nhumanitarian continuum ensured.\nWe have witnessed important events this year in the\nfield of the environment and in the implementation of the\nRio agreements of 1992. Special mention should be made\nof the positive outcome of the Conferences of the parties to\nthe Convention on Biological Diversity and the framework\nConvention on Climate Change, the opening for signature\nof the Convention to Combat Desertification, and the\nestablishment of the Intergovernmental Panel on Forests\nunder the aegis of the Commission for Sustainable\nDevelopment. We welcome those developments and\nreiterate our determination to continue working, within the\nOrganization, towards greater cooperation in the field of the\nenvironment.\nThe United Nations Charter confers upon the\nOrganization the principal task of maintaining international\npeace and security and entrusts that major responsibility to\nthe Security Council.\nThe Security Council must continue to be the decision-\nmaking centre for issues that affect world security and\nmust constantly adapt to currently existing situations in\norder to strengthen the mechanisms set forth in the\nCharter itself.\nThe Open-ended Working Group on the Question of\nEquitable Representation on and Increase in the\nMembership of the Security Council continued its work\nduring previous sessions of the Assembly. The members\nof the European Union participated actively in that work,\nand will continue to do so in the future.\nThe European Union holds the view that peace-\nkeeping operations and missions of preventive diplomacy\nare and should continue to be the focal point of the\nSecurity Council\u2019s action in favour of world peace and\nsecurity. We welcome the updating of the Agenda for\nPeace submitted by the Secretary-General at the beginning\nof this year.\nI would remind the Assembly of the European\nUnion\u2019s commitment to United Nations peace-keeping\noperations, illustrated by the fact that the Union as a\nwhole is not only the main financial contributor to these\noperations, providing 37 per cent of the total budget, but\nalso the main provider of personnel. The European Union\nstands firmly behind this substantial commitment to the\nOrganization\u2019s peace-keeping endeavours. We have all\nsuffered heavy casualties in these operations, and it is of\nthe utmost importance that every possible step be taken to\nensure the safety of United Nations personnel in peace-\nkeeping missions.\nCooperation between the United Nations and\nregional organizations in peace-keeping endeavours\nshould continue to be explored to optimize the use of\nmaterial and human resources and to put the mandates\nentrusted to those missions into practice in the quickest,\nmost efficient and successful way.As an example of the\nactivity of the regional organizations in this field, let me\nmention that on our continent the Organization for\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe has already\ndeveloped a mechanism, still at an embryonic stage, for\npreventive diplomacy, the establishment of confidence-\nbuilding measures and the resolution of conflicts. Acting\non an initiative of the European Union, the Conference on\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) decided at\nthe Budapest Summit last year to reinforce cooperation\nwith the United Nations and with the trans-Atlantic\norganizations.\n5\n\n\nFurthermore, the European Union is studying with\ninterest the proposal for stand-by arrangements. To that\nend, the Union supports the proposals for headquarters of\na permanent nature, as well as for the United Nations stand-\nby forces system, and we are studying with interest other\nproposals which aim at improving the rapid reaction\ncapability of the United Nations with a view to shortening\nthe period for establishing a peace operation and facilitating\nits subsequent deployment.\nThe European Union welcomes the great step forward\nrecently taken within our Organization by the decision to\nextend the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) indefinitely. This\nis fundamental progress in the entire disarmament process\nand the pursuit of nuclear non-proliferation. The decision\nadopted and the strengthening of the inspection procedure\nand the principles and objectives of disarmament and\nnuclear non-proliferation constitute an enormous step in the\nright direction. We also welcome the steady pace of the\nnegotiations for a comprehensive test-ban treaty, which the\nEuropean Union hopes and is confident will be concluded\nin 1996 at the latest.\nWe must now focus our efforts on the universalization\nof the Non-Proliferation Treaty. The European Union\ninvites all States that have not yet done so to become\nsignatories of the NPT. Another European Union priority in\nthe field of nuclear disarmament is the finalization of a\ntreaty banning the production of fissile material for the\nmanufacture of nuclear weapons and explosives. The\nEuropean Union regrets that the Conference on\nDisarmament has not yet been able to set up an ad hoc\ncommittee to begin negotiations on this issue.\nOnce again, we appeal to all States that signed the\nConvention of the Banning of the Development, Production,\nStorage and Use of Chemical Weapons and their\nDestruction to proceed to ratify it so that it may come into\nforce as soon as possible.\nFurthermore, the control and limitation of the use of\ncertain conventional weapons is also cause for concern for\nthe European Union. Through its common action, the Union\naims to continue to encourage the activities of the United\nNations in its fight against the devastating effects of anti-\npersonnel mines in many territories around the world. Also\nin the field of conventional disarmament, we will pay\nspecial attention to the results of the Review Conference of\nthe 1980 Convention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the\nUse of Certain Conventional Weapons Which May Be\nDeemed to Be Excessively Injurious or To Have\nIndiscriminate Effects, in order to render it more effective\nand to widen its scope.\nWe believe in the United Nations. We believe in the\nuniversality, binding character and supremacy of\ninternational law, which is the result of the development\nof relations among nations and consensus among peoples.\nThe European Union gives its unconditional support to\nthe Organization\u2019s ideals and actions.\nWe are sure that these first 50 years are but the first\nstage in an unprecedented task that presents no other\nalternative, given that its chief goal \u2014 that of assuring\nthat we all live together in peace, as well as the\ncomprehensive development of human beings \u2014 can be\nattained only through disinterested cooperation among\npeoples.\n\n"

        "file_text": "With 15 October 1995 only a few days away \u2014 the first\nanniversary of the restoration of the democratic process in\nHaiti \u2014 I am pleased on behalf of the Government and\npeople of Haiti to extend our greetings to the international\ncommunity gathered here and our wishes for a long life to\nthe United Nations, which is playing an ever more decisive\nrole in the lives of our peoples.\nI should like to extend my warmest congratulations to\nHis Excellency Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral of Portugal on\nhis election to the presidency of this fiftieth session of the\nGeneral Assembly and extend my best wishes for his\nsuccess in the exercise of his important duties.\nI should like also to pay a well-deserved tribute to His\nExcellency Mr. Amara Essy, Minister for Foreign Affairs\nof C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, for the wisdom and ability he showed in\nconducting the work of the forty-ninth session.\nAllow me also to congratulate Mr. Boutros Boutros-\nGhali on his effective management as Secretary-General\nof our Organization. His thorough knowledge of the\nissues and his proposals contained in the Agenda for\nPeace and the Agenda for Development have enabled him\nto make a significant contribution to the thinking on\nreforming the Organization with a view to making it more\ncapable of facing the challenges of the twenty-first\ncentury.\nThis session of the General Assembly coincides with\nour commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the\nfounding of the United Nations. More than any other, this\nsession is destined to affect the history of our\nOrganization because of the reflection this anniversary\nwill certainly inspire with regard to its future.\nFifty years have elapsed since 51 States, including\nmy own, the Republic of Haiti, recognizing the absolute\nneed to take collective action to work for peace,\ndevelopment and social progress, decided to found the\nUnited Nations. From its inception, the United Nations\nhas been a focus of the aspirations and hopes of peoples\nworld wide for a more peaceful future and a more\npromising tomorrow.\nThroughout the half century of its existence the\nOrganization has exerted great efforts to achieve the goals\nset forth in the Charter. It has addressed a broad range of\ncomplex international problems and has, in many cases,\nbeen able to find a satisfactory solution to them.\n\n\nThus, the United Nations has distinguished itself in the\ndecisive role it has played in the decolonization process, in\nthe strengthening of international security and in the\nrestoration of peace in many parts of the world. It has also\ncontributed to the development of international law.\nThrough a series of global conferences, it has progressed\ntowards an international consensus on such world problems\nas the environment, population, human rights, the status of\nwomen, the rights of the child, sustainable development and\nmany other fundamental questions.\nQuite recently, United Nations activities in support of\npeace have taken on added scope with the increase in\npeace-keeping operations, some of which have met with\noutstanding success \u2014 operations in Cambodia, in El\nSalvador or in my own country, Haiti, where the joint\naction of the United Nations and the Organization of\nAmerican States brought about a return of constitutional\norder and thereby provided eloquent testimony to this\nsuccess.\nIn that connection allow me on behalf of the people\nand Government of Haiti to express to the international\ncommunity our gratitude for its support and its contribution\nto the restoration of the democratic process in Haiti. Thanks\nto you, Haiti now has a valid peace; political stability is on\nthe verge of becoming a reality; and the security of Haitian\nsociety is a virtual fact.\nYou helped us to emerge from a period of turbulence\nand to create in our country conditions favourable to peace\nand development, replacing the repression under which we\nhad lived for the three years of coup d\u2019\u00e9tat. Once again, I\nwish to express the deep gratitude of the Haitian people to\nthe great family of the United Nations and to each of the\nnations that, in one way or another, provided support for\nthe return of constitutional order.\nIn this connection I should like to share with the\nAssembly the work our Government has accomplished\nsince its restoration.\nOne year after the return of President Jean-Bertrand\nAristide to Haiti, significant progress has been achieved in\nall spheres of national activity. The Government has made\nit a point of honour to draw the Assembly\u2019s attention to the\nfact that the rights of all Haitians are scrupulously\nrespected, freedom of expression and association is\nguaranteed, our institutions have resumed their normal\nfunctioning, the scheduled legislative and municipal\nelections have been carried out, and insecurity in both\ntowns and countryside has noticeably diminished.\nIn achieving that result the Government had to adopt\nmeasures that were vigorous but welcomed by the vast\nmajority of the population. Among others, I would cite\nthe dismantling of the corps of section heads and their\nauxiliaries, the demobilization of the armed forces\npending approval by Parliament of their dissolution, the\nestablishment of a new national police force in keeping\nwith the wishes expressed in the 1987 Constitution, the\ncreation of the National Magistrature School and the\nNational Penitentiary Administration. All of those\nmeasures enjoyed the wholehearted assistance of the\nUnited Nations Mission in Haiti, which has been an\ninvaluable partner in the restoration of democratic\nprocesses in Haiti.\nTo strengthen the population\u2019s confidence in the\nprocess of national reconciliation the Government has set\nup a National Commission for Truth and Justice to shed\nlight on the atrocities committed during the three years of\ncoup d\u2019\u00e9tat, and that Commission has made great\nprogress in its work.\nIn addition, the Government has understood the need\nto go further in making reparations and combating the\nacceptance of impunity. In a Decree of 29 September\n1995, the Government decided to allocate 20 per cent of\nthe budget of the Ministry of Justice to victims of the\ncoup d\u2019\u00e9tat and to provide them with legal aid in bringing\ncases and prosecuting criminals. Such measures\ndemonstrate a determination to put an end to impunity\nand to render justice to those to whom justice is due.\nThus, we are firmly and irreversibly committed to\ndemocracy. There are still some problems to be solved,\nbut no one can question the enormous progress\naccomplished since 15 October 1994. The struggle for the\nestablishment of a democratic State in Haiti continues\nwith ever-greater determination. However, there can be no\nviable democracy without sustained economic\ndevelopment. In Haiti, the link between democracy and\ndevelopment is fundamental, affecting as it does the very\nsurvival of our nation.\nIn this connection the Haitian Government has given\npride of place to two major approaches that define the\nnational development policy, namely, regeneration of the\nspace some 8 million inhabitants will share before the end\nof the century, and universal education.\nNatural resources \u2014 restored, revived and protected\nfrom continuous and uncoordinated overexploitation \u2014\nmust be managed by citizens, families and communities,\n2\n\n\nwho shall learn to acquire know-how, to share knowledge,\nto spread information, and to tap both the vast, exciting\nstockpile of human knowledge and their own rich national\nculture. Through formal and non-formal education and by\nusing all training and information technologies, we must\nmeet the needs of our population, from elementary\neducation to command of the high technology appropriate\nto our development.\nIt is easy to see that, because of their importance,\nthose two fundamental decisions will involve redefining all\nsectoral and non-sectoral policies and programmes. It is\nalong these lines that we shall define policies of direct State\nmanagement, fiscal, monetary, budgetary, public-\ninvestment, public-administration, public-enterprise\nmanagement, credit and other policies, as well as policies\nthat demand a degree of partnership with various sectors of\nthe nation. When the conditions are met we will be able to\nengage in a process of restoring social balance through an\nimproved sharing of national wealth. From there we shall\nmove gradually to narrow the gap between the individual\nincomes of different groups. If the State uses the means and\nthe tools at its disposal, especially fiscal and credit\nmeasures, it should be possible to hasten this movement.\nWith the support of the international community our\nnation is working with high hopes to build a State based on\nlaw and to restore the fabric of our national economy.\nThe example of Haiti, which I have just described,\nalong with other successes achieved by the United Nations\nover the past 50 years, must not hide the reality of a world\nfar from fully achieving the objectives of peace and social\nprogress for all that were the dream of our forerunners.\nDespite the end of the cold war, which has lessened the\nprobability of nuclear conflict, the Earth continues to be an\narena of murderous conflicts that cause unspeakable\nsuffering and vast humanitarian tragedies. In Bosnia and\nHerzegovina, Rwanda, Burundi, Georgia and Liberia to\nname but a few, wars born for the most part of ethnic,\nreligious or tribal antagonisms seem to resist any attempt at\nsolution by the international community. It is true that there\nhas been significant progress with respect to certain crises,\nsuch as those of the Middle East and Angola, and my\nGovernment joyfully welcomes this. But the persistence of\nsuch conflicts dampens our hopes for the establishment of\na lasting peace.\nIn that context, I want to recall the threat that mankind\nstill faces from stockpiles of nuclear weapons and other\nweapons of mass destruction. My delegation hopes that the\nnuclear-weapon States will keep the promises they made at\nthe 1995 Review and Extension Conference of the Parties\nto the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\nWeapons (NPT), with respect to ridding the planet of\nnuclear weapons. The conclusion of a nuclear-test-ban\ntreaty, next year we hope, would be an important step\ntowards that goal.\nOne of the ideas developed by the Secretary-General\nin his \u201cAgenda for Peace\u201d is that peace cannot be viable\nwithout development. It is acknowledged that a basic\ncause of instability and conflict throughout the world is\nincreasingly flagrant social and economic disparities and\nthe destitution afflicting a large part of mankind.\nIn many speeches, the Secretary-General has said\nthat the globalization of problems requires global\nsolutions, whether in the sphere of the environment,\nmigrations, development or international security. It is\nalso time to adopt a comprehensive approach to the\ncollateral effects of inevitable structural adjustment. A\ntimid step in that direction was taken at the Halifax\nsummit of the seven most highly industrialized countries,\nbut what is needed most is greater participation by the\ncountries of the South in the international economic\nsystem with a view to defusing the fearsome \u201csocial\nbomb\u201d described at the Copenhagen World Summit for\nSocial Development.\nLet us remember how vulnerable our countries \u2014\nespecially small island States \u2014 are to natural disasters.\nThis year, the Caribbean region has been the victim of an\nunprecedented number of hurricanes and tropical storms,\nwhich have caused significant damage to the\ninfrastructure of a number of countries, which have seen\nyears of effort shattered in a few hours or less. We extend\nour sympathy to our brother countries, and appeal to the\ninternational community to mobilize all the resources\nneeded for their rehabilitation. Clearly, small island States\nare not equipped to deal with such situations. Perhaps we\nshould consider a multilateral instrument that could limit\ntheir effects on the lives and property of affected\npopulations. In that connection, we welcome the \u201cWhite\nBerets\u201d initiative inspired by Argentina, of which Haiti\nwas the first beneficiary.\nIn a world where the burden of globalization in all\nof its forms is increasingly being felt, the need for a new\nglobal contract is becoming more and more imperative, as\na means to guarantee international peace and security. At\nthe present time, many countries, including my own, are\nnot able to satisfy the most elementary needs of the\nmajority of their population. With the increasing\n3\n\n\nglobalization of markets, and the political, economic,\nfinancial and cultural environment of the world, some\ncountries are achieving a degree of success, while other\ncountries continue to slip towards deterioration. The result\nis that millions of men, women and children are living in\nsubhuman poverty, without access to health care or to\nadequate nutrition.\nThis is a timely occasion for our Organization to play\nits role as an instrument of solidarity and international\ncooperation, in keeping with the mandate that was\nconferred on it 50 years ago. The implementation without\ndelay of the Copenhagen decisions would be desirable. It\nshould be of concern that, otherwise, these situations would\nspill over national borders and become a source of\ndestabilization on a world-wide scale. In that regard, let us\nrecall that sustainable development is the process that\nguarantees economic, social, political and cultural progress\nfor the present population, and survival with happiness,\ndignity, peace, democracy and justice for future generations.\nTo the Bretton Woods institutions, we would say that\nstructural adjustment programmes are useful only to the\nextent that they lead to actual development programmes\nbased on growth, full employment and equity, designed and\ncarried out primarily for the benefit of the most\ndisadvantaged classes of society.\nThis awareness, which implies the will to put forward\na new global contract, also prompts us, on behalf of the\nHaitian Government, to call upon the relevant forums, not\nonly to define and articulate once and for all the areas of\ncommon interest in the various activities of the\nOrganization, but also to seek out the ways and means to\nrelease the financial resources necessary to make the\nactions of our Organization more relevant.\nIn the context of increased interdependence, which is\ncharacteristic of national policies \u2014 especially those of\nthird world countries \u2014 the instruments used by\ninternational institutions and bilateral agreements determine\nany experience of a certain scope. For that reason, it is not\njust support that we are requesting from our partners: we\nare asking them to share with us the experience of\naddressing these challenges. Let them have a stake and\ninvolvement \u2014 which is possible and even probable \u2014 in\nthe redefinition of their own instruments, which should\nchange if those instruments are to be equal to the\nchallenges which, for decades, have faced the world\u2019s\nefforts to improve the world order.\nWe can understand that changes in institutions of a\ncertain size may give rise to much reluctance. And we ask:\nWhat are the risks to the international community if it\nengages in an experiment sufficiently limited not to\nfrighten us, yet sufficiently important to test the\ndesirability of extending it to more determining situations\nand bringing about a significant institutional change?\nOur Organization is at a decisive crossroads in its\nhistory. As we celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of its\nfounding, we are faced increasingly with the problem of\nthe financing of the Organization\u2019s budget for the\noperation of the system. From the experts\u2019 reports, we\nhave already learned that the core resources of the United\nNations Development Programme (UNDP) have shrunk\nby 15 per cent, and we have noted, with some fear, that\ncontributions to various United Nations trust funds have\nbeen undergoing some decline for at least four years. In\nthe long term, this process of regression in the area of\nfinancial contributions will constitute a definite threat to\nthe various operations conducted by the United Nations\nsystem, whether it be in the field of peace-keeping or in\nthe area of development activities properly speaking.\nThese considerations prompt us to ask the question\nthat concerns all of us on this fiftieth anniversary, the\nquestion of the reform of the United Nations system. At\nthe dawn of a twenty-first century that is so filled with\npromise \u2014 but also so disturbing in certain respects \u2014\nour Organization will increasingly be called upon to face\ncertain major challenges in the fields of ecology,\npopulation, economics, information and the fight against\norganized crime. Faced with those daunting challenges,\nsome of which are as yet unknown or unimagined, it is\nimportant to restructure and to strengthen the basic\nframework of this universal Organization.\nThe strengthening of the United Nations structure\nshould, we believe, be built around a legal, administrative\nand institutional reform. In that respect, my Government\nwould ardently wish to see a reform of the Security\nCouncil, with respect both to its mode of operation, which\nshould be more democratic, and to its membership, which\nshould better reflect the diversity that characterizes the\ngreat family of the United Nations.\nIn this regard, we invite all States to look into the\nmost effective ways and means to cooperate with non-\ngovernmental organizations. We must acknowledge the\nfact that, increasingly, these organizations are serving as\nforums for reflection and initiatives in civil society and\nare becoming essential partners in the quest for a new\nworld of more human and integrated development.\n4\n\n\nOne area of great concern to the Government of Haiti\nis the precarious nature of the present situation of many\nrefugees, especially women and unaccompanied children,\nwho deserve special attention. Also, I take this opportunity\nto state our increasingly resolute opposition to any forced\nrepatriation of refugees in violation of international legal\ninstruments that govern this question, including the 1951\nConvention relating to the Status of Refugees and the 1967\nProtocol. Discriminatory policies, racism and xenophobia\nwill only inflame an already tragic situation which has long\ntroubled our conscience. It is time for barbarism to give\nway to civilization and for respect for human rights to be\nenjoyed by all, men and women, without distinction.\nThe Government of the Republic of Haiti supports the\nplan to create an international criminal court to give effect\nto the principle of individual criminal responsibility in cases\nof serious and unacceptable violations of human rights.\nMy Government is deeply alarmed at the scale of the\nillicit production of, trafficking in and abuse of narcotics\naround the world. In order to protect ourselves against this\nscourge, it calls on producer and consumer States, transit\ncountries and those laundering drug money to give their full\nsupport to the fight against this evil.\nSince the end of the cold war, a war that actually was\nonly cold on the territories of the great Powers, the limited\nconflicts that seemed to go along with the inherent situation\nthere have multiplied constantly. We must recognize that\nonly the pretexts have changed. The real reasons for those\nconflicts, we repeat, are the maintenance of an excessively\nprofitable trade in conventional weapons.\nToday, the standing of a nation is not measured, and\nshould no longer be measured, by its economic power or its\nmilitary arsenal. Today, a great nation must apply itself to\nsolving the problems of its people and those of mankind as\na whole.\nIn 1945, 51 States created the United Nations, whose\nintrinsic purpose was to maintain international peace and\nsecurity and to promote the economic development of all its\nMembers. Fifty years later, as we take stock, the changes\nthat have taken place in the international arena only bear\nout the validity of these ideals of the founding fathers.\nThe celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of the\nUnited Nations is an occasion for us to recognize the\ncapacities of this Organization and the need to reform it in\norder to turn it into an increasingly effective instrument that\ncan face the challenges of the twenty-first century to build\na better world.\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me at the\noutset to congratulate Mr. Freitas do Amaral on his election\nto the prestigious office of President of the General\nAssembly at this fiftieth session. His distinguished career in\nPortuguese politics serves as an assurance that his tenure\nwill be very workmanlike and fruitful, in addition to\ncelebratory. I wish also to thank the outgoing president,\nAmbassador Amara Essy, for the excellent job he did last\nyear.\nIt is particularly auspicious to address the General\nAssembly this week \u2014 a day after the signing, in\nWashington, of a bulky, carefully crafted and\nlong-argued-over agreement between Israel and the\nPalestinian Authority on the second stage of Palestinian\nautonomy; and a few days after the signing, here in New\nYork, of a much slimmer, much more tentative and much\nmore general set of additional principles for peace in the\nSouth Slav States, which, nevertheless, we hope,\nrepresents the next step towards peace in that area as\nwell.\nOn 24 October, the United Nations will celebrate its\njubilee. This indicates that the objectives and ideals of\nthis Organization, as set out in the Charter, are still valid\nand still at the forefront of the interest of the international\ncommunity. This fills us with joy, all the more so since\none of the founding Members of the Organization was\nCzechoslovakia.\nThe founding of the United Nations was the logical\noutcome of the efforts of countries which, having been\naffected by the most terrible war in the history of\nmankind, wanted to ensure that a new organization would\nprevent any repetition of a similar conflagration.\nGuaranteeing global peace, however, has never been\nthe sole objective of the United Nations. The United\nNations constitutes a unique forum for all countries,\nwithout distinction, to present their opinions and pursue\ntheir international interests in all areas of concern,\nincluding not only security and disarmament but also\nsocial and economic development, protection of the\nenvironment and other issues that are particularly pressing\nnowadays, including drug trafficking and terrorism. The\nUnited Nations thus offers a platform for solving global\nproblems.\nThe United Nations efforts to implement the\nprinciples of its Charter enjoy the full support of the\nCzech Republic. Mr. V\u00e1clav Havel, the President of the\nCzech Republic, will no doubt underline the importance\nwe assign to it when he speaks from this rostrum next\nmonth. Nevertheless, in view of the changes that have\ntaken place since the inception of the United Nations,\nthere is an urgent need to adapt the Organization to new\nchallenges, to thoroughly reform it and to turn it into a\nbetter and more effective instrument of multilateral\ninternational relations.\nThe most important task is that of creating a more\nefficient and more cost-effective system. We need a\npractical system, one which, even with limited means,\nwould guarantee global security, uphold human rights and\n9\n\n\ncontribute far more effectively to development in less\nprivileged parts of the world. We need an Organization that,\non the basis of the principle of universality, is open to all\nthose who are willing and ready to participate in this\nendeavour.\nThe United Nations cannot spend a penny more on\nprogrammes that duplicate one another or on programmes\nthat have become ineffective or even unnecessary. Many\nprogrammes can be consolidated, or indeed even\neliminated, without any adverse effect on their\nbeneficiaries. The message is clear: many of our national\nGovernments are implementing cost-control and efficiency\nmeasures, and a similar approach must be taken by the\nUnited Nations as well. We recognize the important role\nthat the Advisory Committee on Administrative and\nBudgetary Questions (ACABQ) plays in the process of\nmanaging the United Nations finances and the importance\nof the Office of Internal Oversight Services, created last\nyear. These organs must control United Nations\nexpenditures even more strictly.\nThe Charter of the United Nations devolves the basic\nresponsibility for maintaining international peace and\nsecurity to the Security Council. In this role, the Council is\nirreplaceable. It is perceived as a compact, efficient,\ntransparent and alert body that should guarantee rapid and\neffective United Nations action, wherever necessary, to\nmaintain or restore peace anywhere in the world.\nAlthough it is currently perhaps the most efficiently\noperating organ of the United Nations, there is room for\nimprovement. The Council must put greater stress on\npreventive diplomacy, and it should further improve the\nflow of information between its members and other United\nNations Members, as well as its cooperation with the\nSecretariat. Greater transparency of the Security Council in\nits decision-making would also be desirable. These are steps\nthe Council can pursue by itself.\nA broader issue is that of restructuring the Council,\nwhich requires our special attention. We support, and\nactively participate in, the Open-ended Working Group on\nthe reform and restructuring of the Security Council, and\nwe anticipate that the proposals that eventually emerge from\nit will actually be implemented. The number of permanent\nand non-permanent members of the Council should increase\nto about 20. Any substantially greater number would affect\nits effectiveness. It should, as far as possible, include\nrepresentation by all regions, and the Group of Eastern\nEuropean States should be allotted an additional seat. We\noppose any new categories of Security Council members.\nParticipation in maintaining world peace and meeting\nfinancial obligations to the United Nations are some of\nthe criteria that should be considered in determining the\nexpansion of the permanent membership. We believe\nGermany and Japan to be suitable candidates, and\nadvocate expanded representation of Latin America,\nAfrica and Asia.\nLogically, non-permanent members, and small States\nin particular, cannot play the same role as permanent\nmembers with the veto. Nevertheless, non-permanent\nmembers have a positive role to play in the Council\u2019s\nactivities and in its decision-making. During its current\ntenure on the Security Council, the Czech Republic has\nbeen contributing constructively to the Council\u2019s\nactivities. Our own active policies demonstrate, on the\none hand, the unmistakable place of the Czech Republic\namong traditionally democratic countries and, on the other\nhand, our independent analyses and attitudes, in which we\nare beholden to no other Power. Our Security Council\nactivity has also demonstrated \u2014 if such a demonstration\nwere indeed necessary \u2014 our commitment and\ninvolvement not only with respect to Europe, but also in\nseeking solutions in far-away conflicts which at first\nglance may not affect us.\nThe Czech Republic supports a more active role of\nthe Security Council in various aspects of conflict\nmanagement and in delving even deeper to the roots of\nconflicts. Such a role, exemplified for example in\npreventive diplomacy, aims at creating conditions and an\natmosphere for parties in dispute to enter into serious and\nsincere negotiations, thus restoring stability and peace in\nthe regions where tension prevails. When it comes to\nimplementing the results of negotiations, active and\ncomplex peace building and peacemaking have been our\nprimary vehicles. We do not share one-sided negative\nevaluations of the results of United Nations peace-keeping\noperations. In some regions normalcy has been restored\nprecisely because of the United Nations and its peace-\nkeeping activities. But there are also regions where\ntragedies unfold unchecked despite the United Nations\nbest efforts, including tremendous financial, material and\npersonnel contributions.\nIn its extent, depth and consequences, the crisis in\nthe former Yugoslavia amounts to the greatest and most\ntragic conflict in post-war Europe. The inability of Europe\nand of the international community in general to stop the\nconflict has undermined the confidence of the world\npublic in a number of international institutions. Gaps in\nexisting security arrangements have become apparent, and\n10\n\n\nthe European integration process has slowed down and\nbecame more complicated. The Balkan conflict is also\nfrequently linked with the crisis of the United Nations and\nwith the perceived need to create a more effective\ninternational security mechanism for resolving regional\nconflicts. In this strange way, the war in the former\nYugoslavia might thus eventually assist in forming a new,\nmore effective security mechanism.\nIt transpires that the international community was not\nready for the conflict. It underestimated its complexity and\nits potential for escalation. Its length and its chronic\ncharacter are linked with the military-strategic equality of\nthe antagonists who, despite international pressure, have\nbeen refusing to negotiate. They believe, quite erroneously,\nthat they can attain more of their objectives by fighting than\nby negotiating and signing a peace agreement. The latest\ndevelopments indicate that it is impossible to attain any\nsignificant success in solving conflicts of this type without\nthe determination of the international community and the\ncombination of strong political pressure, sanctions and the\nappropriate use of military force. But it is still more\nobvious that a final, just and lasting solution can be attained\nonly by peaceful negotiations.\nThe fate of the innocent civilian population lies at the\nheart of our concerns. The victims of ethnic cleansing, the\nstill-concealed tragedy of the men and boys of Srebrenica\nand Zepa and the exodus of Croatian Serbs from their old\nhomes all evoke fears for the fate of civilians. We should\nhelp monitor the observance of human rights for civilians\non all sides of the conflict.\nThe United States initiative regarding Bosnia and\nHerzegovina, as well as Croatia, amounts to an effort to\ncreate a joint peace project of Contact Group members and\nother interested parties. This effort should be fully\nsupported by the international community and presented to\nthe belligerent parties as the basic framework for solving\nthe crisis. The de facto recognition of the territorial\nintegrity of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina by the\nFederal Republic of Yugoslavia, and of the Srpska Republic\nby the Sarajevo Government, as well as the acceptance by\nBosnian Serbs of the Contact Group plan dividing the\nterritory of Bosnia and Herzegovina in a 51:49 ratio, should\ncertainly facilitate the next phase in peace negotiations.\nThe changing approach of the Serb party to peace\ninitiatives of the international community, especially to the\nlatest United States plan, confirms the more cooperative\napproach of Belgrade to finding a peaceful solution\nacceptable to all sides. This is definitely a positive. By the\nsame token we supported the joint North Atlantic Treaty\nOrganization (NATO)-United Nations operation, even\nthough we realize that in and of themselves, air strikes\nwould not resolve the conflict. Effective cooperation\nbetween the United Nations and NATO in implementing\nrelevant Security Council resolutions has demonstrated\nthat NATO has a very important role to play in the\nregion.\nSolving the problem of Eastern Slavonia should also\nbe on the agenda of current peace efforts.\nThe Czech Republic is ready to continue its active\nparticipation in peace missions in the former Yugoslavia,\nwhether under United Nations auspices or under some\nregional arrangement according to Chapter VIII of the\nCharter. Needless to say, the Czech Republic will\ncontinue to the best of its abilities to provide\nhumanitarian assistance, and intends to participate in the\npost-war reconstruction of the war-ravaged areas.\nThere has been a great increase in the number of\npeace-keeping operations since the end of the cold war.\nIn the last five years, more peace-keeping operations have\nbeen launched than during the entire previous existence of\nthe United Nations. In 1995, 16 peace-keeping operations\nwere functioning, compared to eight in 1988, with almost\n70,000 personnel. Expenditures rose about five times.\nThis issue is inextricably connected with the critical\nfinancial situation of the United Nations. The United\nNations is almost $4 billion in the red. The Czech\nRepublic supports not only the reform of financing peace-\nkeeping operations, but of the entire system of United\nNations financing. The system should be based on\neconomic indicators \u2014 per capita national product \u2014 and\nshould correspond to a given country\u2019s ability to pay. Let\nme assure you that the Czech Republic takes its\nresponsibility very seriously.\nWe are prepared to pay our fair share of the burden\nimmediately and in full, as soon as this share is decided\nand we receive formal notification from the\nSecretary-General.\nCzech authorities are right now drafting legislation\nwhich, if adopted, would create a legal framework for the\nCzech Republic\u2019s participation in the United Nations\nstand-by arrangements. The system should be as effective\nas possible. Similarly, initiatives aimed at the\nestablishment of United Nations rapid-reaction units to be\nbased on this system \u2014 including, for example, the recent\n11\n\n\nCanadian proposals to this effect \u2014 have our\nunderstanding. Resolving all political, organizational and\nfinancial issues will take time, yet we feel that this is a\npromising way of addressing the critical question of getting\npeace-keeping operations started in time.\nWe hope very soon to become a party to the\nConvention on the Safety of United Nations and Associated\nPersonnel. We share the burden of peace-keeping operations\nby sending troops, military observers and other personnel,\nand therefore have a keen foreign-policy interest in\nstrengthening their status and security.\nStrengthening regimes of non-proliferation of weapons\nof mass destruction is high on the agenda of the United\nNations. It is our view, shaped by, among other things, the\nrecent horrific discoveries of the United Nations Special\nCommission in Iraq, that the Security Council should play\na more important role in this regard.\nThe unlimited extension of the Non-Proliferation\nTreaty attained earlier this year in this very building is a\nsuccess of truly historic importance. An important task is\nthe preparation of an agreement on a complete and\ncomprehensive ban of nuclear tests. We hope that the\nintensive negotiations at the Conference on Disarmament in\nGeneva will reach a successful conclusion in 1996. And let\nme make one point: nuclear tests undertaken despite vocal\nprotests from around the world do not contribute to the\nobjective of global denuclearization.\nThe expectation of an early ratification of the 1993\nConvention on the Prohibition of the Development,\nProduction, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and\non Their Destruction has not yet been realized.\nNevertheless, we hope that in 1996 the Convention will\nenter into force.\nExisting regimes of export and import controls for\ndual-use material, equipment and technologies are also very\nuseful. They complement or expand on international\nagreements, conventions and treaties concerning the\nbanning, elimination and non-proliferation of weapons,\nespecially those of mass destruction. I have in mind in\nparticular activities of the so-called Australia Group, the\nNuclear Suppliers\u2019 Group, the Missile Technology Control\nRegime and the emerging New Forum, the new multilateral\narrangement on export controls.\nThe importance of the topics of this year\u2019s United\nNations conferences, the Social Summit in Copenhagen and\nthe Beijing Fourth World Conference on Women, attracted\nbroad public attention \u2014 which, for that matter, was one\nof the objectives of their organizers. As we reflect on\nthese conferences, evaluate their final documents and\nreview the fate of the documents that emerged from\nearlier conferences, we are contemplating the very future\nof such meetings.\nNotwithstanding all the expectations and enthusiasm\nthat accompany them, we note the increasing\ndisenchantment from the moment a conference is over\nand its conclusions are to be implemented. It then\nbecomes obvious that large parts of its declarations fail\nthe litmus test of practicality. One wonders: do the\ntremendous efforts and the very considerable outlays\ninvolved in organizing such activities really have the end\neffect we would all desire? We are not sure that we can\nanswer in the affirmative.\nThe Czech Republic is a candidate for membership\nin the Economic and Social Council at this year\u2019s\nelections. The successes of our economic transformation\nhave already proved to be of interest to other economies\nin transition. And they have allowed the Czech Republic\nto become an emerging donor country in the\neconomic-assistance equation. These are some of the\narguments I would submit to support our candidature. We\nof course realize that the Council is as badly in need of\nreform and streamlining as other segments of the United\nNations body, and maybe more. We are prepared to offer\nour analytical skills in suggesting improvements and to\nsupport reasonable proposals leading to such reforms.\nAllow to me say a few words from the perspective\nof another high office I currently hold, that of the\nChairman of the Council of Ministers of the Council of\nEurope. The United Nations and the Council of Europe\nhave a number of points in common. These common\npoints should be further explored with a view to\neliminating duplication even across organizations,\neconomizing expenses and leveraging our resources.\nSome ideas about cooperating in the triangle of the\nUnited Nations, the Organization for Security and\nCooperation in Europe and the Council of Europe have\nrecently been shared in Strasbourg. I have full confidence\nthat any ideas that are deemed useful will be further\nexamined and implemented by our organizations.\nThe Czech Republic wishes to demonstrate its\ncontinued emphasis on multinational diplomacy and on\nassuming its proper role in the governance of world\naffairs. We have been doing so in the Security Council\nthese past years; we do so by sending our troops, military\n12\n\n\nobservers and other personnel to far-flung corners of the\nworld; and we do so by offering multilateral and bilateral\nassistance. Putting our shoulder to the wheel, we join others\nin moving this organization of ours into the next\nmillennium and into its next 50 years.\n"

        "file_text": "It is a great honour to represent\nCanada here today as we celebrate the fiftieth anniversary\nof the United Nations during this general debate.\nCanada has always been among the strongest\nsupporters of the United Nations, not only in word but\nalso in deed. In 1945 we were, through Canadian Prime\nMinister Mackenzie King, an original signatory of the\nUnited Nations Charter. Ambassador John Humphreys\nhelped write the 1948 United Nations Universal\nDeclaration of Human Rights. Successive Canadian\nAmbassadors to the United Nations have distinguished\nthemselves in the service of the Organization, as have\ncountless Canadian negotiators in areas ranging from\ndisarmament to trade to development. In addition, Lester\nB. Pearson won a Nobel Peace Prize for his contribution\nto the success of the United Nations in establishing the\nfirst peace-keeping operation, in 1956.\nAll these Canadians had a unifying purpose: to\npromote progress in implementing the United Nations\nCharter, which enshrines the commitment of the people of\nthe United Nations to the advancement of humanity.\nOf course, there have been criticisms of the\nOrganization; many are legitimate and require attention.\nIt is clear, however, that the international community\nremains committed to the goals of the Charter and to the\nUnited Nations as the primary instrument for global\nproblem solving.\nThe United Nations deserves our continued support.\nIf we look at the record of just the last few years, the\nUnited Nations has conducted successful peace-keeping\noperations in Cambodia, Mozambique and Haiti. Thanks\nto the United Nations, in this decade alone 5 million\nchildren will grow up normally, children who would\notherwise have been paralysed by polio. This year the\nUnited Nations is working, as it does every year, to\nensure a better life for the almost 23 million refugees in\nthe world.\nGlobal resolve to support the United Nations and to\nadvance the interests of the international community has\nrecently been underscored by such successes as the\nindefinite extension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation\nof Nuclear Weapons. At the Halifax Summit in June,\nchaired by our Prime Minister, Jean Chr\u00e9tien, the P-8\n(Political Eight) leaders reaffirmed their strong\ncommitment to the United Nations system of international\ninstitutions and added their ideas for revitalizing it.\nThe central message is clear: we must take this\nmomentous opportunity to confirm and renew our\ncommitment to the United Nations. To do so, we require\na renewed vision for the next 50 years. This vision must\n5\n\n\nbe centred on not just striving for, but achieving, human\nsecurity on the basis of the freedom of people everywhere\nto live in peace and without fear, to be prosperous and\nenjoy equality, justice before the law and knowledge. The\nMembers of the United Nations must work together now to\nrenew the Organization and its agencies and programmes\nand to help make this vision a reality.\nIn Canada\u2019s view pursuing this vision requires a focus\non three interlinked objectives: preventing conflict;\nresponding quickly when conflict occurs; and supporting\npeace-building efforts on an ongoing basis. I will address\neach objective in turn.\n(spoke in French)\nThe first priority must be to help the United Nations\nbetter protect people from conflict. The United Nations has\nhad important successes in the past few years but,\nunfortunately, there have also been set-backs. If the United\nNations is to adapt to a changing world, if confidence in\nthe Organization is to be restored, we must learn from the\nfailures of Bosnia, Somalia and Rwanda and build on the\nsuccesses of Cambodia, Namibia and El Salvador.\nPreventive action, as the Secretary-General has laid\nout so well in \u201cAn Agenda for Peace\u201d, takes many forms,\nfrom economic development programmes to mediation, to\nthe preventive deployment of personnel \u2014 as, for example,\nin the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia \u2014 from\nthe investigation of human rights violations to the\nconclusion of agreements limiting the spread of weapons of\nmass destruction. Prevention saves lives, forestalls untold\nhuman suffering and makes the best use of limited\nresources.\nLast year I announced at this podium that Canada was\nproviding a list of Canadian experts available to the United\nNations for preventive diplomacy missions. We are also\ntaking advantage of our membership in La Francophonie,\nin the Commonwealth and in regional organizations such as\nthe Organization of American States (OAS) and the\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe\n(OSCE) precisely in order to work towards enhancing the\nability of these organizations to prevent conflicts. Our\nPrime Minister, Jean Chr\u00e9tien, is currently pressing for an\nexpanded Commonwealth role in democratization and good\ngovernance, which are two key elements of conflict\nprevention. I recently convened a meeting of La\nFrancophonie in Ottawa to generate recommendations for\nit to strengthen its role in conflict prevention, particularly\nin Africa. These recommendations will be presented to the\nleaders, the Heads of State and Government, gathered at\nthe Francophone Summit to be held in Cotonou, Benin, in\nDecember of this year.\nPrevention also means deterring crimes against\nhumanity. Canada strongly supports the early\nestablishment of an international criminal court, which\nwill, we hope, deter such crimes in the future but, should\nthey occur, would punish the perpetrators. The recently\napproved Platform for Action at the United Nations\nFourth World Conference on Women in Beijing lends\nfurther impetus in this area.\nOur recent experiences in the former Yugoslavia and\nin Rwanda emphasize the link between security and\nhuman rights. The United Nations many human rights\nmechanisms produce a wealth of information that could\nhelp us identify and understand potential areas of conflict.\nThe United Nations High Commissioner for Human\nRights has a role to play in enhancing the early warning\nfunctions of the United Nations. The experience of the\nHuman Rights Field Operation in Rwanda revealed the\nneed for the more effective coordination of United\nNations field missions. Canada has commissioned work\non the human rights components of field operations and\non stand-by arrangements for them. This work will yield\nrecommendations on ways to integrate human rights into\nUnited Nations field operations, in a way consistent with\nthe approach outlined in \u201cAn Agenda for Peace\u201d.\nOne of the priorities of Canada\u2019s foreign policy and\none of the best ways to renew commitment to the United\nNations consists of adopting a coherent approach to the\nprevention and management of complex emergencies.\nAverting crisis requires more flexibility and speed in\ndecision-making and in implementation. In this regard\nCanada supports the proposal for a conference on\nsecurity, stability and development in the Great Lakes\nregion of Central Africa. We also reaffirm our strong\nsupport for the United Nations Department of\nHumanitarian Affairs.\n(spoke in English)\nAnother major focus of Canada\u2019s preventive action\nis arms control and disarmament, especially concerning\nnuclear weapons. The historic decision to extend the\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons\n(NPT) indefinitely provides a foundation for further\nimportant gains on nuclear disarmament. We must now\ncomplete the comprehensive test-ban treaty negotiations\nas early as possible in 1996 in order to permit its\n6\n\n\nsignature at the General Assembly next September. An\nagreement to begin negotiations on a treaty to ban the\nproduction of fissionable material for nuclear weapons is\ncurrently held up. We squander such opportunities at our\nperil. Canada calls on all members of the Conference on\nDisarmament to proceed urgently with the cut-off\nnegotiations.\nRegrettably our efforts to take preventive action are\neroded by the continued global imbalance between spending\non armaments and spending on human development.\nMultilateral institutions should take trends in military and\nother unproductive spending into consideration. All States\nMembers of the United Nations should comply with the\nUnited Nations Register of Conventional Arms which will,\nwe hope, be expanded soon to include military holdings and\nnational procurement activities. Together, interested\ncountries could develop criteria to identify excessive\nmilitary expenditures and appropriate international\nresponses. Canada has taken some initiatives in this regard\nin recent months and we look forward to productive\nnegotiations with many Member States here.\nWhen a United Nations preventive diplomacy\noperation stumbles and efforts to prevent conflict fail,\nMember States all too often criticize the United Nations.\nBut much of the blame for the failures of the Organization\nlies with the Member States themselves who do not provide\nit with the tools needed for success. These tools are never\nneeded more than when a crisis erupts.\nLast year I discussed the problems the United Nations\nhas encountered in mobilizing its peace operations to\nrespond to crises. Canada\u2019s long experience with peace-\nkeeping has convinced us that improvements are possible.\nThe international community\u2019s slow response to the horrible\nand deeply distressing events in Rwanda was very much in\nour mind. It was in this context that I announced that\nCanada would examine ways to improve the capacity of the\nUnited Nations to react quickly to such events.\nToday I have the honour of presenting to the\nAssembly Canada\u2019s report entitled \u201cTowards a Rapid\nReaction Capability for the United Nations\u201d as a special\nCanadian contribution to the United Nations during its\nfiftieth anniversary year. It presents practical proposals for\nenhancing the United Nations rapid reaction capability in\nthe field of peace operations. I believe the proposals will\nboth help save lives and conserve scarce resources.\nThe report expresses the view of the Government of\nCanada, but considerable care was taken to consult with\nother Governments, non-governmental organizations and\nintergovernmental institutions. We are also deeply grateful\nto the many experts from many countries who have lent\nus their time and wisdom.\nThe main proposal of the report is the \\\"Vanguard\nConcept\\\". This concept will permit the United Nations to\nassemble, from Member States, a multifunctional force of\nup to 5,000 military and civilian personnel, and, with the\nauthorization of the Security Council, quickly deploy it\nunder the control of an operational-level headquarters.\nThis operational headquarters would be responsible for\nthe advance preparations that are crucial if rapid reaction\nis to work. Forces will be provided under enhanced stand-\nby arrangements with Member States. Our other proposals\nseek to enhance training, to create more efficient logistics\nand transportation, and to strengthen the planning efforts\nof the entire United Nations system. Let me say that none\nof the 26 recommendations in the report requires Charter\nreforms.\nBut the search for immediate, practical solutions\nmust not preclude more visionary possibilities. In this\nregard, the report looked at longer-term questions, such as\nadvanced technology in support of the United Nations\npeace operations, the feasibility of a permanent group of\ncivilian police, the idea of a United Nations Standing\nEmergency Group, a permanent force as has been\nconsidered by our colleague from the Netherlands; and\nthe question of independent sources of revenue for the\nUnited Nations system.\n(spoke in French)\nI believe that the recommendations in the report, if\nimplemented, will strengthen the United Nations capacity\nfor more rapid, effective and successful peace operations.\nThey will help restore confidence in the ability of the\nUnited Nations to respond to crises.\nWe are conscious of the fact that words are not\nenough. In the words of a former military adviser to the\nUnited Nations:\n\u201cWe can\u2019t deploy studies.\u201d\nFor Canada this report is only the first step in\ntranslating ideas into action. To meet the growing need\nfor civilian personnel during crises, Canada will offer the\nUnited Nations secondment or the loan of civilian\npersonnel on a short-term urgent basis to help in the\ndevelopment of a fully trained capacity in the areas of\n7\n\n\nhuman rights, legal advice, humanitarian assistance, and\nother aspects of a rapid civilian response to crises.\nLast week Canada sent the Secretary-General an\nupdated inventory of Canadian personnel and equipment on\nstand-by to the United Nations, including technical\ninformation that would be crucial to rapid response. We are\nnow prepared to negotiate with the United Nations a more\ndetailed memorandum of understanding on stand-by\narrangements, which would include more information on\nreadiness and capability standards.\nOur report devotes special attention to the creation of\nan operational-level headquarters as the heart of the\n\u201cVanguard\u201d concept. Canada is prepared to help in\nestablishing its headquarters should the United Nations\ndecide to accept this recommendation. We have already\nmade a significant number of military personnel available\nto the United Nations on secondment or on loan. We are\nprepared to make available additional personnel, both\ncivilian and military, in order to bring this idea closer to\nrealization.\nThe time for moving towards fundamental\nimprovements in the way the United Nations responds to\ncrises is now. A number of countries have advanced\nproposals similar to Canada\u2019s and there are many new and\ninteresting proposals for change coming also from the non-\ngovernmental sector.\nFollow-up is of key importance. We need to marshal\nour energies, to determine the most promising areas of\naction, and to move quickly towards putting words into\naction. Over the coming weeks and months, Canada intends\nto work closely with like-minded countries from around the\nworld, and, of course, with the United Nations Secretariat\nto this end.\nThe ongoing work of peace-building must continue\nalongside preventive diplomacy and now rapid reaction\noperations. Indeed, peace-building involves a wide range of\nactivities. Much of the work needed for articulating a broad\nvision of human security has already been done in the\nseries of United Nations conferences in the economic and\nsocial fields, culminating in the Platform for Action\nrecently adopted at the United Nations Conference on\nWomen. It sets out a comprehensive view of sustainable\ndevelopment, which balances economic and social agendas\nfor the purpose of promoting the well-being of society. This\nglobal consensus offers an opportunity to restore confidence\nin the work of the United Nations system in these fields,\nand to dispel the perception of aimlessness and drift. The\nUnited Nations can continue to play an invaluable role in\nforging global agreements on development goals, in\nadvocating core values, and in responding to humanitarian\nand development needs.\nWe must seek to anchor change in a commitment to\npeople-centred sustainable development. A strong\nemphasis must be placed on the reduction of poverty and\non the integration of the poorest countries into the world\neconomy. However, no single country, or even group of\ncountries, can achieve global results alone. We are,\ntherefore, determined to work with all Member States to\npursue these goals sufficiently and effectively. Let me\ntake this opportunity to set out some ideas on the way to\nrenew commitment to the economic and social work of\nthe United Nations.\nFirst, there is a need to achieve the right balance\nbetween wide-ranging debate and decisions on which\nprogrammes should be adopted. The justified breadth of\ndebate does not mean that United Nations programs\nshould be established to address every problem. There are\nmany other actors who play important roles. The United\nNations should focus on what it is uniquely equipped to\nachieve.\nSecondly, there is a need for a fresh sense of the\nreal goals of development. The outcomes of the major\nconferences are at the core, and their distillation and\ncoordinated follow-up should be a touchstone for the\nUnited Nations in the economic and social fields.\nThe roles and functions of organizations and\nagencies should be examined and refocused to ensure that\nthey are oriented to future needs. The Agenda for\nDevelopment is an important opportunity to initiate the\ninstitutional change required.\nImproving cooperation with and among specialized\nagencies is essential to give limited resources some\nimpact. The Economic and Social Council must take more\nresponsibility for policy coordination within the United\nNations system. A start was made this summer in Geneva.\nThe recent establishment of the United Nations\nProgramme on AIDS is a promising example. There, the\nexecutive heads of agencies and programmes must\ndemonstrate leadership, particularly in coordinating the\nfollow-up to international conferences and ensuring that\nduplication, overlapping and needless spending are\neliminated as far as possible.\n8\n\n\nWe must effectively harness the complementary roles\nof the United Nations and the Bretton Woods institutions.\nTo ensure a smooth transition from emergencies to\nrehabilitation, improved cooperation in crises must be an\nimmediate priority. I urge the Secretary-General and the\nleaders of the World Bank and the International Monetary\nFund (IMF) to propose new arrangements for post-crisis\nassistance. They could also establish a high-level working\ngroup to consider how to strengthen cooperation, both at\nthe Organization\u2019s Headquarters and elsewhere, in areas\nsuch as data collection, analysis and reporting. The World\nTrade Organization (WTO) should also participate in\nrelevant aspects of this work.\nWe have all come to understand the extent to which\nhuman security is indivisible from environmental security.\nMore and more conflicts are arising following disagreement\nover the use of finite natural resources. The United Nations\ntherefore has a key role to play in promoting sustainable\ndevelopment. Canada welcomes the recent success of\nUnited Nations conferences in some areas of international\nresource-management operations, such as the United\nNations Conference on Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly\nMigratory Fish Stocks. Our goal is concrete, internationally\nsanctioned conservation measures. The same objective\napplies to our efforts to ensure the sustainable management\nof forests and arable land.\nThe Rio Summit achieved landmark agreements on\nclimate change and biodiversity. Canada welcomes the\nprogress made by the Commission on Sustainable\nDevelopment and by the United Nations Environment\nProgramme (UNEP), in clarifying their respective roles in\nfollowing up these agreements in collaboration with\nMember States.\n(spoke in English)\nIn speaking about the three elements \u2014 preventive\naction, rapid reaction and peacebuilding \u2014 I wish to\nemphasize the need to see them as mutually reinforcing.\nUnited Nations Member States must be committed to all\nthree in order for any one to be successful.\nTo ensure a renewal of the United Nations vision\nthrough these actions, we must also reassert our\ncommitment to assuring the effectiveness of its key bodies.\nAlthough I could speak of many United Nations agencies\nin this regard, because of its critical role in promoting the\nvision of the next 50 years, I will limit my remarks to the\nSecurity Council.\nThe Security Council\u2019s mandate to help prevent\ndisputes and to resolve conflicts confer on it unique\nresponsibilities. The binding nature of some decisions\nadds further weight to its deliberations.\nIn recent years the Council has experienced a period\nof intensified activity. It has also experienced setbacks\nfrom which we can all learn. One lesson of particular\nimportance is that members of the Security Council,\nespecially the permanent five, need to demonstrate a firm\ncommitment to the implementation of their own decisions.\nFor Canada, the need for more open, transparent and\ncollegial decision-making is crucial. There must be closer\nconsultations with countries contributing personnel and\nequipment in order to help implement Council decisions.\nHere, real progress has been achieved of late, which\nCanada warmly welcomes. This progress needs to be\ninstitutionalized.\nThe credibility and effectiveness of the Council in\npromoting international peace and security is also a key\nelement. Although we do not regard expansion of its\nmembership as a panacea, it is clear that composition\nplays a role in fostering credibility and effectiveness. The\nCouncil is no longer as representative as it once was. Its\nlegitimacy,and perhaps also the quality of its decisions,\nwould be greatly enhanced by more representation from\nthose countries that contribute the most to the\nmaintenance of international peace and security and to the\nbroad purpose of the Organization \u2014 that is, the key\ncriterion for non-permanent membership enshrined in\nArticle 23 of the Charter.\nPerhaps it is time to reflect together on those\npurposes to which Article 23 refers. They would surely\ninclude participation in United Nations peace operations,\ncommitment to arms control and disarmament, support for\ngood-neighbourly relations, humanitarian assistance,\nhuman rights, development cooperation and the promotion\nof civil society. An understanding among Member States\nalong these lines would help in the selection of\nnon-permanent Council members, whether on the existing\nbasis or on a modified basis.\nA recurring theme throughout my remarks has been\nthe need for the United Nations to marshal its scarce\nresources more effectively. There is simply no other\noption if we are to restore confidence in this Organization\nand in the specialized agencies. As the Secretary-General\nhas stressed, the Organization\u2019s financial crisis is\n9\n\n\ncrippling its effectiveness and its credibility. We cannot\nallow this to happen.\nThe answer lies in addressing both expenditure and\nrevenue. Many Governments, including Canada\u2019s, are\nfacing difficult budgetary decisions. We have had to live\nwith expenditure reductions in real terms while maintaining\npriority programmes. International organizations must\nrespect the same pressures as domestic Governments. The\nUnited Nations and its agencies must focus on key\nobjectives and reduce overhead spending in order to protect\npriority programmes. In fact, there are many steps that chief\nexecutive officers can take to increase efficiency and to\nreduce costs without impairing programmes, and we should\nall insist that they do so. Similarly, many agencies\u2019 budgets\nshould be held at present levels, wherever possible, if not\nreduced. Member States must work collectively to this end.\nCanada strongly supports the proposal put forward by the\nSecretary-General for an efficiency task force to address\nthese issues. We are prepared to contribute both expertise\nand personnel to get it started soon.\nWhile the United Nations needs to do more to limit\nspending and to promote efficiency, its financial crisis\nwould be significantly alleviated if its Member States were\nto meet their financial obligations in full, on time and\nwithout conditions. Canada calls on all Member States to\ndo so. We cannot accept that Member States, some of\nwhich rank among the richest countries in the world, fail to\nmeet their financial obligations to this institution. This is\neven more difficult to accept when we consider that a\nnumber of the poorest countries in the world meet their\npayments in full and on time. Indeed, among the merely 60\nMember States that had met their regular budget obligations\nto the United Nations fully by 31 July of this year, 32 were\ndeveloping countries. Unfortunately, 71 other Member\nStates had made no payment at all. Almost 100 countries\nstill owe money from previous years, including, I have to\nsay, several members of the Security Council. The majority\nof Member States appear content to approve programmes,\nappropriations and assessments without honouring the\nobligations to which they are committed. This is\nunacceptable and cannot be allowed to continue.\nThe General Assembly\u2019s High-level Working Group\nconsidering the United Nations financial plight should begin\nlooking at the establishment of incentives to pay. It should\nalso agree on an equitable method of sharing the burden,\nfree of the distortions that characterize the present scale of\nassessments.\nIn conclusion, let me say that I have sought to pay\ntribute to this Organization\u2019s achievements, and to\nemphasize that Canada strongly supports the United\nNations. We are prepared to contribute concretely and\nactively to its revitalization and renewal. But confidence\nwill be restored and commitment renewed only through a\npartnership in which Member States live up to their\ncommitment and focus on key priorities that respond to\nhuman-centred goals for sustainable security and\ndevelopment. If we are successful, and frankly I truly\nbelieve that we will be successful, I have no doubt that 50\nyears from now our successors will be able to praise,\nwithout hesitation or qualification, the record of our\nOrganization\u2019s first 100 years.\n"

        "file_text": "Please permit me to\noffer you, Mr. President, our congratulations on your\nelection to your high office and to assure you of our\nsupport and cooperation.\nTo the Secretary-General we wish to express our\nhighest regards and admiration for his leadership; and to the\nPresident of the General Assembly at its forty-ninth session,\nour deep appreciation for his contribution.\nThis is also a most fitting occasion for me personally\nto congratulate our brother and neighbour in the Pacific the\nRepublic of Palau on becoming a full Member of the\nUnited Nations. My delegation eagerly looks forward to\nworking closely with that country.\nToday, as we celebrate the passing of 50 years since\nthe creation of the United Nations, we must also reflect on\nthe events associated with the purpose for which this body\nwas created. The havoc wreaked upon humanity by the\nSecond World War prompted the founding fathers to devise\nan instrument to ensure a stable world and a better future.\nMy purpose today is, first, to recognize those areas\nin which this body has undertaken some major initiatives\nin various sectors that are of great and direct significance\nto us in the Marshall Islands. I also will state briefly\nsome of our concerns with respect to our membership in\nthe United Nations, and then I intend to raise those issues\nwhose implications have critical consequences for our\nsurvival in our country. As members will note, some of\nthese have been raised a number of times in this forum\nduring the past sessions of this body.\nThis year, the completion of the United Nations\nConference on Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly\nMigratory Fish Stocks is of particular importance to my\ncountry, and my Government intends to sign and ratify\nthe agreement, which was finalized this summer. We are\nindebted to the very able leadership of the Chairman,\nAmbassador Nandan, from Fiji. The Marshall Islands has\ngiven its full support to the Ambassador in his\ncandidature to the post of Secretary General of the\nInternational Seabed Authority.\nI wish to acknowledge the support we have received\nfrom the Intergovernmental Panel of Experts of the\nClimate Change Convention. The scientific evidence we\nreceived from them in order adequately to address the\nConvention confirmed our belief in the existence of such\nphenomena as sea-level rise in many of our low-lying\nislands and in our region.\nWe are particularly concerned by the strong\npossibility that the Alliance of Small Island States\n\n\n(AOSIS) Protocol, now known as the Berlin Mandate,\nmight be derailed because of intransigent short-term\neconomic interests. Such a possibility, arising solely from\nthe desire to facilitate the selling of more oil, if real,\nimperils our very survival. We will not accept such a\ncondition and we urge that interference and delaying tactics\nthat hamper the work of AOSIS and other concerned\ncountries should cease. The increasing level of destruction\ncaused by hurricanes and storms is a clear signal that the\nmatter is urgent. We have deep sympathy with our friends\nin the Caribbean countries and in the United States who\nwere recently struck by this devastation.\nThe follow-up of the Global Conference on the\nSustainable Development of Small Island Developing States\nthat was held in Barbados last year will be looked at during\nthis General Assembly session. The comprehensive and\nambitious programme involved has received the\nwholehearted endorsement and support of the Marshall\nIslands Government. In this regard, may I extend our warm\nthanks to the Chairman of AOSIS, Her Excellency\nAmbassador Annette des Iles of Trinidad and Tobago, for\nall her efforts.\nMy Government also looks forward to receiving the\nrecommendations of the Fourth World Conference on\nWomen held in Beijing last month. We will work closely\nwith the United Nations to ensure that the recommendations\narticulated in the Conference are appropriately addressed.\nMr. President, we endorse without hesitation the\nconcern expressed in your statement in September of this\nyear, in which you stated: \u201cEfforts must be made to ensure\nthat all States that are not yet Members should seek to be\nadmitted in the near future\u201d (Official Records of the\nGeneral Assembly, Fiftieth Session, Plenary Meetings,\n1st meeting, p. 7)\nIn the light of this view, the reasons underlying the\ninability of many of these nations to become Members of\nthe United Nations should be examined. My delegation\nfeels that the unfair burden that is borne by many of the\nless developed countries with respect to the current system\nof assessing the scale of contributions to the regular budget\nand for peace-keeping operations deters others from seeking\ntheir rightful place in this community of nations.\nThe Marshall Islands participated actively in the High-\nlevel Open-ended Working Group on the Financial Situation\nof the United Nations, and we concur fully with the\nrecommendation that the current floor rate should either be\nabolished, reduced substantially, or be designed according\nto a formula by which a country is assessed on the basis\nof its capacity to pay. A decision to that effect by the\nGeneral Assembly at this session will undoubtedly help\nexpedite the realization of the goal that you,\nMr. President, envisioned.\nThe current inequities with respect to the existing\nfloor rate have also been noted in a number of reports,\nincluding that of the Committee on Contributions. My\ndelegation strongly urges the United Nations to take\naction on the recommendations made by that Committee\nas soon as possible.\nThe need to undertake certain structural reforms\nwithin the United Nations in order to make it more\nefficient and responsive to the changing needs of present-\nday society is critical. One such area which should be\nclosely looked at is the Security Council, where the\nconcept of permanent membership does not, in our view,\nconstitute fair democratic representation. We are,\nhowever, aware of the differences in capabilities which\nexist among nations. We are aware, too, of the need for\nthis issue to be carefully weighed and believe that\npossible solutions, including Italy\u2019s proposal for a more\nformal set of subgroups or constituencies, should be\nseriously studied. This would be particularly helpful\nwithin our own regional group. We are hopeful that the\nHigh-level Working Group on the Security Council will\nact with wise expediency to devise viable and acceptable\nsolutions to this important issue.\nWe are also carefully studying the various reports\nand proposals developed by different groups on the work\nof other agencies of the United Nations. One aspect which\nwe consider to be of great importance is the need to\ndetermine whether the existence of some of the agencies\nrealistically justifies the resources provided for their\nsupport. We must arrive at a frank assessment of whether\nthe tasks entrusted to an agency are actually carried out\nin a meaningful way, and what that work produces in\nterms of results. As long as this issue remains\ninadequately addressed, the climate of resentment and\nsuspicion will persist and may give rise to adverse effects\non the level of contributions needed to support the work\nof the United Nations. We must make urgent progress to\ncomplete this task of reform.\nThe Convention on Biological Diversity and its\nfundamental tenet regarding the conservation and\nsustainable use of our resources is under serious threat\nfrom human activities. Evidence derived from data\ngathered in our country suggests in no uncertain terms\n2\n\n\nthat nuclear contaminants resulting directly from nuclear-\nweapons tests conducted in our country have entered our\nbasic food chain, upon which our very livelihood depends\ncausing, among other things, extensive health risks.\nWe must also pause and reflect on the plight of those\ngroups of victims who, while the rest of the world was\nenjoying the benefits and freedom of the post-war period,\nwere themselves caught between the crossfire of super-\nPower rivalries. One such unfortunate group was the people\nof the Marshall Islands.\nWe are steadily unravelling the large amount of\ninformation now available to us on the nature and\nconsequences of nuclear testing activities carried out in the\nMarshall Islands. We are deeply disturbed and alarmed at\nwhat we are uncovering. For in addition to the unfortunate\nnuclear tests, we unearthed something just as horrifying as\nthe nuclear tests themselves, if not more so. It grieves me\nimmeasurably to report today that in one of the Trusteeship\ndocuments we discovered it was confirmed that in a\nmeeting held in New York on 10 May 1954, the Secretary-\nGeneral of the United Nations agreed at the urging of the\nthen United States Ambassador, Mr. Lodge, to withhold\nfrom circulation to Member States a petition from the\nMarshall Islands. The Marshallese petition, which pleaded\nwith the United Nations to put an immediate halt to the\ntests was to be withheld by the Secretary-General pending\nthe completion of the test series. In this petition, the people\nof the Marshall Islands, through their leaders, had expressed\ntheir genuine fears and concerns to the only world\ninstitution they believed could help them. In return,\nhowever, the high executives in this institution not only\nfailed to consider this a matter of any significant\nimportance, but actually engaged in an act most unbefitting\nthe integrity of this august body.\nThe ethical implications of this act, unimaginable as\nthey may be, are obvious. Nevertheless, I am raising the\nissue, and I can assure the Assembly that we shall continue\nto do so in various United Nations and other international\nforums. We shall do so until the international community\ntakes action to address our concerns and until this\nOrganization acknowledges the support lent by high\nofficials to nuclear testing in the Marshall Islands.\nWe want to bring to the attention of the international\ncommunity the reality and the magnitude of the effect of\nthese tests on our health, our environment and our future\ndevelopment as a nation. We also want it to become aware\nof our daily struggle to cope with a situation whose\nradiation-induced nature continues to haunt us, whose\ncomplexity in terms of solutions is far beyond our\ncapacity to handle and whose conception was solely for\nthe purpose of countering hostilities and tensions that bore\nno relationship whatsoever to the Marshall Islands.\nAnd so I ask Member States, when they hear us\nspeaking out about the perils of radiation, to think about\nthese in terms of human suffering and to try to visualize\nMarshallese children being born faceless, with no bones,\nor with missing or extra limbs \u2014 the jellyfish babies, as\nsome have come to call them \u2014 and the irreparable\ndamage wreaked upon the reproductive health of their\nmothers.\nIt would be remiss of me, however, not to\nacknowledge some of the efforts made by the former\nTrustee in addressing our health and environmental\nproblems caused by radioactive contaminants. We also\nfeel that the international community has an obligation to\ntake serious note of our concerns, as well as to undertake\na leading and active role in ensuring that an acceptable\nprocess, designed to restore the Marshall Islands to\nhabitable conditions, is effectively and expeditiously set\nin motion. We were, after all, entrusted by the United\nNations itself, and so this body had the moral obligation\nand the irrefutable responsibility at the time of testing to\noversee these activities and to make our safety its primary\nconcern. The same moral obligation, in our view, remains\nbinding even today.\nPerhaps one of the most gratifying things\noccurring \u2014 which, I might add, is giving us a ray of\nhope \u2014 is that there is now a growing consciousness of\nthe fact that nothing short of a collective effort is needed\nin order to focus on this issue. That some nations are\nbeginning, although slowly, to understand and sympathize\nwith our plight is most encouraging. This consciousness\nis clearly reflected in their willingness to incorporate our\nconcerns into pertinent and relevant international texts. I\nshould like to cite some examples.\nThe Review and Extension Conference of the States\nParties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\nWeapons, for example, took special note of the\ninternational community\u2019s responsibility to assist the\ninhabitants and restore the environment of the former\nUnited Nations Trust Territories that were adversely\naffected by nuclear-weapons-testing programmes.\nThe Fourth World Conference on Women, held this\nyear in Beijing, recognized that the concept and practice\nof environmental degradation are incongruent with\n3\n\n\ndevelopment and that the use and testing of nuclear\nweapons are undeniably one factor in the destruction of the\nenvironment, the displacement of people and the creation of\nhigh health risks.\nThe South Pacific Forum, held last month in Papua\nNew Guinea, called upon all Governments and international\norganizations with expertise in the field of clean-up and the\ndisposal of radioactive contaminants to give appropriate\nassistance for remedial purposes when so requested by\naffected countries. The Forum also noted the existence of\na special responsibility towards those peoples of the former\nUnited Nations Trust Territory administered by the United\nStates that had been adversely affected by nuclear-weapon\ntests conducted during the period of the Trusteeship. This\nresponsibility includes the safe resettlement of displaced\nhuman populations and the restoration to economic\nproductivity of affected areas, the provision of adequate\nhealth care and compensation for the loss of life, land and\nhealth.\nDuring the post-Forum dialogue in Papua New Guinea\nour former Trustee \u2014 the United States \u2014 took the\nposition that it would not stand in the way of the Marshall\nIslands\u2019 exploring the question of or soliciting assistance\nfrom other countries or organizations for the purposes of\nthe disposal of radioactive contaminants, the resettlement of\naffected populations and the economic restoration of the\nenvironment. Our sincere hope, however, is that the United\nStates will not take its advocating of such a position as an\nopportunity to bow out of its obligations. It is our hope that\nit will, instead, redouble its efforts and, with the assistance\nof other nations and international bodies, lend its full\nsupport for the goal of making our country free of\nradioactive contaminants.\nI should also like to take this opportunity to thank the\ncurrent Administration for its willingness to acknowledge\nthe United States Government\u2019s role in using human beings\nfor radiation experiments, including at least two confirmed\ninstances of medical research, which did not provide any\ndirect benefit to Marshallese subjects.\nThe unearthing of these horrendous activities is an act\nof political courage on President Clinton\u2019s part. For the\nMarshall Islands, the White House Advisory Committee on\nHuman Radiation Experiments uncovered vital information\nabout the effect of radiation on people and the environment.\nThe Marshall Islands appreciates the United States\nGovernment\u2019s recognition that the now infamous Bravo\nblast was not the only weapon that exposed the Marshallese\npeople and environment to radiation. It is worth bearing in\nmind that, while Bravo was the equivalent of 1,000\nHiroshima bombs, the total megaton equivalent of\nweapons tested in the Marshall Islands exceeded 7,000\nHiroshima bombs.\nIt is an important step in our countries\u2019 bilateral\nrelations that we can now begin to broaden our discussion\nof exposure. Exposure will never again be defined in\nterms of fallout from Bravo alone, but will now\nincorporate the cumulative effects of all the tests and the\neffects of residual contamination in the environment. The\nMarshall Islands looks forward to continuing to work with\nthe United States Congress and the Clinton\nAdministration to ensure that the recommendations of the\nAdvisory Committee are fully implemented \u2014 including\nthe recommendation concerning whether it would be\nappropriate to add the populations of other atolls to the\nsouth and east of the blasts that have shown excessive\nthyroid abnormalities. We hope that the international\ncommunity will give these efforts its full support.\nAs if our own four decades of painful experience\nwith the dreadful business of nuclear testing were not\nenough, there appeared once again this year in our\nbeautiful Pacific the trauma of yet a further series of\nnuclear tests, intended to continue until May next year. I\nrefer of course to the French resumption this year of\nnuclear testing at Mururoa. It is probably because we are\nfar removed from metropolitan centres that there is a\ntendency for certain people to look at the Pacific as the\n\u201cideal desert\u201d for nuclear testing, as one French official\nrecently put it. Often overlooked too is the fact that all\nisland nations spread out across the length and breadth of\nthe Pacific are connected by this mighty ocean. Nuclear\ndamage to one island nation poses immense long-term\nimplications and dangers to others in the region.\nAs people who are living the nightmarish experience\nof nuclear testing, we cannot and will not accept the weak\nargument that the current tests are safe for any of our\nPacific neighbours and friends. Nor can we accept the\ncontinuation of this irresponsible practice in the region.\nWe have denounced its resumption from the beginning\nand will continue to do so.\nWe joined in support of New Zealand\u2019s case against\nFrance in the International Court of Justice. We took this\naction with great regret since France has always been a\nconstructive partner in our relationship with the developed\nworld. It is simply incomprehensible to us that this great\nnation of culture, science and fine arts could visit this\nabomination upon us in the Pacific region. We protested\n4\n\n\nto the French authorities, but the first tests went ahead\nanyway. Although the International Court of Justice\ndeclined to hear the case, the decision was entirely based\non technicalities. France should not think that this is a\nvictory for it, as many of the judges pointed out that there\nwas a strong moral and legal background for halting the\ntests. I strongly disagree with the claim made by the French\nForeign Minister here a few weeks ago \u2014 that the tests\nwere environmentally safe. Look at the situation I have just\ndescribed in the Marshall Islands. We have also received\ndocumentation from a number of eminent scientists which\nwould, at the very least, warrant exercising caution.\nFurthermore, France is a State party to the Noumea\nConvention for the Protection and Development of Natural\nResources and Environment of the South Pacific Region as\nwell as the Convention on Biological Diversity. The\nprinciple of environmental-impact assessment and the\nprecautionary approach are not compatible with the\nactivities that it is carrying out today. The offer to carry out\nan impact assessment after the tests are finished is a\nridiculous offer, since by then it might be much too late.\nThe tests are violating treaties and they are violating our\nenvironment, and I also think that they are a violation of\nour human rights. The tests must stop. They must stop now.\nThe collective voice of the leaders of the countries of\nthe South Pacific Forum was heard when a statement was\nissued during its meeting in Papua New Guinea expressing\nextreme outrage at the resumption of French nuclear testing\nin the Pacific. They demanded that France desist from any\nfurther tests. The outrage was especially compounded by\nthe intransigence of France, and the People\u2019s Republic of\nChina, in persisting with their nuclear tests in the face of\nthe strong views of the Pacific region. My Government\nstands by the decision announced last week by the\nChairman of the Forum, Sir Julius Chan, that France is no\nlonger invited to the post-Forum dialogue.\nWe are in full support of the extension of the Non-\nProliferation Treaty. We will also work actively to achieve\na breakthrough in the negotiations for a comprehensive test-\nban treaty. We also acknowledge the support of just, fair-\nminded and world-conscious leaders and peoples, who have\ncondemned and continue to condemn this anachronistic\nseries of tests in the Pacific. We join our voice to theirs in\nsupport.\nThis session provides the community of nations with\na unique opportunity to examine our past performance\nrecord. As a world-governing institution, the United Nations\nmust look closely at its strengths and build upon them.\nLikewise, it must pay particular attention to its\nshortcomings and weaknesses so that it can continue to\nprovide much-needed hope, strength and direction to the\nnations of the world.\n"

        "file_text": "On\nbehalf of the delegation of the Kingdom of Morocco, I am\npleased to extend to the President my sincere\ncongratulations on his election to the presidency of the\nfiftieth session of the General Assembly.\nI am convinced that his diplomatic experience,\nexcellent knowledge of international issues, and the many\nresponsibilities that were assigned to him will ensure the\nsuccess of our work and help us achieve the best results.\nI also wish to assure the President that the delegation\nof the Kingdom of Morocco will spare no effort in\ncooperating with him and in providing every support to\nfacilitate his task. I also salute in him the representative\nof a country which shares strong ties of friendship,\ncooperation and good-neighbourliness with Morocco.\nI should like to avail myself of this opportunity to\npay tribute to the outgoing President, Mr. Amara Essy,\nfor his excellent conduct of the work of our previous\nsession.\nI should like also to express my deep appreciation to\nMr. Boutros-Boutros Ghali, the Secretary General, for his\nuntiring efforts towards the promotion of peace and\nsecurity and for his constant endeavours in facing up to\nthe tremendous responsibilities shouldered by the United\nNations as a result of the developments that took place in\nthe world over the past few years.\nThose efforts of the Secretary-General acquire\ngreater importance at a time when our Organization faces\nan unprecedented financial crisis.\nThis session stands out by the fact that it coincides\nwith the fiftieth anniversary of our Organization. We may\nrecall the day, 50 years ago, which gave rise to hope that\n\n\nwe were embarking on an age of emancipation, liberty,\nindependence and the maintenance of peace and security.\nThat day heralded, for all humanity, the dawn of a new era\nthat was received with joy as it was to be the beginning of\na path of dialogue and cooperation that affected an\nalternative to violence and confrontation.\nThe important changes in international relations\nwitnessed by the world over the past few years did usher in\na new world situation. However, the fact that, in the new\nsituation, the economic interests of the major Powers\ncontinued to have the upper hand frustrated the hopes of the\ndeveloping countries that a new era of genuine solidarity\nbetween the rich and the poor was about to emerge and\nserve the legitimate interests of all the members of the\ninternational Community.\nAs we see it, the economic and social situation in\nmost countries of the South gives no cause for hope or\noptimism. The gap between developed and developing\ncountries is still widening, and the economic, commercial,\nand social problems of the developing countries are only\nworsening. This has thrown the doors wide open to such\nphenomena as extremism, fanaticism and terrorism,\nscourges that we must confront and curb.\nIn order for us to do so, the world economy has to be\nrestructured in the context of genuine cooperation between\nall nations and an earnest dialogue in which the rich\ncountries would shoulder their full responsibilities towards\nthe promotion of an international partnership whose aim\nshould be to find viable solutions to this problem that\nwould work in favour of men\u2019s moral and material\ninterests, wherever they may be: North or South.\nWhile we welcome the initiatives taken towards the\nrestructuring of the world economy since the ratification of\nthe General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the\nsubsequent inception of the World Trade Organization, and\nthe steps taken by numerous developing nations, including\nMorocco, to restructure their economies with a view to\nintegrating those economies into the world economy, we\nbelieve that such initiatives, by themselves, will not be\nsufficient to lead to solutions to the economic, trade and\nfinancial problems that beset the third world. We hope that\nthe World Trade Organization will adequately and fully\ndischarge its responsibilities and that it will be provided\nwith the necessary means that would make it an effective\ntool and enable it to translate into reality the commitments\nmade.\nWe hope that the current negotiations amongst the\nvarious international organizations concerned will lead to\nthe desired coordination between monetary, financial and\ntrade policies and thereby lead to the laying of genuine\nfoundations for free international trade, wherein there\nwould be no deterioration in the terms of trade or any\ndecline in the prices of primary commodities. We also\nhope that those discussions will mark the beginning of a\nreconsideration of the concept of foreign debt from which\nthe developing countries suffer.\nThe African continent is in the grip of a disastrous\neconomic and social situation. Morocco views with\nconcern the deterioration of this situation as it is part of\nthe African continent, and is a member of the African\nfamily that has a long history of shared struggle for\nliberation and emancipation which binds it to all the\npeoples of Africa.\nGiven the gravity of a situation, that portends untold\ntragedies, Morocco calls on the international community\nto make a concerted effort to find a solution to the\nworsening problems of Africa.\nIn our opinion, the strategic perspective and the\napproach adopted so far in tackling those problems will\nnot lead to any improvement or substantial qualitative\nchange so long as the international community does not\ncommit itself to a long-term strategy that embodies\nconcrete commitments in favour of Africa. Such a\nstrategy, as we see it, should be part of a comprehensive\nperspective aimed at improving the level of social and\neconomic development in Africa with a view to\nintegrating the continent into the world economy and\nenabling it to benefit from its dividends. In this respect,\nMorocco calls for a speeding up of the implementation of\nthe Convention to combat desertification in order to meet\nthe needs of our continent at both the national and\ninternational levels.\nIn spite of the efforts made by the United Nations\nand repeated calls from this rostrum to give pride of place\nto dialogue, and to solve conflicts by peaceful means and\npreventive diplomacy, some regions in the world continue\nto be the scene of armed conflicts and civil wars which\ncrush our hopes of establishing lasting peace and security.\nBy the same token, the proliferation of weapons of mass\ndestruction, especially nuclear weapons, still threatens our\nworld and should be addressed most earnestly in order to\navoid irreparable disasters.\n2\n\n\nIn this respect Morocco has effectively contributed to\nthe indefinite extension of the Treaty on the Non-\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and hopes that all\ncountries will accede to this important Treaty and thereby\nensure its universality. Morocco also hopes that the Middle\nEast will be exempt from all weapons of mass destruction,\nas has been the case for other regions of the world. This is\none of the noble objectives that the Organization should\nwork for so that all may channel the funds tied up in this\nfield to development and to combating all forms of\nunderdevelopment.\nIt is indeed cause for optimism that progress has been\nmade in the negotiations on the test-ban treaty, especially\nthe pledge made by the Conference on Disarmament to\nconclude a treaty concerning this issue before the end of\n1996.\nThe era of colonialism is now a thing of the past. As\na matter of fact, this has been one of the great\nachievements of the past 50 years. Unfortunately however,\nthe two Moroccan cities of Sebta and Melilia and the\nneighbouring islands are still under Spanish occupation.\nThese enclaves, which are part and parcel of Moroccan\nterritory, and which overlook the Mediterranean sea, are\nthus the last remaining colonies in Africa. Such a situation\nis indeed a strange anomaly which neither reason nor logic\ncan accept and which clashes head on with the spirit and\nthe letter of the United Nations Charter.\nIn this context, may I recall the major stages which\nMorocco has gone through in order to complete its\nterritorial integrity. Since its independence in 1956,\nMorocco started negotiations with Spain in order to\ncomplete its independence, hence the withdrawal, in 1958,\nfrom the region of Tarfaya, which is part of the Moroccan\nSahara, then the withdrawal from the region of Sidi Ifni in\n1969. In 1975, after a period of alternating dialogue and\ntension, Morocco recovered its other southern provinces.\nThe only parts that are still under Spanish colonization are\nSebta and Melilia and the neighbouring islands.\nMorocco, which opted for dialogue as a fundamental\nprinciple in its policy vis-\u00e0-vis its neighbours, propounded\nthat principle in international forums as the best means of\navoiding armed conflict and sought to settle all problems by\npeaceful means, remains convinced that its historical ties\nwith Spain, coupled with the two countries\u2019 common\neconomic interests, will help overcome the difficulties that\nstand in the way of a solution to this dispute.\nMorocco considers Spain to be one of its most\nimportant economic and political partners in view of the\nsize of Spain\u2019s investments in Morocco, the volume of\ntrade between the two countries, the joint development\nprojects, such as the intercontinental link between Spain\nand Morocco that would link the African and European\ncontinents, as well as the burgeoning cooperation in the\nareas of culture and tourism.\nWe are convinced that if all this is taken into\naccount, it would help resolve the disputes. We believe\nthat the best framework for the desired settlement is to be\nfound in the proposal made to Spain by His Majesty King\nHassan II, to set up a reflection and consultation\ncommittee with the aim of finding a solution to the\nproblem of Sebta and Melilia that would allow Morocco\nto exercise its sovereignty over the two cities and the\nneighbouring islands while preserving Spain\u2019s economic\ninterests.\nThe Arab Maghreb Union has made considerable\nprogress on the road to Maghreb unity. Morocco, which,\nlike its neighbours, believes that the Union is a strategic\nchoice, is determined to overcome the few remaining\nobstacles in the way of progress towards unity. In this era\nof economic blocs, the creation of the Arab Maghreb\nUnion is an unavoidable necessity if regional integration\nis to be achieved, if challenges are to be met and if we\nare to ensure the progress and prosperity of our peoples,\nwho are united by the bonds of common language,\nreligion and history.\nI am sure that idea of establishing the Arab Maghreb\nUnion, which reflects an ancient historical reality, will\ncome to fruition as have other regional blocs that have\nachieved a high level of integration and unity even\nwithout enjoying the bonds that unite the Arab Maghreb\nUnion.\nIn recent years, the Middle East has witnessed many\ndevelopments that have created an opportunity to achieve\npeace and to end the Arab-Israeli conflict on the basis of\nthe principles of land for peace, respect for the national\nand political rights of the Palestinian people and the\nestablishment of their own State, with Al Quds as its\ncapital.\nOne of the decisive events in the region was the\nconclusion of the Israeli-Palestinian Agreement signed at\nWashington D.C., which confirmed that the peace process\nin the region is irreversible, notwithstanding the obstacles\nit is encountering. The Jordanian-Israeli agreement also\n3\n\n\nconfirmed that the logic of tolerance and coexistence in the\nframework of a just, lasting and comprehensive peace based\non international legality is now an absolute necessity for all.\nIn this connection we welcome with satisfaction the\nTaba Agreement that was signed in Washington D.C.\nbetween the Palestinians and the Israelis, an important\nmilestone on the road towards the establishment of peace\nand security in the region. It is our fervent hope that the\ntwo parties will be able to overcome existing obstacles and\nshow a firm determination to settle pending problems,\nbearing in mind the legitimate interests of all and respecting\ntheir commitments and the behests of international legality.\nOptimistic as we are about the progress on the Israeli-\nJordanian and the Israeli-Palestinian tracks, we hope that\npositive development will materialize on the Israeli-Syrian\nand Israeli-Lebanese tracks which would lead to results\nacceptable to all parties on the basis of the relevant\nresolutions of the United Nations Security Council and\nGeneral Assembly, particularly Security Council resolutions\n242 (1967), 338 (1973) and 425 (1978).\nLast year, in an attempt to promote the peace process\nin the region, Morocco acted as host to the very first\nEconomic Summit for the Middle East and North Africa,\nwhich stressed the need to establish economic programmes\nas part of an effective partnership that would create better\nliving conditions for the peoples of those regions. The\nSummit also emphasized the need to assist economic\ndevelopment in Palestine to enable the Palestinian people to\npromote their economic and developmental institutions and\nto participate on an equal footing in the development of the\nregion.\nWe hope that the Amman Summit will be another\nmilestone in the mobilization of the potential of public and\nprivate sectors to consolidate the peace process by\npromoting economic cooperation to help in the region\u2019s\ndevelopment and by meeting the aspirations of the peoples\nof that region after progress, prosperity and just and lasting\npeace.\nThe United Arab Emirates and the Islamic Republic of\nIran have not yet arrived at a final settlement of their\ndispute over the future of the islands of Abu Musa and\nGreater and Lesser Tumbs. In light of our historical\nrelations with those two sisterly countries, and given the\nrelations of neighbourliness and friendship between the\npeoples of the United Arab Emirates and Iran, we look\nforward the day when there will be a final solution to this\ndispute so that the region may revert to the spirit of\ncoexistence that once characterized it.\nThe tragedy of the Bosnian people is almost without\nprecedent in the history of mankind. It is even more\nalarming in light of the international community\u2019s failure\nto stand up against murders, displacement of populations,\nethnic and religious cleansing, mass rape and the\ndestruction of the country\u2019s culture heritage and\ncivilization.\nIt is regrettable that the world should be witnessing\nsuch procrastination under the new world order, which\npurports to be founded on respect for human rights. It is\nalso somewhat amazing that that new world order, which\nhad mustered all its resources to extinguish every hot spot\noutside the Western world, should now fail to protect a\npeople in the very heart of Europe who are daily being\nsubjected to Serb aggression.\nMorocco, which had been under the impression that\nthe problem of Bosnia and Herzegovina would be settled\nin 1992, was surprised at the deterioration of the situation\nthere and by the escalation of violence and massacres. In\nthis connection, Morocco has consistently discharged its\nhuman and Islamic duty to defend the sovereignty and\nterritorial integrity of the Republic of Bosnia and\nHerzegovina, mitigate the agony of the Bosnian people\nand provide humanitarian assistance to them.\nI am convinced that the meeting of the Islamic and\nInternational Contact Groups in Paris on 7 September\n1995 and the meeting that took place between the two\ngroups yesterday, 28 September 1995, are likely to open\nthe way to coordination and consultation to achieve the\nexpected objectives and strengthen the foundations for\npeace in the region on the basis of justice and\ninternational law.\nWe welcome with hope the results of the 8\nSeptember 1995 meeting between the Bosnian, Serb and\nCroat ministers at Geneva.\nWe hope that the agreement in principle concluded\nby the parties to the conflict last Tuesday, 26 September\n1995, in New York will be a decisive step towards\nalleviating the sufferings of the people of Bosnia and\nHerzegovina and that it will help them achieve their\nhopes for peace, tranquillity, sovereignty, safeguard the\nterritorial integrity of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina\nand thus ensure peace, reconciliation and stability in the\nregion.\n4\n\n\nWith regard to the question of the so-called Western\nSahara, Morocco took the initiative of proposing the\norganization of a referendum and accepted the settlement\nplan presented by the Secretary-General. Morocco also\nagreed on the criteria concerning voter identification and\nmade serious efforts in full cooperation with the Secretary-\nGeneral, the Security Council and the United Nations\nMission for the Referendum in Western Sahara\n(MINURSO). Morocco has also offered financial assistance\nand the necessary support to overcome difficulties and\nimplement the settlement plan in good faith.\nIn view of the obstacles we are now encountering in\nconnection with the identification process with regard to all\npersons of Saharan origin, we appeal to the Security\nCouncil to take the necessary measures and to mobilize all\nthe appropriate means that would safeguard the settlement\nplan against collapse and remove the spectre of tension\nfrom the region.\nI take this opportunity to renew our commitment and\nstress our firm determination to continue our full\ncooperation with the Secretary-General in order to complete\nall the procedures and take all necessary measures to\norganize the referendum early next year, as suggested by\nthe Secretary-General in his latest report to the Security\nCouncil on the issue.\nWe hope that the fiftieth anniversary of our\nOrganization will be an opportunity to study all the ideas\nand suggestions put forth in order to improve and redress\nthe structures of our Organization so that, given all the\nchanges in the world, it can meet the actual needs of the\ninternational community. I refer in particular to ideas\nregarding the enlargement of the Security Council and\nimprovement of its working methods, which must be\ncarefully considered and given ample time so that results\ncan be achieved and a consensus can be reached.\nWe are confident that the perseverance and earnest\ndetermination we have shown in taking up challenges will\nbe the best incentive for us to face up to the new challenge\nand enable our Organization to fulfil its duties adequately\nat the dawning of the twenty-first century, which we hope\nwill be the beginning of a new era of peace, stability and\nlife in dignity for humanity.\n"

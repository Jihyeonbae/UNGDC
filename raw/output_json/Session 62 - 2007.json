        "file_text": "Many speakers before me \nhave eloquently debated the theme for this session. I \nam delighted that no one disputes the evidence that \nscience presents to us concerning climate change. \nToday we meet in this Hall as neighbours and residents \nof this one planet earth. We are bound together by our \ncommon humanity and shared future. We have within \nus the capacity to act resolutely to save our planet, and \nnow is the time. We cannot afford to squander any \nmore opportunities, for tomorrow might be too late. \n William Shakespeare instructs us, in his famous \nwork, Julius Caesar, that: \n\u201cThere is a tide in the affairs of men, \nWhich, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune; \nOmitted, all the voyage of their life  \nIs bound in shallows and in miseries.  \nOn such a full sea are we now afloat;  \nAnd we must take the current when it serves,  \nOr lose our ventures.\u201d \n We are convinced that we should focus on \nworking together to save our planet from the increasing \nthreat of global warming and all its attendant \nconsequences. When we meet as the peoples of the \nworld, we must of necessity remind ourselves of the \noriginal and higher purpose of the United Nations. \nMany of the global challenges we face persist, not \nbecause they are insurmountable, but because we have \nfallen short of the commitments and obligations freely \nentered into under the Charter. \n We, the peoples of the earth, have the human and \ncultural resources and technology to end severe global \npoverty and disease, reverse climate change, prevent \nwars and alleviate human suffering. Unfortunately, \nsubstantial resources continue to be wasted on \ndestructive endeavours rather than constructive work. \nWe squander valuable assets in the production of \nweapons of war and mass destruction rather than \ndevelopment. \n The world would be a much better place if the \nnatural resources on this planet were exploited to feed, \nclothe, educate, care for the sick, prevent diseases and \nbuild communities. Young men and women should \ngrow up looking forward to doing extraordinary things \nto advance the cause of economic and social progress \nand not spending precious time manufacturing bombs \nand weapons of war or planning how to kill other \nhuman beings. \n It is deeply regrettable that nations continue to \ngive higher priority to the narrow pursuit of national \ninterests than to cooperation for the common good and \nmutual benefit. This emphasis on rivalry breeds \ninjustice, intolerance, extremism and aggression. We \nmust remind ourselves that all of us are the people of \nthis earth and no other. We are bound by our common \nhumanity. We must rise to the challenge of the \nfounders of this unique universal Organization, so that \nwe may live for our respective countries rather than die \nfor them and together build a more just and equitable \nfuture for us all. \n The United Nations has touched the lives of the \nvast majority of our fellow human beings. We therefore \nreaffirm our abiding faith in its efficacy and usefulness \nin addressing global issues. The Organization embodies \nour hope and aspirations for peace, security, respect for \nhuman rights and development; in one word, a better \nlife for all. In that respect, the search for consensus in \nall aspects of United Nations reform must of necessity \ncontinue in a fair, just and balanced manner. \n From 51 Member States in 1945 to 192 in 2007, \nthe United Nations has grown in diversity and \nuniversality. It has also spread and consolidated its \nlegitimacy and authority throughout the world. The \nUnited Nations is the centre for harmonizing the \nactions of nations towards the attainment of the \ncommon good. Its strength lies in its unparalleled \nlegitimacy. Without the United Nations, States, both \nlarge and small, would encounter many formidable \nchallenges. \n It is hardly surprising, therefore, that for this \nOrganization to live up to its mandate and to people\u2019s \nexpectations, it has to constantly reform itself to \nrespond to contemporary global challenges and \nrealities. In his inspiring and visionary statement at the \nclosing of the San Francisco Conference 62 years ago, \nPresident Harry Truman of the United States proffered \ntimeless wise counsel when he said, \n\u201cThis Charter, like our own Constitution, will be \nexpanded and improved as time goes on. No one \nclaims that it is now a final or a perfect \ninstrument. It has not been poured into a fixed \nmold. Changing world conditions will require \nreadjustments   but they will be the \nreadjustments of peace and not of war.\nThose visionary words of one of the founding fathers \nof the United Nations should guide us in dealing with \nUnited Nations reform. We call upon the original \nsignatories of the United Nations Charter and, in \nparticular the permanent members of the Security \nCouncil, to assume greater leadership in the search for \nconsensus and compromise on the reform of the United \nNations Security Council. They should be more \nflexible in responding to proposals put forward on the \nreforms of the Security Council. \n As nation States we are encouraged to build \nsound democratic institutions. It is imperative, \ntherefore, that the principle of fairer, more inclusive, \nparticipatory and accountable institutions should be \nextended to global governance. In that respect, it \nshould be perfectly understandable why a substantial \nnumber of Member States consider it not only \nnecessary, but also long overdue, to increase \nmembership of the Council in both the permanent and \nnon-permanent categories. Today, important matters of \ninternational peace and security cannot be resolved \nthrough the monopoly of fire power. It requires greater \nparticipation and collaboration of nations   large and \nsmall. \n Botswana recognizes that we cannot all be \nmembers of the Security Council. There are those \namong us who have the capacity to carry the daunting \nresponsibilities of permanent membership. That is why \nit should be possible for us to reach consensus in \nmaking \u201creadjustments of peace and not of war\u201d. An \nall-or-nothing approach is not in our best interest. \nBotswana strongly supports the search for a \ncompromise on that long-standing issue, which if left \nunresolved can only become an unnecessary distraction \nto other equally pressing priorities. \n Conflicts in Africa cause the loss of hundreds of \nthousands of innocent lives. Many people are driven \ninto abject poverty and exposed to disease due to the \nmassive displacement of populations and destruction of \ntheir productive capacity. Huge amounts of resources \nare annually allocated to the United Nations \npeacekeeping budget to resolve conflicts. Even more \nresources are needed for the care and upkeep of \nrefugees and displaced peoples. \n The situation in Darfur continues to cause \nconcern. Concerted efforts are needed to bring that \nconflict to an end. In this respect, we welcome the \nSecurity Council decision to deploy a peacekeeping \nmission in Darfur and call upon our brothers and sisters \nin the Sudan to work together to find a lasting political \nsettlement. \n Botswana is concerned about the situation in \nChad and the Central African Republic. The loss of \ncivilian lives is intolerable. We call upon Chad, the \nCentral African Republic and other parties to those \nconflicts to commit to a peaceful political process to \navert further loss of lives. It is clear that the resolution \nof conflict in that region will require closer \ncooperation, collaboration and partnership between and \namong those countries involved in conflict situations. \n Following elections in the Democratic Republic \nof the Congo we are hopeful the country is on the road \nto recovery. It is important for the international \ncommunity to continue to support the Democratic \nRepublic of the Congo in its post-conflict \nreconstruction and development efforts. The marauding \nlawless militias that continue to undermine the peace \nprocess should be left in no doubt that anarchy will not \nbe tolerated. \n The Democratic Republic of the Congo and the \ncountries of the Great Lakes region of Africa will for \nthe foreseeable future require the assured support and \npartnership of the international community, not only in \npeacebuilding but more importantly, in the prevention \nof conflicts. \n Botswana acknowledges the existence of those \nproblems, not because we consider the future of Africa \nto be hopeless or bleak. We do so in order to arrive at a \ncorrect diagnosis of the illnesses and hence the \nprescription of the right remedy. \n The African Union is playing a pivotal role in the \nprevention, management and resolution of conflicts on \nthe continent. While the United Nations Security \nCouncil has the primary responsibility for the \nmaintenance of international peace and security, Africa \nshould be a dependable and indispensable partner in \nresponding expeditiously to the urgent need to end the \nconflicts and save lives. \n The countries and peoples of Africa should \nrecognize that the primary responsibility for durable \npeace and social and economic development lies with \nthem. In that respect, we should adopt sound policies \nand programmes that promote economic growth and \ndevelopment, foreign direct investment as well as \ndomestic investment. \n Indeed we are witnessing significant economic \ngrowth in Africa. The latest International Monetary \nFund projections are that, in 2007 the African economy \nis expected to grow by six per cent, just below the \nseven per cent per annum target of the New Partnership \nfor Africa\u2019s Development, that is necessary to achieve \nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). \n We look to our development partners to deliver \non the pledges to scale up official development \nassistance to Africa, effect meaningful debt relief, \nimprove market access for African goods and services \nand encourage their private sectors to invest in Africa. \n In the year 2000, at the dawn of the new \nmillennium, we convened in these hallowed halls to \nchart a new path for the United Nations development \nagenda. We adopted the Millennium Declaration and \nthe Millennium Development Goals. We undertook to \neradicate extreme poverty and hunger, promote gender \nequality as well as to combat HIV and AIDS. \n The Millennium Summit followed many global \nconferences of the 1990s at which we made numerous \ncommitments to combat poverty and \nunderdevelopment. The outcomes of these United \nNations conferences and summits provide a veritable \ntemplate for addressing the debilitating scourge of \npoverty, disease, hunger and underdevelopment in the \nworld. \n Today, as we meet here seven years after the \nadoption of the Millennium Declaration and half way \nto 2015, we should pause and take serious stock of the \nprogress made or the lack of it. It is evident that, while \nother regions of the world are making progress towards \nthe realization of the MDGs, indications are that unless \nsomething is done to support Africa, the continent is \nunlikely to achieve any of the Goals by 2015. Statistics \ntell tales of a continent that is host to huge numbers of \nthe poor and the hungry. Diseases, in particular \nHIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis, still kill many \npeople in Africa. Those factors require an urgent \nresponse, as they create conditions that pose a threat to \npeace, stability and security. \n In this interdependent world, the United Nations \ncannot realistically hope to achieve the MDGs by 2015 \nif one part of humanity is lagging so far behind. \nSomething must be done to assist and support Africa. \nIn March 2002 at Monterrey, Mexico, we recognized \nthe imperative of global cooperation and partnership in \nthe achievement of internationally agreed development \ngoals. We agreed that \n\u201cachieving the internationally agreed development \ngoals, including those contained in the United \nNations Millennium Declaration, demands a new \npartnership between developed and developing \ncountries\u201d (resolution 58/130, para. 11). \nLet us honour our commitments and move forward. \n Let me conclude by reiterating the fact that \nBotswana has long recognized that sustainable \ndevelopment has to be a nationally owned and led \nprocess that requires sound democratic institutions and \nprudent economic management. Adherence to those \nprinciples, coupled with the exploitation of mineral \nresources and donor support, enabled us to achieve \nrapid economic growth and some measure of \ndevelopment. \n Continued assistance is necessary to enable us to \nconsolidate the gains of the past few years and ensure \nsustainable development. In that respect, the scope of \ndevelopment cooperation should include private sector \ndevelopment, private investment and access to \ntechnology. Assistance to middle-income countries \nsuch as Botswana is crucial and in the long-term \ninterest of the global economy. We are asking not for \nhandouts, but for assured support, partnership and \ncollaboration. \n"

        "file_text": "I wish to take  this opportunity to congratulate you most sincerely on \nyour election as President of the General Assembly at \nits sixty-second session. My delegation is confident \nthat your in-depth knowledge of international \neconomic and political issues, complemented by your \nextensive diplomatic experience, will serve you in \ngood stead to guide our deliberations effectively in the \ncoming months. \n I also wish to take this opportunity to express \nTrinidad and Tobago\u2019s deep appreciation for the \nleadership of your predecessor, Her Excellency \nSheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa, the first Arab woman \nto hold that lofty position. As President of the General \nAssembly, her efforts contributed to focusing the \nattention of the international community on the \npressing challenges of climate change, inter alia, \nthereby facilitating, in the process, global awareness \nand increased support for internationally agreed action \non this issue given its impact on our planet and, \nespecially, on the very survival of several small island \ndeveloping States. \n I consider this occasion opportune, as well, to \nconvey Trinidad and Tobago's unequivocal support for \nour current Secretary-General His Excellency Mr. Ban \nKi-moon. We commend his leadership role in the \ntroubling humanitarian crisis in the Darfur region of \nthe Sudan and applaud his initiative to convene the \nHigh-Level Event on Climate Change. These are \nindeed apt demonstrations of his willingness to \nconfront forcefully and resolutely issues of \ntranscendental importance to the present and future \nwell-being of peoples everywhere. \n Though small in size and population, Trinidad \nand Tobago, through visionary leadership, transparency \nand public accountability and prudent management of \nour natural resources, is continuing along a path of \nsustainable development. Our development strategy \nseeks to go beyond the achievement of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) and to ensure that by the \nyear 2020 all sectors of our multi-ethnic and \nmulticultural society will enjoy a standard of living \ncomparable to that of the developed world. \n The performance of our economy draws its \nstrength from vertically integrated and well-developed \nenergy and petrochemical industries, which are \ncomplemented by buoyant and competitive \nmanufacturing and service sectors, including financial \nservices and tourism, as well as by the ongoing \ntransformation of the agricultural sector. All these \nfactors provide the basis for economic growth levels \noff 8.6 per cent over the last five years and a recorded \nrate of 12 per cent in 2006. We have also been able to \nachieve a 7 per cent reduction in poverty from a high \nof 24 per cent in 1998 and are currently experiencing a \nlow unemployment rate of 5.9 per cent.  \n It is on the basis of this strong economic \nperformance that Trinidad and Tobago has continued \nits commitment to the Caribbean Community \n(CARICOM), as we seek to advance the integration \nprocess, moving from the current stage of the single \nmarket to that of a single economy. Effective \nparticipation in this process of furthering strengthening \nand deepening the regional integration movement \nremains a major foreign policy goal of the Government \nof the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago. It is for this \nreason and given the fact that our economic fortunes \nare inextricably linked, that Trinidad and Tobago \ncontinues to provide economic and humanitarian \nassistance to several CARICOM countries adversely \naffected by natural disasters. \n Our further economic development and that of \nthe global community as a whole, is dependent on the \nexistence of global peace and security. In this regard, \nthe Security Council has continued to take timely \ndecisions on global crises in different parts of the \nglobe, on terrorism and on nuclear non-proliferation.  \n The reform of that principal organ of the United \nNations, charged with maintaining international peace \nand security, continues, however, to elude us. It is time \nto engage in bona fide negotiations on this matter. The \nstatus quo is unacceptable. The Security Council must \nbe reformed to reflect the current geopolitical realities \nof the twenty-first century and no longer the world as it \nwas in the aftermath of World War II. New and \nimportant actors from Africa, Asia and Latin America \nand the Caribbean are a part of today\u2019s global reality. \nAn expanded and enhanced Security Council would \nprovide the Council with even greater legitimacy and \nsupport in the carrying out of its Charter \nresponsibilities. Trinidad and Tobago is of the view \nthat much progress was made during the sixty-first \nsession and the political momentum which was \ngenerated there should not be lost.  \n A reinvigorated Security Council is needed to \naddress the major issues that continue to bedevil \ncontemporary international relations. In the Middle \nEast, the failure to move forward on the peace process \nhas set back global efforts to achieve a just, lasting and \ncomprehensive peace in the Middle East. The \nPalestinian people have yet to exercise their legitimate \nrights to self-determination and to the establishment of \nan independent Palestinian State in an undivided \nhomeland.  \n We call on the Quartet to resume the Road Map \nprocess for peace in the Middle East, so that the world \ncan, in the foreseeable future, see two States, Israel and \nPalestine, living side by side in peace, within \ninternationally recognized and secure borders. \nAdditionally, internationally acceptable solutions must \nbe found to address the fate of the Palestinian refugees, \nthe status of Jerusalem and the issue of Israeli \nsettlements in the West Bank. All these matters have \nremained pending for far too long and the Palestinians \nshould no longer be denied the realization of their \nstatehood. \n While there has been little or no progress in the \nmatter of peace in the Middle East, the Government of \nthe Republic of Trinidad and Tobago is pleased to note \nthat, with respect to the humanitarian crisis in the \nDarfur region of the Sudan, agreement has finally been \nreached, which has resulted in the deployment of a \nhybrid United Nations-African Union peacekeeping \nforce for Darfur. We welcome this positive \ndevelopment. While we hope that the hybrid United \nNations-African Union peacekeeping force will bring \npeace and stability to the region and enable \nhumanitarian relief to flow once again to where it is \nmost urgently required, all our efforts must now be \nturned towards putting a cease-fire in place and \nstriving to have all the rebels groups fighting in Darfur \nmove towards a peace arrangement with the Sudanese \nGovernment. Peace and justice are, however, \ninextricably linked and there can be no lasting peace in \nDarfur without accountability for the heinous crimes \ncommitted against the people of Darfur during the \nconflict. \n While international political and security \ndevelopments continue to pose major difficulties for \nthe international community, developments in the area \nof international trade give rise to even greater concern. \nWe are mindful of the reality that the steadfast efforts \nof Trinidad and Tobago, of the subregion and of other \ndeveloping countries to confront effectively the \nchallenges of globalization and liberalization would be \nrendered futile in the absence of a fair, transparent and \nequitable international economic trading system. The \nGovernment of Trinidad and Tobago therefore remains \ndeeply concerned that, after many years of protracted \nnegotiations characterized by many missed deadlines, \nthe Doha Round of multilateral trade negotiations has \nyet to reach a compromise that would pave the way for \nan agreed outcome, particularly in the areas of \nagriculture and industrial products, and that \nincorporates the development dimension. We \nunderscore the importance of ensuring that the \nprinciple of special and differential treatment is truly \nreflected throughout the negotiating modalities, and we \ncall upon all parties in the negotiations to take fully \ninto account the special needs of small and vulnerable \neconomies. \n The Government of the Republic of Trinidad and \nTobago fully expects that the negotiations will resume \nin good faith and that there will be commensurate \nprogress in agriculture, industrial products and all \nother areas of the negotiations, in keeping with the \nmandate of a single undertaking. That will ensure the \nsuccessful conclusion of the Round and an outcome \nthat fully reflects the commitment undertaken at Doha \nto put development at the heart of the multilateral \ntrading system. \n While those trade negotiations seem to have \nstalled and will require the injection of a high degree \nof political will to bring them to a successful \nconclusion, the international community is faced with \nyet another global concern in the form of climate \nchange. As a result of greenhouse gas emissions from \nfossil fuel use and land-use changes through \ndeforestation, the world is already destined to an \nincrease of 1.14 degrees Celsius by the end of the next \ntwo decades. \n There therefore needs to be a clearly defined \nglobal mitigation strategy that keeps the long-term \ntemperature increase at less than 2 degrees Celsius \nabove pre-industrial levels. Increases over 2 degrees \nCelsius are very likely to have an increased adverse \nimpact on small island developing States, such as \nTrinidad and Tobago. In order to avoid a global climate \ndisaster, the Government of the Republic of Trinidad \nand Tobago calls for urgent and ambitious action by all \nStates in accordance with their common but \ndifferentiated responsibilities, respective capabilities \nand social and economic conditions. \n As a State party to the United Nations Framework \nConvention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the \nKyoto Protocol, we call on all States parties to \nUNFCCC, particularly major emitters of greenhouse \ngases, to agree at Bali to launch negotiations on a \npost-2012 regime. In those negotiations, the \nGovernment of Trinidad and Tobago and other \nlike-minded Caribbean Community (CARICOM) \nmember States will seek to achieve substantial and \nlegally binding emission reductions in the shortest \ntimeframe possible and significant increases in the \nlevel of resources available to developing countries, in \nparticular small island developing States, to assist them \nin adapting to the adverse effects of climate change. To \nthis end, the Government of the Republic of Trinidad \nand Tobago has already made a voluntary contribution \nof $1 million to the trust fund for the Caribbean \nCommunity Climate Change Centre in Belize to \nstrengthen that institution, so that it can assist \nCARICOM member States in implementing their \nadaptation strategies to deal with the adverse effects of \nclimate change. \n But we in the Caribbean are not only concerned \nabout global warming and its adverse effects on \nCaribbean States. We are also deeply interested in \npreserving the marine environment of the Caribbean \nSea, which is an important natural resource for all its \nlittoral island and continental States, given their \nvarying degrees of dependence on tourism. The \npassage through the Caribbean Sea of ships carrying \nradioactive waste is an issue to which all CARICOM \nGovernments attach the highest importance. Allow me \nto take this opportunity to reiterate the continued \nobjection of Caribbean countries against the use of the \nCaribbean Sea for the trans-shipment of radioactive \nwaste. The repeated scientific and safety reports may \noffer some reassurance, but they do very little to \nappease our concern. \n Our Prime Minister, Mr. Patrick Manning, in his \n2008 budget statement, brought into sharp focus the \nvision of the Government of the Republic of Trinidad \nand Tobago for our cosmopolitan society. He \nemphasized that the mission in which we as a nation \nare engaged collectively is a transformation process \naimed at bringing sustained prosperity and the requisite \nhigher quality of life to every individual, family and \ncommunity across the country. The Government has \ntherefore sought to give concrete expression to the \nnational quest for a highly competitive, productive, \ninnovative and caring society, in which all are \nencouraged to attain their highest potential and are \nfacilitated in doing so. \n It is, accordingly, in this spirit that we have just \nsigned the Convention on the Rights of Persons with \nDisabilities, which was adopted and opened for \nsignature during the sixty-first session of the General \nAssembly, and we will take steps to ratify the \nConvention once the necessary implementing \nlegislation is put in place to complement what is \nalready provided for in our domestic policy with regard \nto persons with disabilities. \n It is this confidence in and respect for the \ninternational rule of law that has encouraged Trinidad \nand Tobago to campaign, since the late 1980s and at \nthe highest political levels, for the establishment of an \nInternational Criminal Court (ICC). We are keenly \naware of the important strides being made by ICC, as it \ndevotes its attention to the prosecution of individuals \naccused of committing the crimes within its \njurisdiction, namely, genocide, war crimes and crimes \nagainst humanity. \n Trinidad and Tobago recalls in this connection the \nadoption at the Rome Diplomatic Conference of a \nresolution recommending that a conference to review \nthe Court\u2019s Statute also consider the inclusion of \ntrafficking in illegal drugs on an international scale as \nbeing within the Court\u2019s jurisdiction. We must seize the \nopportunity now forced upon us by international trends \nto fully engage ICC in efforts to stem the tide of that \nscourge, and similarly, to consider the inclusion of acts \nof terrorism, once that term is clearly defined by the \ninternational community. \n Our approach will be grounded in the recognition \nof the continued deleterious effects that the \ninternational trade in illegal drugs is having on the \nsocial fabric of societies the world over, including in \nthe Caribbean. The time has come for the international \ncommunity to recognize the illicit trafficking of drugs \nas an international crime subject to the jurisdiction of \nICC. \n Another area of public international law to which \nTrinidad and Tobago attaches the utmost importance is \nthe 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the \nSea. This year\u2019s meeting of the United Nations \nOpen-ended Informal Consultative Process on Oceans \nand the Law of the Sea addressed the important issue \nof marine genetic resources. Part XI of the Convention \nexplicitly provides that the area beyond national \njurisdiction and its resources are the common heritage \nof mankind. Trinidad and Tobago is accordingly of the \nview that any legal regime developed to regulate the \nmarine genetic resources of the Area must be guided by \nthe common heritage principle. Adherence to such a \nprinciple would ensure that the resources of the Area \nare exploited for the benefit of all members of the \ninternational community, and not just for the benefit of \nthose with the financial wherewithal and the technical \nknow-how. \n Similarly, we recognize that all States parties to \nthe Convention are ipso facto members of the \nInternational Seabed Authority. Despite the importance \nof the current work of the Authority on polymetallic \nsulphides and cobalt crusts, many States parties fail to \nattend the annual sessions of the Authority held in \nJamaica. The continued absence of States undermines \nthe common heritage principle laid down in Part XI of \nthe Convention and threatens the very legitimacy of the \nwork of the Authority. We accordingly call on all \nmembers of the Authority to attend regularly the \nsessions of the Authority and thus assist it in adopting \nregulations governing the exploration and exploitation \nof the mineral resources in the Area, which are of \nbenefit to all mankind. \n Trinidad and Tobago, like its Caribbean \nneighbours, acknowledges its maternal links to Africa \nand notes that 2007 was an important year for the \npeoples of that continent and for the African diaspora \nworldwide. Earlier this year, we observed here at \nHeadquarters and in the capitals of all CARICOM \nStates a programme of activities intended to raise the \nconsciousness of peoples the world over regarding the \nhorrors of the transatlantic slave trade and the \ndeleterious effects it had on Africa, depriving that \ncontinent of millions of its inhabitants, and on people \nof African descent in the Americas. We in Trinidad and \nTobago have used the opportunity to educate all of our \ncitizens on the degrading treatment to which those \nhuman beings were subjected and to demonstrate that, \nnotwithstanding our history of slavery, followed by the \nindentureship of other segments of our population, the \npeople of Trinidad and Tobago have developed a \nharmonious cosmopolitan society, which is an \naccomplishment worthy of emulation in other parts of \nthe globe that are fractured by fratricidal ethnic and \nreligious struggles. \n In order for the suffering of millions of enslaved \nAfricans not to have been in vain, the Government of \nthe Republic of Trinidad and Tobago intends to make a \nfinancial contribution to the CARICOM initiative for a \npermanent memorial to be erected within these \nhallowed walls of the United Nations in remembrance \nof all those who perished in the Middle Passage and on \nthe plantations in the New World in their struggle for \nfreedom and liberation from the yoke of slavery. We \ncall upon the international community to contribute \ngenerously to such a worthwhile and historic venture. \n In conclusion, the United Nations remains a \ncentre for harmonizing the goals and aspirations of all \nmankind. There is no other universal forum with \ngreater legitimacy or a more suitable mandate to bring \nabout an improvement in the human condition. We \nmust address all these global issues with firmness of \npurpose and in a resolute manner if we are to save \ncoming generations from the adverse consequences of \nwar, underdevelopment and poverty, as well as the \ndeleterious effects of climate change, and to ensure that \nall humanity can enjoy improved standards of living in \nfreedom and in dignity on a habitable planet. \n"

        "file_text": "Let me begin by adding my \nvoice to the many salutations directed to Mr. Ban \nKi-moon on being elected as the Secretary-General of \nthe United Nations. I wish him a fruitful tenure of \noffice, trusting that through his work the poor of the \nworld will have good reason to increase their \nconfidence in this Organization of the nations of the \nworld. \n Again, I reiterate the many thanks to Her \nExcellency Ms. Haya Rashed Al Khalifa, for the good \nwork she did as the President of the General Assembly \nat its sixty-first session. Equally, my congratulations go \nto Mr. Srgjan Kerim on his election as the President of \nthe General Assembly at its sixty-second session. \n We meet here today, under the theme of \nresponding to climate change, at this session, which \nmarks the half-way point in the freely agreed period \nduring which the nations of the world committed \nthemselves to work, individually and collectively, to \nachieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). \n Billions of the people of the world know as a \nmatter of fact that the consequences of climate \nchange   be it droughts, floods or unpredictable and \nextreme weather patterns   undermine our common \nefforts to achieve the MDGs. Today, we all understand \nthat the costs of doing nothing about climate change far \noutweigh those of taking concrete measures to address \nthis challenge. It is clear that delaying action on this \nmatter of climate change will hit poor countries and \ncommunities hardest. Yet the pace of climate change \nnegotiations is out of step with the urgency indicated \nby science. \n I would therefore urge that we collectively aim \nfor a significant advance in the multilateral \nnegotiations when our negotiators meet in Bali in \nDecember this year. Together, we must ensure that we \nbuild a fair, effective, flexible and inclusive climate \nregime under the United Nations Framework \nConvention on Climate Change and its Kyoto Protocol, \nand we must agree to this as a matter of urgency. \nThough we have different responsibilities, and \ndeveloped countries clearly have an obligation to take \nthe lead, we all have a common duty to do more and \nact within our respective capabilities and in accordance \nwith our national circumstances. \n The World Summit on Sustainable Development \ncorrectly reaffirmed sustainable development as a \ncentral element of the global action against poverty and \nthe protection of the environment and identified \nimportant linkages between poverty, the environment \nand the use of natural resources. These linkages are \nreal to billions of the poor; the combination of their \nempty stomachs, their degraded environment and their \nexploited natural resources, for which they benefit \nnothing, defines hopelessness and a heart-wrenching \nexistence. \n Many of these wretched of the Earth know from \ntheir bitter experience how their resource-rich areas \nwere transformed into arid, uninhabitable and desolate \nareas forcing migration to better-endowed regions, thus \nexacerbating conflicts and the struggle for scarce \nresources. \n Gathered here as representatives of the peoples of \nthe world, we know very well that climate change, \npoverty and underdevelopment are not acts of God but \nhuman-made. \n Clearly, the starting point for a future climate \nregime must be equity. A core balance between \nsustainable development and climate imperatives will \nhave to be the basis of any agreement on a \nstrengthened climate regime. Any deal on fair use of \nthe ecological space will have to be balanced by a deal \ngiving all countries a fair chance in the development \nspace. \n Under the aegis of the United Nations, but also \nwithin our regional bodies, we have adopted many \nprogrammes and declarations, with clear \nimplementation targets aimed at addressing the \nchallenges of climate change, poverty and \nunderdevelopment. As this conclave knows very well, \nthe many lofty agreements include, among others, \nthose adopted at the Rio Earth Summit, the \nCopenhagen Social Summit, the Millennium Summit, \nthe World Summit on Sustainable Development and the \nMonterrey International Conference on Financing for \nDevelopment. At all these summits and others, we have \nadopted declarations using moving and solemn words \nthat express our profound understanding of the gravity \nof the challenges facing the modern world and have \nunequivocally committed ourselves to defeating any \nand all of the miserable and dehumanizing conditions \nfacing large parts of humanity. \n Indeed, this collective asserted, in paragraph 11 \nof the Millennium Declaration (resolution 55/2):  \n  \u201cWe will spare no effort to free our fellow \nmen, women and children from the abject and \ndehumanizing conditions of extreme poverty. ... \nWe are committed to making the right to \ndevelopment a reality for everyone and to freeing \nthe entire human race from want.\u201d \nYet the poor, whose hopes have been raised many times \nas we have made declaration after declaration against \npoverty and underdevelopment   and as we are doing \nnow on climate change   can be forgiven for thinking \nthat this important global leadership often sounds like \nan empty vessel.  \n That this collective is able to express, always \neloquently, the dire circumstances characterizing \npoverty is without doubt. However, this Organization, \nwhich should pride itself on visible actions and results \nin the fight against climate change and poverty, finds it \ndifficult to demonstrate decisive progress in that \nregard. The reasons for that are not hard to find. \nAlthough the concepts of freedom, justice and equality \nare universal and fully embraced by the United \nNations, this global Organization has not itself \ntransformed and designed necessary institutions of \ngovernance that are consistent with the noble ideals \nthat drive modern democratic societies. \n Because the nations of the world are defined by \nthe dominant and the dominated, the dominant have \nalways become the decision-makers in the important \nglobal forums, including at this seat of global \ngovernance. Accordingly, the skewed distribution of \nworld power   political, economic, military, \ntechnological and social   replicates itself in \nmultilateral institutions, much to the disadvantage of \nthe majority of the poor people of the world. \n Indeed, even as we agree on the important \nprogrammes that should bring a better life to the \nbillions of poor, the rich and the powerful have \nconsistently sought to ensure that, whatever happens, \nthe existing power relations are not altered and \ntherefore that the status quo remains. The results of \nthat situation are that the United Nations can and does \ncorrectly identify problems and appropriate solutions \nnecessary for making the world a better place for all of \nhumanity. Naturally, the dominant and the powerful \nvery often respond positively to agreed programmes if \nthese would advance their own narrow interests. \n At the same time, the poor will continue to strive \nfor improvement of their wretched conditions. They \ntherefore see the United Nations as a natural \ninstrument for helping to accelerate the process of \nchange for the better. Hence, they correctly see \nimplementation of all United Nations programmes as \nbeing central to the efforts relating to climate change \nand the struggle against poverty and \nunderdevelopment. \n Yet the cold reality is that it will be difficult for \nthe United Nations, in its present form, to fully \nimplement its own decisions and therefore to help the \npoor to swiftly achieve the Millennium Development \nGoals (MDGs). Indeed, until the ideals of freedom, \njustice and equality characterize this premier world \nbody itself, the dominant will forever dictate to the \ndominated, and the interests of the dominated   which \nare those of the majority of humanity   will be \ndeferred in perpetuity. Thus, noble statements will \ncontinue to be uttered on all matters facing the \nmajority of the people of the world, such as the need to \nsuccessfully conclude the Doha Development Round, \nwhile little is done to implement the many critical \nagreements necessary to pull the poor out of the morass \nof poverty and underdevelopment. \n We in my own country are of the firm belief that \nwe will achieve the MDGs. Having emerged from more \nthan three centuries of colonialism and apartheid, we \ninherited two interlinked economies, which we \ncharacterize as the first and second economies. The \ntwo economies   one developed and globally \nconnected and the other localized and informal   \ndisplay many features of a global system of apartheid. \nAs South Africans, we have sought to strengthen the \nfirst economy and to use it as a base for the transfer of \nresources to strengthen and modernize the second \neconomy, and thus embark on the process of changing \nthe lives of those who subsist in the second economy. \n Indeed, without the requisite resource transfers, it \nwill not be possible to achieve the MDGs, because our \nsecond economy cannot on its own generate the \nresources needed to bring a better life to millions of \npoor South Africans. I mention this because, as we all \naccept, central to the global attainment of the MDGs is \nthe critical matter of resource transfers from the rich \ncountries of the North to the poor countries of the \nSouth. \n Many developing countries   especially those of \nmy own continent, Africa   do not have the material \nbase from which to address and attain the MDGs on \ntheir own. Accordingly, there is an urgent need for \nmassive resource transfers through development \nassistance, investment, trade, technology transfers and \nhuman resource development to these poor countries if \nwe are to achieve the MDGs and successfully adapt to \nthe devastating impacts of climate change. \n If we do not succeed in building a climate change \nregime that balances adaptation and mitigation, \nunderpinned by the transfer of technology and financial \nresources, we will place an unmanageable burden on \nfuture generations. In that regard, given Africa\u2019s \nspecific and dire challenges, we believe it is important \nto enter into a partnership with Africa using the African \nUnion\u2019s programme the New Partnership for Africa\u2019s \nDevelopment (NEPAD), which the Assembly has \nadopted, so that the measures that the continent has \nundertaken, with limited resources, for the regeneration \nof all the African countries can be strengthened by \nsupport from the international community, guided by \nthe programmes of the United Nations. \n As history teaches us, it was because of the \nmassive resource transfers in the aftermath of the \nSecond World War that Western Europe recovered and \nwas set on its development path. A similar intervention \nhelped to put a number of Asian countries on their own \ndevelopment trajectory. The question we should ask is, \nwhy is there an absence of the same resolve to assist \npoor nations today? The global village to which we \nconstantly refer should encourage us to expand human \nsolidarity. Thus, we would build a durable bridge over \nthe river dividing our common global village and \nregrettably ensuring that one human being lives a \nfulfilling life while another experiences a miserable \nexistence. \n Representing the citizens of the world, we have \nset for ourselves programmes requiring that all of us \nwork together to create better living conditions for \nhumanity and ensure that we achieve that which is \nnecessary for our mutual prosperity. \n Together, rich and poor, developed and \ndeveloping, North and South, we can and must truly \nhold hands and address the challenges of climate \nchange and sustainable development, work together to \ndefeat poverty and underdevelopment and ensure that \nevery human being is saved from the indecencies and \nhumiliations that are inseparable from poverty. But to \ndo that, we need first and foremost to implement the \ndecisions that we have adopted freely in this eminent \nhouse of the representatives of the global community. \nAnd so, let our actions speak louder than our words.  \n"

        "file_text": "Thank you for the opportunity \nto address the General Assembly of the United Nations.  \n Sixty years ago, representatives from 16 nations \ngathered to begin deliberations on a new international \nbill of rights. The document they produced is called the \nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights, and it stands \nas a landmark achievement in the history of human \nliberty. The Declaration opens by recognizing the \ninherent dignity and the equal and inalienable rights of \nall members of the human family as the foundation of \nfreedom and justice and peace in the world. As we \ngather for the sixty-second session of the General \nAssembly, the standards of the Declaration must guide \nour work in this world.  \n Achieving the promise of the Declaration requires \nconfronting long-term threats. It also requires \nanswering the immediate needs of today. \n We nations in this Hall have our differences. Yet, \nthere are some areas where we can all agree. When \ninnocent people are trapped in a life of murder and \nfear, the Declaration is not being upheld. When \nmillions of children starve to death or perish from a \nmosquito bite, we are not doing our duty in the world. \nWhen whole societies are cut off from the prosperity of \nthe global economy, we are all worse off. Changing \nthese underlying conditions is what the Declaration \ncalls the work of larger freedom, and it must be the \nwork of every nation in this Assembly. \n This great institution must work for great \npurposes, to free people from tyranny and violence, \nhunger and disease, illiteracy and ignorance and \npoverty and despair. Every member of the United \nNations must join in this mission of liberation. The \nfirst mission of the United Nations requires liberating \npeople from tyranny and violence. The first article of \nthe Universal Declaration begins by stating that all \nhuman beings are born free and equal in dignity and \nrights. This truth is denied by terrorists and extremists \nwho kill the innocent with the aim of imposing their \nhateful vision on humanity. The followers of this \nviolent ideology are a threat to civilized people \neverywhere. All civilized nations must work together \nto stop them by sharing intelligence about their \nnetworks and choking off their finances and bringing to \njustice their operatives. In the long run, the best way to \ndefeat extremists is to defeat their dark ideology with a \nmore hopeful vision   the vision of liberty that \nfounded this body. \n The United States salutes the nations that have \nrecently taken strides towards liberty, including \nUkraine, Georgia, Kyrgyzstan, Mauritania, Liberia, \nSierra Leone and Morocco. The Palestinian territories \nhave moderate leaders   mainstream leaders   who \nare working to build free institutions that fight terror, \nenforce the law and respond to the needs of their \npeople. The international community must support \nthese leaders so that we can advance the vision of two \ndemocratic States   Israel and Palestine   living side \nby side in peace and security. \n Brave citizens in Lebanon and Afghanistan and \nIraq have made the choice for democracy. Yet, the \nextremists have responded by targeting them for \nmurder. This is not a show of strength; it is evidence of \nfear; and the extremists are doing everything within \ntheir power to bring down these young democracies. \nThe people of Lebanon and Afghanistan and Iraq have \nasked for our help, and every civilized nation has a \nresponsibility to stand with them. Every civilized \nnation also has a responsibility to stand up for the \npeople suffering under dictatorship. In Belarus, North \nKorea, Syria and Iran, brutal regimes deny their people \nthe fundamental rights enshrined in the Universal \nDeclaration. \n Americans are outraged by the situation in \nBurma, where a military junta has imposed a 19-year \nreign of fear. Basic freedoms of speech, assembly and \nworship are severely restricted. Ethnic minorities are \npersecuted. Forced child labour, human trafficking and \nrape are common. The regime is holding more than \n1,000 political prisoners, including Aung San Suu Kyi, \nwhose party was elected overwhelmingly by the \nBurmese people in 1990. \n The ruling junta remains unyielding, yet the \npeople\u2019s desire for freedom is unmistakable. This \nmorning, I am announcing a series of steps to help \nbring peaceful change to Burma. The United States will \ntighten economic sanctions on the leaders of the \nregime and their financial backers. We will impose an \nexpanded visa ban on those responsible for the most \negregious violations of human rights   as well as their \nfamily members. We will continue to support the \nefforts of humanitarian groups working to alleviate \nsuffering in Burma. And I urge the United Nations and \nall nations to use their diplomatic and economic \nleverage to help the Burmese people reclaim their \nfreedom. \n In Cuba, the long rule of a cruel dictator is \nnearing its end. The Cuban people are ready for their \nfreedom. And as that nation enters a period of \ntransition, the United Nations must insist on free \nspeech, free assembly and, ultimately, free and \ncompetitive elections. \n In Zimbabwe, ordinary citizens suffer under a \ntyrannical regime. The Government has cracked down \non peaceful calls for reform and has forced millions to \nflee their homeland. The behaviour of the Mugabe \nregime is an assault on its people and an affront to the \nprinciples of the Universal Declaration. The United \nNations must insist on change in Harare and must insist \non freedom for the people of Zimbabwe. \n In Sudan, innocent civilians are suffering \nrepression; and in the Darfur region, many are losing \ntheir lives to genocide. America has responded with \ntough sanctions against those responsible for the \nviolence. We have provided more than $2 billion in \nhumanitarian and peacekeeping aid. I look forward to \nattending a Security Council meeting that will focus on \nDarfur, chaired by the French President. I appreciate \nFrance\u2019s leadership in helping to stabilize Sudan\u2019s \nneighbours. The United Nations must answer this \nchallenge to conscience and live up to its promise to \npromptly deploy peacekeeping forces to Darfur. \n Secondly, the mission of the United Nations \nrequires liberating people from hunger and disease. \nArticle 25 of the Universal Declaration states that \neveryone has the right to a standard of living adequate \nfor the health and well-being of himself and of his \nfamily, including food, clothing, housing, and medical \ncare. Around the world, the United Nations is carrying \nout noble efforts to live up to these words. \n Feeding the hungry has long been a special \ncalling for my nation. Today, more than half the \nworld\u2019s food assistance comes from America. We send \nemergency food stocks to starving people, from camps \nin Sudan to slums around the world. I have proposed \nan innovative initiative to alleviate hunger under which \nAmerica would purchase the crops of local farmers in \nAfrica and elsewhere, rather than shipping in food \nfrom the developed world. This would help build up \nlocal agriculture and break the cycle of famine in the \ndeveloping world, and I urge our United States \nCongress to support this initiative. \n Many in this Hall are bringing the spirit of \ngenerosity to fighting HIV/AIDS and malaria. Five \nyears ago, in sub-Saharan Africa, an AIDS diagnosis \nwas widely considered a death sentence, and fewer \nthan 50,000 people infected with the virus were \nreceiving treatment. The world responded by creating \nthe Global Fund, which is working with Governments \nand the private sector to fight the disease around the \nworld. The United States decided to take these efforts a \nstep further by launching the $15 billion Emergency \nPlan for AIDS Relief. Since 2003, this effort has \nhelped bring cutting-edge medicines to more than a \nmillion people in sub-Saharan Africa. It is a good start. \nSo earlier this year, I proposed to double our initial \ncommitment   to $30 billion. By coming together, the \nworld can turn the tide against HIV/AIDS, once and for \nall. \n Malaria is another common killer. In some \ncountries, malaria takes as many lives as HIV/AIDS, \nthe vast majority of them children under the age of \nfive. Every one of these deaths is unnecessary, because \nthe disease is preventable and treatable. The world \nknows what it takes to stop malaria   bed nets, indoor \nspraying and medicine to treat the disease. Two years \nago, America launched a $1.2 billion malaria initiative. \nOther nations and the private sector are making vital \ncontributions as well. I call on every Member State to \nmaintain its focus, to find new ways to join this cause \nand to bring us closer to the day when deaths caused by \nmalaria are no more. \n Thirdly, the mission of the United Nations \nrequires liberating people from the chains of illiteracy \nand ignorance. Article 26 of the Universal Declaration \nstates that everyone has the right to education. When \nnations make the investments needed to educate their \npeople, the whole world benefits. Better education \nunleashes the talent and potential of citizens and adds \nto the prosperity of all of us. Better education promotes \nbetter health and greater independence. Better \neducation increases the strength of democracy and \nweakens the appeal of violent ideologies. So the United \nStates is joining with nations around the world to help \nthem provide a better education for their people. \n A good education starts with good teachers. In \npartnership with other nations, America has helped \ntrain more than 600,000 teachers and administrators. A \ngood education requires good textbooks. So, in \npartnership with other nations, America has distributed \ntens of millions of textbooks. A good education \nrequires access to good schools. So, in partnership with \nother nations, America is helping nations raise \nstandards in their schools at home and providing \nscholarships to help students come to schools in the \nUnited States. And in all our education efforts, our \nnation is working to expand access for women and \ngirls so that the opportunity to get a decent education is \nopen to all. \n Finally, the mission of the United Nations \nrequires liberating people from poverty and despair. \nArticle 23 of the Universal Declaration states that \neveryone has the right to work, to free choice of \nemployment and to just and favourable conditions of \nwork. In the twenty-first century, this requires ensuring \nthat people in poor countries have the same \nopportunity to benefit from the global economy that \ncitizens of wealthy countries have. \n The United Nations provides vital economic \nassistance designed to help developing nations grow \ntheir economies and reach their potential. The United \nStates agrees with that position. We have dramatically \nincreased our own development assistance, and we are \ndelivering that aid in innovative ways. We started the \nMillennium Challenge Account to reward nations that \ngovern justly, fight corruption, invest in their people \nand promote economic freedom. With this aid, we are \nreaching out to developing nations in partnership, not \npaternalism. And we are ensuring that our aid dollars \nreach those who need them and achieve results. \n In the long run, the best way to lift people out of \npoverty is through trade and investment. A nation that \nis open and trading with the world will create \neconomic rewards that far exceed anything it could get \nthrough foreign aid. During the 1990s, developing \nnations that significantly lowered tariffs saw their per \ncapita income grow about three times faster than other \ndeveloping countries. Open markets ignite growth, \nencourage investment, increase transparency, \nstrengthen the rule of law and help countries help \nthemselves. \n The international community now has a historic \nchance to open markets around the world by \nconcluding a successful Doha Round of trade talks. A \nsuccessful Doha outcome would mean real and \nsubstantial openings in agriculture, goods and services, \nand real and substantial reductions in trade-distorting \nsubsidies. The world\u2019s largest trading nations, \nincluding major developing countries, have a special \nresponsibility to make the tough political decisions to \nreduce trade barriers. America has the wi11 and \nflexibility to make those necessary decisions. Our \nnegotiators are demonstrating that spirit in Geneva. I \nurge other leaders to direct their negotiators to do the \nsame. And I am optimistic that we can reach a good \nDoha agreement and seize this once-in-a-generation \nopportunity. \n In the meantime, America wi11 continue to \npursue agreements that open trade and investment \nwherever we can. We recently signed free-trade \nagreements with Peru, Colombia, Panama and South \nKorea. These agreements embody the values of open \nmarkets, transparent and fair regulation, respect for \nprivate property and resolving disputes under rules of \ninternational law. These are good agreements. They are \nnow ready for a congressional vote, and I urge our \nCongress to approve them as soon as possible. \n As America works with the United Nations to \nalleviate immediate needs, we are also coming together \nto address longer-term challenges. Together, we are \npreparing for pandemics that could cause death and \nsuffering on a global scale. Together, we are working \nto stop the proliferation of weapons of mass \ndestruction. Together, we are confronting the \nchallenges of energy security, environmental quality \nand climate change. I appreciate the discussions on \nclimate change led by the Secretary-General last night. \nI look forward to further discussions at the meeting of \nmajor economies in Washington later this week. \n The goals I have outlined today cannot be \nachieved overnight, and they cannot be achieved \nwithout reform of this vital institution. The United \nStates is committed to a strong and vibrant United \nNations. Yet the American people are disappointed by \nthe failures of the Human Rights Council. That body \nhas been silent on repression by regimes from Havana \nand Caracas to Pyongyang and Tehran, while focusing \nits criticism excessively on Israel. To be credible on \nhuman rights in the world, the United Nations must \nfirst reform its own Human Rights Council. \n Some have also called for reform of the structure \nof the Security Council, including an expansion of its \nmembership. The United States is open to this \nprospect. We believe that Japan is well qualified for \npermanent membership on the Security Council and \nthat other nations should be considered as well. The \nUnited States will listen to all good ideas, and we will \nsupport changes to the Security Council as part of \nbroader United Nations reform. And in all we do, I call \non Member States to work for an institution that \nadheres to strict ethical standards and lives up to the \nhigh principles of the Universal Declaration. \n With the commitment and courage of those in this \nHall, we can build a world where people are free to \nspeak, assemble and worship as they wish   a world \nwhere children in every nation grow up healthy, get a \ndecent education and look to the future with hope   a \nworld where opportunity crosses every border. America \nwill lead towards that vision, in which all are created \nequal and free to pursue their dreams. That is the \nfounding conviction of my country. It is the promise \nthat established this body. And, with our determination, \nit can be the future of our world.  \n"

        "file_text": "At the outset, \nI would like to congratulate you, Sir, on your election \nto the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-\nsecond session. I wish you every success in your \nmission. I would like also to thank your predecessor, \nSheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa, for successfully \npresiding over the previous session. \n I would like further to pay tribute to Secretary-\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon, who has assumed his post at a \ncritical moment in which the Organization is facing \nseveral serious challenges that threaten international \npeace and security. \n The current session has begun at a time when \nmore than one fifth of the world\u2019s population of \nMuslims are observing mandatory fasting during the \nmonth of Ramadan. We were eager to participate in the \nactivities of this session being held in this holy month \nin order to stress our conviction in the need to \ncontribute to promoting coexistence among nations and \nto raise an important issue related to the purposes of \nthe international community with respect to the future \nof peace and progress. \n Given its great significance, I would like to refer \nto Security Council resolution 1770 (2007), on the \nsubject of Iraq, which was adopted on 10 August 2007. \nThat resolution has partly restored to the United \nNations its rightful role in addressing Iraq\u2019s tragedy, \nafter it was proven that it is no longer possible for that \nmatter to remain confined to a single State or to a \ncoalition of States of converging interests.  \n The world\u2019s major conflicts have become far too \nbig for a single Power to handle them on its own. \nResponsibility for addressing them should therefore be \nplaced with the United Nations, as it constitutes the \npolitical embodiment of the international community\u2019s \nprinciples, laws and broad aspirations to peacebuilding \nand to achieving progress on the basis of the rule of \nlaw and the will of those upholding its authority. If the \nrole of the United Nations is to be more effective, its \nstructure must be reformed to adapt to the changes that \nhave taken place in the world since the adoption of the \nCharter of the United Nations, in 1945. \n While the current situation in Iraq requires that \nthe international community assume its \nresponsibilities, the main responsibility remains with \nthe leaders of the whole Iraqi people, who are \nprimarily responsible for hammering out a formula of \nnational reconciliation that ensures justice, peace and \nsecurity and preserves the sovereignty and territorial \nintegrity of Iraq. \n The international order has witnessed both \u201ccold\u201d \nand actual wars. Although real wars are humanly \nunacceptable, cold wars are psychologically unbearable \nbecause they inevitably lead to proxy conflicts, which \nare incompatible with a world in which the forces of \nenlightenment and the elements of understanding \namong nations and cultures have strived in an \nunprecedented manner. \n The work of the United Nations in the areas of \ndevelopment should be accorded high priority, given \nthe close links that exist between development, \nsecurity and peace. We were indeed pleased that the \nGeneral Assembly approved the initiative of the State \nof Qatar to host the first follow-up conference to the \nInternational Conference on Financing for \nDevelopment, which is to be held at Doha during the \nsecond half of 2008. \n One of the major challenges that we all have to \naddress pertains to the protection of the environment. \nIn addition to the destructive effects of climate change, \nthe environment is subject to degradation and \npollution, which threaten human life as well as that of \nall living creatures. Such a situation requires both our \ncooperation and concerted efforts by industrialized and \ndeveloping countries alike to find new approaches and \nvisions leading to effective short-, mid- and long-term \nsolutions. In that connection, I would like to \nunderscore my country\u2019s support for any measures \naimed at protecting the environment and achieving \nsustainable development. \n International aid is one of the areas for promoting \ninternational partnership. The volume of aid should \ntherefore be increased and its efficiency improved by \neasing the conditions on which it is granted so as to \npromote the national development strategies of \nrecipient countries. In that regard, we are concerned \nabout the decline in 2006 of the real value of official \ndevelopment assistance. Donors should make \nadditional efforts to double the assistance provided to \nsub-Saharan African countries and to promote the \ndevelopment agenda of the United Nations. \n Moreover, given the important, major role played \nby global trade in financing development, a successful \nconclusion to the Doha Round would provide new \nopportunities to promote multilateral trade \ntransactions. While we are concerned about the \ndeadlock in the ongoing consultations on the \nimplementation of the Doha Development Agenda, we \nhope that we will be able to put that phase behind us. \nWe also hope that all parties concerned, especially \ndeveloped countries, will show the sufficient flexibility \nto reach mutually beneficial, practical results. \n I have not come to this session to present issues \nor crises related to my country or the Arab world, \nalthough some of them have reached proportions \nconstituting human tragedies. I have come here to raise \nbroader issues, as I am convinced that all Arab and \nMuslim issues are related to the problems of the world \nas a whole. In the light of a global understanding of the \nnew phase in international progress   an \nunderstanding that emphasizes the belief in the need to \nresort to the collective international will, as embodied \nby the United Nations, its leadership and system, and \nin the set of principles on which the Organization\u2019s \nCharter is based   Arab and Muslim causes would not \nbe the only ones to benefit from it; it would also \nbenefit the entire world. Just causes are always \nprotected by the principles of the law, and the law \nprovides their true guarantee, as well as powerful \nsupport. \n"

        "file_text": "It gives  me great pleasure at the outset to convey to all those \npresent the greetings and the best wishes of His \nExcellency Omar Hassan Ahmed Al-Bashir, the \nPresident of the Republic of the Sudan, who, owing to \nunforeseen circumstances, could not take part in this \nimportant session. \n It also gives me great pleasure to congratulate the \nPresident for his election as President of the United \nNations General Assembly in its sixty-second session. I \nam confident that his rich experience and high \nprofessionalism will lead our deliberations to the \nexpected successful results. I would also like to seize \nthis opportunity to pay tribute to his predecessor, \nSheika Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa, for the commendable \nefforts she undertook during the previous session of the \nAssembly. \n I would also like to take this opportunity to \nwarmly congratulate Mr. Ban Ki-moon for his election \nto lead this Organization. We have no doubt that he \nwill contribute constructively to the revitalization of \nthe United Nations role, preserving its Charter and the \nservice it renders to Member States in a spirit of \nrespect and transparency and that he will enable the \nUnited Nations to confront the current challenges at \nthis critical juncture in the development of \ninternational relations, where the international \ncommunity is faced with huge fateful challenges in \nmany areas. \n Last year, our President announced to the \nAssembly from this rostrum (see A/61/PV.11) that \npeace in our country is no longer a dream, but rather it \nis a living reality and an irrevocable strategic objective. \nToday, I am honoured to tell members that since then, \nwe have resolutely continued to implement the \nComprehensive Peace Agreement and to make it a \nreality. \n All the constitutional institutions and organs \nnecessary for implementation of the Agreement have \nbeen established. At the level of executive institutions, \nthe presidency, the Government of National Unity, the \nGovernment of South Sudan and the state governments \nhave all been established. In addition, the legislative \ninstitutions at the national level, in South Sudan and at \nthe State level have been formed. At the judicial level, \nthe National Judicial Service Commission and the \nConstitutional Court have been set up. Furthermore, all \ncommissions provided for in the Comprehensive Peace \nAgreement   such as the National Constitutional \nReview Commission, the Assessment and Evaluation \nCommission, the National Petroleum Commission, the \nNational Civil Service Commission, the Commission to \nProtect the Rights of Non-Muslims in the Capital and \nthe Technical Ad Hoc Border Committee   have been \nestablished and are all now diligently and \nconscientiously carrying out their mandates. \n Under the timeline for the implementation of the \nComprehensive Peace Agreement, the National \nElectoral Commission and the Human Rights \nCommission will be established by the end of this year. \nThe National Legislature will adopt relevant legislation \nfollowing the resumption of its session this month. A \nnumber of unresolved issues are currently being \ndiscussed and negotiated by joint committees \ncomprising representatives of the two partners and \nother members of the Government of National Unity. \nWe hope that those issues will be resolved soon, \nparticularly since both partners have declared their \ncommitment to that end. Moreover, it is important to \nemphasize that peace and security prevail today in \nSouth Sudan and the other areas covered by the \nComprehensive Peace Agreement. That fact in itself is \nthe greatest achievement of the Agreement, since it \nforms the necessary groundwork for the \nimplementation of other provisions. \n While my country reaffirms its full commitment \nto the letter and the spirit of the Comprehensive Peace \nAgreement and is determined to energetically and \nfaithfully pursue its implementation, we also expect the \ninternational community to honour its pledges in \nfulfilling the requirements for peace   in particular \nthe pledges made at the 2005 Oslo donor conference, \nthe cancellation of all external debt and the lifting of \nunilateral economic sanctions and restrictions, which \nhamper reconstruction and development efforts and, \nindeed, defeat the very objectives of the Agreement   \nso that the country can manage the burden of \nreconstruction and development. Peace and security are \ntwo sides of the same coin: neither can exist without \nthe other. Sudanese citizens are eagerly awaiting the \npeace dividends of reconstruction and development. \nWe must not fail to meet that legitimate expectation. \n The march towards peace resolutely continued \nwith the signing of the Darfur Peace Agreement at \nAbuja in May 2006 under the generous auspices of the \nAfrican Union, which served as mediator. The \nAgreement was a huge step forward towards the \nachievement of peace, stability and development in \nDarfur through dialogue. That fact was acknowledged \nby the international community, which effectively \ncontributed to the conclusion of the Agreement.  \n We have begun to implement various aspects of \nthe Darfur Peace Agreement. In the area of \npower-sharing and participation, the Transitional \nDarfur Regional Authority has been established, and \ncitizens of Darfur have been appointed to executive \nlegislative positions at all levels of Government. All \nprovisions of the Agreement related to power- and \nwealth-sharing and to security arrangements   \nparticularly the Ceasefire Commission   have also \nbeen put in place, in full cooperation with the partners. \n With regard to the humanitarian situation, my \ncountry has always been fully committed to facilitating \nunhindered access to the flow of relief assistance for \nthe affected and the needy. We have also facilitated the \nactivities and movement of humanitarian organizations \nin Darfur. All those efforts culminated in the Joint \nCommuniqu\u00e9 between the Government of the Sudan \nand the United Nations on Facilitation of Humanitarian \nActivities in Darfur, which we signed with the United \nNations on 28 March 2007. The Communiqu\u00e9 is \nbeing implemented through a joint mechanism \ncomprising the Government, the United Nations and \nnational and international voluntary non-governmental \norganizations. \n The humanitarian situation is clearly improving, \nas confirmed by health and humanitarian statistics \nshowing lower levels of epidemics, hunger and food \nshortages, a situation better than in other parts of that \narea of Darfur. The return of internally displaced \npersons and refugees to their villages is another sign of \nimprovement. The Secretary-General himself \nwitnessed such movement during his most recent visit \nto the Sudan. \n The joint efforts of the Government of the Sudan \nand the United Nations to maintain and consolidate \npeace have continued with the strengthening of the \nAfrican Union Mission in the Sudan (AMIS) through \nthe light and heavy support packages adopted at the \nhigh-level meeting held in November 2006 in \nAddis Ababa, followed by the hybrid operation \nauthorized by the Security Council in its resolution \n1769 (2007). Our country has declared its full \ncompliance with the letter and the spirit of that \nresolution.  \n The progress that has been made on the political, \nhumanitarian and peacekeeping fronts could have been \nachieved only through dialogue led by the United \nNations and other international actors   for which we \nhad been calling for quite some time   not through the \nimposition of policies of pressure and coercion. Thus, \nit has been possible to arrive at an agreement \nacceptable to all parties. That has propelled the \nsituation in Darfur into a good phase, thanks to efforts \naimed at a peaceful settlement and the inclusion of \ngroups that did not endorse the Darfur Peace \nAgreement.  \n My country is firmly convinced that the problem \nof Darfur must be resolved in a political manner, \nthrough negotiations. Therefore, we believe that high \npriority should be accorded to a political negotiation \nprocess. We reiterated that belief at the aforementioned \nhigh-level consultations held at Addis Ababa. Here, I \nwish to reaffirm my Government\u2019s full support for the \njoint African Union-United Nations initiative, led by \nSpecial Envoys Jan Eliasson and Salim Ahmed Salim. \nIn addition, we reiterate that we are fully prepared to \nengage in the peace talks scheduled to begin in Libya \non 27 October 2007. \n From this rostrum, we call on all rebel \nmovements in Darfur to join in the march towards \npeace without delay and to immediately cease \nhostilities, in response to the repeated appeals of the \nGovernment of the Sudan. My Government has already \ndeclared a unilateral ceasefire, which will coincide \nwith the 27 October peace talks. We hope and expect \nthat the armed factions will reciprocate so that a \npermanent and verifiable ceasefire can be declared \nwhen the talks begin. Furthermore, we call on the \ninternational community to take firm measures against \nthose who obstruct or refuse to participate in the peace \ntalks. We also call upon those international actors who \nhave hosted a number of the leaders of those factions \nto demonstrate that they are credible by persuading \nthem to participate in the Libya talks. At the high-level \nconsultations held on 21 September in New York, it \nwas resolved that the talks would be final and \nconclusive. \n Reconstruction and development are major \nfactors for stability and for strengthening efforts \ntowards a political settlement. We must therefore \ndevote similar attention to the issues of development, \nrehabilitation and reconstruction, as stipulated in \nSecurity Council resolution 1769 (2007). We look \nforward to the international community finalizing its \ncurrent efforts towards holding an international \nconference on the reconstruction of Darfur; we hope it \nwill take place soon. \n In the twists and turns of the Darfur problem, my \ncountry has been the subject of unfair, hostile and \nill-intentioned campaigns from some international \nquarters that are bent on exploiting the crisis in Darfur \nto serve their well-known interests, agendas and \nschemes. This vicious campaign has targeted our \ncountry\u2019s policies and political positions and seeks to \nexaggerate and distort the facts and to denigrate the \ncountry's capabilities, its heritage and the values and \ntraditions of its people. The campaign also aims at \ndiverting attention from other regional and \ninternational crises. We hope that the international \ncommunity will shoulder its responsibilities in the \nservice of peace and stability in Darfur and seize the \ngolden opportunity that will be provided by the \nexpected peace talks in Libya. \n My country, which has reaffirmed its full \ncommitment to the objectives of peace and stability, \nculminating in concrete terms in the Comprehensive \nPeace Agreement, will leave no stone unturned to \nspread peace, security and stability in Darfur. It will \nstrive to consolidate its positive and constructive \nengagement with the United Nations. Clearly, there is \nno person or group of persons more concerned, or more \ndetermined to stop the bloodshed and achieve peace \nand stability in Darfur, than the Government of the \nSudan. \n We live in a world of continuous challenges and \nrecurrent threats. There is no doubt that the \ninternational community is more than ever convinced \nthat the only way to confront these challenges and their \nconsequences is through collective efforts effectively \nand ably led by the United Nations. Such a role is \nreflected in the special attention the Organization has \nbegun to pay to the challenge of climate change, as \nreflected in the statements made by heads of State or \nGovernment during the recent high-level event on \nclimate change. Climate change and environmental \ndegradation are major causes of conflict in many \nAfrican countries, including my own, as noted in the \nrecent comprehensive report of the United Nations \nEnvironment Programme, which highlighted the \nserious challenges the world faces as a result of climate \nchange. \n We must therefore consolidate our efforts and \ncapacities in order to save our planet for present and \nfuture generations. We all recognize that climate \nchange should be confronted within the framework of \nthe requirements of sustainable development and its \nthree pillars: economic development, social \ndevelopment and environmental protection. Sudan \nsigned the United Nations Framework Convention on \nClimate Change (UNFCCC) and ratified it in \nNovember 1993, thus committing itself to mutual \ncooperation with the global community to address the \nproblem of climate change. A global consensus on a \npost-2012 agreement must be reached at the thirteenth \nsession of the Conference of the Parties to the \nUNFCCC and the third session of the Meeting of the \nParties to the Kyoto Protocol, to be held in Bali in \nDecember 2007. A successful outcome would be based \non the Rio principle of common but differentiated \nresponsibilities and would take fully into account the \nneeds of the developing countries, especially the most \nvulnerable among them In this context, the Sudan \nbelieves that developed countries must meet their \ncommitments in the fields of development, \ncapacity-building and financial and technical assistance \nto developing countries and must take the initiative to \nconfront such problems in those countries. \n The current international economic conditions \nand the commercial and financial scenario constrain \ndevelopment in developing countries, especially the \nleast developed among them. This poses imminent \ndangers to the peoples of those countries, due to many \nfactors. The most important of them are: the paucity of \nofficial development assistance (ODA); the unfair \nterms of international trade, which place restrictions on \ndeveloping countries\u2019 exports to international markets \nand impose unfair prices on their primary \ncommodities; heavy external debt; and the negative \neffects of the process of globalization. \n The Millennium Summit reaffirmed Africa\u2019s \nspecial needs and made meeting them a priority. \nHence, the United Nations should take the lead in \nreaching that objective. In this regard, we hope that the \nposition of Special Adviser to the Secretary-General on \nAfrica will be strengthened and that the necessary \nresources will be allocated to that office to enable it to \nshoulder its responsibilities towards strengthening \nUnited Nations activities focused on Africa, in \nparticular those pertaining to the attainment of the \nMillennium Development Goals and the consolidation \nof international cooperation to support the New \nPartnership for Africa\u2019s Development. \n The Sudan reiterates the importance of the \nMillennium Declaration and of reaching its goals, as \nwell as the importance of other items on the \ninternational development agenda, with special \nemphasis on the right of developing countries to \ndetermine their priorities without restrictions, \nconditions or predetermined obligations that impede \ntheir development efforts, as described in the \nAfrican-Caribbean-Pacific Summit that my country \nhosted last December. \n In this respect, I would like to point out that my \ncountry has exerted tremendous efforts towards the \nrealization of these objectives and has made noticeable \nprogress in the difficult areas of poverty eradication, \neducation, health care, maternal and child welfare and \ncombating diseases. \n The concept of human rights continues to attract \nthe attention of the international community, not only \nbecause of the vital importance of the issue, but also \nbecause of attempts to deviate from the aim of \ndiscussing this issue with integrity and to exploit it in \norder to settle political scores. My country is of the \nview that a new approach based on dialogue and \ncooperation should be introduced when dealing with \nhuman rights, instead of naming and shaming, \ncondemnation and threats of sanctions. Moreover, \nselectivity and double standards should not influence \nthe consideration of human rights issues, especially at \nthe Human Rights Council, which completed its first \nyear with the adoption of an important document that \nlays the institutional foundation of the Council \nthrough, inter alia, ensuring the independence of \nrapporteurs in the fulfilment of their mandates and \nensuring that human rights are monitored with \nneutrality. With the adoption of that important \ndocument, the Council has truly started the process of \ncorrecting the failures and shameful practices of the \nformer Commission on Human Rights. \n In fulfilment of its political commitments, and \nconsistent with the attention it gives to all sectors of \nsociety, especially the most vulnerable ones, the Sudan \nwas among the first countries to sign the Convention \non the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Women \nhave been the focus of Government plans and \nstrategies aiming at their advancement and \nempowerment in all fields, in compliance with the \nprovisions of the Transitional Constitution and the \nComprehensive Peace Agreement. These efforts were \ncrowned with the adoption of national strategies and \nplans pertaining to the advancement and empowerment \nof women in all fields. \n As indicated earlier in relation to the declared \nobjectives of the establishment of the Human Rights \nCouncil, in the light of experience with the former \nCommission on Human Rights, any effort to reform \ninternational institutions will be futile without the \nreform of the United Nations itself; any United Nations \nreform will be incomplete without the reform of the \nSecurity Council. \n While we commend the efforts exerted thus far in \ndeliberations pertaining to Security Council reform and \nthe revitalization of the General Assembly, it is \nimportant to intensify efforts further in order to \naccomplish the desired objectives and understandings \nin this area. The Sudan reiterates its commitment to the \nAfrican position, as provided for in the Ezulwini \nconsensus and confirmed by subsequent African \nsummit meetings. Africa is the only continent without \npermanent representation on the Security Council, \nalthough African issues constitute more than \n70 per cent of the Council\u2019s agenda. \n The fact that the Palestinian question remains \nunresolved since the establishment of the United \nNations decades ago not only tarnishes the credibility \nof the Organization but also continues to pose a serious \nthreat to international peace and security. It is \nimperative to conclude a comprehensive, lasting and \njust settlement of this conflict, especially in the light of \ncontinued violent confrontations between the \nPalestinian people and the Israeli occupying forces. \n The international community should force Israel \nto comply with international resolutions and fulfil its \ncommitments, including those set out in the Road Map, \nand enable the Palestinian people to exercise its right \nto self-determination and to establish its own \nindependent State, with its capital in Al-Quds \nAl-Sharif. It is also imperative to reach a \ncomprehensive settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict, \nbased on Israel\u2019s withdrawal from all the land it \noccupied in 1967. In this context, and to ensure \nsustained security and peace for all the peoples in the \nregion, we wish to confirm the need to make the \nMiddle East, without any exceptions, a nuclear-\nweapon-free zone. \n Developments in Iraq have further aggravated the \ndeteriorating situation in the Middle East. The \nincreasing pace of violence in Iraq and the \ndeterioration of the security situation make it \nincumbent on all of us to cooperate and help the Iraqi \npeople in their predicament. This can be achieved only \nthrough respect for the free will of the Iraqi people, the \npreservation of Iraq\u2019s unity and national sovereignty \nand setting a time frame for the exit of occupation \nforces from Iraq. \n My country has repeatedly condemned terrorism \nin all its forms and manifestations. The Sudan supports \nall relevant regional and international decisions and \nresolutions pertaining to terrorism and affirms its \ncooperation with the international community to \nimplement these decisions. However, in order to \neradicate terrorism, it is necessary to address its root \ncauses and implement the integrated strategies that \nhave been adopted. \n I wish to conclude by reiterating that, in order for \nthe United Nations to continue playing its role, we all \nhave a collective responsibility, one based on a solid \ndetermination to make this Organization a platform for \ncollective international efforts that would effectively \nand expeditiously address global challenges. We also \nneed to coordinate with regional organizations within \nthe framework of the United Nations Charter. \n We look forward, therefore, to working together \nto strengthen multilateral cooperation for the common \ngood, transcending narrow self-interest. My country, \nwhich this year celebrates the fifty-first anniversary of \nits joining the United Nations, hopes that this session\u2019s \ndeliberations will represent a landmark in fulfilling \nthose goals. \n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of  the people and the Government of the Republic of \nMozambique and, indeed, on my own behalf, I would \nlike to associate myself with the previous speakers in \ncongratulating you most warmly on your election as \nPresident of the General Assembly at its sixty-second \nsession. We are confident that with your experience \nand wise leadership, as demonstrated throughout your \nremarkable academic and diplomatic career at the \nservice of your country, and with the support of us all, \nthe deliberations of this session will be crowned with \nsuccess. \n Mr. President, my delegation would like to take \nthis opportunity to pay tribute to your predecessor, Her \nExcellency Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa, for her \ndedication and the innovative manner with which she \npresided over the deliberations of the sixty-first session \nof the General Assembly. \n We also wish to reiterate our special tribute to the \nSecretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon, \nfor his election to this post, and we salute him for his \ncommitment to the continued search for solutions to \nthe many challenges faced by humanity, and for his \nhard work on behalf of our Organization. \nMr. Secretary-General, we would like to reaffirm our \nfull readiness to continue cooperating with you for the \nsuccessful discharge of your difficult but noble \nmission. \n We commend the selection of the theme of \nclimate change as the main discussion topic for this \nsession, as it is an urgent and important issue for our \ncountries and for the future of our planet. Thanks to the \nrevolution in convergence technology in the areas of \ninformatics, broadcasting and telecommunications, \nwith implications for time and space compression, we \nhave been following with emotion and on a regular \nbasis, and in some instances in real time, the effects of \nclimate change on our planet. We have witnessed the \nreduction in the availability of water resources and the \ntragic consequences for human beings, fauna and flora; \nthe increase in the frequency and magnitude of extreme \nmeteorological phenomena, such as extreme \ntemperatures, earthquakes and tsunamis, resulting in \nthe occurrence of natural disasters whose consequences \nare incalculable; the reduction of glaciers and the rise \nof sea level; to mention but a few of the potential \nimpacts of climate change, the full effects of which are \nyet to be clearly determined. \n The impact of these phenomena is felt more \nharshly in developing countries, such as ours, given \nour deficient forecasting capacity in terms of human \nand technical resources. When these disasters strike \nour countries, our limitations and our lack of capacity \nto face them become more obvious. Examples of such \nlimitations include: a lack of infrastructure, such as \nroads and bridges, preventing rescue personnel from \nproviding timely assistance, even to citizens at great \nrisk; a lack of means to assist the victims; and a lack of \nresources to mitigate the suffering of the survivors.  \n Given that we live in a global village, the effects \nof climate change are also felt in developed countries. \nPhenomena never before recorded with the magnitude \nand frequency with which they manifest themselves \ntoday are beginning to be a cause of concern for the \ncitizens of these countries. \n To digress a little from the discussion at hand, we \nwould like to express our solidarity with and \ncompassion to all victims of the natural disasters that \nhave affected different regions of the planet in recent \nyears. In honour of the victims of these disasters, let us \nall reaffirm our commitment to continue together to \nstrive for a better world, a world free of these threats to \nhuman life and possessions, and to fauna and flora. \n That is a collective commitment and aspiration \nthat we have already assumed through several \ninstruments, such as the Rio Declaration, Agenda 21 \nand the Kyoto Protocol. More than ever, and in the face \nof recurrent and increasingly devastating tragedies, \nthere is a need for the involvement of all the members \nof the international community in the implementation \nof the global actions provided for in these joint \nundertakings. \n By the same token, we should ensure that the \nthree pillars of sustainable development, namely, \neconomic development, social development and the \nprotection of the environment should be approached \nand tackled by all of us, in an integrated, coordinated \nand balanced manner. Let us all keep in mind the \nstrong relationship between these commitments and \nour collective desire to attain the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals. \n We note with great satisfaction that the \ninternational community continues to be committed to \naddressing, in a structured and sustainable manner, the \nchallenges imposed by climate change. In this context, \nwe welcome the decisions on climate change taken by \nthe Heads of State and Government of Group of Eight \n(G-8) at their last summit held in June of this year in \nGermany. \n We would also like to congratulate the Secretary-\nGeneral, for his initiative in appointing three eminent \npersons as Special Envoys on Climate Change. The \nconvening of the High-level Event on Climate Change, \njust two days ago here in this General Assembly Hall, \nopens up new prospects for the renewed momentum \nnecessary for substantial progress to be made during \nthe Conference of States Parties to the United Nations \nFramework Agreement on Climate Change, scheduled \nfor December of this year in Bali, Indonesia. \n We are hopeful that this Conference will build \nconsensus on future actions, including concrete targets \naimed at reducing carbon dioxide emissions, and a \npost-Kyoto agreement to be binding on all nations. \nMay this Conference not frustrate expectations, \nparticularly those of the developing countries. \n It is our hope that in Bali consensus will be \nreached in some key areas. First, we would like to see \nthe provision of funding of the national action plans for \nadaptation to climate change, proposed by developing \ncountries parties to the Framework Convention on \nClimate Change. The second element is the Adaptation \nFund, established in conformity with the Kyoto \nProtocol, to provide assistance for developing \ncountries, in particular the least developed countries, in \nthe funding of their adaptation activities. The third is \nthe implementation of the Buenos Aires Programme of \nWork on Adaptation and Response Measures. \n Mozambique is a country prone to various types \nof natural disasters, which cyclically have resulted in \nthe loss of human lives, the destruction of huge \nagricultural areas, property and social and economic \ninfrastructures and increased soil erosion and a \ndecrease in or outright loss of biodiversity. \n This state of affairs is aggravated by the shortage \nof physical infrastructures for water management, such \nas dams and dykes, and for food conservation, such as \nsilos. In addition, over 70 per cent of our population \nlives in rural areas, and natural resources are their \nprincipal source of livelihood. Hence the need for \nsustainable use that does not jeopardize the country\u2019s \nenvironmental balance. \n Because of this permanent vulnerability, \nenvironmental issues in general, and climate change in \nparticular, form an integral part of the Government \nagenda. Particular attention is thus given to reducing \nthe vulnerability of citizens to famine caused by \ndrought, reducing human and property losses, \nmitigating the suffering of the population as a result of \ndisasters and ensuring quick and harmonious \nreconstruction processes. \n The activities under way include mapping the \nareas at risk, improving the early warning system, \nimproving the conditions for the population to store \nagricultural produce, the provision of training and civic \neducation for our citizens on natural disasters and their \nimpact on the life of the country and the establishment \nof a national emergency operations centre, which \noperates 24 hours a day non-stop. \n The introduction and implementation of these \nmeasures give priority to and rely on the active \nparticipation of our citizens. For us, the involvement of \nour citizens, who are the primary and ultimate \nbeneficiaries of these governmental actions, is a key \nfactor in ensuring the success of activities aimed at the \npreservation of the environment and mitigating the \nadverse effects of climate change. The positive impact \nof these actions was in evidence and widely \nacknowledged during the recent floods, cyclones and \nhigh tides that we experienced earlier this year. These \nmeasures were recently put to the test once again, when \na warning was sounded on the possibility of a tsunami. \n In recognition of the fact that the mitigation of \nand adaptation to climate change and the prevention \nand reduction of natural disasters require the \nengagement of the international community, the \nimportance of strengthening regional, continental and \ninternational coordination cannot be overemphasized. \nIn the framework of the report of the High-level Panel \non System-wide Coherence in the areas of \ndevelopment, humanitarian assistance and the \nenvironment (A/61/583), we advocate the \nstrengthening of the Global Environment Facility \nwithin the United Nations system. We thus encourage \nthe United Nations to enhance its institutional capacity \nand resources to better assist Member States to \nincorporate adequate environmental policies in their \nnational development strategies. In this regard, special \nattention should be given to developing countries with \nlimited resources to fund their national capacity-\nbuilding for dealing with issues related to climate \nchange. \n From this rostrum we once again call upon all \nUnited Nations Member States to accede to and fully \nimplement all the instruments that have been adopted \nto revert and mitigate the impact of climate change. \nThese instruments include the Kyoto Protocol, Agenda \n21 and the Rio Declaration, whose contents were \nreaffirmed at the World Summit on Sustainable \nDevelopment, held in Johannesburg in 2002. \n As members of the United Nations family, we \nhave the historic responsibility of securing a bright \nfuture for our children and for the generations to come \nby preserving a quality environment. That is why \ntoday, more than ever, the time has come for us to join \nour hands and work to preserve our planet. To act \nagainst climate change is, in the last analysis, to \npreserve world peace and security and to ensure \nnecessary conditions to achieve the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals, which should be viewed and \nassumed as the minimum that can now be demanded. \nIndeed, let us not postpone until tomorrow what we \ncan, and must, all do today, as tomorrow may be too \nlate. \n"

        "file_text": "It has been barely two weeks since I initiated in \nGuatemala an electoral process that will conclude on \n14 January, when I will have the honour to bestow the \npresidential sash on the person elected democratically \nby my people. That event will have two consequences: \nfirst, representative democracy will be strengthened \nfurther in Guatemala, based on an electoral process that \neven international observers have described as very \nsatisfactory. \n Secondly, this is my last appearance before the \nGeneral Assembly, an occasion which I take advantage \nof in order to attest my support to the United Nations \nand to greet our new Secretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-\nmoon, and the outgoing President of the General \nAssembly, Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa, and the \nincoming President, Mr. Srgjan Kerim. \n Now that we have only a few months before \nhanding over power in Guatemala, I wanted to give a \nbrief account of the main accomplishments of my \nadministration, within the framework of what we \nconsider a successful history, despite the problems that \ncontinue to besiege us. After overcoming an internal \nconflict that lasted four long decades, this story reflects \nsuccess not only for Guatemala but also for the United \nNations, the Organization that is so closely tied to our \nPeace Accords. It is precisely those agreements that \nencompass our main objectives, namely strengthening \nthe State\u2019s democratic institutions, promoting \neconomic and social development, fighting against \npoverty and social exclusion, fully respecting human \nrights and building a multicultural, multiethnic and \nmultilingual Nation. \n Allow me to reveal some of the accomplishments \nof the past years. First, one of the successes of our \nadministration was improving the quality of public \nmanagement through the creation or strengthening of \npublic institutions, the articulation of coherent policy \nprogrammes combined with specific actions and in \nmany instances, updated legislation. It would be \ntedious to enumerate the multiple areas revamped, \nincluding diverse subjects such as food security, the \nenergy sector, administrative and financial \ndecentralization, governmental administration, the \nrevenue administration, trafficking of persons and \nassistance to immigrants   the last subject is so dear \nto our concerns. \nAt the same time, we have progressed in \nstrengthening and creating new democratic \nmechanisms control institutions, invigorating the \ndirection of ministries as well as enhancing result-\noriented management, while all along integrating the \nmain political aims with planning and budgets. In that \ncontext, we have built a State where public expenditure \nand biddings are subject to civil society scrutiny. \nHaving instituted the \u201cGuatecompras\u201d programme and \nmaking it mandatory for the public sector, we have \nreinforced the commitment to work with transparency \nin all areas of government. \n Secondly, in the last four years we have also \nachieved an economic recovery within a framework of \na solid financial stability. We exceeded growth rates of \n3.5 per cent in the biennium 2004-2005 by attaining \n5 per cent in 2006 and 5.6 per cent in 2007. The overall \npoverty index fell five percentage points between the \nyears 2000 and 2006, from 56 per cent of the \npopulation to 51 per cent, respectively. We \nacknowledge that ratio is still unacceptably high but \nthe achievement of that reduction must inspire us to \ncontinue fighting to fulfil in Guatemala one of the main \nMillennium Development Goals of the United Nations. \nFor that reason, public policy was redirected \ncompletely towards rural development, where the main \nsocial underdevelopment and poverty are concentrated. \n One of the sources of the increasing dynamism of \nour economy has been the export sector, whether to \nCentral America or to the rest of the world. All that \neffort has been impelled by our National Agenda for \nCompetitiveness 2005-2015, and it has been \ncomplemented by a marked increase in investment in \ninfrastructure, mainly in the rural areas. The \ncommitment to reach better levels of competitiveness \nwas also translated into the construction of a new \ninternational airport and the remodelling of six more, \nalong with qualitative and quantitative improvements \nto seaports, as well as the rehabilitation, paving and \nextension of over 2,100 kilometres of roads throughout \nthe country. \n Thirdly, we have given an enormous impulse to \nsocial expenditure, particularly those destined for \neducation, health and housing. The goals set forth in \nthe Peace Accords of assigning 4.8 per cent of gross \ndomestic product to social expenditures have been \nsurpassed to reach 5.7 per cent in 2006, approximately \ntwice the proportion of ten years ago. \n Thanks to that redirection of policy and the \nstrengthening of institutional reforms, particularly in \neducation, the principal social indicators have begun to \nshow significant improvements. For example, the net \nrate of school attendance at the primary level was \nraised from 72.6 per cent in 1997 to 95.5 per cent in \n2006. At the same time, we achieved a higher rate of \nhealth coverage, thanks to the strategy adopted, under \nwhich another 4.1 million Guatemalans can access that \nessential service. \n Fourthly, in the area of the inclusion of \nindigenous peoples, Guatemala enacted the Public \nPolicy for Coexistence and the Elimination of Racism, \nunder the aegis of the Presidential Commission Against \nDiscrimination. Also, we have incorporated \nmulticultural criteria into public policies, planning and \nprojects; we have strengthened bilingual and \nintercultural education and we have instituted an \naffirmative action policy in order to increase the \nproportion of indigenous civil employees in the public \nsector. \n Fifthly, during my administration a human rights \napproach was promoted in all public sector policies \nand during the past four years more public policies \nregarding human rights were enacted than during all \nthe previous governments. In that context, allow me to \nmention just one aspect: the right of reparations \nviolations has been acknowledged for victims of \nhuman rights and for that purpose we devised a \nNational Plan of Compensation with a duration of \n13 years in order to respond to all claims. \n Finally, we addressed the issue of citizen security \nin an integral manner, a social phenomena conditioned \nby multiple economic, social, political and cultural \nfactors, while at the same time insisting on the full \nobservance of human rights. We recognize that there is \nstill much to do in that area, but in practice definite and \nsignificant advances have been attained. To address \nnew national and regional challenges that have arisen \nin regard to citizen insecurity and organized crime, my \nadministration concentrated its efforts on strengthening \npublic institutions and building democratic \ngovernance. \n I must state that many of these policies should be \nconceived as State policies rather than those of a \nparticular Government. In this regard, we have put into \nplace a transition programme so as to transfer to the \nnew democratically elected authorities, after the second \nround of elections to be held on 4 November, all the \ninformation deemed most relevant to facilitate the \nadministration of the new Government. \n Logically, our foreign policy was also inspired by \nthe same principles and values as our domestic policy, \nwhich I have already outlined. Perhaps the area in \nwhich we have best managed to promote these \nobjectives is here in the United Nations, which has \nworked with us in the negotiation, implementation and \nfollow-up to our peace accords. We have tried to repay \nthat support in a modest way with our contribution to \npeacekeeping operations in various parts of the world, \nparticularly in our sister nation of Haiti, as well as \nthrough our active presence in various United Nations \nforums.  \n Given the circumstances, it is in our interest to \npreserve, to strengthen and to adapt to modern times \nour Organization, the United Nations, whose ideals we \nvalue so much. The United Nations occupies a special \nplace in our foreign policy. We value it not only for its \npast role   the United Nations Verification Mission in \nGuatemala left the country at the end of 2004   but \nalso for its continued contributions. In 2006, an office \nof the High Commissioner for Human Rights, which \nworks with and advises and counsels the State, was \nestablished. This month, September, a new concerted \neffort is being made between Guatemala and the United \nNations with the collaboration of a group of friendly \nnations, through the creation of an International \nCommission against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG), \nwhose objective is to improve our investigation \ncapacities and the arraignment and prosecution of \ncriminal activities in our country. This is an \nunprecedented collaboration between a Member State \nand the United Nations, with a view to combating \nimpunity, and particularly transnational crime, an \nendeavour that will surely yield very tangible benefits \nfor my country and valuable experience for the United \nNations. \n We also reiterate our commitment to the Central \nAmerican integration process, which has produced \nremarkable advances in the last four years. We are very \nclose to securing our integration process by means of \nputting in place a customs union, and we are also \nembarking on a negotiation process with the European \nUnion aimed at securing an association agreement. \n Reviewing some of the other items on our \nagenda, on Monday of this week I had the privilege to \ntake part in the high-level event on climate change, \nwhere I added our voice of alarm at the irreversible \nharm that we are causing ourselves owing to global \ngreenhouse emissions. The amount of scientific data \nproving this phenomenon is unquestionable, and \nGuatemala has not been spared its effects. But we also \nhave the scientific means to mitigate, and even reverse, \nrecent tendencies, which requires a shared but \ndifferentiated effort on the part of all of us. The United \nNations offers unparalleled forums in which to tackle \nthis common threat. It is as serious a threat to humanity \nas are wars with weapons of mass destruction, or \ntransnational terrorism. \n I would like in the last part of my speech to talk \nabout some of the items on the General Assembly\u2019s \nagenda. I have the following specific comments. As a \nmulticultural, multiethnic and multilingual country, we \nare proud to have worked hand in hand with other \ncountries in the negotiations that led to the recent \nadoption of the United Nations Declaration on the \nRights of Indigenous Peoples. \n As a member of the Human Rights Council, we \nhave actively participated in its process of institution-\nbuilding. We believe that the greatest challenge that the \nCouncil has to confront is to finalize that building \nprocess and to set in motion the universal, periodic \nreview mechanism. Guatemala will be one of the first \ncountries to be reviewed. \n We are pleased at the holding of the first annual \nministerial examination of the Economic and Social \nCouncil, aimed at appraising the progress achieved in \nfulfilling the targets and the objectives of development, \nas well as the launching of the Development \nCooperation Forum. We support any reform and \nreorientation of the Organization that will enhance its \nability to deliver results, coherence and efficiency. We \ntake note of what has already been done in the \nDepartment of Peacekeeping Operations, as well as the \nSecretary-General\u2019s ideas for reforming the \nDepartment of Political Affairs. We are concerned, \nhowever, that the issues of reform relating to the \ndevelopment agenda agreed at the World Summit of \n2005 are not being accorded the same priority. \n Also, as a country that was a principal actor in \nthe Financing for Development conference of 2002, we \nbelieve that the dialogue scheduled for 23 and \n24 October will afford an opportunity to review the \ncurrent achievements of its goals and to implement the \nundertakings set forth in the Monterrey Consensus. \n In our capacity as a middle-income country, we \nwere pleased at the holding of the Intergovernmental \nConference of Middle-Income Countries last March in \nSpain, and we are committed to the success of the \nsecond such meeting to be convened in El Salvador in \nOctober. \n We continue to await the much-discussed reform \nof the Security Council, and we note the advances \nattained during the last session of the Assembly, when \nwe were closer than ever before to a process of \nintergovernmental negotiation. We trust that during this \nsession those efforts will be pursued. \n As I have said, this is the last occasion on which I \nshall come before the Assembly as President of \nGuatemala. I therefore reiterate my deep gratitude to \nthe United Nations and to all its Member States for \ntheir support for our work and our initiatives during the \nfour years of my mandate. \n"

        "file_text": "I  should like at the outset to express heartfelt \ncongratulations to you, Sir, on your election as \nPresident of the General Assembly at its present \nsession, as well as my best wishes for every success \nduring your tenure. I also wish to thank Her Excellency \nSheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa for her constructive \nand tireless efforts during her remarkable and fruitful \npresidency at the previous session, which was a source \nof pride for her country, Bahrain, and for the \ninternational community.  \n As this is the first session of the General \nAssembly under our newly appointed Secretary-\nGeneral, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, I should like to reaffirm, \non behalf of the Kingdom of Morocco, our full \nconfidence in and support for his tireless efforts and \ngood offices aimed at enabling the United Nations to \nattain its lofty objectives and to fulfil the aspirations of \nall nations. It is our hope that, at the dawn of the third \nmillennium, a more just and effective world system can \nemerge, enabling nations to achieve collective peace \nand sustainable development.  \n Our session takes place at the eve of the \ncelebration by the United Nations of the sixtieth \nanniversary of two important historical events that \nhave marked its activities, forged its identity and \nproved its added value and its outstanding contribution \nto strengthening international cooperation, protecting \nhuman dignity and consolidating world peace and \nsecurity. These events are the General Assembly\u2019s \nadoption in 1948 of the Universal Declaration of \nHuman Rights and the deployment of the first United \nNations peacekeeping operation in that same year. In \nthis context, it is appropriate to pause and take stock of \nwhat has been done in these two vital areas, and to \noutline the work objectives of our Organization in \norder to develop and optimize our common assets in a \ncomplex international melieu.  \n The Universal Declaration of Human Rights laid \nthe foundations of international consensus regarding \nuniversal values and subsequently contributed to \ninternational efforts for the codification, protection and \nrespect of basic cultural, social, economic and political \nrights. To this end, the international community is \ninvited, through the United Nations, to take concrete \nmeasures to implement the provisions of this \nDeclaration and give effect to confirm concretely its \npolitical and legal values.  \n In that connection, His Majesty King Mohammed \nVI stated in a royal address on 9 December 1999 that \namong the appropriate means of ensuring respect for \nhuman rights was the commitment to the relevant \ninternational covenants and the setting up of \nmechanisms for respecting and safeguarding these \nrights. He added that those legal and institutional \ninstruments were, however, insufficient if respect for \nhuman rights was not part of standard conduct at all \nlevels, or if, in other words, it did not become a shared \nculture. \n The Kingdom of Morocco has embarked, under \nHis Majesty\u2019s enlightened leadership, on a thorough \nand ambitious process of political openness, human \ndevelopment and social modernization. In parallel, it is \nwilling to participate in constructive international \nefforts aimed at establishing world consensus on \nhuman rights concepts, so that they no longer \nconstitute a source of conflict and confrontation but are \nrather a motive for cooperation and consultation. Those \nconcepts should not remain mere universal values but \nshould become a reality, taking into consideration the \ndiversity and indivisibility of human rights.  \n In this regard, the Kingdom of Morocco proposed \nlast March, in the Human Rights Council, the adoption \nof a universal declaration on training and education in \nthe culture of human rights, whose objective would be \nto consolidate and reinforce the values, principles and \nconcepts of human rights by all international social \ncomponents, so that they become a daily concern and a \nresponsible practice. Morocco hopes that this proposal \nwill be supported by all States, so that it may constitute \na valuable contribution to the celebration of the sixtieth \nanniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human \nrights.  \n Peacekeeping operations are a key element of the \nactivities of the United Nations, embodying the \ncollective security principle that is one of the pillars of \nthe United Nations Charter. Thanks to this mechanism, \nthe United Nations has displayed a great capacity to \nadapt to change and has been able to participate in a \ndirect and effective manner in the reinforcement of \ninternational peace.  \n The importance of peacekeeping operations has \nincreased with the evolution of the traditional concept \nand the accumulation of tasks, which are no longer \nlimited to peacekeeping per se. These tasks have also \nbroadened in scope to encompass assistance to States \nundergoing reconstruction or engaged in the \nimplementation of transitional justice, the \nconsolidation of human rights, or good governance. \n In this respect, the Kingdom of Morocco has been \na pioneer in United Nations peacekeeping efforts, \nsending since 1960 more than 50,000 Blue Helmets to \n13 peacekeeping operations across four continents. \nThanks to their sacrifice and determination to uphold \nthe principles of the United Nations, the Royal Armed \nForces, along with the other peacekeeping troops, \nhelped the United Nations to win the Nobel Peace \nprize.  \n In view of its cumulative experience and field \nexpertise, the Kingdom of Morocco believes that it is \nhigh time to examine ways and means of reinforcing \nthe legal basis and organizational framework of \npeacekeeping operations, while taking into \nconsideration the changes undergone by this United \nNations mechanism, as well as the need for \nimprovement of the deployment conditions and work \narrangements of its personnel.  \n Accordingly, the Kingdom of Morocco proposes \nthe organization next year of a high-level meeting to \nexamine this issue in all its aspects, with a view to \nadopting recommendations for the development of new \nnorms and work arrangements that will ensure the \nsuccess of peacekeeping operations.  \n Despite its efforts, Africa still faces major \nsecurity challenges and significant difficulties in \nimproving the health and living conditions of its \ncitizens. Given its deep-rooted African identity and its \nprofound historical, human and cultural ties with \nAfrican States, the Kingdom of Morocco has, as \ndirected by His Majesty the King, made its relations \nwith the continent one of the priorities of its foreign \npolicy. These relations are based on the principles of \nmutual respect, active solidarity, fruitful cooperation \nand constructive involvement in the regional initiatives \nand international strategies related to the continent. \n Besides participating in development \nprogrammes aimed at effectively revitalizing South-\nSouth cooperation and undertaking numerous solidarity \nactivities with African States victims of natural \ndisasters, the Kingdom of Morocco hosted the first \nAfrican Conference on Human Development, held in \nApril 2007 in Rabat in cooperation with the United \nNations Development Programme. The Conference \ncreated an opportunity to establish a complementary \nstrategy to meet the particular needs of Africa in the \ncontext of achieving the Millennium Development \nGoals. \n In this regard, the Rabat Declaration on human \ndevelopment and the plan of action and \nrecommendations of the Conference, constitute a \nframework of reference for the holding next year of a \nhigh-level meeting on Africa and development, as \nproposed by Morocco. Likewise, the conclusions of the \nRabat Conference could contribute significantly to the \nwork of the World Millennium Development Goals \nsummit to be held next year in response to a proposal \nmade by the United Kingdom Prime Minister.  \n Morocco expresses the hope that the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s next report on the causes of conflicts and the \npromotion of peace and sustainable development in \nAfrica will contain practical recommendations and a \nclear political vision aimed at the reinforcement of \nstability, peace and security on the African continent, \nthe consolidation of democracy and human rights, \nrespect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of \nAfrican States, and the peaceful settlement of disputes \nin accordance with the principle of good \nneighbourliness. \n The Moroccan Sahara issue, one of the longest \nregional disputes in Africa, is at a historical turning \npoint as a result of the launching of the Manhassett \nnegotiations between the parties to the dispute, held \nunder United Nations auspices. This turning point \nresults from the dynamic created by the Moroccan \nautonomy plan for Moroccan Shara, a plan which has \nopened promising perspectives for overcoming the \nstalemate on this issue at the United Nations. It offers \nthe fundamental elements necessary for a realistic, \napplicable, definitive and final political solution to a \nregional dispute that has hindered the development of a \nstrong and homogeneous Maghreb that interacts with \nits geopolitical and geostrategic environment. \n The Moroccan autonomy plan, which since 2004 \nhas answered the calls by the Security Council for the \nneed to find a political solution to that dispute, is in \nconformity with the provisions of international law. It \nis the result of wide-ranging international consultations \nand in-depth deliberations involving inhabitants of the \nregion through the Royal Advisory Council for Saharan \nAffairs. \n In the light of that positive dynamic, the Security \nCouncil adopted resolution 1754 (2007), which \nrepresented a departure from former approaches in the \ntreatment of the issue, since it called for negotiations \nwhile taking into account recent developments, in \nparticular the Moroccan plan and the efforts of the \nKingdom which the Security Council has recognized as \nserious and credible. \n The Kingdom of Morocco, which took part in \nthose negotiations in good faith and with an open and \nconstructive attitude, reiterates its commitment to \nadvance the process in order to reach a final solution to \nthe dispute within the framework of its national \nsovereignty and territorial integrity as well as on the \nbasis of the autonomy plan, as the ultimate objective of \nthe negotiation process and as an open, flexible and \nindivisible offer. The solution to this regional dispute \nin the light of the Moroccan plan would lead to the \ncreation of a stable regional security order, based on \ncooperation between the States of the region, which \nwould deal with the serious security challenges of the \nregion, including terrorism, human trafficking and \nother clandestine activities. The impact of such \nactivities will go beyond the region and will affect \nEuropean, Mediterranean and West African countries \nas well. \n The difficult circumstances in the Middle East \nrequire strengthened coordinated efforts in order to put \nan end to a lengthy and bitter conflict that has caused \ngreat suffering for the people of the region for more \nthan half a century. \n The Kingdom of Morocco, which follows closely \nall those developments, affirms once again from this \nrostrum the pressing need to reactivate the peace \nprocess in the Middle East according to a \ncomprehensive approach and on the basis of \nagreements signed by the parties, the Road Map and \nthe Arab Peace Initiative. That is a strategic choice and \nreflects the sincere will of the Arab States to search for \na just and lasting peace in the Middle East   a peace \nthat guarantees the national rights of the Palestinian \npeople, including the right to establish an independent \nState, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital, and \nwithdrawal from occupied Arab territories in Syria and \nLebanon, in order to allow the States and peoples of \nthe region to live in peace and security. \n Morocco is optimistic about the positive results \nthat will ensure from the international conference on \nMiddle East peace to be held in the United States \nbefore the end of this year. Moreover, the Kingdom of \nMorocco, which chairs the Al-Quds Committee in the \nperson of His Majesty King Mohammed VI, insists \nonce more on the need to respect the special status of \nJerusalem and to preserve its cultural and spiritual \nidentity. In that respect, His Majesty King Mohammed \nVI has endeavoured to draw the attention of the United \nNations and influential actors to the illegal, invalid \narchaeological excavations around the Al-Aqsa \nMosque and to obtain their good offices so as to put an \nend to them. \n The Kingdom of Morocco follows with great \nconcern the difficult situation in the brotherly country \nof Iraq and calls upon the various sects and factions to \nallow the virtues of wisdom and clear-sightedness to \nprevail, through serious dialogue and national \nreconciliation with the aim of preserving the \nsovereignty and territorial integrity of Iraq and in order \nto put an end to the cycle of violence threatening its \nstability, security and its unity. \n Finally, I wish to recall that the world is \nundergoing considerable changes and is confronted \nwith numerous serious and global challenges, such as \nclimate change, which is the main topic of this annual \nsession. All these challenges call for multilateral \ninstitutions that are able to establish effective \nmultilateral cooperation and coordination among States \nto promote coherence and synergy among the various \nnational and regional initiatives. Hence the crucial \nimportance of a stronger United Nations that enjoys the \nconfidence and commitment of its Member States and \ntheir support in order to make a success of its reform \nprogramme. The Organization also needs to strengthen \nits credibility in order to harmonize its agenda with our \ncrucial priorities and with the need to ensure a better \nfuture for humanity within the framework of more \nbalanced, interdependent and tolerant international \nrelations. \n"

        "file_text": "It is an \nhonour for me to speak before this Assembly. The \nUnited Nations is the very embodiment of the \ncommitment we have all made to contribute to peace \nand security and to create better living conditions in a \ngreater climate of freedom. For its part, the \nGovernment I represent has never ceased strengthening \nits actions in the international arena. The Canadian \nGovernment is a responsible partner and a fully \nengaged Power. We are guided by unwavering \nprinciples. Canada\u2019s commitment is not only linked to \nour interests, but above all to the values that inspire \nCanadians, which are freedom, the rule of law, \ndemocracy and human rights. They are the values \nunderlying our presence in Afghanistan, in Haiti, in the \nSudan and elsewhere in the world.  \nAnd they are the values and aspirations that are \nembodied in the Preamble to the Universal Declaration \nof Human Rights: the inherent dignity and the rights of \nall members of the human family are the foundation of \nfreedom, justice and peace. Article 1 of the Declaration \nsays further \u201cAll human beings are born free and equal \nin dignity and rights\u201d.  \n Those are not abstract concepts. They are real and \nconcrete concepts with effects both immediate and \nprofound. Promoting them is not enough. They must be \nprotected and defended, particularly when they are \nunder assault   in Burma, in Afghanistan, in the \nSudan, in Iran and elsewhere. \n In Kabul, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has \nconfirmed the desire of the United Nations to stabilize \nAfghanistan. Canada has engaged its political \ncommitment and practical capabilities to rebuild \nsecurity, democracy, human rights and prosperity in \nthat country.  \n Canada believes that a united international \ncommunity must support efforts to rebuild Afghanistan. \nInternational organizations, including the United \nNations, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the \nWorld Bank, must work towards that common goal. No \none country can do that alone. To fully implement \nSecurity Council decisions, we must work in close \npartnership, both with the Government of Afghanistan \nand with our friends and allies. \n To ensure a successful commitment, Canada \ndeploys the necessary resources, as with our mission in \nAfghanistan. Under the terms of a clear United Nations \nmandate, Canada joined the coalition of the \nInternational Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan. \nMore than 60 countries and international organizations \nhave undertaken with us to help the democratically \nelected Afghan Government rebuild its country. \n Canada believes that the efforts of the countries \nand organizations working in Afghanistan are \ncommendable and also reflect the core principles \nespoused by the United Nations. The challenge is great, \nbut the principles we are defending are greater still. \n The countries assisting Afghanistan are united by \na single conviction: there can be no reconstruction \nwithout security. Democracy and political stability \ncannot flourish in a climate of terror. Health care and \neducation cannot be provided where anarchy prevails. \nEconomic development is impossible when chaos is all \naround. Security is the crucial foundation on which \neverything depends, but long-term security requires \nsustainable investment in the country\u2019s development; \none goes hand in hand with the other. \n Thanks to the assistance of Canada and the \ninternational community, Afghanistan has made \nprogress. Afghan police officers are currently being \ntrained, Afghan refugees are returning home and \nAfghan children are learning to read and write. Canada \nis having a real and direct impact on the lives of the \nAfghan people and is contributing to the achievement \nof the vision of the future expressed in the Afghanistan \nCompact which was signed in 2006. In order to make \nthat vision a reality, it is crucial that the United Nations \nand the Government of Afghanistan ensure the \nfulfilment of the Compact. And yes, despite the \nincidents of intimidation and violence, the situation of \nthe Afghan people is improving.  \n Last year, Prime Minister Harper emphasized \nhere that the United Nations Assistance Mission in \nAfghanistan was the most important special political \nmission of the United Nations. The Canadian \nGovernment continues to support the leadership role of \nthe United Nations in Afghanistan. For that reason, \nCanada supports having a new high-level United \nNations special envoy for Afghanistan. \n In the past year, our Government has \ndemonstrated its multifaceted commitment to that \nmission. We have increased our development spending, \nour diplomatic presence and our military engagement. \nWe welcome Security Council resolution 1776 (2007). \nIt extends the authorization of the International \nSecurity Assistance Force in Afghanistan and calls on \nMember States to contribute personnel, equipment and \nfunding. The Canadian Government encourages \nmembers of the Assembly to actively support that \nresolution and its implementation. \n There are other challenges we must also meet. In \nHaiti, the Canadian Government has asked the Security \nCouncil to extend the mandate of the United Nations \nStabilization Mission in Haiti. That represents \nCanada\u2019s most substantial development programme \nand its largest stabilization mission in the Americas. \n In Burma, it is imperative to restore democracy \nand human rights. We expect the United Nations to be \nat the forefront of those efforts. Although we have \ndisagreed on occasion with the decisions and processes \nof the United Nations Human Rights Council, the \nconvening of a special session of the Human Rights \nCouncil on Burma is an example of the sort of activism \nand engagement that Canada expects of that body, \nespecially in dealing with countries that perpetuate \nhuman rights violations. \n In the Sudan, innovative peacekeeping missions \nare creating a security framework which will become \nthe foundation upon which a durable peace can be \nbuilt. The international community must demonstrate \nthe political will to find new solutions. Those solutions \nmust be aimed not only at immediately ending the \nhorrific violations of human rights occurring daily in \nDarfur, but also at addressing the issues of freedom and \ndemocracy that must form the foundation for a durable \npeace. Canada\u2019s substantial contribution to the Sudan \ncontinues in the form of humanitarian assistance and \nequipment. Of course, we condemn the intolerable \nattack against soldiers of the African Union force. \n The scope of the challenges we must overcome to \nmaintain our security is such that no country can hope \nto tackle them alone. We, the Member States, can and \nmust show the determination and political will so that \nthe United Nations may truly reflect the principles that \nits founders wanted it to embody. \n Canada is and will remain a committed partner \nfor all those who seek to work for freedom, to work for \ndemocracy and to work for human rights and the rule \nof law. \n"

        "file_text": "I bring warm greetings of \n\u201ciakwe\u201d from the people of the Republic of the \nMarshall Islands, on whose behalf I have the honour to \naddress the General Assembly at its sixty-second \nsession. \n I wish to convey our congratulations to you, \nMr. President, on your election in the presidency of the \nAssembly at this session. I am confident that, under \nyour able leadership, consensus on crucial issues will \nbe achieved, benefiting the entire membership, \nparticularly the often-forgotten remote small island \nStates of the Pacific. My commendation also goes to \nyour predecessor for her successful stewardship of the \nwork of the Assembly at its sixty-first session. \n Allow me to also congratulate you, \nMr. Secretary-General, for your election as the eighth \nSecretary-General of this Organization. Steering the \nUnited Nations in today\u2019s interwoven world of \ncomplex trials and tribulations remains ever more \nchallenging, and I wish to express my country\u2019s \nconfidence in your stewardship and to commend you \nfor your current efforts in taking a range of measures to \nstrengthen the capacity of the United Nations. \n For the past 62 years, we have come to this \nAssembly to express various issues and concerns dear \nto our heart, as they affect the daily lives of our \ncitizens. Education, health and the environment are \namong the issues at the top of my country\u2019s priorities, \nbut these issues are nothing if we, the community of \nnations, fail to attempt to avert the forthcoming \necological disaster.  \n My people are concerned with   or rather \nterrified by   with the issue of our very survival. Will \nwe even exist 50 years from today? If we are to exist at \nall, we must put a stop to the rising tide of destruction \nunleashed by global warming. Our future   or \nperhaps, our absence of future   depends on the \ndecisive actions of this Assembly. I find no pride in \nhaving coined the term \u201cecological refugee\u201d. It is my \ndeepest hope that no one, and certainly no one in the \nMarshall Islands, will have to bear that name. \n Since my election more than seven years ago, \neducating the world about the threat my people face as \na result of sea-level rise and global warming has been \none of my Government\u2019s priorities. In addressing the \nissue of climate change, actions and real progress are \nneeded. In saying this, I am proud to announce the new \nalliance that my Government established earlier this \nyear with the local government of Martin Luther King \nJr. County, in Washington State in the United States, \naimed at confronting the threat posed by global \nwarming. \n The unwavering faith I have in this Organization \nis the reason why I am standing at this podium today \non behalf of my people. On our shoulders, as leaders, \nlies the responsibility entrusted to us, to keep not only \nthe peace to live in harmony and with dignity, but to \npreserve our environment to ensure the very survival of \nour children for generations to come. \n I commend the Secretary-General for convening a \nhigh-level meeting on climate change this week. I am \nalso hopeful that we, as leaders, will come up with the \nnecessary agreements on the United Nations \nFramework Convention on Climate Change in \nDecember. While we are committed to playing our part, \nstrong leadership is required by the major \nindustrialized countries. We once again renew our \nsupport for the Framework Convention and the Kyoto \nProtocol, and we call upon all States that have not yet \ndone so   in particular the major emitters   to ratify \nthe Protocol without further delay. We also call upon \nthe international community to assist small island \ndeveloping States in developing and implementing \ncomprehensive adaptation strategies. \n I remain hopeful that the international community \ncan reach a consensus on moving forward the \nnecessary agreements to achieve lasting peace, security \nand diplomatic solutions to the seemingly endless web \nof issues. We are so integrated and interconnected \ntoday that we all face equal challenges, be it in \nterrorism or the proliferation of nuclear weapons. I \ncommend this Assembly for adopting last September \nthe historic United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism \nStrategy, which will prevent the global scourge of \nterrorism. The Marshall Islands remains committed in \nthe fight against terrorism, and we continue to take \naction at the national level and to cooperate at the \nregional and international levels to ensure that we \ncombat terrorist threats with comprehensive and united \naction. \n In the area of disarmament and non-proliferation, \nour collective efforts need to be invigorated to \novercome stalemate. Nuclear weapons and the testing \nconducted on our islands in the past is a nightmare that \ncontinues to haunt my people. The 67 atmospheric \nweapons detonated on my island of Bikini Atoll from \n1946 to 1958 continue to inflict pain and suffering on \nmy people to this day. The Marshallese people were \nunder the care of the United Nations Trusteeship \nCouncil when the United States nuclear testing \nprogramme was in progress. Once again, I call on the \nUnited Nations and its agencies and Member States \nwho share similar experiences and have the expertise to \nassist us with the restoration of our radiation-\ncontaminated environment to provide the needed \nassistance for my people\u2019s health-care needs that are \nlinked to radiation exposure, and to support the \nMarshall Islands\u2019 Changed Circumstances Petition, \nwhich was submitted to the United States Congress in \n2000. \n I commend the work of the Assembly at its sixty-\nfirst session in adopting resolution 61/109, which \nrequests the United Nations Scientific Committee on \nthe Effects of Atomic Radiation to continue its work, \nincluding its activities to increase knowledge about the \nlevels, effects and risks of ionizing radiation from all \nsources, and requests the United Nations Environment \nProgramme to continue to provide support for the work \nof the Committee and for the dissemination of its \nfindings and to review and strengthen the Committee\u2019s \npresent funding. I am confident that my people will \nbenefit from the Committee\u2019s work, noting that \nprevious policy and resettlement decisions based on \nmisleading scientific opinions have caused so much \nsuffering among my people. \n My people\u2019s survival and well-being also depend \non our ocean resources. We are encouraged by \ninternational and regional agreements and treaties that \naim to protect these scarce resources. However, illegal, \nunreported and unregulated fishing continues to \nthreaten our major source of livelihood. In protecting \nour ocean resources from exploitation, we continue to \nseek assistance from Member States with the expertise \nand capacity in conducting and enforcing conservation \nand management measures, as well as in the \ndevelopment of our domestic fisheries. I reiterate once \nagain my support for a moratorium on bottom-trawling \nuntil there are clear indications on its negative effects \non the ocean biodiversity.  \n The Micronesia Challenge   a commitment led \nby the Republic of Palau, the Federated States of \nMicronesia and the Republic of the Marshall Islands   \naims at conserving that biodiversity and our vulnerable \necosystem by effectively conserving at least 30 per \ncent of the near-shore marine and 20 per cent of the \nforest resources across Micronesia by 2020. The \nMicronesia Challenge is part of a much larger and \ngrowing commitment by island nations throughout the \nworld to take the international lead in preserving \nprimary ecosystems. I call on the international \ncommunity to support the efforts that have been put in \nplace and to develop and provide the resources for \nrealistic financial plans in support of conservation and \nsustainable use of our natural resources. \n Within the Pacific region, we continue to \ncooperate closely to ensure that effective regional \nactions are taken in our endeavour to combat our \nvulnerabilities in the economic, social and \nenvironmental areas, which are priority areas \nhighlighted under the Pacific Plan and Kalibobo \nRoadmap, endorsed by Pacific leaders almost two \nyears ago.  \n My Government has had the pleasure of hosting \nand actively engaging in several regional meetings held \nto that effect. The Eighth Pacific Islands Conference of \nLeaders, which I was honoured to chair in Washington; \nthe Seventh Annual Micronesian President\u2019s Summit, \nheld in Chuuk, Federated States of Micronesia, earlier \nthis month; the seventh Food and Agriculture \nOrganization meeting of the South West Pacific \nMinisters for Agriculture, held in May; and the \nMicronesians in Island Conservation conference, held \nlast June in Majuro   all these provided the \nopportunity for our leaders, development partners and \nnon-governmental partners to meet with other leaders \nfrom the region to address the wide range of issues and \nchallenges that continue to plague the Pacific. \n In my view, the successful implementation of \nregional commitments international obligations can be \nachieved only with the support and commitment of \nmember countries, regional and international \norganizations, development partners and a range of \nstakeholders. \n In that regard, I wish to emphasize that the \nassistance of the international community, which has \nplayed a crucial role in enabling us to meet current and \nemerging challenges, is still very much needed. There \nis only so much that we can do as small island \ndeveloping States; thus, now more than ever, I continue \nto call on the international community for considerable \ninvestments and comprehensive assistance, including \nthe much-needed policy reorientation to address the \ninterlinked issues of economic, social and \nenvironmental security. \n The Republic of the Marshall Islands was \nfounded on the ideals of freedom, democracy and \nrespect for human rights. We continue to observe and \nstand for those democratic values and the defence and \npromotion of human rights. The United Nation\u2019s noble \nideals of good governance, democracy, multilateralism \nand respect for human dignity also serve as my guiding \nlight in my capacity of high steward of my people. \n However, while the United Nations continues to \nwork with States in resolving disputes peacefully and \nin helping to create democratic societies, it still turns a \nblind eye to the 23 million people of Taiwan and \nsilences their voices. The absence of Taiwan in the \nUnited Nations creates a gap in the global network for \ncooperation, goes against the ideals and concept of \njustice upheld by the United Nations and contravenes \nthe principle of universality. \n We reiterate our support for the reform and \nexpansion of the Security Council and for a criteria-\nbased approach under which potential members, such \nas Japan, must be well qualified, based on factors such \nas economic size, population, commitment to \ndemocracy and human rights, financial contributions to \nthe United Nations and contributions to United Nations \npeacekeeping efforts. \n During the general debate of the sixtieth session, \nwe noted in this historic Hall that the United Nations \nand its offices and agencies did not have a permanent \npresence in many of the small island developing States \nof the Pacific. In June 2006, it was announced that a \ncoalition of the United Nations Development \nProgramme (UNDP), United Nations Children\u2019s Fund \n(UNICEF) and United Nations Population Fund \n(UNFPA) would open a total of eight new offices in the \nPacific island countries. We welcomed that historic \naccomplishment, the progress it marked towards \nharmonization within the United Nations and the \nassistance and support the new offices would provide \nin developing national capacity and meeting the \nMillennium Development Goals. \n We, Member States that pay our dues, deploy \npeacekeepers, and discharge our responsibilities in the \ninternational community, deserve offices that give \nrelevance to the United Nations and the \nimplementation of its doctrines. The Marshall Islands \nis appreciative of the work currently under way for the \nestablishment of a joint presence in our country by \nUNFPA, which will be the leading agency on behalf of \nUNDP and UNICEF. We, however, ask the General \nAssembly and the Secretariat to ensure that offices \nbefitting the ideals and reputation of the United \nNations are established in the other identified Pacific \nisland countries. \n In closing, I wish to reassure you, Mr. President, \nthat the Marshall Islands remains committed to the \nimplementation of the commitments made over the last \ndecade, and we expect our partners to fulfil their \ncommitments as well. The sustainable development of \nsmall island developing States, such as the Marshall \nIslands, can only be achieved through a genuine \npartnership within the international community. Only \nthen can we realize the commonly shared goal of \nuniversal peace and prosperity. \n My delegation looks forward to a productive \nsession under your able leadership, Sir. Komol tata, \nand God bless. \n"

        "file_text": "Allow me to congratulate you, \nSir, on your election as President of the General \nAssembly at its sixty-second session. I also welcome \nthe highly respected Secretary-General to the first \nsession of the Assembly convened since he assumed \nhis post. \n I would like to start by saying that my country is \nproud to be one of the founding fathers of the United \nNations in its current form. The Czech Republic, a \nsuccessor State of Czechoslovakia, participated \nactively in all kinds of United Nations activities in the \npast and it will continue to do so in the future. We take \npart in the work not only of the United Nations itself, \nbut also of its specialized organizations and agencies \nsuch as UNESCO, the United Nations Development \nProgramme, the Food and Agriculture Organization of \nthe United Nations, the World Health Organization, the \nInternational Atomic Energy Agency and many others. \nWe have always supported any meaningful initiative \nthat leads to the increase of stability and prosperity in \nthe world. \n I am proud to confirm that the Czech Republic \nhas the ambition to be elected to the Security Council \nas a non-permanent member for the period 2008-2009. \nI believe that we can be trusted by the majority of \nMember countries and that we deserve their votes. We \nare convinced that we have already demonstrated our \ndevotion to freedom, democracy, international \ncooperation, economic development and respect for the \nsovereignty of countries belonging to the community \nof nations. My country served in the Security Council \nin 1994-1995. We tried to do our best. We were reliable \nand committed to hard work. I can assure the Assembly \nthat we will now do an even a better job. \n We have always recognized the principal \nresponsibility of the Security Council for maintaining \npeace and security. Since the 1990s, the Czech \nRepublic has contributed to more than 20 United \nNations peacekeeping missions and United Nations-\nmandated operations in the Balkans, Asia and Africa. \nWe deeply believe in the prevention and non-violent \nresolution of disputes and conflicts. That can be proved \nby our own behaviour; witness the peaceful dissolution \nof Czechoslovakia in 1992. Over the past several years, \nwe have also multiplied our official development \nassistance. \n In the past 18 years, the Czech Republic has \nundergone radical and dynamic development, which \nwas made possible by the fall of communism and by \nour rapid departure from that oppressive, inhuman and \ninefficient political, social and economic system. Our \ntransformation strategy, based on the acceptance of \npolitical pluralism, parliamentary democracy and a \nmarket economy, was successful. \n A further important impetus to our development \nwas our approaching the European Union and our entry \ninto it three years ago. Today, the Czech Republic is a \nfull-fledged member of the Union and will hold the \nEuropean Union presidency in the first half of 2009. It \nmight be of interest to the Assembly that the slogan of \nthe Czech presidency will be Europe without \nbarriers. We mean by that the removing of both \ninternal and external European Union barriers. I fully \nsupport that concept, as I strongly believe in the need \nto remove barriers that hinder economic progress, \nespecially in developing countries. \n We consider the United Nations to be an \nextremely important and, in fact, irreplaceable \nplatform. There is no substitute for it in the current \nworld. It is a platform for meetings and consultations, \nfor dialogue and, eventually, for reaching agreements \non treaties among nations sharing the same or similar \nvalues and political stances. This unique platform is \nbased on the plurality of views of its 192 Member \ncountries and on our mutual respect for our sometimes \ndiffering positions. The ambition of the United Nations \nis not, and should never be, the search for one \nobligatory, unitary view imposed by some of us on \nthose who disagree. \n I did not use the term \u201cplatform\u201d by chance and \nwithout purpose. By using it, I implicitly object to the \nalternative concept: the concept of global governance \nbased on the indefensible idea that the world can be \nglobally governed, masterminded, controlled, managed \nand/or even planned. To aspire to do that is something \nwe can never accept. It is an ambition based on the \nabuse of reason and on the pretence of knowledge. \nDemocracy is something else. \n There are some among us who prefer the \noperational efficiency - or the ability to act - of this \nOrganization to the recognition of the existence of \ndifferent views. They want to make decisions in an \neasier and faster way. Our communist past tells us that \nwe should not do that. We also want the United Nations \nto be reasonably operational, but we categorically \noppose that happening at the expense of individual \nMember States. We have to respect the views of \nindividual member countries regardless of their size. It \nis crucial that every Member State has equal status and \nthat its voice not be ignored. \n We have to go forward. The United Nations needs \nchanges. We do support reform of the United Nations, \nbecause the Organization should reflect the current \nsituation in the world more than the situation of the era \nwhen it was founded. Some changes are inevitable, and \nwe should discuss them seriously. \n To our great regret, in the world at present we are \nwitnessing many cases where there is a lack of freedom \nand democracy. Our task for the future is to minimize \nsuch cases. However, I do not see and hear the terms \n\\\"freedom\\\" and \\\"democracy\\\" as much or as often as \nthey deserve. We hear other words more frequently: \naid, government initiatives and interventions, social \njustice, positive rights, environment, resources, \nclimate, problem solving, facing threats and global \nchallenges among others. \n Here we have to be very careful. We should \nsupport meaningful activities, not programmes that in \neffect put constraints on local development. We should \nuse natural resources efficiently and protect the \nenvironment, but not in a way that restricts human \nactivity and harms economic development. We would \nhelp global development more by reducing barriers \nthan by providing conditional aid. Reducing \nprotectionism and lowering export subsidies is a far \nmore efficient way to help developing countries than \nanything else. We should not allow developing \ncountries to be blocked from their own economic \ngrowth by additional burdens imposed upon them that \nthey will not be able to bear. \n At the conference on climate change held the day \nbefore yesterday, I resolutely warned against the \nunjustified alarmism of global-warming activists and \ntheir fellow-travellers in some Governments and \ninternational organizations, but even that potential \nproblem, as well as any other, can never be solved \nwithout relying on freedom, free markets, free trade \nand other attributes of free society. \n Preserving the environment is very important, but \nwe have to be modest in our attempts to control the \ncomplexities of the world. Let us use the potential of \nthis Organization as much as possible. Let us \ncooperate, let us listen to each other, let us negotiate to \nthe last possible moment and let us try to understand \nothers. The Czech Republic tries to follow those rules. \n"

        "file_text": "Allow me at \nthe outset to congratulate Mr. Kerim on his assumption \nof the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-\nsecond session. There is no doubt that his deep \nfamiliarity with the academic world, tied to his \nexperience in the political world and in business, is a \nmajor asset that will help him to lead us confidently in \nthe Assembly\u2019s work. I sincerely hope that our debates \nwill be fruitful and lead to the adoption of relevant \nresolutions. \n Allow me also to welcome our new Secretary-\nGeneral, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, who recently honoured us \nwith his first visit to Haiti in August. We are firmly \nconvinced that the new Secretary-General will rapidly \nbring to bear his experience of the United Nations \nsystem, his vast learning and his broad open-\nmindedness in carrying out the reforms that most \nMembers of our Organization know to be necessary. \n Despite its difficulties, our Organization remains \nthe principal forum offering all States, large and small, \nthe same space for dialogue to address the fundamental \nissues surrounding our coexistence and future on this \nplanet. May the Secretary-General be assured of the \nsupport of the Haitians in his efforts to increase the \neffectiveness of the United Nations and to enable it to \nachieve its full potential. \n I am speaking here on behalf of a people that has \nendured great suffering over the past 200 years: \nmaterial deprivation of all sorts, vulnerability to \nnatural threats and disasters, poor access to health care \nand education, the deaths of hundreds of thousands of \nchildren from malnutrition, and a very young \npopulation   65 per cent below the age of 25   \ndenied any true opportunity for employment. \n I speak on behalf of a people that seems to be \ndepopulating itself as its most competent professionals \nforsake a life of difficulties to the benefit of other \ncountries or businesses, and as its children, women and \nsenior citizens, weary of living what seems to be a \nhopeless existence, take to the open seas on makeshift \nboats, seeking a better life under other skies. \n I speak on behalf of a State whose neighbours, \nincluding the most powerful among them, sometimes \nportray it as a threat to regional security because Haiti \nappears too frequently on the agenda of the General \nAssembly or the Security Council, with a burdensome \narray of problems of insecurity or political unrest. \n I speak on behalf of a country that analyses \nsomewhat prematurely describe as a failed State \nbecause it has trouble making its institutions \noperational and organizing a way of life appropriate to \nthe majority of its citizens, and because the State itself, \nunfortunately, often finds itself waging an endless war \nagainst its own children. \n Haiti is on the way to bidding farewell to that \nState   slowly, patiently, yet resolutely. The organized \narmed gangs responsible for violence against innocent \npeople have been dismantled and there is no longer any \nforbidden zone for peaceful citizens anywhere on our \nterritory. \n The management of our economy has improved \nconsiderably. We have stopped printing money. That \nhas reduced the inflation rate   which had run \nrampant for several years and which just a few months \nago reached 40 per cent   to less than 10 per cent. Our \ngross domestic product has seen moderate but \nsustained growth, after having been negative for more \nthan 10 years.  \n We have worked patiently to establish an \natmosphere of calm and collegiality within the political \nclass, which is a condition essential for enabling the \npolitical forces to put an end to their perpetual \nfactional disputes and to mobilize around genuine \nnational reconstruction plans.  \n The Security Council will soon extend the \nmandate of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in \nHaiti (MINUSTAH) for another year. Such an \nextension would be most appropriate. This reminds us \nthat our victory over insecurity, the holding of \ndemocratic elections, the improvement of governance \nin the country and the strengthening of our judicial \nsystem were possible thanks in large part to the efforts \nof United Nations forces within the framework of the \nOrganization\u2019s peacekeeping programme. Certainly, the \nmembers of our national police, although young, \ninexperienced and underequipped, have proved to be \ncourageous and determined in the fight against \ninsecurity, but MINUSTAH\u2019s support at their side has \nbeen greatly appreciated. Let me take this opportunity \nto express once again our thanks to the Organization, \nto the Security Council and to the friendly countries \nthat mobilized their own resources and citizens to \ncome to the assistance of Haitians at this difficult time \nin their history. \n Haitians, recalling that they belong to a people \nwho fought for their freedom and carried the torch of \nliberty to many other shores of the continent, continue \nto see the presence of foreign armed forces on their soil \nas a wound to their national sovereignty. Practically \nspeaking, however, that is the only realistic formula \ncurrently available that is enabling Haitians to regain \nfreedom and live in peace. \n It is now up to Haitians to benefit from this \nperiod of calm by pulling themselves together, \nreconsidering their fate with a positive vision of the \nfuture and returning to daily life as a disciplined, \nhardworking and law-abiding people while our State \nstrengthens its internal cohesion, modernizes its \njudicial system and improves its governance and its \ncapacity to intervene, so that it can create and maintain \nan environment conducive to economic recovery and \ngenuine sustainable development. \n The adoption of the Millennium Development \nGoals (MDGs) was an act of awareness. Nevertheless, \nhalfway towards the deadline set for achievement of \nthe Goals, it seems clear that many of us   including \nmy country   will not meet the 2015 targets, despite \nthe considerable progress made in various areas. \nMobilizing resources to support the pursuit of the \nMDGs is a difficult but essential task. It is not only \nnecessary for ethical reasons or because the \ninternational community must honour its commitments. \nProblems that cannot be resolved in a poor State will \nspill over to richer States, which will thus be forced to \nrevisit problems that they had already overcome by \nthemselves at the national level. \n The General Assembly has included in the agenda \nfor the present session an item relating to cooperation \nin combating the activities of transnational organized \ncrime. In that connection, I should like to highlight my \ncountry\u2019s efforts to fight against corruption and illicit \ndrug trafficking. In Haiti, we are currently developing \nways to deal with corruption. We have begun to work \nto strengthen State structures and to plan legal and \nregulatory reforms to be established to ensure that that \nendemic evil disappears from our institutional \npractices, both in politics and in business.  \n But the fight against drug trafficking is of another \nscale entirely, because it sets us squarely against \nsophisticated and well-organized adversaries who have \naccess to powerful international networks in both drug-\nproducing and drug-consuming countries. We are \nsensitive to the human suffering and social upheaval \nattributable to drug abuse, and we are aware of the \nefforts being made to treat and rehabilitate addicts, \nprimarily in the major drug-consuming countries. \nHowever, trafficking also has harmful effects on the \neconomic, social and political structures of small States \nsuch as mine and poses a serious threat to their \nsovereignty and security, even if they are only transit \nStates. The approach that has emerged from various \ninternational conferences focuses on prevention and \ndemand-reduction in consumer countries first and then \nto reduce supply in producing countries and suppress \ntrafficking networks. \n Haiti and the Dominican Republic are on the \ntrade route of one of the most intense flows between \nthe producer countries of South America and the \nconsumer countries of North America. We are firmly \ncommitted to helping the countries of the North \neliminate the drugs that arrive in their countries by way \nof our territory as a place of transit. But we cannot deal \nwith this scourge alone, and our efforts to improve the \nmonitoring of our land, sea and air borders and \nstrengthen our institutions come up against the power \nof the networks put in place by the traffickers. \n The solutions developed to deal with these \nproblems will clearly yield no results if we do not \nurgently address the issue of economic development, \nbecause, as has been eloquently stated in reports of the \nSecretary-General, development is another name for \npeace. \n It follows from that observation that we need a \nnew culture of international solidarity based on a \ncomprehensive and coordinated approach in which the \nfight against poverty goes hand in hand with \nsustainable development. It is an approach in which \ndevelopment assistance and the fight against insecurity \nare supported by the efforts of more developed \ncountries to open up their markets, to encourage flows \nof foreign direct investment and technology transfers \nand to support the private sector and entrepreneurial \ninitiatives: a comprehensive approach in which rich \nand poor understand that they are co-owners of this \nplanet and that its fate is in all our hands.\n"

        "file_text": "I am pleased to extend my warmest \ncongratulations to you, Sir, on your election as \nPresident of the General Assembly at its sixty-second \nsession. We have every confidence in your efforts to \nstrengthen peace within a global system characterized \nby justice, balance and stability. \n I would also like to congratulate your \npredecessor, Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa, on her \nsuccessful efforts to advance debate and dialogue on \nthe main concerns and problems of our day. \n I also wish to congratulate and thank Secretary-\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon, who, from the day he took \noffice, began to promote the reform of the \nOrganization, in addition to addressing international \npeace and security issues. \n Allow me, in particular, to welcome the fact that \nthe General Assembly at its sixty-first session focused \non development issues, together with the fight against \npoverty, the adverse effects of climate change, \neconomic globalization, promoting dialogue and \nunderstanding between civilizations and religions, \nintroducing modern good governance systems, and the \nconsolidation of democracy. \n Achieving the Millennium Development Goals, \nwhich is an urgent priority, requires that we all \nintensify our efforts and promote cooperation and \ncoordination so as to establish conditions conducive to \nsustainable, comprehensive and balanced development. \n We believe that encouraging the spirit and values \nof understanding, dialogue and complementarity \nbetween civilizations and nations, upholding the rule of \nlaw, and expanding justice and equity are the speediest \nway to ensure peace and security in the world and \neradicate hatred and confrontation between peoples. \nThe continuation of seemingly intractable problems, \nthe widening of the gap between rich and poor, the \nexistence of structural dysfunctions in the global \neconomy, the absence of justice, and the prevalence of \ninjustice and despair are factors that perpetuate pockets \nof tension and conflict and encourage extremism and \nterrorism. \n We in Mauritania have rejected terrorism in all its \nforms and manifestations. We strongly condemn it and, \nat the same time, we continue to adhere to Islamic \nvalues in our society   which are based on tolerance \nand the rejection of violence and extremism and call \nfor understanding and brotherhood.  \n Under the Charter of the United Nations we are \ncommitted to join efforts to maintain international \npeace and security. That commitment continues to be \nundermined by conflict situations, some of which have \npersisted since the founding of the Organization. The \nArab-Israeli conflict is undeniably the one that \ngenerates the most antagonism and most threatens \ninternational peace and security. That conflict \ncontinues despite the fact that the framework setting \nout the general conditions for a just, comprehensive \nand lasting settlement of the conflict has been defined \nand reaffirmed over the years by the Security Council \nand the General Assembly. Those basic requirements \nconstitute the very essence of the Arab Peace Initiative. \nThat Initiative guarantees peace, security and the \nrecognition of the State of Israel by Arab countries in \nexchange for an end to the occupation of Arab \nterritories and an agreement to seek out mutually \nacceptable solutions for other outstanding issues. Israel \nmust seize this historic opportunity and subsequently \ncomply with international law so that the peoples of the \nregion can at last live in peace   and in particular so \nthat the Palestinian people can regain their usurped \nrights and be able to establish an independent State, \nwith Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital. \n Mauritania is of course following closely the \nissue of the Western Sahara. We are pleased with the \nrecent steps that have led to the resumption of direct \nnegotiations. We reiterate our support for the efforts of \nthe Secretary-General to find a definitive solution \nacceptable to all parties that guarantees stability in the \nregion.  \n With regard to Darfur, we are pleased about the \nagreement reached between the Government of the \nSudan, the African Union and the United Nations. We \nhope that all parties will join efforts to ensure that \npeace, understanding and accord prevail as soon as \npossible among our Sudanese brothers and sisters. \n As for the situation in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, we were \npleased to note the remarkable progress made on the \npath towards civic peace in the country. We hope that \noverall stability will prevail in that brotherly country \nand that it will once again assume its rightful place in \nthe West African subregion and in the continent as a \nwhole. \n The African Union, working with the United \nNations, is making intensive efforts to resolve the \ncrises on the African continent. However, social and \neconomic progress undoubtedly offers the best solution \nto those conflicts. Africa\u2019s share of the world economy \nhas declined in the past two decades. The continent \nnow lags behind in achieving the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals. Yet, there are real signs of \nimprovement in the situation on the continent. New \neconomic opportunities now exist, thanks in large part \nto the growing demand for emerging markets, but \nAfrica still needs further official development \nassistance and greater flows of foreign direct \ninvestment. I should like to point out that African \ncountries are of course primarily responsible for their \nown development. They must also ensure the rule of \nlaw, promote good governance and establish a \nframework conducive to direct foreign investment.  \n This year, we in Mauritania improved the \ndemocratic process by establishing a pluralistic system \nbased on a Constitution that guarantees the right of the \npeaceful transfer of power. Our country has therefore \nundergone a major democratic transformation. We have \ndone so through presidential elections conducted in an \natmosphere of transparency, honesty and open \ncompetition   as was noted by national and \ninternational observers, including the United Nations, \nthe European Union, the League of Arab States, the \nAfrican Union, the International Organization of la \nFrancophonie and the Organization of the Islamic \nConference. In the same atmosphere of freedom and \npluralism, municipal and legislative elections made it \npossible to choose the representatives of the people to \nmunicipal councils and the two houses of Parliament. \nWe paid particular attention to Mauritania\u2019s women in \nboth elections, with 20 per cent of contested seats \nreserved for them. As a result, women are now more \nrepresented than ever in the legislative and executive \nbranches, as well as in local administration, diplomacy \nand management.  \n Moreover, my Government has made sustained \nefforts to strengthen national unity and to ensure \ntransparency in the management of public affairs. \nAmong other things, those efforts have led to steps to \nsecure the dignified return of Mauritanian refugees \nresiding in Senegal and Mali, so as to usher in a new \nera of brotherhood and national reconciliation in our \ncountry.  \n In the same vein, we have enacted a law \ncriminalizing slavery. A high court of justice was also \nestablished in order, if necessary, to prosecute the \npresident of the country and senior Government \nofficials through an integral procedure that aims at \ninstitutionalizing the norms of good governance, \nmodernizing institutions and strengthening the \noversight mechanism through greater and direct \nparticipation by the representatives of the people and \nof civil society. We are more determined than ever to \npersevere along this path because we believe it is the \nbest way to strengthen national unity and achieve \ndevelopment, security, stability and prosperity for the \nnation and for our citizens.  \n Mauritania is resolutely committed to \ncontributing to relations of cooperation and solidarity \nin our region, in accordance with the ambitions and \naspirations of our people. In this framework, our faith \nin the Arab Maghreb Union as a strategic choice for the \nregion and our faith in the Arab League and the African \nUnion are unwavering, given our firm commitment to \nthe spirit of fraternity and solidarity and to relations of \ncooperation, friendship and good neighbourliness that \nlink our country to its Arab and African environment. \nAt the same time, our country remains determined to \nstrengthen the bases of dialogue, exchange and \nunderstanding between peoples and civilizations, \nnamely within the framework of the  \nEuro-Mediterranean dialogue.  \n Mauritania reiterates its commitment to the ideals \nand purposes of the United Nations, the only \nmultilateral framework at the service of humanity as a \nwhole. Faced with the multiple challenges and threats \nin today\u2019s world, it is our common duty to make the \nUnited Nations a melting pot where we can harmonize \nour efforts to implement the priorities stated in the \nMillennium Declaration and at various international \nconferences. In a globalized world marked by the \naccumulation of wealth and an unprecedented \nacceleration of technological and scientific progress, it \nis up to us to benefit equitably from the possibilities \nthat are offered to all peoples and to establish the best \nliving conditions coupled with greater freedom. We \ntook this commitment when we created the United \nNations more than 60 years ago. Today we have the \nmeans to assume our responsibilities and to uphold this \noften reiterated commitment.  \n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, at the outset I wish to \ncongratulate you, Sir, on your election to the \npresidency of this session of the General Assembly. It \nis a great pleasure for me to address the General \nAssembly for the third time in order to take stock of \nthe actions of the international community and to \nexpress commitment and share our thoughts regarding \nthe priorities on our agenda. \n When this world forum was created six decades \nago, it was an expression of will and necessity; out of \nwill came commitment and out of necessity came \nawareness. The States represented here today are more \ncommitted and are more conscious than ever of the \nneed to advance in establishing peace, combating \npoverty, protecting human rights, and furthering \ndemocracy and international law.  \n In our complex and uncertain world new and old \nchallenges, new and old conflicts exist simultaneously. \nOur cooperation has improved in quality, but poverty \ncontinues to affect a large sector of the world\u2019s \npopulation. We are moving forward in promoting and \nprotecting human rights, but gross violations persist. \nWe seek peace, prosperity and dignity for all. What \nmeasures and instruments do we have to meet these \nchallenges? How can we adapt them in order to \nrespond more effectively?  \n Today, we know that no State alone can \neffectively address the global agenda and guarantee \nhuman development in a world that is increasingly \nuncertain and interdependent   though no less \nstimulating and creative for that. The means exist at the \nuniversal, regional and bilateral levels, as well as at the \nlevel of our many interrelationships. The structures and \norganizations that the international community has \nbuilt with so much effort form a complex framework \nthat we must reform, strengthen and update. Spain \npromotes effective multilateralism inspired by values \nand principles sustained by the people. The \ninternational community recognizes the need for a \ngreater political consensus and effective cooperation, a \ntrend seen within the United Nations system as well as \nin regional structures such as the European Union \n(EU), the Iberoamerican Community of Nations, or the \nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe \n(OSCE). Spain participates in those organizations, \nwhere optimism on progress is tangible. Despite the \nsometimes slow pace of progress, there is a global \npolitical awareness of the challenges affecting \ndemography, sustainable human and economic \ndevelopment and their link to climate change. \n Peace is possible and necessary   real peace, not \njust the absence of war. We need to clear the way for \npeace and political reason in the Middle East, a region \nfraught with violence and dramatic tension, which in \nturn affects the security and confidence of the \ninternational community. We must choose the power of \nwords over that of arms, trust over mistrust, \ncommitment over fear and dialogue and effective \nconcerted action over disagreement. Spain wishes to \nhelp the parties and joins with the Quartet and its \nrepresentative in seeking a final solution. In order to do \nthis, we must establish an open dialogue without \npreconditions and draw renewed inspiration from the \nMadrid Conference. For peace to be complete, it must \ninclude Syria and Lebanon.  \n The meeting proposed by President Bush is an \nappropriate occasion to formalize everyone\u2019s \ncommitment to this desired peace. Spain unreservedly \nsupports that initiative.  \n We wish for a peaceful, viable and democratic \nPalestinian State, living in peace with Israel, and an \nIsrael that is secure and has good relations in its region. \nThe international community must support and assist \nparties in their efforts. Spain is firmly determined to \nmake its contribution effective. \n Spain\u2019s commitment in the region is also \ndemonstrated by its participation in the United Nations \nInterim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL). I truly hope that \nthe Lebanese political forces will reach a consensus \nresolution of their political crisis without interference. \nI appeal for a political agreement in the name of peace, \nin the national interest of Lebanon and in the interest \nof the region. \n The conflict in Western Sahara is one of the main \nobstacles to the integration process of the Arab \nMaghreb Union. We are actively committed to seeking \na just and final political agreement that respects the \nprinciple of self-determination within the framework of \nthe United Nations. Spain trusts that with the \nassistance of the Secretary-General\u2019s Personal Envoy \nand the support of friendly nations, all parties will \nmake progress and that the direct negotiations that \nhave already been initiated will culminate in an \nagreement. \n Constructive trust is fundamental, and that was \nbehind the dialogue forum on Gibraltar in which \nimportant agreements were reached on matters of local \ncooperation of benefit to all. Spain hopes to make \nprogress in reaching a final solution to the sovereignty \ndispute in accordance with the resolutions and \ndecisions of the United Nations.  \n We have seen uneven progress in conflicts with a \nhistory of devastation and violence. We have also seen \nprogress and change in conflicts that had been \ndeadlocked, such as those in Georgia, Nagorny \nKarabakh and Transdniestria, as well as in that relating \nto the status of Kosovo.  \n Peace is possible and necessary, and we are \nmoving towards it despite being hit by terrorism, which \nposes a serious threat to peace and security. This global \nviolence aims at undermining the stability of free and \ndemocratic societies and, as we agreed a year ago in \nthe United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy \n(resolution 60/288), we must prevail over that violence \nby coordinating our efforts and responding collectively. \nWe are pleased that, in our determination to defeat \nterrorism, victims and their families have not been \nforgotten, and that the international community \ncontinues to urge respect for them. I believe that this is \na well deserved acknowledgement and that without it \nthe strategy against global terrorism would be \nincomplete. \n Spain participates in peacekeeping operations \nauthorized and mandated by the Security Council, in \nLebanon, Afghanistan and the Balkans. Allow me, here \nin the General Assembly, to express my gratitude to the \nSpanish armed forces, the State security forces and \nothers engaged in cooperative efforts for their work \nand solidarity in favour of peace. In particular, I pay \nheartfelt tribute to those Spaniards who have lost their \nlives in this effort and to their families and friends; \nonly four days ago two Spanish soldiers died in \nAfghanistan. To assist in the logistics of peacekeeping \noperations, Spain has offered to establish a United \nNations support base in Quart de Poblet in Valencia. A \ncommunications centre will be established there for the \ndevelopment of peacekeeping operations on the \nground. \n It is possible to defeat poverty. It is an ethical and \npolitical duty, a duty that Spain is firmly determined to \nshoulder. I am pleased and proud to say that my \ncountry today is the eighth-largest contributor to the \nUnited Nations system; our goal is to devote 0.7 per \ncent of our gross domestic product to development aid \nby 2012. In only three years, backed by political and \nsocial consensus, we have reinforced cooperation and \nincreased its volume   to nearly \u20ac4.5 billion this year. \nSpain has expressed profound solidarity with and \ncommitment to the goals set forth in the alliance \nagainst hunger and poverty.  \n We want access to drinking water and sanitation \nto be a universally enjoyed right. Water will be the \ncentral theme at International Expo Zaragoza 2008. \nThat event will give participating countries and visitors \ninsights into the fundamental aspects of water in the \ntwenty-first century, such as the environment, \ninternational cooperation and prospects for scientific, \ntechnological and economic management. I encourage \nand invite members to participate in the 2008 Zaragoza \nexposition on water and sustainable development. \n Spain wishes to assist in the structural \nstrengthening of the United Nations and believes that \ninstitutional and managerial reform taking account of \nglobal civil society inputs is a priority. \n That comment, Mr. President, is intended to \nhighlight the progress made on the Security Council \nissue at the sixty-first session of the General Assembly, \nduring the mandate of your predecessor. It is essential \nfor this very sensitive aspect of reform to be resolved \nthrough a political decision adopted by consensus, and \nnot in haste.  \n We welcome the Human Rights Council as a \nforum to debate issues related to rights and freedoms. \nSpain reiterates its trust in that body and its desire to \nbecome a member next year. The protection and \npromotion of human rights is a fundamental pillar of \nSpain\u2019s foreign policy, because we are convinced that \nthe violation of these rights leads to oppression and \nviolence. We hope for the adoption at this session of a \ndraft resolution on the abolition of the death penalty or, \nat the very least, on a universal moratorium. \n The Alliance of Civilizations will mobilize the \ninternational community and global civil society to end \nthe risk of polarization caused by the prejudices, \nerroneous ideas and extremism that can disrupt \npeaceful coexistence. Mr. Jorge Sampaio, the Special \nRepresentative of the Secretary-General, has presented \nan implementation plan programme, and a trust fund \nfor voluntary contributions has been set up with the \nsupport of the Group of Friends, involving more than \n70 States and international organizations. \n This has been a good year for Spain, and we \nwould like to share it with the international community. \nOur presence abroad has increased due to the active \ninvolvement of our citizens and our institutions, \neconomic stability and business activity, all of which \nhas been conducive to greater openness to the rest of \nthe world. This is not the time to be discouraged; \nrather, it is a time for commitment and optimism. An \nobjective and rational analysis of the progress that the \ninternational community has made in recent years \nshould inspire hope and strengthen the will to work \ntowards the development of a balanced agenda that \naddresses the challenges of our times. The States \nmembers of the General Assembly are more aware than \never that only through united action in solidarity can \nwe meet these challenges effectively by using political \ndialogue, preventive diplomacy and public and \nhumanitarian diplomacy. Spain sees the situation as \npositive. In that regard I would quote the Spanish poet \nBlas de Otero: \u201cI ask for peace and I ask to speak ... in \ndefence of man and his justice\u201d. That means a \ncommitment to action, not rhetoric. \n"

        "file_text": "Allow  me at the outset, Sir, to congratulate you on your \nelection as President of the General Assembly at its \nsixty-second session. I am confident that, with your \nwisdom and experience, you will lead our work to \nsuccess. I wish you every success. I also wish to \ncommend Her Excellency Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-\nKhalifa, from the sisterly Kingdom of Bahrain, \nPresident of the General Assembly at its sixty-first \nsession, for all her constructive and concrete efforts to \nensure the success and positive results of the \nAssembly\u2019s work. \n The sixty-second session of the General \nAssembly coincides with the sixtieth anniversary of my \ncountry\u2019s joining the United Nations, on 30 September \n1947. The Republic of Yemen was one of the first \ncountries to realize the importance of participating and \ninteracting in an international forum that serves noble \nhuman objectives, the reason for which this \nOrganization was established. We also became aware \nof the role of the United Nations in safeguarding \ninternational peace and security and in promoting \ncooperation among Member States with the aim of \nachieving prosperity for all societies. \n On this occasion, I cannot fail to refer to the \ntransformations that the Republic of Yemen has \nundergone since its inception on 22 May 1990, be it in \nhuman development, freedoms, democracy or \nprotection of human rights. However, during the past \ntwo years in particular we have had significant success \nin establishing good governance and enlisting popular \nparticipation in local council elections, and we have \nembarked on an integrated ambitious programme for \neconomic, political, social, judicial and administrative \nreform. This has come to be known as the National \nReform Agenda. \n The presidential and local elections held in \nSeptember 2006, the transparency and fairness of \nwhich were attested to by all international observers, \nare evidence of the practice of democracy, freedom of \nexpression, peaceful change of government, political \npluralism, and decentralization in the management of \nState affairs. Yemen has also granted local councils \nbroad authority. Several pieces of legislation to combat \ncorruption were passed by the Yemeni Parliament, \nincluding the establishment of a Supreme Anti-\nCorruption Commission. They deal with procurement, \ntenders and bidding, and the establishment of an \nindependent Commission, financial disclosure for \npublic servants and basic reform in the judiciary. The \nGovernment now seeks to amend the laws that govern \nthe press in order to remove all constraints. \n Yemen has acceded to several international \nagreements relating to the fight against corruption, \nincluding the initiative of international transparency in \nthe mining and extraction industry sector. \n Today the world is witnessing political changes in \nYemen: freedom of expression and of demonstration \nfor its citizens, accorded to them by the constitution \nand by law. Even though some people have used these \nfreedoms to cause anarchy and violence, the \nGovernment has dealt with them in consonance with \nthe constitution and the law. \n I reiterate that my country abides by the approach \nthat it decreed for itself: democracy, political \npluralism, peaceful change of authority and recourse to \nthe ballot box as the best and only way for change. It is \nworth recalling here that the Government of Yemen has \ndeclared its intention to amend the constitution so as to \nreduce the presidential term of office from seven to \nfive years and the term of office of Parliament \nmembers from six to four years. It also intends to \namend the law pertaining to local administration, so \nthat governors would be elected directly, and to turn \nlocal administration into local government, so that \nmore decentralization and participation in governance \ncan be realized. \n As it moves along this path, Yemen faces several \nchallenges in the areas of development, poverty and \nunemployment. These challenges compel Yemen to call \non other States and on international organizations to \nhelp it overcome obstacles and to increase their \ndevelopment aid to Yemen, especially as the per capita \nassistance provided to the Yemeni individual does not \nmeet the internationally accepted standard. \n No one today questions the existence of global \nwarming, the results of climate change that the world is \nexperiencing, or the damage that is being inflicted on \nthe environment. Hence, it is only natural to stress that \nwe should all assume our common responsibility to \ncontain the damage caused by some wrong-headed \npolicies and practices, given that the devastating \neffects of such policies are evident to each and every \none of us. Over the past year we have seen floods, \nhurricanes and global warming in many regions of the \nworld. The future has in store more catastrophes that \nmay affect or wipe out millions of people, especially in \nthe third world. Consequently, the poor would continue \nto pay for the luxuries of the rich. \n We would like to recall all the agreements \nrelative to the environment and the resolutions that \nhave been adopted at conferences to protect it. We \nshould therefore seek to contain the climatic changes \nthat result in desertification and flooding. \n The tense situation in the Palestinian territories \nand the violence the Palestinian people are facing from \nthe Israelis are matters that run contrary to the \nprovisions of the United Nations Charter, international \nlaw, international agreements, the Universal \nDeclaration of Human Rights and the Fourth Geneva \nConvention. While the Arabs in the past have been \ncriticized for not providing an Arab vision to put an \nend to the Arab-Israeli conflict, they were indeed \nsurprised that, when they presented their own Arab \nPeace Initiative, it was totally ignored by Israel and the \ninternational community, in spite of all the elements \nthat would secure a comprehensive and just solution to \nthe conflict. Thus, it is our hope that the Arab follow-\nup committee of the Arab initiative will have created a \npositive atmosphere leading to an international \nconference to be held under international supervision \nto achieve peace in the Middle East. It is also our hope \nthat the United States of America will keep its promise \nregarding the establishment of the Palestinian State on \nnational soil, with Holy Jerusalem as its capital, based \non the principles of total sovereignty, viability, and \nreturn of refugees; and we hope that the solution will \nbe widened to include total Israeli withdrawal from the \nGolan and the Sheba\u2019a farms. We emphasize the \nimportance of the participation of all the parties \nconcerned in the international conference to be held \nsoon. \n On this occasion, we call on our Palestinian \nbrothers to return to dialogue, to unite their positions, \nto abide by the Arab Peace Initiative, to reorganize the \nPalestinian house in accordance with the constitution \nand Palestinian legitimacy. I refer here to the recent \nYemeni initiative to bring the Palestinian factions \ntogether to serve the unity and ambitions of the \nPalestinian people. \n The Republic of Yemen welcomes Security \nCouncil resolution 1770 (2007) on Iraq. From this \nrostrum it calls on the international community to stand \nwith the elected Iraqi Government to extend its \nauthority, to put an end to sectarian violence, to control \nall the armed militias and to face the terrorist elements \nthat seek to spread anarchy and undermine legitimate \nresistance and efforts at national reconciliation. We \nemphasize the necessity for dialogue among all the \nnational groups in Iraq in order to reach a common \nvision that could restore Iraq\u2019s security and stability \nand its pioneering role in the region. The Republic of \nYemen calls on everyone to stop interfering in the \ninternal affairs of Iraq, to respect its unity and Arab \ncharacter, to put an end to the occupation of its lands \nand to reject any plan to divide it. \n Regarding the Sudan, we welcome its \nGovernment\u2019s acceptance of an expansion of the forces \nand mandate of the African Union-United Nations \nHybrid Operation in Darfur. We support the efforts of \nthe Sudanese Government to restore peace in that \nregion in accordance with the security plan presented \nby the Security Council, provided that the sovereignty, \nterritorial integrity and unity of the Sudan will never be \njeopardized under any pretext.  \n The Republic of Yemen blesses the reconciliation \nagreement signed by the Somali factions in the \nKingdom of Saudi Arabia, which came about as a \nresult of African, Arab and international efforts. Yemen \ncalls on all international actors to provide further \nassistance and support to the Transitional Federal \nGovernment in a manner that would enable it to rebuild \nSomalia. We emphasize the importance of providing \nenough African peacekeeping forces to stabilize and \nnormalize the security situation in Somalia. That would \nhasten the withdrawal of Ethiopian forces. As has \nalways been the case, the Republic of Yemen will \nremain a partner in the reconciliation process, \nsupporting all the parties, rejecting any foreign \nintervention in Somalia and emphasizing the need for \nreconstruction in Somalia, with a view to enabling the \nTransitional Federal Government to rebuild State \ninstitutions. \n The Republic of Yemen emphasizes the right of \ncountries to possess nuclear technology for peaceful \npurposes. It continues to support a special General \nAssembly declaration of the Middle East as a zone free \nfrom all nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass \ndestruction, and resolutions demanding that Israel \nabide by the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \nNuclear Weapons (NPT), in order to guarantee the \nstability of the region and to prevent a nuclear arms \nrace there. \n The Republic of Yemen emphasizes the \nimportance of achieving the Millennium Development \nGoals (MDGs), adopted in 2000. We also support the \nobjectives set out in the Monterrey Consensus. My \ncountry is convinced that the mobilization of financial \nresources for development and the effective use of \nthose resources in developing countries and countries \nin economic transition, are two crucial areas in which \ntrue international partnership should be encouraged. It \nis worth mentioning that the responsibility of creating \nand managing development programmes is first and \nforemost the responsibility of national Governments, in \naccordance with their priorities, needs and \nspecificities, and in keeping with international \nstrategies stemming from the Millennium Development \nGoals. This should take place in partnership with donor \ncountries and international organizations, and in \naccordance with national goals and programmes \ndevoted to human development.  \n The Republic of Yemen wants the human being to \nbe the centre and goal of its development and has \nplaced the MDGs high among the priorities of its \npolicies and its five-year development plan for the \nperiod 2006-2010. It has strenuously sought to take the \nsocial, economic and environmental dimensions of \ndevelopment into consideration. It has also involved \ncivil society organizations in implementing these \nstrategies. In addition, my country is working with \ndonor countries, international specialized agencies and \nother institutions to implement our third five-year plan, \nwith the objective of alleviating poverty by supporting \nsmall-scale programmes, expanding technical \neducation, enabling women, providing investment \nservices and opportunities and strengthening good \ngovernance. This is an ambitious plan that requires \ninternational support if it is to fully achieve its \nobjectives of bringing about a qualitative change in \nhuman development in Yemen.  \n There have been difficulties, however, in the \nimplementation of this ambitious reform programme, \nincluding frequent increases in the price of food stuffs, \nsuch as wheat flour, which has affected the standard of \nliving of Yemeni citizens, placing increasingly heavy \nburdens on them. Accordingly, it is incumbent on rich \nStates to consider how to deal with inflation in \ninternational markets, so that countries\u2019 efforts to \nimplement their reform programmes will not be \njeopardized and so that those countries can strike a \nbalance between the costs of reform on the one hand \nand living standards, social peace and political stability \non the other.  \n In conclusion, allow me to express on behalf of \nthe Government of the Republic of Yemen our deep \nthanks to the Secretary-General, His Excellency  \nMr. Ban Ki-moon, for his sincere and strenuous efforts \nat the helm of the Organization. We are confident that \nhe is capable of leading it with a view to bringing \nabout justice and fulfilling the principles and values of \nthe United Nations to which we all aspire. We look \nforward to his continued leadership, especially in the \nsearch for a just and comprehensive peace in the \nMiddle East.  \n"

        "file_text": "It is indeed an honour for \nme to extend to Mr. Kerim the sincere congratulations \nof the Government of Somalia upon his election to the \npresidency of the General Assembly. His tenure comes \nat a crucial period for the international community as \ntensions and instability have surfaced and the United \nNations has also embarked on a series of world-\nchanging reforms. My delegation is confident that he \nwill rise to the challenges and steer this body \ncompetently during the sixty-second session. \n Fitting tribute is also due to his predecessor, \nSheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa, for her sterling \nguidance and exemplary way of steering the \nproceedings of the sixty-first session of the General \nAssembly during some of the most trying times for the \nUnited Nations. \n Permit me also to express on behalf of the \nTransitional Federal Government of Somalia my \nsincere felicitations to the new Secretary-General, Mr. \nBan Ki-moon, who has had a distinguished career in \ninternational diplomacy and who brings that extensive \nexperience to the United Nations. Those skills will be \ncrucial in his new assignment. We are confident that he \nwill be a beacon of hope in keeping the United Nations \nideal alive during the years ahead. \n May I also take this opportunity to congratulate \nMs. Asha-Rose Migiro on her appointment to the High \nOffice of Deputy Secretary-General. \n The President returned to the Chair. \n One of the major principles of the United Nations \nCharter is to maintain peace and security, and to that \nend to take effective measures for the prevention and \nremoval of breaches to world peace and security. It is \nin that conviction that I appear before this body to \nunderscore the concerns of the Federal Government of \nSomalia on political and security matters related to the \nroles that should be assumed by the international \ncommunity. \n Regrettably, we feel that our major efforts in \nnation-building and State-institution development have \nmet with an unreceptive response and reticence of an \ninexplicable nature. Collective action by this world \nbody has been more consistent and vigorous, until very \nrecently, in coming to the rescue of nations in dire need \nof help. A case in point concerning that \nincomprehensible attitude is the long-delayed adoption \nof a resolution on the timely deployment of a \npeacekeeping mission in Somalia. If that stand \ncontinues, it will reveal only a lack of commitment and \nindirect acquiescence to prolonging the agony of the \nSomali people. We call upon the United Nations to \ncome out without delay in support of the deployment \nof the multinational forces. \nThe Transitional Federal Government of Somalia \nhas diligently embarked on implementing the tasks \nmandated by our Charter before the end of the \ntransitional period in 2009. Those include, among other \nthings, securing democratic transformation, putting in \nplace permanent constitutional legality, establishing a \nmulti-party democratic society, and setting up regional \nautonomous administrations. The federal institutions in \ncharge of that arduous task are working hard to provide \nthe nation with a federal constitution that upholds those \nfundamental obligations, thus signalling a new era of \ntranquillity for the Somali people. \n The efforts of the Federal Government \nculminated in the convening of a peace and national \nreconciliation conference in Somalia this year, \nindicating that national consciousness is regenerating \nwithin our society and a self-healing process has \nbegun. \n Despite disruptive intimidations by terrorist \nelements that tried to hijack the proceedings, the \nconference came to a successful conclusion. \nRepresentatives of all walks of life in the Somali \ncommunity attended the conference and dealt with \nissues of concern in every aspect. In that regard, we \npay special tribute to the helping hand of the Ethiopian \nforces and the Uganda-led African Union Mission in \nSomalia, which effectively dealt with the terrorists, \nwho are gradually fading away. \n Here, I wish to underscore that peace, security \nand the well-being and prosperity of individuals and \nnations alike are at stake in the fight against terrorism. \nIt is our view that the only viable response to terrorism \nis a collective response of all nations, and it is for that \nreason that the United Nations system has a pivotal \nrole to play and vital contributions to make in many \naspects of counter-terrorism, from promoting the rule \nof law and effective criminal justice systems to \nensuring that countries have the means to counter \nterrorism. No other institution has the means to unify \nnations in the fight against that evil, and there is no \nbetter venue for nations to forge their protective \nmeasures. \n Our efforts aimed at nation-building, restoring \npeace and stability, conflict resolution, reconstruction \nand rehabilitation cannot have the expected impact \nunless the required funding resources and the needed \nequipment and supplies are made available as the days \nof institutional disharmony are replaced by an immense \naspiration to rebuild the country. We therefore reiterate \nour repeated calls for a pledging conference, and \nappeal to the donor community to show serious \ncommitment to organizing and convening an \ninternational donor conference, in coordination with \nthe Transitional Federal Government of Somalia. \n Another area that cries out for speedy action is \nthe humanitarian needs in Somalia. As members are all \naware, the protracted civil war and persistent \nfragmented conflicts over the past two decades have \nbeen exacerbated by natural disasters that have not \nonly devastated public and private institutions, but \nhave also torn the socio-economic fabric of society and \ncontributed to grave humanitarian crises. We appeal to \nthe world community to make generous contributions \nand to work closely with the Somali authorities to \nensure that humanitarian access is provided to the most \nvulnerable populations. Meeting those humanitarian \nneeds will ultimately provide a strong foundation from \nwhich recovery, reconstruction and development can \nemerge in the future. \n This historical moment requires bold initiatives \non the part of the President of the General Assembly, \nwho, in tandem with the Secretary-General, is called \nupon to provide the vision and strength of conviction \nnecessary to carry the United Nations forward to face \nthe myriad challenges to the Organization. We are \nconfident that, by working together closely, we can and \nshall meet the challenges ahead. \n"

        "file_text": "It is my great pleasure, Sir, \nto extend to you warmest and most sincere \ncongratulations on your assumption of the presidency \nof the General Assembly. The Jamaican delegation is \nconfident that much will be accomplished during the \nsixty-second session under your able leadership. You \ncan be assured of the support of the Jamaican \ndelegation in that endeavour. \n To your predecessor, Her Excellency Sheikha \nHaya Rashed Al-Khalifa, the Jamaican delegation \nextends its appreciation for her unstinting efforts in \nadvancing the work of the General Assembly during its \nsixty-first session. \n Jamaica also wishes to pay tribute to the laudable \nefforts of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon who, since \nhis assumption of office in January of this year, has \nmoved forward in earnest to enhance the process of \nreform of the United Nations. \n I am deeply honoured to be addressing the \nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-second session on behalf \nof my country, Jamaica. Today, I especially restate my \ncountry\u2019s firm commitment to the ideals and principles \nof the United Nations and underscore Jamaica\u2019s strong \nsupport for multilateralism, which must underpin the \ncore processes in the execution of the functions and \nresponsibilities of the United Nations. In doing so, I \nam driven by our resolve for change, as well as by the \nneed for unity and for the reinvigoration of the United \nNations in order for it to effectively and efficiently \nachieve the fundamental purposes set out in its Charter.  \n As we begin this session, we must not lose sight \nof our strategic objectives and vision towards the \nmaintenance of international peace and security; the \ndevelopment of friendly relations among nations; the \nachievement of international cooperation in the \neconomic, social, cultural and humanitarian fields; and \nthe promotion of human rights and fundamental \nfreedoms.  \n Looking back at the record over the past year, it \nis disconcerting that the challenges we face at the \nglobal level have not seen much discernable change. \nFrom a security point of view, the world continues to \nbe plagued by seemingly incessant and protracted \nconflicts, such as those in the Middle East, parts of \nAfrica and elsewhere. Millions of innocent persons are \nthe victims of civil strife or are displaced as a result of \nviolence and armed conflict. Terrorism, transnational \norganized crime and the proliferation of weapons of \nmass destruction continue to threaten international \npeace and security.  \n From the economic and social perspective, we \ncannot escape the fact that we live in a world \ncharacterized by high levels of underdevelopment and \nsocial degradation   a world where too many people \nlive in dehumanizing poverty. It is a world in which \nhuman security is being threatened by environmental \ndegradation. The experience of HIV/AIDS and the \nconstant threat of new pandemics underscore our \ninterconnectedness and interdependence, demanding \nuniversal cooperation and collective action.  \n All States, developed and developing, large and \nsmall, are vulnerable to those threats and must of \nnecessity have a shared commitment to strengthening \ncollective security and safeguarding world peace and \nsecurity. No nation can address those challenges and \nthreats entirely on its own. Sustained collective action \nand global cooperation are required to identify and \nshape a common vision and agreed objectives to deal \nwith the complexities of our times. In recent years, we \nhave renewed our commitment to the United Nations as \nthe catalyst for effectively advancing the interests of \nour peoples in the areas of development, peace and \nsecurity, and human rights.  \n Unquestionably, there have been pockets of \nsuccess in global economic progress over the past \ndecade. By and large, however, our commitments have \nnot been matched by the desired implementation of the \ntargets for meeting basic human needs, human security \nand sustainable development. It is clear that much \nmore needs to be done if we are to achieve the \ndevelopment targets in the Millennium Development \nGoals (MDGs) by 2015.  \n The Government of Jamaica fully accepts that \neach country has the primary responsibility for setting \ndevelopment priorities through sound governance and \npolicies. We believe that the goals that were solemnly \nagreed seven years ago are not overly ambitious and \nare still achievable. In that context, my Government is \ncommitted to taking further measures to pursue the \nobjectives of the MDGs and other internationally \nagreed development goals. We are committed to \nproviding the necessary framework that will promote \nsocial inclusion, enhance productive capacity and \nemployment, and facilitate investment and sustained \neconomic growth.  \n But many developing countries, such as Jamaica, \ncannot do it alone. The realization of the development \nagenda is dependent not only on our own domestic \ncapabilities, but equally on the genuine commitment of \nall Member States to pursue a global partnership for \ndevelopment, which is at the core of the strategy for \ndevelopment. We believe, therefore, that it is \nimperative that we move beyond the simple reiteration \nof principles and translate commitments into action. \nWe must give life to the aspirations embodied in the \noutcomes of international conferences on the basis of \nmutual responsibility and mutual accountability, with a \nfair expectation that obligations, as agreed, will be \nfully undertaken.  \n In all that we do, we must recognize that progress \nand uplifting the poor benefits all of us. It can mean \nthe difference between conflict and stability, between \nhope and despair. As developing countries strive to put \nin place practical national development strategies, \ndeveloped country partners must support those efforts \nthrough greater market access, debt relief, private \ncapital flows, technological transfers and improved \nglobal economic governance. Jamaica therefore calls \nfor renewed focus, as well as the necessary political \nwill, to honour the commitments made for \ndevelopment, and urges the fulfilment of all \nobligations that we have collectively embraced so that \nwe may effect real change in the lives of millions of \nimpoverished people around the world.  \n A critical role in that process is official \ndevelopment assistance, including the fulfilment by \ndeveloped countries of the official development \nassistance target of 0.7 per cent of gross national \nincome. The High-Level Meeting on Financing for \nDevelopment provides an opportunity to enhance \ncollaboration with our partners towards achieving that \ngoal.  \n The unique situation of middle-income \ndeveloping countries, such as Jamaica, also requires \nspecial attention. That varied group of countries, with \nper capita gross domestic product spreading from $900 \nto $10,000, is by no means a homogeneous group and \npossesses its own particular vulnerabilities. Greater \nefforts must be made to address the needs of middle-\nincome developing countries, in particular the high \nlevel of indebtedness that those countries face.  \n Globalization and economic liberalization have \nresulted in the increased exposure of developing \ncountries to external economic forces over which they \nhave little control. We should refuse to accept that \nglobalization creates winners and losers. What we \nshould strive for is a win-win and inclusive process in \nwhich the benefits and opportunities are more widely \nenjoyed across countries and regions.  \n An enabling international environment also \nrequires a global trading system that is fair and \nequitable and that is conducive to development and \nintegration in the world economy. A continued cause of \ngrave concern to Jamaica is therefore the current \nimpasse in the negotiations in the Doha Development \nRound, in spite of commitments to work expeditiously \ntowards implementing the development dimensions of \nthe Doha work programme. We must summon the \nnecessary political will to reignite trade negotiations, \nwith the development agenda as the centrepiece of the \ndiscussions as we seek to integrate developing \ncountries in the multilateral trading system.  \n It is important that the creation of a viable and \nequitable trade regime also recognize diversity in the \nlevels of development and size of economies. A one-\nsize-fits-all model disregards the complexities and \nunique circumstances of countries. Jamaica will \ntherefore continue to insist that new trading \narrangements take account of that differentiation, \nespecially as it concerns small vulnerable economies. \nThe principle of special and differential treatment \nseeks only to level the playing field and to give \ndeveloping countries a fair chance to participate \nmeaningfully in global trade. At the same time, we will \nalso join other developing countries in pressing for the \nremoval of support for agricultural products by certain \ndeveloped countries as a precondition for further \nmarket access for such products.  \n We call for and join in continuous and concerted \ninternational efforts to fight the spread of \ncommunicable diseases, including HIV/AIDS, \ntuberculosis, malaria and others, particularly bearing in \nmind that they are all preventable. The global impact \nof AIDS has been particularly devastating. The high \nprevalence in many countries, especially in sub-\nSaharan Africa and the Caribbean, is cause for alarm. It \nshould be noted that the pattern of high prevalence and \nhigh heterosexual transmission is strongly associated \nwith poverty.  \n While noting the international response through \nthe Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS \n(UNAIDS) and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, \nTuberculosis and Malaria, we stress the need for \nincreased funding to help support developing countries \nto fight the pandemic. We are particularly concerned \nthat the countries of the Caribbean, including Jamaica, \nare placed at a disadvantage in accessing the necessary \nfunding to curtail the spread of the disease owing to \ntheir assigned middle-income status.  \n Implementing a global response to climate \nchange must remain a priority as we seek consensus for \ncombating global warming beyond 2012, when the \nKyoto Protocol expires. As we prepare for the \nConference of the Parties to the United Nations \nFramework Convention on Climate Change in Bali, \nIndonesia, we are encouraged that the recent High-\nLevel Event on Climate Change and the General \nAssembly informal debate on climate change \nreinforced the urgency with which issues pertaining to \nenvironmental sustainability have to be tackled.  \n The principle of common but differentiated \nresponsibility must be applied across the board. We are \nequally convinced that the international community \nmust assist small island developing States in \nincorporating climate change adaptation and mitigation \nconcerns in national sustainable development plans and \nassist them by improving access to environmentally \nsound technology related to climate change.  \n Jamaica and other countries in the Caribbean are \nall too familiar with the adverse effects of climate \nchange and associated phenomena, including the rise in \nsea-level and the increase in the frequency and \nintensity of hurricanes and other weather events that \nthreaten the sustainable development, livelihoods and \nthe very existence of small island developing States. In \nmy own country, the onslaught of Hurricane Dean on \n19 August resulted in the loss of life and extensive \ndamage to infrastructure, property and the agricultural \nsector, as well as in the loss of livelihood for many.  \n The threat of terrorism transcends boundaries and \nhas had a devastating impact on the economic \ndevelopment of States, whether directly or indirectly. It \nis imperative that we negotiate and conclude a \ncomprehensive convention against terrorism. We must \nalso invigorate disarmament and non-proliferation \nefforts.  \n There is a need to comprehensively address the \nillicit trafficking in small arms and light weapons, \nwhich have the capacity to kill and maim thousands of \npeople. Jamaica has first-hand experience of high \nlevels of gun violence and the unwarranted burden it \nplaces on our social and economic system. We urge the \ninternational community to give priority attention to \nthis menace, including through the creation of a legally \nbinding instrument containing stricter controls on the \nillegal trade in small arms and ammunition. Likewise, \nwe support the proposal for the establishment of an \narms trade treaty.  \n A major priority of the United Nations is not only \nwinning the peace, but more importantly keeping and \nsustaining the peace. Jamaica fully supports the work \nof the Peacebuilding Commission, which earlier this \nyear celebrated its first anniversary and whose \ngroundbreaking work is assisting in post-conflict \nrehabilitation and reconstruction. As a member of the \nCommission, Jamaica looks forward to the \ncontinuation of the dialogue as we seek to build on the \nsuccesses of the recent past, always mindful that the \ncountries under consideration require swift action to \nimplement priority projects as part of the rehabilitation \nand reconstruction process.  \n The Caribbean Community (CARICOM) \ncontinues to be seized of developments in Haiti. We \nreaffirm the importance of the continued engagement \nof the international community and, in this regard, \nwelcome the renewal of the mandate of the United \nNations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH) to \nassist in the stabilization process. We also encourage \nsupport from the international community to meet the \nlong-term social, economic and development needs of \nHaiti.  \n We must remain unwavering in our commitment \nto the promotion and protection of human rights and \nthe rule of law. Much more needs to be done to ensure \nthat the basic rights of individuals are universally \nprotected and that transparent and accountable \ngovernance prevails at the local and international \nlevels.  \n Jamaica is honoured to assume the Chairmanship \nof the Third Committee during the General Assembly \nat its sixty-second session, as part of our commitment \nto ensure that human rights are promoted and protected \nglobally. In this regard, we are particularly keen to help \nguide the Committee\u2019s work in promoting and \nprotecting the rights of marginalized and vulnerable \ngroups. Jamaica recognizes the importance of the \nprotection of the human rights of women, which is \ncritical to the international processes aimed at \nachieving gender equality and the development of \nwomen.  \n Late last year a significant milestone was \nachieved with the adoption by the United Nations of \nthe Convention on the Rights of Persons with \nDisabilities with the distinction of being one of the \nmost supported conventions at its opening for signature \nin March 2007. Jamaica is pleased to have been the \nfirst country to ratify the Convention and encourages \nothers to accede to the Convention as a sign of their \ncommitment to ensuring that the rights and dignity of \nthe disabled are promoted and protected. We also \nwelcome the adoption of the Declaration on the Rights \nof Indigenous Peoples.  \n The deteriorating humanitarian situation in \nDarfur remains a matter of grave concern and \npreoccupation of the international community. Jamaica \ntherefore welcomes the recent unanimous adoption of \nSecurity Council resolution 1769 (2007) for the \ndeployment of the joint African Union-United Nations \nHybrid Operation in Darfur to the region. We are \nencouraged that by certain developments that indicate \nthat this kind of cooperation has begun and urge that \nthese efforts be intensified.  \n The process of reform of the United Nations \nseems prolonged and challenging, with little or no \nconsensus in the various proposals put forward for \nimprovements in the functioning of the United Nations \nand its main organs. We must redouble our efforts to \nrevitalize the General Assembly, so that it can \neffectively carry out its role and responsibility as the \nchief deliberative and policy-making organ of the \nUnited Nations. We must also work towards a reformed \nSecurity Council that is more inclusive, more \nrepresentative and more transparent.  \n This year marks the bicentenary of the abolition \nof the transatlantic slave trade. Member States of the \nCaribbean Community are heartened by the \noverwhelming solidarity of the international \ncommunity in marking the event at the special \ncommemorative meeting of the General Assembly in \nMarch and other activities during the course of the year \nto memorialize the victims of this egregious period in \nour history.  \n A significant element of the commemoration is a \nplan to honour the victims of the transatlantic slave \ntrade and slavery, through the erection of a permanent \nmemorial in the halls of the United Nations. We are \ngrateful to Member States that have contributed or \npledged towards the permanent memorial account that \nhas been established and look forward to your further \nsupport and contributions towards the erection of the \nmemorial.  \n We are 192 Member States; we have the \nfundamental tools and the required level of expertise to \neffectively address the major challenges facing us \ntoday. It is now clear that we must also have a steadfast \nwill and a shared commitment towards a radical change \nfrom the existing mindset in favour of positive action, \nif the United Nations is to successfully respond to \nchallenges, which continue to hamper the attainment of \nits objectives for peace and sustainable development.  \n In calling for radical change in the existing \nmindset and in the way we discourse and take actions \non international issues, we should be guided by the \npurposes and principles of the Charter. A change in our \nmindset will require a rethinking on the part of all \nMember States as we seek to promote world peace and \nachieve economic and social development. It will also \nrequire a deep search in the conscience of all States as \nwe seek to adhere to our obligations under \ninternational law with due regard for the collective will \nof the international community.  \n This radical change in the existing mindset will \nnecessarily require us to be more responsible as \nMember States of a united Organization, more \nresponsible as citizens of this one world and more \nfocused on the shared responsibilities that come with \nour membership in the United Nations.  \n Let us not falter in our obligation to ensure that \nthe Organization not only remains responsive to the \nvast array of concerns and demands of its diverse \nmembership, but that it is able to do so without \ncompromising the noble ideals and principles on which \nit was founded.  This process begins with a conscious \ndetermination and political resolve to transform not \nonly our modus operandi, but the thinking that informs \nit. Jamaica stands ready to play its part in this \nendeavour and calls upon all Member States to do \nlikewise.  \n"

        "file_text": "I am  honoured to address the General Assembly as the first \nPrime Minister of a constitutionally permanent \nGovernment representing Iraq, its people, and its \naspirations in cementing the foundations of democracy, \npeace, freedom and cooperation with the international \ncommunity. I come carrying the concerns of the people \nof the Valley of Two Rivers who built the most ancient \ncivilization and established the first laws, and who \ntoday offer humanity a lofty example in sustaining life, \nfacing challenges, and persisting in protecting our \nyoung democratic experience. \n The Iraqi people lived isolated from the world in \nthe shadow of dictatorship for 35 years. There was no \nfreedom of expression or belief, no multiple party \nsystem, no free elections, no democratic institutions, \nno communications systems, and no media except \nthose that were controlled by the Government \nintelligence agencies. \nMillions of victims in Iraq suffered throughout \nthat era in adventurous wars with two neighbouring \ncountries, Iran and Kuwait. Genocidal mass murder \nwas committed inside Iraq, such as during the \nal-Anfaal campaign and in Halabja. In addition, there \nwere mass graves, horrific prison cells and detention \ncamps, and the immense destruction that plagued the \ninfrastructure of the various governmental institutions. \n Today in the new Iraq, there are hundreds of \nparties active within 20 political alliances. There are \nmore than 6,000 civil society organizations, hundreds \nof newspapers and magazines, 40 local and satellite TV \nstations, as well as the offices of foreign \ncorrespondents from all over the world working \nwithout restrictions or conditions. \n The new Iraq is being targeted today. Terrorism \nkills civilians, journalists, artists, intellectuals and \nprofessionals; it attacks universities, marketplaces and \nlibraries; it blows up mosques and churches and \ndestroys the infrastructure of State institutions. We \nconsider terrorism to be an extension of the fallen \ndictatorship, although it may vary in its external form \nor in the gangs that carry it out. Terrorism seeks to \nabort the political process and to ignite sectarian strife \nas a prelude to hijacking Iraq back into the era of \ntyranny, oppression and backwardness. \n Car bombs, explosive vests in public places and \nthe display of decapitated heads on television are all \nmessages of threat and intimidation that terrorists send \nto the world community, the bloody chapters of which \nwere executed in Algeria, Spain, England, France, \nLebanon, Turkey and here in New York. We are \nsteadfast and determined to exterminate and defeat \nterrorism in Iraq so that it does not spread through the \ncountries of the world, repeating the tragedy. \n Iraq, which carries the greater burden in \nconfronting terrorism, calls upon the nations of the \nworld to help and join in its efforts to fight the scourge \nof terrorism. Our battle aims at providing security, \nstability and prosperity, and at protecting our \ndemocratic experience. We are determined to be \nvictorious in our battle, which will be a victory for \nhumanity. The fierce onslaught of terror against Iraq \nsince the fall of the dictatorship has not stopped our \npeople, through three epic elections, from laying the \ngroundwork for a democratic experience unique in \nIraq\u2019s history and the region, in which, as a permanent \nConstitution was voted upon, a parliament was elected \nand a National Unity Government was established. \n The new Iraq living through its nascent \ndemocratic experience is governed by constitutional \ninstitutions, in which freedom of opinion, belief and \nexpression are respected. That Iraq will not retreat \nfrom its democratic option, for which our people have \npaid a very high price. Our position requires the \nsupport and cooperation of the world\u2019s nations so that \nIraq can build a modern State that guarantees justice, \nequality and respect for religious, intellectual, sectarian \nand ethnic pluralism. \n Our people, who have enjoyed the taste of \nfreedom after eras of tyranny and oppression, will \ncontinue on the road towards building a State of \ninstitutions, reinforcing the authority of law, respecting \nhuman rights, and the active participation of women in \nall areas. The national reconciliation and dialogue \ninitiative that I launched upon assuming my \nresponsibility as the Prime Minister of the National \nUnity Government did not come out of thin air. Its \nstrength arises from the Iraqi people\u2019s civilization and \ncultural heritage, which have made great contributions \nto humankind. Iraqis have lived in peace, brotherhood, \nforgiveness and tolerance since the dawn of history. \nTheir religious, national, sectarian and ethnic diversity \nhave been elements of strength, reinforcing national \nunity. \n We think of national reconciliation as a life boat, \na perpetual peace project and a safe harbour for the \npolitical process and the democratic experience. We \nalso believe that national reconciliation is not the \nresponsibility of the Government alone. It is a \ncollective responsibility held by the political powers, \nintellectual leaders, religious leaders, the educated, \ncivil society organizations and all the active powers in \nthe Iraqi arena. National reconciliation is the strategic \nchoice that has saved our country from slipping into \nthe pit of a sectarian war that was planned by the \nenemies of freedom and democracy after they blew up \nthe tomb of the two Askari imams in Samara. \n National reconciliation is not a dinner party \nprepared between those in dispute, nor is it a dose of \nmedicine, as some might think. It is a realistic vision \nthat counteracts the burdensome legacy of the fallen \nregime in all areas. It lays the foundation for political, \nsocial and economic progress and the security that we \nstrive for. Furthermore, it cements the principles of the \nnew political system. \n National reconciliation is the olive branch that \nblossomed into the formation of support councils in \nmany of our provinces and Iraqi cities. It was also \nsuccessful in leading some 28,000 citizens from Iraqi \ntribes to join our military efforts to combat terrorism. It \nhas resulted in the restoration of security in our cities, \nvillages and provinces, including in Al-Anbar \nprovince, which has been liberated from the Al-Qaida \nterrorist organization. The terrorists fled from there, \nonly to face another defeat, this time in Diyala \nprovince. Thus, Al-Qaida is losing its safe havens, one \nby one. \n Indeed, national reconciliation is stronger than \nthe weapons of terrorism. It caused the reintegration of \nmore than 14,000 people who had been members of \narmed groups that splintered off from Al-Qaida. Those \nfighters stood alongside our armed forces and the \nmultinational forces battling Al-Qaida, dealing \ndevastating blows to that terrorist organization.  \n The practical accomplishments that have been \nachieved through constant mobilization for national \nreconciliation are considered important successes, in \ncontrast to the great challenges facing Iraq and the \nexperiences of people who have suffered from \ndictatorships and civil and sectarian wars. \n We emphasize that the acts of sectarian violence \nbeing committed in Iraq are not perpetrated by the \nmain elements of society, but rather by extremists and \nfanatics belonging to various groups. We have been \nsuccessful in largely containing this problem. The \naverage number of sectarian killings has decreased and \nsecurity and stability have been restored in many \nformer hot spots. That has helped the return of \nthousands of displaced families to their homes. We are \nresolved to fight any and all outlaws, regardless of \ntheir sectarian or political affiliations. Our armed \nforces have been steadfast in establishing law and \norder and in instilling a sense of respect for the \nGovernment in many provinces whose residents have \ndiverse religious, sectarian and ethnic affiliations. \n The skills and capabilities of our security and \nmilitary agencies have grown swiftly as they have \nconfronted terrorist organizations, militias and \norganized crime groups. However, they need further \ntraining and development so that they can quickly take \nover from the multinational forces the responsibility \nfor security throughout Iraq. Having proved our ability \nto provide security in eight provinces, we are prepared \nto assume full and swift responsibility for security so \nthat we can protect the democratic achievements of our \npeople. We shall work to ensure that our armed forces \nact in a professional manner and are loyal first and \nforemost to our country, not to an individual party, sect \nor ethnicity. \n In addition to those achievements, the \nGovernment of National Unity has begun the process \nof reconstruction. We have voted on the largest budget \nin Iraq\u2019s contemporary history. With the cooperation of \nparliament, we have adopted the investment law, which \nis considered a step forward that will stimulate the \nIraqi economy and move it from a centrally based \nsystem to one based on free enterprise and a market \neconomy. That in turn will help to fulfil our people\u2019s \naspirations to development, prosperity and well-being. \nIn addition, the Government has finalized a draft law \nfor oil and gas, which if approved by parliament will \nensure fair distribution of wealth, since oil is \nconsidered the property of all Iraqis. \n The Government also continues to adopt and \nimplement other laws in various areas. We have taken \npractical steps to improve our people\u2019s living \nconditions, to increase salaries and pensions, to combat \nunemployment and to expand the efforts of the social \nwelfare network. The Government is determined that \nnext year will be dedicated to promoting the service \nsector in order to alleviate the hardships and suffering \nof our citizens.  \n We understand that these promising steps do not \nfulfil all our aspirations and that we have a long way to \ngo until we achieve our goal of a secure, stable and \nprosperous Iraq. We hope that the international \ncommunity will support Iraq and help it to achieve that \nnoble goal.  \n We believe that security is an integrated system. \nA secure and stable Iraq will be in the best interests of \nthe region and of the world as a whole. We have \nwarned all countries in the region that the relentless \nflow of weapons, money and suicide bombers and the \nspreading of fatwas that incite hatred and murder will \nonly spell disaster for the peoples of the region and the \nentire world. \n After the Government of National Unity was \nformed, we took the initiative to improve Iraq\u2019s \nrelationship with neighbouring countries. We also took \npains to make our common borders peaceful and \neconomically prosperous areas. The foreign policy of \nthe new Iraq is based on our permanent Constitution, \nwhich does not allow our land to be used against our \nneighbours and prohibits foreign interference in our \ninternal affairs. Today, we feel optimistic that countries \nin the region are aware of the danger of the terrorist \nonslaught against Iraq and that a weak Iraq is not in \ntheir interests. A strong and democratic Iraq will be a \nguarantee of security and stability in the region. \n Because of its new policies, Iraq has become a \nplace for negotiations and dialogue between feuding \nregional and international entities. We will take steps to \nreinforce that positive role, adopting a policy of \nimproving conditions, defusing crises and banishing \nthe spectre of war and conflict from the region. We \nfirmly believe that tension and instability undermine \nsecurity not only in Iraq, but throughout the region and \nthe world. \n Iraq, which in recent decades has been a hotbed \nof tension in the region, is now qualified, by virtue of \nits material and human resources, to serve as a \nplatform for regional and international economic \ncooperation. That will contribute to the establishment \nof an economic system that will produce development \nand prosperity for the peoples and countries of the \nregion. \n We also wish to express our sincere desire to \nestablish the best possible relationship with the \ninternational community. We believe that Iraq must be \nopen to all countries, developing relationships and \nbenefiting from the experiences of other democracies. \n As I stand before leaders and representatives of \nthe world\u2019s nations, I must recall that the Iraqi people \ncontinue to pay the price for the reckless politics of the \nprevious, fallen regime and to experience the \nconsequences of international resolutions, especially \nthose relating to its weapons programme and its \ninvasion of the brotherly State of Kuwait. Those \nresolutions, which were exploited by the previous \nregime for political gain, have caused much damage to \nour infrastructure, service sector and education and \nhealth systems. Our people are looking to the \ninternational community for help in repairing that \ndamage and lifting the heavy burdens of debt and \nreparation.  \n The Iraqi people will remember the countries that \nmade sacrifices and stood alongside them in bringing \ndown the dictator\u2019s regime. They will remember those \nwho helped them during the transition to a democratic \nand pluralistic federal system. Moreover, they will \nalways respect and appreciate the countries and \nGovernments that support their political process and \nparticipate in the reconstruction process.  \n Our efforts, in partnership with the international \ncommunity, to achieve economic progress and social \njustice culminated in success with the signing of the \nInternational Compact with Iraq and the \nimplementation of its provisions. That document \nrepresents a new stage in the development of balanced \nrelationships between Iraq and other Governments \nthroughout the world. It is a point of departure in the \nbuilding of a democratic, pluralistic, federal Iraq where \nall citizens are equal and will benefit from fair \ndistribution of wealth after the burdens of debt, \nunemployment, and administrative and financial \ncorruption left over from the days of the former regime \nhave been lifted. \n We hope that the countries concerned will comply \nwith the provisions of the International Compact with \nIraq. That will help the international community and \nencourage it to play its role in reconstruction and \ndevelopment and in supporting national reconciliation \nand the democratic experience. \n Many of the region\u2019s problems and crises can be \nresolved through constructive and focused dialogue. In \norder to maintain peace and security, our region must \nabandon the path of war and adventure, which has led \nto increased harm and suffering for the people. \n Within this framework, we call for recognition of \nthe rights of the Palestinian people, for assistance to \nthem in establishing an independent State, and for the \nreturn of occupied Arab lands in accordance with \ninternational resolutions. The elimination of weapons \nof mass destruction in the Middle East will indeed \nguarantee a just and comprehensive peace.  \n We call for the intensification of national, Arab \nand international efforts to help Lebanon and its \npolitical authorities to transcend the state of division \nand to bar interference in its internal affairs so that \nLebanon can regain its national unity and \ncohesiveness.  \n To forge partnerships and to achieve peace, \nstability and prosperity, we must bolster cooperation \namong all countries of the world and must work \ntogether to attain the noble goals of the United Nations. \nThis also necessitates ensuring equal and balanced \nrelationships among States and developing a more fair \nand just global order by helping economically \ndisadvantaged developing countries and reducing the \ndevelopment gap between poor and rich nations. \n We support an active United Nations role in the \ninternational arena, peacefully resolving crises once it \nattains all the elements and support that it needs to play \nthat important role. We call upon the United Nations to \nadopt peaceful initiatives that can help defuse \nconflicts, save people from the scourge of war and \nestablish international security and stability. That will \nguarantee the rights and interests of all nations and will \nreinforce partnerships and cooperation among them. It \nwill also provide the necessary environment for solving \nthe problems and crises that face the world in a fair and \njust way.  \n Finally, on behalf of the Iraqi people, I wish to \ncongratulate Mr. Srgjan Kerim, President of the \nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-second session. I also \nwant to thank Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who \nplayed an important role in the United Nations \nadoption of the International Compact with Iraq to help \nIraq carry out its reform programme of political, \neconomic and security reform. My deep appreciation \ngoes also to all countries that signed the Compact. \n"

        "file_text": "I would like, first of all, to \nextend my congratulations to you, Sir, on his election \nto the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-\nsecond session. I am convinced that you will guide the \nGeneral Assembly through its important deliberations \nand challenges. I assure you of my full support and that \nof the Maltese delegation.  \n I also take this opportunity to express the \nappreciation of the Maltese delegation to the outgoing \nPresident of the General Assembly at its sixty-first \nsession, Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa, for her \nuntiring work in facilitating a constructive dialogue \namong all the United Nations Member States. \n Once again, the General Assembly is meeting to \nconsider and debate international issues that impact on \nthe heart and soul of the world populations. We are \nconcerned with the life and survival of those that do \nnot have a voice to cry out against the injustices, \nunderdevelopment, human rights violations, gender \ndiscrimination, poverty, child labour and \nenvironmental degradation. \n Malta applauds the efforts of Secretary-General \nBan Ki-moon who, since taking up his office, has \nvalidly been making a solid contribution towards a \nmore secure world, which is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153our shared \nresponsibility\u00e2\u20ac\u009d. \n The challenge of global climate change, \nparticularly of global warming, induces me to make a \nfew remarks about this environmental threat and its \nserious economic and social impacts which will impede \nprogress towards the Millennium Development Goals. I \nam very proud of the fact that almost 20 years ago, in \n1988, my country, Malta, raised awareness about the \ngrave repercussions of climate change through an \ninitiative which led the General Assembly to declare \nthat \\\"climate change is the common concern of \nmankind\\\".\u009d Eventually, that initiative led to the \nadoption of the Framework Convention on Climate \nChange and its Kyoto Protocol. \n I note with satisfaction the remarkable \nparticipation in last Monday's high-level event. The \nSecretary-General was unequivocal in outlining the \nchallenge the world community is facing today. He \nsaid:  \n Much has happened since those early days. \nBut the fundamental challenge remains \nunchanged, and has become even more pressing. \nIndeed, I am convinced that climate change, and \nwhat we do about it, will define us, our era, and \nultimately the global legacy we leave for future \ngenerations.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d (Press release GA/10619) \n The disastrous effects on local populations that \nweather extremes are having as a result of global \nwarming, such as Hurricane Dean, which, the \nAssembly will recall, devastated the economies and \ninfrastructure of the island States of Dominica, Saint \nLucia, Jamaica, Martinique and Guadeloupe, and other \nsmall island States in the Pacific and the Caribbean. All \nof that requires the United Nations to strengthen its \nleadership in dealing with natural disasters. \n Malta believes that the issue of climate change \nand its repercussions must be addressed in a more \ncohesive and concerted manner among all the \ninternational institutions and organizations. It is \nimperative that all actors involved in climate risk \nreduction take a unified stand on a strategy and action \nto strengthen the resilience of affected countries in \nbuilding their ability to face and adapt to the adverse \nimpact of climate change. \n Malta also believes that the United Nations \nshould establish a mechanism through the General \nAssembly which will report on the activities in the \nfield of climate change throughout the past 20 years \nand propose elements of a possible future global \nstrategy which avoids the current fragmented approach \nand takes special account of the needs of small island \nStates. \n We owe such an effort to present and future \ngenerations. Malta looks forward to decisions at the \nBali summit next December that we are sure will orient \nand accelerate action within the United Nations \nframework to obtain agreement on a comprehensive, \neffective, fair and urgent global strategy to limit \nclimate change and adapt to its impacts. \n In a few weeks time, Malta together with the \ninternational community will be celebrating the fortieth \nanniversary of the initiative launched also by Malta on \nthe law of the sea, which, 15 years later, saw the \nadoption of the United Nations Convention, declaring \nthe seabed and its subsoil as the common heritage of \nmankind. Forty years after the launch of the Maltese \ninitiative and 25 years after the adoption of the 1982 \nUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, we \ncan safely state that this concept could also be \nappropriately applied to the global environment, with \nthe knowledge that this priceless possession is owned \nby all human beings on this planet. The environment is \nour common area, our common heritage and as such it \nis our global concern. As States Members of the United \nNations, we must work together to ensure that this \nprecious possession is protected and enhanced. \n The maintenance of a special focus on furthering \ndialogue, peace, stability and prosperity in the \nMediterranean and the Middle East is one of the \nprimary objectives of Malta's foreign policy. Together \nwith other European Union member States as well as \nwith our Mediterranean neighbours, Malta will \ncontinue to join in the calls for creating the necessary \nconditions for strengthening peace and cooperation in \nthe region. Malta's participation in the Euro-\nMediterranean Barcelona Partnership, the Five plus \nFive Summit, the Mediterranean Forum, the Euro-Med \nParliamentary Assembly and the Parliamentary \nAssembly for the Mediterranean complement Malta's \nlong-standing vocation and commitment to, and \nunderstanding of, the Mediterranean region. Malta is \nproud to host the headquarters of the newly established \nParliamentary Assembly of the Mediterranean which \nwill meet for the first time in my country this \nNovember, launching a new dimension of discussions \non Mediterranean affairs. \n Close to Mediterranean affairs in the order of \npriorities is the Middle East, with the Palestinian \nquestion at its core. Malta intends to continue, as it has \ndone for many decades now, to support efforts to bring \nlasting peace in the Middle East. We find the economic \nand social repercussions on the living conditions of the \nPalestinian people worrisome. We remain concerned \nabout the security of the State of Israel and of the \nIsraeli people. We are troubled by the continuing \nviolence between Israelis and Palestinians, as well as \namong Palestinians, violence that continues to claim \ninnocent lives on both sides. Malta will persist in \nworking with the United Nations and the concerned \nparties for a two-State solution to the Israeli-\nPalestinian question. Malta supports the decision of \nPrime Minister Olmert and Palestinian President Abbas \nto meet regularly in their quest for a durable and long-\nlasting solution. We also welcome the appointment of \nformer British Prime Minister Tony Blair as the special \nrepresentative of the Quartet and the initiative of \nPresident Bush to convene a major meeting on the \nissue in November of this year. \n A centrepiece of our Organization is the \nprotection of human rights worldwide. The Human \nRights Council's first year of existence has witnessed \nthe successful conclusion of its institution-building \nprocess. Malta predicts that the universal periodic \nreview will become an effective and a proactive \nmechanism that not only provides an appraisal of \nMember States' human rights records but also \nencourages further achievements. \n Malta welcomes the adoption of the United \nNations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous \nPeoples by the General Assembly (resolution 61/295). \nLinked to the promotion and protection of human \nrights is the right to life. It is Malta\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s belief that the \nabolition of the death penalty would enhance respect \nfor the protection of the right to life. Malta also \ncommends and welcomes the Secretary-General's \ndecision to appoint a Special Adviser on the Prevention \nof Genocide with the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153responsibility to protect\u00e2\u20ac\u009d and \nwith an expanded mandate to cover cases of mass \natrocities. \n This year is the tenth anniversary of the Rome \nStatute which established the International Criminal \nCourt. Malta reiterates its full support and \ncommitment. My country intends to work with the \nUnited Nations and the States parties to the Rome \nStatute, to ensure that the International Criminal Court \nstrengthens its tools in the administration of justice, \nreconciliation and the promotion of the rule of law and \ndemocracy. \n Two weeks ago, the international community \njoined the people of the City of New York to \ncommemorate the sixth anniversary of the terrorist \nattack on the World Trade Centre. While grieving with \nthose who have lost their loved ones and with all the \npeople of the United States, we reaffirm our \ncommitment with States Members of the United \nNations in the fight against terrorism. The completion \nof negotiations on a United Nations comprehensive \nconvention against international terrorism would \ncomplement and strengthen the United Nations Global \nCounter-Terrorism Strategy and the Secretary-General's \nCounter-Terrorism Committee Implementation Task \nForce in addressing the threat of terrorism to global \npeace and security. \n Allow me to touch on another subject. The plight \nof internally displaced persons and those who are \nseeking a better life elsewhere has continued to be one \nof the priority issues of the international community. \nIndeed, Malta has for some time now been witnessing \nthat tragic human migration, caused primarily by \ninternal conflicts, poverty and underdevelopment, and \nresulting in a large influx of asylum seekers arriving \nirregularly on our small island State, which, at 1,200 \npersons per square kilometre, has one of the highest \npopulation densities in the world. The impact on us is \ntherefore enormous. \n I would like to reiterate the calls made by Malta \nin this same Assembly last year for a concerted \nresponse from the international community, as well as \nfrom the United Nations, its institutions and \norganizations, particularly the Office of the United \nNations High Commissioner for Refugees, in \naddressing the problem appropriately and adequately. \nThe response should be undertaken particularly by \ncombating the criminal organizations that are \nfinancially benefiting from illegal immigration while \nthey put the lives of those same immigrants at risk, and \nby providing special assistance to those countries \nwhich, like Malta, carry a disproportionate burden in \naddressing the phenomenon. \n Malta hopes that the High-Level Dialogue on \nInternational Migration and Development held last year \nand the follow-up meetings will continue to find \nsupport in establishing a comprehensive institutional \nand holistic response to international migration and \nsolutions that I hope will be based on the values of \nsolidarity, on respect for human dignity, and on the \nsharing of responsibility. \n In a month's time, the United Nations will be \nhosting the High-level Dialogue on Financing for \nDevelopment with a view to reviewing the six areas of \nthe Monterrey Consensus. The detailed report of the \nSecretary-General recommends a series of policies for \naction by United Nations Member States and other \nstakeholders in advancing and consolidating economic \ngrowth, sustainable development, and social progress. \nAs rightly pointed out by the Secretary-General,  \nThe Monterrey Consensus embodies a major \ncommitment to keeping fully engaged at all \nlevels, and to continuing to build bridges \namong development, finance and trade \norganizations and initiatives (A/62/217, \npara. 127). \n In that context, the roles of the International \nMonetary Fund and the World Bank are crucial. In \naddition, the conclusion of negotiations on the Doha \ndevelopment agenda would significantly contribute to \nthe sustainable development of developing countries. \n In order to ensure that the United Nations is \nbetter equipped to accomplish the mission and \nmandates given to it by its principal organs, the \nongoing process of reform has to be accelerated. The \nWorld Summit in 2005 agreed on a number of reforms, \nand especially on the need to restructure the main \nUnited Nations bodies, including the General \nAssembly, the Economic and Social Council and the \nSecurity Council. Progress has been made, but, I \nsubmit, more progress has still to be achieved. Malta is \nan advocate of a stronger United Nations that is \nrepresentative of the whole membership, transparent in \nits role and actions, and accountable, efficient and \neffective in its management. \n It is also in that context that Malta strongly \nsupports efforts to strengthen the system-wide \ncoherence of the United Nations operational \ndevelopment activities. The reform of the United \nNations and the proposed establishment of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153One \nUnited Nations\u00e2\u20ac\u009d country approach are, in Malta\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s view, \ntwo important pillars on which our Organization can \nappropriately address the new and growing challenges \nit is facing. Member States must give the United \nNations a new face, a stronger meaning and an \ninnovative way of thinking, implementing and acting. \n The United Nations, our Organization, must be \ngiven the ability to respond, the capacity to effectively \ncoordinate and deliver, and the means to truly reflect \nthe aspirations of its whole membership. \n"

        "file_text": "Senegal \nwelcomes Mr. Kerim\u2019s election to the presidency of the \nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-second session. We \ncongratulate him and will support him as he carries out \nhis important responsibilities. His predecessor, Sheikha \nHaya Rashed Al Khalifa of the Kingdom of Bahrain, a \ncountry which is a friend to Senegal, deserves our \ntribute and appreciation for her outstanding \ncontribution, throughout her term of office, to the \nrevitalization of the General Assembly.  \n I also would like to take a moment to \nacknowledge my brothers and sisters in the diaspora, \nwho this year commemorated the 200th anniversary of \nthe abolition of slavery. That shameful and repugnant \ntrade constituted the worst of attacks on the dignity of \nthe human person, as did its continuation, colonization. \nThat is why I would now solemnly warn against \nhorrendous revisionist arguments that attempt in vain \nto falsify history. Colonialism in its design and \nexclusive logic of domination, exploitation and \nenslavement cannot boast of any civilizing mission or \nany positive fallout, because by its very nature it is a \nnegation of the human condition. We must remain \nvigilant and mobilized. In Senegal we say yes, we will \nforgive, but we will not forget or agree to \nmanipulation. \n The high-level discussion we held on \n24 September on the serious issue of climate change \nconfirms once again the terrible threat that is hanging \nover our planet. I therefore welcome the initiative of \nthe Secretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, to put this \ncrucial issue at the very heart of our agenda. We have \nall seen the damage done. Mankind has not been wise. \nWe have, with greater or lesser awareness, destroyed \nthis Earth which God has lent to us. We must beseech \nhis forgiveness. \n Combating climate change demands innovative \nsolutions, which must take into account the special \nsituation of countries that are not significant polluters \nbut which nevertheless suffer from the serious \nconsequences of this phenomenon of the modern age.  \n Senegal is aware of its responsibility to join the \nstruggle against pollution. Therefore, in exploiting our \nmineral resources, we take particular care to restore the \necosystem and to use non-polluting practices and \ntechnologies. We have also prohibited the importation \nof used cars more than five years old and of household \nappliances that pollute. As we have already mentioned, \nwe do not want Africa to be a dumping ground for \noutdated technology from Europe or elsewhere.  \n We are also gradually establishing a policy of \ncombating coastal erosion. On the Atlantic coast, at the \nhigh-tide line, we are building a reinforced concrete \nwall on the granite or clayey base of the continental \nshelf, 2.5 to 3 metres deep by 40 centimetres thick, to \nslow the advance of the sea. Experts say that the wall \nwill stop the sea\u2019s advance for 50 to 100 years. We \nhave done this on an experimental basis, since it is \nvery expensive. The wall costs $2,000 per metre. We \nhave constructed 2 kilometres as an example, to show \nthat it is possible, because we consider it the ultimate \nweapon.  \n We are also launching a project for ports leading \ninto free zones, alternating with tourist complexes, \nalong the Atlantic coast; that is also a way of stopping \nthe advance of the sea. Coastal erosion, from Morocco \nto Mauritania to Senegal, is a threat which the \ninternational community must take very seriously.  \n In the Sahel region, we Africans are also planting \nwhat we call the great green wall, 7,000 kilometres \nlong by 150 kilometres wide from Dakar to Djibouti. \nWe have not waited; each of us in our own country has \nbegun to create the \u201cwall\u201d. The European Union and \nFrance, as Mr. Sarkozy has said, are ready to provide \nus with loans to help with the wall in order to stop the \nencroaching Sahel and the process of desertification.  \n We have also tried to take advantage of the \nbillions of tons of water that, each year during the \nrainy season, fall on the Sahel and are absorbed by the \nearth or flow into the sea. In Senegal we have therefore \nbuilt holding basins in the most low-lying areas, where \nrunoff water accumulates. We have built 250 of these \nbasins; we are walking the walk. The African countries \nmeeting in Bamako have decided to implement this \nprogramme, from Dakar to Djibouti, to create such a \n\u201cwall\u201d to stop the encroaching desert. \n At Senegal\u2019s initiative, non-oil-producing \ncountries have now established an association that we \ncall the Green OPEC, with the aim of protecting our \ninterests. We call on the international community to \ntake on the excess costs with which we have been \nburdened owing to increases in the price of oil. We also \nwant to turn Africa towards producing biofuels. For \nthis reason, I welcome the launch, here in New York on \n2 March 2007, of the International Biofuels Forum. As \nPresident of the African Non-Petroleum Producers \nAssociation, I solemnly request that all of the Forum\u2019s \ninitiatives and participants pursue our common goal of \npromoting alternative energy sources. \n As we pursue economic and social development \nin the South, African countries in particular continue to \nface insurmountable obstacles, such as agricultural \nsubsidies in developed countries. We have already \ntalked about that subject enough. Paradoxically, at the \nsame time that our countries are being forced to open \ntheir markets in the name of free trade, developed \ncountries are subsidizing their own products, so we are \nno longer able to export our products to the developed \nworld. \n As I said at the Group of Eight summit in \nHeiligendamm, Germany, Africa is not poor. It has \nbeen impoverished by unjust trade practices and by the \nexploitation of its resources, which are not bought at \ntheir true price. I wish to add that trade measures are \nnot in themselves enough to wipe out the injustice that \nhas been done. We also need genuine economic \nmeasures. \n If we want to fend off the advance of poverty, we \nmust be creative. But first, what is poverty? It is \ncertainly not an income of less than a dollar a day, the \ndefinition advocated by the United Nations. Poverty, in \nmy view, is a set of unmet needs. Poverty is a leaky \nroof, or not having a roof over one\u2019s head at all. It is \npoor-quality food, no drinking water, no clothing, no \nhealth care, no education or training. Lastly, being poor \nis not having a clean environment. That is what I call \nthe cluster of needs, which is an entire set of needs \nand, as we can see, not just a monetary assessment.  \n What are we in Senegal doing? We have launched \na programme to build housing, called the Jaxxay plan, \nunder the slogan of \u201cone family, one roof\u201d. We build \nnice, affordable homes. For less than $70 a month, \npeople can become homeowners in Senegal. The \ndevelopment in which we are building those houses \nprovides health, education and other services. That is \nhow we are trying to combat poverty. \n Allow me to turn to the digital revolution. We \nbelieve that Africa has a great opportunity, because the \ndigital revolution is happening now. The Internet \ncontains all the knowledge in the world. Africans must \ntherefore have access to the Internet for their training, \ninformation and educational needs and in their \nuniversities and schools. For that reason, as Africa\u2019s \nrepresentative to the World Summit on the Information \nSociety, organized by the International \nTelecommunication Union in Geneva in 2003, I \nproposed a Global Digital Solidarity Fund to bridge the \ndigital gap that separates us from the developed world. \nAfter many ups and downs, the Fund is now supported \nby all of the Members of the United Nations. \nUnfortunately, the majority have not yet formalized \ntheir acceptance of this Fund or have begun paying into \nit. However, all countries in principle are members of \nthis Fund, which seeks to provide computers to Africa \nand to be involved in various programmes, like \nhealthcare telematics.  \n In Geneva we launched what is called the Geneva \nPrinciple, which asks countries and producers of \ninformation and communication technology to \nvoluntarily donate one per cent of the amount of each \ntransaction to the Digital Solidarity Fund.  \n Let us now discuss the Security Council and the \nneed for Africa to have a seat therein, irrespective of \nany question of reform. It is the only continent which \nis not represented in the Security Council, even though \nit has been said that 70 per cent of the Council\u2019s \nbusiness involves Africa. \n Today, Senegal is at peace   I shall not dwell on \nthis   and we are trying to provide the materials and \nthe personnel needed for Darfur. Senegal is increasing \nits contingent from 150 to 1,600 and is also providing \nall the police for the operation conducted by the \nAfrican Union and the United Nations.  \n The Middle East situation still gives serious \nconcern and I wish to reconfirm Senegal\u2019s unwavering \nsupport for the just cause of the Palestinian people in \ntheir legitimate quest for a viable State. We support all \nefforts to that end.  \n Remembering the last two wars, we must really \ntry to achieve peace. Peace is not just the absence of \nwar as somebody said this morning. We must combat \nwar in the minds of men, particularly young people.  \n In March 2008, Senegal will have the honour of \nhosting the eleventh Islamic Summit Conference. It is, \ntherefore, my deepest hope that we will make progress \ntowards achieving peace in accordance with our \nreligion and the Qur\u2019an. I have already proposed an \nIslamic-Christian dialogue, which would be a first step \ntowards dialogue among peoples. We believe that if the \nleaders of the world meet together and make a real \nappeal for tolerance as a legacy from this generation to \nfuture generations, then we will have taken a step \nforwards towards understanding among the various \nreligions. This is absolutely essential to the \nestablishment of peace.  \n We know that Organization of Petroleum \nExporting Countries (OPEC) oligopoly increases the \nprice of oil as it wishes by manipulating supply   I \nknow this because I am an economist. I realize that it is \nthe law of the market, but the rest of us suffer from it. I \npropose that whenever OPEC increases the price of oil, \nit voluntarily add 2 per cent, but not as a tax: 1 per cent \nto combat poverty and 1 per cent to combat \nenvironmental degradation. Out of the $200 million of \nprofits from Africa, this would be at least $40 million \nand you won\u2019t feel it more than you do just now, \nbecause a barrel which cost $29 in December 2003 \nnow costs over $81. \n"

We declare our total support for the \nOrganization's efforts to meet the multiple \nhumanitarian, social, peace and security and \ndevelopment challenges confronting our world today.  \n At the outset, may I, on behalf of the Government \nand the People of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, \ncongratulate Mr. Kerim and his country, the Republic \nof Macedonia, on his election as President of the \nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-second session. I assure \nhim of the full support and cooperation of the Nigerian \ndelegation as he leads the deliberations of the session.  \n I also wish to extend my profound appreciation to \nhis predecessor, Her Excellency Ms. Haya Rashed Al \nKhalifa, for the commitment and dedication with which \nshe presided over the affairs of the sixty-first session. \n I formally extend my sincere congratulations to \nMr. Ban Ki-moon on his assumption of office as \nSecretary-General. I commend him for his resolute \nleadership and his determination to carry through the \nrequisite reform of the United Nations system and \nassure him of the full support of the Nigerian \nGovernment.  \n I also pay tribute to the previous Secretary-\nGeneral, Mr. Kofi Annan, for the commitment, \ndiligence and courage with which he piloted the affairs \nof the United Nations during the past 10 years. We are \nproud of the enormous contributions made to this \nOrganization by that illustrious son of Africa.  \n Since coming into office, my Administration has \nanchored its pursuit of a re-energized, stable and \nprosperous Nigeria on the fundamental principles of \ndemocracy, good governance, free enterprise and the \nrule of law. Those are worthy principles which Nigeria \nshares with the United Nations family.  \n As a main theme of this session's general debate, \n\\\"Responding to climate change\\\"\u009d is most appropriate. \nthe African continent is particularly vulnerable to the \nimpact of climate change. In our collective \ndetermination to meet this challenge, African leaders at \nthe Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the \nAfrican Union (AU), which met in Addis Ababa last \nJanuary, decided to integrate climate change issues into \nall sustainable development initiatives at the national \nand regional levels.  \n Nigeria reiterates its commitment to the United \nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change. \nWhile applauding the successful outcome of the high-\nlevel event on climate change that was held here two \ndays ago, on 24 September, we affirm that much more \nneeds to be done.  \n It has been seven years since world leaders met in \nthis Hall for the Millennium Assembly and committed \nthemselves to ridding Africa of its most pressing \nsocioeconomic and political challenges in order to \nallow the continent move with the rest of the world. \nWhile tangible progress has been made in a few areas, \nthe continent is still bedevilled by great challenges.  \n The continued festering of the Darfur crisis \nremains a blight on the collective conscience of the \ninternational community, one which the Assembly \nneeds to address with the utmost urgency. The \nhumanitarian crisis has reached a critical level. The \nAbuja Peace Agreement, which Nigeria helped to \nfacilitate, remains the reference point for a \ncomprehensive settlement of the crisis. However, the \nlack of full implementation of the Agreement raises \nserious cause for concern, and we call on all parties to \nrespect their commitments and help drive the peace \nprocess forward. We continue to support the process \nand reaffirm our support for the African Union \u00e2\u20ac\u201d \nUnited Nations hybrid force in the Sudan.  \n It is imperative that the concerted fight against \nthe HIV/AIDS pandemic, malaria, tuberculosis and \nrelated diseases not lose momentum. At the national \nlevel, we in Nigeria have consistently taken concrete \nmeasures to raise awareness of HIV/AIDS and to \nincrease funding for the National Action Committee on \nAIDS. We appreciate the financial and material \nassistance from our development partners in this \nregard, but our continent cries out for even more \nintensified collective efforts at ridding Africa of this \nand other pandemics.  \n Two years ago, we appraised our performance \nagainst the set targets of the Millennium Development \nGoals (MDGs) and realized that unless concrete and \nmore determined actions were taken, the overarching \naim of meeting the 2015 targets of poverty eradication \nwould remain a fantasy. We recognize that the primary \nresponsibility for social and economic development \nrests mostly with individual States. Within the ambit of \nthe African Union's New Partnership for Africa's \nDevelopment, the nations of Africa are practically \nfacing up to the continent's economic and \nsociopolitical development challenges through the \nadoption and engendering of a new political culture \nthat will be conducive to long-term development.  \n Through such initiatives as the African Union's \nAfrican Peer Review Mechanism, our programme of \nself-monitoring and self-assessment, as well as the \ninstitutionalization of the ideals of democracy and \ngood governance, Africa has clearly defined an assured \ncourse to economic regeneration and political stability. \nWhat Africa seeks from the international \ncommunity is genuine partnership for economic \ndevelopment. This should be manifested in a global \neconomic system predicated on fairness, justice and \nequity, one that ensures fair trade terms and recognizes \nthe centrality of mutuality in prosperity. More \nspecifically, Africa requires massive and focused \nforeign investment in the development of critical \ninfrastructure across the continent. \n Let me say that we in Nigeria are wholly \ncommitted to the United Nations Global Counter-\nTerrorism Strategy (resolution 60/288) in the fight \nagainst international terrorism. As a follow-up to that \ncommitment, Nigeria has established four counter-\nterrorism centres in the country, in addition to the \nNigerian Financial Intelligence Unit, which, together \nwith the Central Bank of Nigeria, monitors banking \ntransactions as part of the mechanism to locate and \nterminate the illegal transfer of funds for terrorist and \nother criminal acts, including money laundering. \nNigeria reiterates its condemnation of all acts of \nterrorism and calls upon the international community \nto muster the political will necessary to confront and \ncheck this menace. \n Nigeria affirms its abiding faith in the ideals and \nobjectives of the United Nations. We believe that a \nstrengthened and restructured United Nations would be \nbest placed to address the complex challenges facing \nour world today. In that regard, my delegation will \ncontinue to collaborate with other Member States to \npress for comprehensive reform of the United Nations \nsystem, including the much-desired expansion of the \nSecurity Council in both the permanent and non-\npermanent categories in order to reflect the realities of \ntoday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s world. The situation whereby Africa is totally \nexcluded from permanent membership of the Council \nis unfair and untenable and must be rectified. \n The challenges that confront our world today call \nfor renewed purpose, renewed resolve, renewed \ncourage and renewed respect for human dignity. \nPosterity beckons us to a real test of our sense of duty. \nWe cannot afford to fail that test. I assure the Assembly \nthat Nigeria will continue to support the United \nNations in our collective aspirations for a safer, fairer, \nmore just and more prosperous world. \n"

        "file_text": "Let me at the outset \ncongratulate Mr. Kerim on his election as President of \nthe General Assembly at its sixty-second session and \nassure him of the cooperation of the Dominica \ndelegation throughout this session. I commend his \npredecessor, Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa, for her \nleadership during the sixty-first session of the General \nAssembly. \n I also wish to congratulate Secretary-General Ban \nKi-moon on his election. I wish him a long and \nsuccessful tenure, and hope that under his leadership \nthe United Nations will give greater attention to the \nplight of the world\u2019s small island developing States, \nwhich are among the most vulnerable to climate \nchange, natural disasters and a rise in sea levels. \n In the interdependent world which we live in \ntoday, the promotion of the fundamental values of \npeace, democracy, human rights and development \ndepends on strong multilateral institutions. Dominica \nbelieves that it is only a strong United Nations, \nsensitive to the variable geometry of its own complex \nconstruction, that can serve as the foundation of our \nshared ambitions for effective multilateralism and a \nrules-based international order. \n The experience of the past decade has taught us \none important lesson: global challenges require global \nresponses, and those challenges can receive the \nappropriate responses only through the framework of \nmultilateral action. The United Nations is the \nundisputed centre for multilateralism, and we must all \ndemonstrate unwavering commitment to vesting in the \nUnited Nations the authority and to offering it the \nspace to undertake effective interventions in the \ninterest of the preservation of human life, human \nrights, peace, justice, democracy and the rule of law. \n More than ever, we need a United Nations which \nis not only guided by the principles that oversaw its \ncreation, but capable of adapting to the growing \nchallenges of today\u2019s globalized world. We need an \neffective United Nations that will place the highest \npriority on development, while having the capacity to \nrespond to the various crises that threaten international \npeace and security. \n The work of the international community in \npoverty alleviation must be accelerated as the chasm \nbetween the rich and the poor continues to widen. In \nthat connection, the importance of achieving the \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) by 2015 is \ncritical. We must therefore rededicate ourselves to the \nimplementation of the actions called for in the United \nNations Decade for the Eradication of Poverty and in \nrelevant resolutions of the General Assembly, including \nthose related to the right to development, the \nalleviation of burdensome debt, and fair and equitable \ntrading rules.  \n Climate change is the most pressing \nenvironmental problem humankind has ever faced. It \nseriously threatens human security and will undermine \nour ability to achieve the MDGs. Unless there is a \nglobal and collective response, this planet will become \nunlivable for most of us. \n Small island developing States are most \nvulnerable to the effects of climate change, even \nthough they contribute the least to emissions of \ngreenhouse gases. Sea-level rise threatens the \nterritorial existence of small island developing States, \nand low-lying islands in the Indian Ocean, the Pacific \nand the Caribbean may simply disappear in the next 30 \nyears or less as the melting of ice caps and mountain \nglaciers on all continents becomes the new reality of \nunchecked climate change. The disappearance of \nbeaches and coastal tourism plants and the loss of \ncoastal communication infrastructure would devastate \nthe tourism economy of most island States. Other \nregions are also beginning to experience the effects of \nthose climatic changes, with persistent conditions of \ndrought followed by devastating flooding. \n Rising sea temperature is causing death and the \nbleaching of coral reefs, which in turn are impacting \nnegatively on fish stocks, the major protein source of \nisland States. It is estimated that a one-degree increase \nin sea temperature over pre-industrial levels will lead \nto significant loss of tuna and dolphin stocks for a large \nnumber of island States. \n Rising sea temperature also provides a fertile \nground for the development of tropical storms and \nhurricanes, which affect the Caribbean region every \nyear. Climate change is contributing to the frequency \nand severity of those storms. We are currently in the \nmidst of the 2007 hurricane season and, over a two-\nweek period in the month of August, the Caribbean \nregion suffered the onslaught of two category-5 \nhurricanes, Dean and Felix. Those storms seriously \naffected Dominica, Guadeloupe, Martinique, Saint \nLucia, Jamaica, Belize, Honduras, Nicaragua and \nMexico. We are only half-way through this hurricane \nseason, which is forecast to have seven category-5 \nhurricanes. It may very well be that the worst is yet to \ncome. \n My own country, Dominica, was severely \nbattered by Hurricane Dean, the third-worst hurricane \nto make landfall in the Caribbean since 1850. After 15 \nhours of buffeting by winds of 110 miles per hour and \ncontinuous rainfall, our agricultural economy was \ndestroyed, our infrastructure devastated by swollen \nrivers and numerous landslides, and our housing stock \nseriously affected. We appreciate greatly the solidarity \nof a number of countries, regional and extra-regional, \nand the generous support they provided in the \nimmediate aftermath, but now comes the serious \nchallenge of reconstruction, which is estimated to cost \nover a $100 million. \nThe high-level event on climate change helped to \nunderscore that doing nothing about climate change \nwill have enormous negative implications for all \ncountries, and more particularly for the least developed \ncountries and small island developing States. The pace \nof climate change negotiations is disconcertingly slow \nbecause it is not adequately responsive to the urgency \ndictated by science. \n We urge all the nations of the world to come to \nBali in December prepared to advance the multilateral \nnegotiations. A demonstration of collective political \nwill and commitment to determined action will be \ncritical if we are to reach agreement on a fair, effective, \nflexible and inclusive climate regime under the United \nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change \nand its Kyoto Protocol. Developed countries and the \nmore advanced developing countries must make a \ngreater effort to do more and to be considerate of the \nemergency situation facing the small island States. \n We continue to stress that the vulnerable situation \nof the small island developing States must be addressed \nthrough the vigorous implementation of the actions \ncalled for in the Mauritius Strategy for the Further \nImplementation of the Programme of Action for the \nSustainable Development of Small Island Developing \nStates. \n We call for the full implementation of the \nmandates contained in the Millennium Declaration, in \nparticular the commitments to development and \npoverty eradication, the protection of the common \nenvironment, and the realization of human rights, \ndemocracy and good governance. As a follow-up to the \nreform commitments emanating from the 2005 \nSummit, we welcome the reports of the High-level \nPanel and of the Secretary-General on system-wide \ncoherence, and we hope for the strengthened capacity \nof the United Nations in development, humanitarian \nassistance and the environment. \n The adoption of the Global Counter-Terrorism \nStrategy by the General Assembly was an important \nachievement. It will be meaningless, however, if we do \nnot address its full implementation. Small States like \nDominica and the rest of the States members of the \nOrganization of the Eastern Caribbean States must be \nassisted to meet the various obligations required by the \nimplementation of the counter-terrorism conventions. \n As a country with an indigenous Kalinago \npopulation, Dominica is proud to have played a role in \nthe negotiation process that led to the recent adoption \nof the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of \nIndigenous People, and we call on those Member \nStates that have not yet done so to embrace the \nDeclaration. \n Dominica applauds the African Union for its \nunwavering efforts towards the maintenance of peace \nand security on the African continent, and we are \nsupportive of the long-term vision of an African peace \nand security architecture. In that context, Dominica \nwelcomes the creation of the African Union-United \nNations Hybrid Operation in Darfur, which we hope \nwill contribute to the political resolution of the conflict \nthere and bring to an end its tragic humanitarian \nconsequences in the Sudan and the neighbouring \nStates. \n In our region, we welcome the continuing \nengagement of the United Nations and the \nOrganization of American States in Haiti. We urge the \nUnited Nations to make the commitment to going \nbeyond the current engagement through the United \nNations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH) to \na longer-term engagement that will bring sustainable \neconomic stability and development to Haiti. We \nappreciate the important role of Brazil and the other \nMember States that are participating in MINUSTAH, \nbut we must be careful not to see those interventions as \nthe emergency response of an international fire brigade \nquickly extinguishing political conflagrations and \nremaining only long enough to dampen the embers of \nrenewed conflict. \n Haiti\u2019s problems stem from underdevelopment \nand extensive periods of dictatorship. It is in \ndemocracy and development, therefore, that the \nsolutions for Haiti lie. A stable and prosperous Haiti \nwill significantly strengthen the Caribbean Community \nand contribute meaningfully to the process of \ndeepening regional integration and the attendant march \ntowards the Caribbean single market and economy. \n Recent violent upheavals in Myanmar are not \nencouraging for the hoped-for resolution of the long-\nstanding difficulties afflicting that country in its \ntransition to democracy. We urge influential countries \nin South-East Asia that have friendly relations with the \nmilitary regime in Rangoon to use their good offices in \nsupport of the United Nations effort to bring about a \npolitical solution and national reconciliation among all \nconcerned parties. \nThe continued presence of the Republic of \nFrance, the Kingdom of the Netherlands, the United \nKingdom and the United States of America in the \nCaribbean should provide an opportunity for the \nstrategic engagement of those metropoles, Canada and \nSpain with the independent Caribbean States to create \nin the Caribbean a zone of peace, security and \nprosperity, complementing the invaluable development \nassistance of the People\u2019s Republic of China, the \nRepublic of Cuba, the Bolivarian Republic of \nVenezuela, Japan and the European Union. \n I wish to underscore the vital importance of a fair \nglobal trading system as the only way for small States \nto survive in this globalized world. We do not want to \ndepend on fast-disappearing development assistance. \nWe want to have the assurance that we will be able to \ntrade the goods and services we produce on terms and \nconditions that will enable us to build our economies \nand to provide employment for our citizens. That is \nwhy we continue to call for the earliest possible \nconclusion of the Doha Development Round of the \nWorld Trade Organization (WTO). We urge the major \ntrading nations to demonstrate a spirit of compromise \nand constructiveness, backed by a genuine will to \ncommit to a balanced agreement that embraces the \nprinciple of special and differential treatment for small \nisland developing States and places development at the \ncentre of any final agreement. \n Dominica has made important progress in its \nquest to adapt to the challenges of trade liberalization \nand its attendant preference erosion. Those changing \nterms of trade have progressively devastated our \nprimary source of foreign exchange earnings   the \nexport of bananas. That persistent assault on our \nbanana exports to the European Union through \nunrelenting recourse to the WTO dispute settlement \nbody has impacted negatively on our overall economy. \nAs a result, we have had to undergo a structural \nadjustment programme and undertake stringent fiscal \nmeasures that have required sacrifices by the \npopulation as a whole in order to stabilize the \ndeteriorating fiscal and economic position. We have \nturned the corner and returned to a period of sustained \neconomic growth, and are moving steadily to the \ndiversification of our economy. The impact of \nHurricane Dean so soon afterwards will therefore be \ndoubly devastating. \n We are working towards a new energy regime \nthat will significantly reduce our dependence on fossil \nfuels for our energy needs and slow the haemorrhaging \nof scarce foreign exchange earnings to meet the ever-\nrising cost of petroleum products. We plan to increase \nour current 40-per cent renewable energy generation \nfrom hydropower through initiatives for geothermal \nenergy development and further expansion of \nhydropower. We will need the continuing partnership \nof the development partners to remain on that path \ntowards successful economic transformation. \n May I call on the United Nations once more to \nrededicate itself to making development the highest \npriority of this body. Together, the developed countries \nand the developing countries must work in a \ncooperative manner to address the challenges of \nclimate change and sustainable development. We can \nwork together to defeat poverty and underdevelopment \nand to give hope and dignity to all peoples. To achieve \nthat, we must implement the decisions that we take \nhere in this General Assembly every year. The time for \naction is now. \n"

        "file_text": "Sir, allow me to \ncongratulate the President on his unanimous election to \npreside over the General Assembly at its sixty-second \nsession. We are confident that he will discharge the \nhigh responsibility of his office with the wisdom, skill \nand experience for which he is renowned. \n I also wish to commend Ambassador Sheikha \nHaya Rashed Al-Khalifa, who acquitted herself very \nwell in the management of the General Assembly at its \nsixty-first session. \n I equally wish to express our appreciation to the \nSecretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon, \nfor taking up challenging issues facing humanity with \ncourage and determination. \n The world needs a stronger United Nations and \neffective multilateralism that can help humanity to \nrespond in a timely and effective way to global \nchallenges. Namibia regards climate change as one of \nthe urgent challenges facing humanity today. There is \nan overwhelming body of scientific evidence that \npoints to the urgency and gravity of climate change. \nClimate change is a global issue with serious \nimplications for economic growth, sustainable \ndevelopment and the achievement of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals. \n Climate change is a present-day reality that \nadversely affects the lives of many people. The \ninternational community has to live up to its \ncommitment to provide resources to developing \ncountries in order that they may adapt to the effects of \nclimate change. By the same token, compulsory targets \nmust be set for the reduction of greenhouse gas \nemissions. \n Namibia is not happy with the rate at which \ninvestments are being made in the development of \nrenewable and clean energy sources. I call upon the \nprivate sector to join hands with Governments to \ndevelop and apply technologies that can mitigate \nclimate change. Sir, I assure you of Namibia\u2019s \ncommitment to act in consort with other Member \nStates to solve this problem through the establishment \nof concrete and ambitious goals to be implemented \nover an agreed period. All countries have a \nresponsibility to act according to their common but \ndifferentiated responsibilities and respective \ncapabilities. \n Namibia would like to see the process for the \nreform of the United Nations expedited. The \nimportance of a stronger and effective United Nations, \ncapable of delivering its mandate, cannot be \noveremphasized. This, among other things, would \ninvolve the revitalization and reaffirmation of the \nauthority of the General Assembly as the chief \ndeliberative, policymaking and representative organ of \nthe United Nations. \n Namibia is pleased with the enhanced role of the \nEconomic and Social Council. I believe that it is well \npositioned to shape the overall development agenda, to \ndeal effectively with economic and social issues and to \nmobilize international efforts for the protection of the \nenvironment. \n We believe that the Security Council should be \nmade more democratic and transparent in its \ncomposition and working methods. All Member States, \nboth big and small, should have a meaningful stake in \nit. Namibia appreciates the efforts of the President of \nthe General Assembly at its sixty-first session to move \nthe reform process forward. The Security Council has \ngreat significance for Africa, since a major part of its \nagenda currently concerns peace and security issues on \nthat continent. In 2006, for example, 42 out of a total \nof 87 resolutions adopted by the Security Council dealt \nwith Africa. However, Africa has only three \nnon-permanent seats on the Council. \n I wish to reiterate Namibia\u2019s strong support for \nthe common African position as contained in the \nEzulwini consensus and in the Sirte Declaration. The \nneed for Africa to be equitably represented in the \nCouncil, with all the privileges associated with \nmembership, remains a priority for us. The challenge in \nthe immediate future would therefore be to begin a \ngenuine intergovernmental negotiation process, based \non the principle of justice and fairness for all. \n The achievement of the Millennium Development \nGoals (MDGs) and other internationally agreed \ncommitments stand central to global economic stability \nand prosperity. The highest priority should be our \ncollective commitment to sustainable socioeconomic \ndevelopment on a global scale. I therefore wish to \nexpress my delegation\u2019s appreciation for the \nMillennium Development Goals Report 2007, which \nwe find very useful as a summary of what has been \nachieved so far. \n Namibia is concerned, however, that the results \nare slow and uneven. We wish to underline what is \nstated on page 4 of the report: \u201cthat the MDGs will be \nattained only if concerted additional action is taken \nimmediately and sustained until 2015\u201d. All \nstakeholders need to fulfil, in their entirety, the \ncommitments they made in the Millennium Declaration \nand their subsequent pronouncements. It is, therefore, \nimportant that Governments and institutions in the \neconomically advanced countries offer genuine \npartnership by providing new and additional resources \ncommensurate with the commitments made in line with \nthe MDGs. \n Namibia is classified as a lower middle-income \ncountry. It ranks number 126 out of 177 countries on \nthe Human Development Index, as it still bears the \nlegacy of social and economic inequalities inherited \nfrom its colonial past. Inequality in the distribution of \nincome and assets in Namibia is among the highest in \nthe world. Nevertheless, Namibia has made progress in \nthe provision of health, education and other critical \nservices for the majority of the population, and we are \non course to meet a number of the MDGs. \n Indeed, we face severe difficulty in responding to \na combination of the devastating HIV/AIDS pandemic, \nhigh levels of food insecurity and poverty at the \nhousehold level. This situation is compounded by \ndeclining international aid to Namibia because of its \nclassification as a lower middle-income country. I once \nagain call upon the international community to increase \nits support to Namibia, including market access and \naccess to financial sources, in the form of targeted \nofficial development assistance, concessional loans and \ninvestment flows. \n Namibia applauds the Joint Communiqu\u00e9 agreed \nto by the United Nations Security Council and the \nAfrican Union (AU) Peace and Security Council as a \nstep in the right direction. There is a need for more \nstructured and formalized cooperation between the two \nbodies on issues of peace and security in Africa. Such \ncooperation should also include the areas of financing, \nlogistics, technology and training. \n The right of peoples to self-determination is a \nfundamental human right that is enshrined in the \nCharter of the United Nations. It is sad that, seven \nyears into the twenty-first century, colonialism is still \nwith us, posing a serious challenge to this Organization \nand humanity at large. My delegation has raised its \nvoice repeatedly in this Assembly by calling for the \nrealization of the inalienable rights of the people of \nWestern Sahara to self-determination. The international \ncommunity has an obligation to assist the people of \nWestern Sahara in their quest for freedom and \nindependence. Namibia, therefore, calls for the \nimmediate and unconditional implementation of the \nUnited Nations Settlement Plan for Western Sahara, \nand all resolutions of the Security Council and the \nGeneral Assembly, with the aim of holding a free and \nfair referendum in Western Sahara. \n Similarly, Namibia is deeply concerned about the \ncontinuous suffering of the people of Palestine under \nIsraeli occupation. We wish to reaffirm our full and \nunequivocal support for the inalienable rights of the \nPalestinian people to self-determination, including \ntheir right to return to their land. I reiterate our appeal \nto the parties to resume the peace process on the basis \nof international law and all the relevant United Nations \nresolutions. To this end, the United Nations has a \nresponsibility to assist the process. \n My delegation reiterates its call for an \nunconditional end to the economic, commercial and \nfinancial blockade imposed by the United States of \nAmerica against Cuba. We believe that the blockade is \nnot only against international law, but that it is also \npolitically unjustifiable and undemocratic. Its \nextraterritorial nature impedes free trade and economic \ndevelopment. We urge the Government of the United \nStates of America to heed the call of the international \ncommunity and to implement the resolutions of the \nGeneral Assembly that call for an end to the blockade. \n Let us commit ourselves, once again, during this \nsession of the General Assembly, to address effectively \nthe challenges we face, to save humanity from \ncatastrophe and to make the earth a common place for \nall, where all will live in peace and security. \n"

        "file_text": "I am pleased and  grateful to the Almighty to have the opportunity once \nagain to attend this important universal forum. \n In the present tumultuous world, loud outcries, \nthreats and tensions predominate. The big Powers are \nunable to solve present problems, and mistrust in \nregional and international arenas is on the rise. The \npsychological security of societies is targeted by an \nonslaught of political and propaganda designs; \ndisappointment prevails with regard to the efficacy of \nthe policies and actions of the international \norganizations in the establishment of durable peace and \nsecurity, and the protection of human rights is being \nweakened. I plan to touch upon and explain the roots of \nand solutions to these predicaments and some of the \nprincipal challenges facing our world. I will also speak \nto you about the need to remedy the present situation, \nabout prospects for a brighter and a more hopeful \nfuture and about the appearance of the sublime, about \nbeauty, compassion and generosity, about justice and \nthe blossoming of all God-given human talents and \nabout the prominence of faith in God and the \nrealization of the promise of God. I will then submit \nfor your judgement the question of Iran\u2019s nuclear \nprogramme as a yardstick for the measurement of \nhonesty, efficacy, steadfastness and accomplishment. In \nthe closing part of my statement, I will offer my \nproposals. \n As you are all aware, mankind is currently facing \nimportant, numerous and diverse challenges. I will \nrefer to some of them. \n First, organized attempts to destroy the institution \nof family and to weaken the status of women. Family is \nthe most sacred and valuable human institution. It is \nthe centre of the purest mutual love and affection \nbetween mothers, fathers and children, provides a safe \nenvironment for the nurturing of human generations \nand serves as a fertile ground for the blossoming of \ntalent and compassion. This institution has been \nrespected in all times by all peoples, religions and \ncultures. Today we are witnessing an organized attack \nby the enemies and plunderers of humanity, who are \ntrying to destroy this noble institution by promoting \nlewdness and violence and by crossing the boundaries \nof chastity and decency. \n Womanhood, as the manifestation of divine \nbeauty and supreme kindness, affection and purity, has \nbeen heavily exploited in recent decades by the holders \nof power and the owners of media and wealth. In some \nsocieties, womanhood has been reduced to a mere \ninstrument of publicity, and all the boundaries and \nprotective shields of chastity, purity and beauty have \nbeen trampled. That is a colossal betrayal of human \nsociety and of future generations, and it is an \nirreparable blow to the pillar of social coherence, the \nfamily. \n I now turn to the issues of widespread violations \nof human rights, terrorism and occupation. \nUnfortunately, human rights are being extensively \nviolated by certain Powers   especially those who \npretend to be their exclusive advocates. Setting up \nsecret prisons, abducting persons, carrying out trials \nand secret punishments without any regard for due \nprocess, conducting extensive tapping of telephone \nconversations, intercepting private mail and issuing \nfrequent summonses to appear at police and security \ncentres have become commonplace and prevalent. \nThese Powers prosecute scientists and historians for \nstating their opinions on important global issues. \n They use various pretexts to occupy sovereign \nStates and cause insecurity and division, and then use \nthe prevailing situation as an excuse to continue their \noccupation. For more than 60 years, Palestine, as \ncompensation for the loss that it incurred during the \nwar in Europe, has been under the occupation of the \nillegal Zionist regime. The Palestinian people have \nbeen displaced, are under heavy military pressure or \neconomic siege or are incarcerated under abhorrent \nconditions. The occupiers are protected and praised, \nwhile the innocent Palestinians are subjected to \npolitical, military and propaganda onslaughts. The \npeople of Palestine are deprived of water, electricity \nand medicine for the sin of asking for freedom, and the \nGovernment that was freely elected by the people is \ntargeted. Terrorists are being organized to attack the \nlives and property of people with the blessings of the \npoliticians and military officials of the great Powers. \n The brutal Zionists carry out targeted \nassassinations of Palestinians in their homes and cities, \nand terrorists are decorated with medals of peace and \nreceive support from the great Powers. On the other \nhand, they attract a number of Jews from various parts \nof the world by using false propaganda and by \npromising to provide them with welfare, jobs and food, \nand then settle them in the occupied territories, \nexposing them to the harshest restrictions, \npsychological pressures and constant threats. They \nprevent these people from returning to their homelands \nand, by coercion and propaganda, incite them to \nmalevolence towards the indigenous Palestinian \npeople. \n Iraq was occupied under the pretext of \noverthrowing a dictator and the existence of weapons \nof mass destruction. The Iraqi dictator, who had been \nsupported by the same occupiers, was disposed of, and \nno weapons of mass destruction were discovered, but \nthe occupation continues under different pretexts. No \nday passes by without people being killed, wounded or \ndisplaced, and the occupiers not only refuse to be \naccountable for and ashamed of their military \nadventure, but speak in a report of a new market for \ntheir armaments as a result of it. They even oppose the \nConstitution, the National Assembly and the \nGovernment established by the vote of the people, \nwhile not even having the courage to declare their \ndefeat and to leave Iraq. \n Unfortunately, we are witnessing the bitter truth \nthat some Powers do not value any nation or human \nbeing and that the only things that matter to them are \nthemselves and their political parties and groups. In \ntheir view, human rights amount to profits for their \ncompanies and their friends. The rights and the dignity \nof American people are also being sacrificed for the \nselfish desires of those holding power. \n I shall now discuss aggressions against \nindigenous cultures and national values. Culture is the \nmanifestation of identity, the key to the survival of \nnations and the foundation for their interaction with \nothers. In an organized movement, indigenous cultures \nthat are messengers of monotheism, love and fraternity \nare being subjected to broad and destructive \naggressions. National customs and values are being \nhumiliated, and the self-esteem and character of \nnations are being ridiculed and defamed. The purpose \nis to promote blind emulation, consumerism, \nscepticism towards God and human values and the \nplundering of the peoples\u2019 wealth by great Powers. \n With regard to poverty, illiteracy, health-care \nissues and the gap between the rich and the poor, I \nshould like to say that, while a major part of the natural \nenvironment in Asia, Africa and Latin America is being \nplundered by the political and economic domination of \ncertain Powers, the situation of poverty and deprivation \nis alarming.  \n Let me draw the attention of the Assembly to \nsome data issued by the United Nations. Every day, \nnearly 800 million people go to bed hungry and about \n980 million suffer from absolute poverty, having less \nthan a dollar a day in purchasing power. People in \n31 countries   equivalent to 9 per cent of the world\u2019s \npopulation   have an average life expectancy of \n46 years, which is 32 years fewer than the average in \ndeveloped countries. The gap between the rich and the \npoor in some parts of the world has increased by \n40 times. In many countries, the majority of the people \nare deprived of access to education and schooling. In \ndeveloping countries, the rate of maternal mortality \nduring pregnancy is 450 per 100,000; that figure is 7 in \nthe richer nations. The infant mortality rate is 59 per \n1,000 live births for the developing countries and 6 for \nthe richer nations. One third of the deaths throughout \nthe world   or 50,000 deaths daily   result from \npoverty. I believe that those data clearly demonstrate \nthe tragic situation dominating economic interactions \nin the world. \n Next, I shall take up the forsaking of noble values \nand the promotion of deception and lies. Some Powers \nsacrifice all human values, including honesty, purity \nand trust, for the advancement of their goals. They \npropagate scepticism and deception in the relations \nbetween States and peoples. They lie openly, level \nbaseless charges against others, act in contradiction to \nlegal norms and damage the atmosphere of trust and \nfriendship. In their relations with others, they openly \nabandon morality and noble values, forsaking justice, \nrespect for others, love, affection and honesty for \nselfishness, supremacy, enmity and imposition. They \nsacrifice all the good things of life, including the \nsublime, for their own greed. \n I now turn to violations of rules of international \nlaw and disrespect for commitments. Some, who \nthemselves have drafted international law, openly and \neasily violate it and apply discriminatory policies and \ndouble standards to others. Having drafted \ndisarmament regulations, they daily test and stockpile \nnew generations of lethal weapons. Having helped to \nframe the Charter of the United Nations, they show \ndisrespect for the right of sovereign nations to self-\ndetermination and independence. They conveniently \nabrogate their formal treaties and do not yield to laws \nconcerning protection of the environment. Most of the \nviolations of international obligations are committed \nby a few global Powers. \n I will now talk about an escalation of threats and \nthe arms race. Some Powers, whenever their logic fails, \nsimply use the language of threats. The huge arms race \ncasts its menacing shadow over the entire globe. The \nnations of Europe were the victims of two world wars \nand a number of other devastating conflicts and were \nsubjected to the consequences of the cold war for many \ndecades. Today, Europeans are living under threat and \ntheir interests, security and lands are endangered \nbecause of the arms race carried on by certain big \nPowers. \n A bullying Power arrogates to itself the right to \nset up a missile system, poisons the life of the peoples \nof a continent and lays the ground for an arms race. \nSome rulers who superficially appear to be powerful \nactually believe that the tools they have at hand can be \nused at any time and for any purpose and, \nconsequently, threaten others and cast the shadow of \ninsecurity over nations and regions. \n International organizations and mechanisms \nclearly lack the capacity to overcome problems and \nchallenges, to put in place fair and just relations and \npeace, fraternity and security. There is hardly a \nGovernment or nation that really trusts these \nmechanisms to secure its rights or defend its \nindependence, territorial integrity and national \ninterests. \n There are many more challenges besides the ones \nI have enumerated. I know that I could have introduced \nmore had I wanted to touch upon them, but I chose to \nconfine myself to the ones I have stated. Now, the \nimportant and decisive question concerns the roots and \ncauses of these challenges. A scientific and careful \nanalysis shows that two fundamental factors account \nfor the present situation. Without a doubt, the first \nfactor is the relations arising from the consequences of \nthe Second World War. The victors of the war drew the \nroad map for global domination and formulated their \npolicies on the basis not of justice but of safeguarding \nthe interests of the victors over the vanquished nations. \nTherefore, for 60 years now, mechanisms arising from \nthis approach and related policies have been incapable \nof finding just solutions for global problems. Some big \nPowers still behave like the victors of the World War \nand regard other States and nations, even those that had \nnothing to do with the war, as the vanquished. They \nhumiliate other nations and make extortionate \ndemands. Their condescending ways are reminiscent of \nmedieval times and the old lord-serf relationship. They \nbelieve that they should have more rights than others \nand that they are not accountable to any international \norganization. \n Unfortunately, among all the ineffective bodies, \nthe United Nations Security Council ranks first; owing \nto circumstances in which some Powers with an \nexclusive and special right to the veto in the Security \nCouncil act as prosecutor, judge and executioner. It is \nnatural that countries that have been subjected to those \nPowers\u2019 infringements of their rights have no hope of \ngetting what they deserve from the Council. \n Regrettably, humanity has witnessed that in all \nlong wars   like the Korean and Viet Nam wars, the \nwar of the Zionists against the Palestinians and against \nLebanon, the war of Saddam against the people of Iran \nand the ethnic wars of Europe and Africa   one \nSecurity Council member was one of the belligerents \nor supported one party, usually the aggressor, against \nthe other, or the conflict itself. \n Let us take a look at Iraq. They first occupied the \ncountry and then received authorization from the \nSecurity Council   the same Council in which the \nsame occupiers have the right of veto. Whom should \nthe people of Iraq complain about, and where should \nthey take their complaints, in the hope of securing their \nrights? \n We saw in Lebanon that some Powers, for 33 \nlong days, prevented the Security Council from taking \nany action against the Zionist regime with the hope of \ngiving it time to achieve victory. Then, when they \nbecame disappointed at seeing their hopes unfulfilled, \nthey decided to put an end to the hostilities by adopting \na resolution. But the duty of the Security Council is to \nprevent the expansion of conflicts, to put ceasefires in \nplace and to promote peace and security. To whom and \nto what organization should the people of Lebanon \ncomplain? \n The presence of some monopolistic Powers has \nprevented the Security Council from performing its \nmain duty, which is the maintenance of international \npeace and security based on justice. The credibility of \nthe Council has been tarnished, and its efficacy in \ndefending the rights of United Nations Member States \nhas been undermined. Many nations have lost their \nconfidence in the Council. Some other mechanisms, \nsuch as monetary and banking ones, are in the same \nundesirable situation and have been turned into tools \nthat enable some Powers to impose their will on other \nnations. It is evident that these mechanisms are not \ncapable of responding to current needs, solving \nchallenges or establishing fair and sustainable \nrelations. \n Again, there is no doubt that the second and more \nimportant factor is that some big Powers disregard \nmorals, divine values, the teachings of the prophets and \nthe will of the Almighty. They allow the rule of the \nincompetent. How can the incompetent, who cannot \neven manage themselves and conduct their own affairs, \ngovern humanity and arrange its affairs? Unfortunately, \nthese people have put themselves in the position of \nGod. They are in servitude to their own whims, and \nthey desire to have everything for themselves. For \nthem, human dignity and the lives, property and \nterritories of others are no longer respected. For \ncenturies, humanity has had a deep wound inflicted on \nits tired body by impious Powers. Today, the problems \nthat people around the world face are mainly rooted in \ndisregard for human values and ethics, as well as in the \nrule of the selfish and the incompetent. \n The only sustainable approach to the betterment \nof humankind is a return to the teachings of the divine \nprophets, monotheism, respect for the dignity of \nhumans and the flow of love and affection in all \nrelationships, ties and regulations, and the reform of \npresent structures on this basis. To fulfil this objective, \nI invite everybody to form a front of fraternity, amity \nand sustainable peace, based on monotheism and \njustice, under the name of the Coalition for Peace, to \nprevent incursions and arrogance and to promote the \nculture of affection and justice. I hereby announce that, \nwith the help of all independent, justice-seeking and \npeace-loving nations, the Islamic Republic of Iran will \nbe heading down this path. \n Monotheism, justice and compassion for humans \nshould predominate in all the pillars of the United \nNations, and this Organization should be a forum for \njustice, where every member should enjoy equal \nspiritual and legal support. The General Assembly, \nrepresenting the international community, should be \nconsidered the most important pillar of the United \nNations and should, free from any pressure or threats \nby big Powers, take the required measures for the \nreform of the other United Nations structures including \nespecially the reform of the Security Council. It should \ndefine new structures based on justice and democracy, \nwith a view to becoming responsive to present \nrequirements and settling existing challenges, thereby \nbringing about enduring stability and security.  \n The nuclear issue of Iran is a clear example of \nhow such mechanisms perform and of the prevailing \nthoughts behind them. Members are all aware that Iran \nis a member of the International Atomic Energy \nAgency (IAEA) and has always observed its rules and \nregulations. It has had the most extensive cooperation \nwith that Agency in all areas. All our nuclear activities \nhave been completely peaceful and transparent. \n According to the Statute of the IAEA, every \nmember has a number of rights and obligations. In fact, \nall members have to stay on a peaceful path and, under \nthe supervision of the Agency, assist other members, \nand they are entitled to be supported by the Agency \nand have access to the fuel cycle with the help of the \nAgency and its members. \n Thus far, Iran has fulfilled all of its obligations \nbut has been deprived of other members\u2019 technical \nassistance and, even at times, of the Agency\u2019s support. \nFor about five years, some of the aforementioned \nPowers have, by exerting heavy pressure on the IAEA, \nattempted to prevent the Iranian nation from exercising \nits rights. They have derailed Iran\u2019s nuclear issue from \nits legal tracks, and have politicized the atmosphere to \nimpose their wishes through taking advantage of all \ntheir potential. \n The Government of Iran spared no effort to build \nconfidence, but they were not satisfied with anything \nshort of the complete halt of all activities, even those \nrelated to research and university fields. They only \nsought to deprive the Iranian people of all their \ninalienable rights, even to the extent that centres not \ninvolved in the fuel cycle or not in need of supervision \nby the Agency were closed. \n After three years of negotiations and attempts to \nbuild confidence, the Iranian nation came to the firm \nbelief that the main concern of these Powers is not the \npossible deviation of Iran\u2019s nuclear activities, but is to \nprevent its scientific progress under that pretext. If this \ntrend continues, there will be no possibility for Iran to \nenjoy its rights, not even in the next 20 years. \nTherefore, Iran decided to pursue the issue through its \nappropriate legal path, one that runs through the IAEA, \nand to disregard unlawful and political impositions by \nthe arrogant Powers. \n In the past two years, abusing the Security \nCouncil, the arrogant Powers have repeatedly accused \nIran and have even made military threats and imposed \nillegal sanctions against it. However, by the grace of \nfaith in God and national unity, Iran has moved \nforward step by step, and now our country is \nrecognized as one with the capacity for industrial-scale \nfuel cycle production for peaceful uses. Unfortunately, \nthe Security Council, in dealing with this obvious legal \nissue, was influenced by some bullying Powers and \nfailed to uphold justice and protect the rights of the \nIranian people. \n Fortunately, the IAEA has recently tried to regain \nits legal role as supporter of the rights of its members \nwhile supervising nuclear activities. We see this as a \ncorrect approach adopted by the Agency. Previously, \nthey illegally insisted on politicizing the Iranian \nnation\u2019s nuclear case, but today, because of the \nresistance of the Iranian nation, the issue is back with \nthe Agency, and I officially announce that, in our \nopinion, the nuclear issue of Iran is now closed and has \nturned into an ordinary Agency matter. Today, many \nimportant questions have been raised about the nuclear \nactivities of certain Powers within the IAEA, which \nshould be dealt with properly. Of course, Iran has \nalways been, and will be, prepared to have constructive \ntalks with all parties. \n I would like to thank all the nations and countries \nthat, during this difficult period, defended the legal \nrights of my nation and motherland. I also want to \nexpress our appreciation to the members of the  \nNon-Aligned Movement, our friends in the Security \nCouncil and in the IAEA Board of Governors, the \ncommitted and law-abiding experts of the Agency and \nits Director General for standing by the law. I would \nalso like to announce that, unlike the monopolistic \nPowers, the Iranian nation is ready to offer to other \nmembers its experiences in the form of educational \nprogrammes, based on its obligations under the \nAgency\u2019s Statute and under Agency supervision. \n Now I would like to address those who have \nshown hostility towards the Iranian nation for some \nfive years and who have offended and accused my \npeople, who have contributed to the history and \ncivilization of the world. I advise them to learn from \nhistory and their recent actions. They badly mistreated \nthe great Iranian nation, but they should be careful not \nto inflict the same on other members of international \norganizations, and not to sacrifice the dignity of \ninternational organizations for the sake of their \nunlawful wishes. Today the nations of the world are \nwide awake and resistant. If those Powers reform \nthemselves, the whole world will be reformed. Nations \nare inherently good and can coexist peacefully. \n Those Powers should endeavour to serve their \nown peoples; others do not need them. Is it not high \ntime for these Powers to return from the path of \narrogance and obedience to Satan to the path of faith in \nGod? Would they not like to be cleansed of their \nimpurities, submit to the will of God and believe in \nhim? Faith in God means believing in honesty, purity, \njustice and compassion for others. They can be certain \nthat they will benefit from purity, honesty, justice and \nloving and respecting human dignity. They can also be \ncertain that such values are, more and more, considered \nappropriate, valuable and beautiful by the nations of \nthe world. \n This is the invitation of all the divine prophets \nfrom Adam to Noah, Abraham, Moses, Jesus Christ and \nMohammed, peace be upon him. If they accept this \ninvitation, they will be saved, and if they do not, the \nsame calamities that befell the people of the distant \npast will befall them as well. According to the holy \nQuran: One who does not answer the divine call \nshould not think that he has weakened God on Earth; \nhe has no companion but God and he is clearly \nengulfed by darkness\u201d. They have nothing of their own \nand cannot escape from the dominion of the rule of \nGod and his will. \n At this important gathering, I have to remind \nthem of the following words of the Almighty, which \nare mentioned in the Holy Quran:  \n Do they not look at the powers and \nGovernments which came before them? If the \npeople of the past had actually possessed \nsomething, they would have kept it and would not \nhave let you possess it now. God destroyed them \nbecause of their sins, and nobody could protect \nthem against the will of God. \n These Powers have to know that thoughts and \nmethods based on oppression and injustice are doomed \nto failure. Do they not see the signs of vigilance and \nresistance based on monotheism, philanthropy and the \njustice-seeking spirit of the nations of the world? Do \nthey not notice that we are nearing the sunset of the \ntime of empires? I hope that this invitation will have a \npractical answer. \n Peoples and Governments are not obliged to obey \nthe injustice of certain Powers. Those Powers, for the \nreasons already mentioned, have lost the competence to \nlead the world. I officially declare that the age of \nrelations arising from the Second World War and of \nmaterialistic thought based on arrogance and \ndomination is well over now. Humanity has passed a \nperilous precipice and the age of monotheism, purity, \naffinity, respect for others, justice and true peace-\nloving has commenced. \n It is the divine promise that the truth will be \nvictorious and the Earth will be inherited by the \nrighteous. Those who are free, believers and the people \nof the world should put their trust in God. Those who \ncrave lofty values, wherever they are, should try to \nprepare the grounds for the fulfilment of that great \ndivine promise by serving the people and seeking \njustice. \n The era of darkness will end, prisoners will return \nhome, the occupied lands will be freed, Palestine and \nIraq will be liberated from the domination of the \noccupiers, and the peoples of America and Europe will \nbe free of the pressures exerted by the Zionists. \nTenderhearted and humanity-loving Governments will \nreplace the aggressive and domineering. Human \ndignity will be regained. The pleasing aroma of justice \nwill permeate the world and people will live together in \na brotherly and affectionate manner. \n Striving in that way to surrender rule to the \nrighteous and perfect human, the promised one, is \nindeed the final cure for the wounds of humanity, the \nsolution of all problems, and the establishment of love, \nbeauty, justice and a dignified life throughout the \nworld. That belief and endeavour is the key to unity \nand constructive interaction among nations, countries, \nthe people of the world and all true justice-seekers. \nWithout a doubt, the promised one who is the ultimate \nsaviour, along with Jesus Christ and other holy \nprophets, will come. In the company of all believers, \njustice-seekers and benefactors, he will establish a \nbright future and fill the world with justice and beauty. \nThat is the promise of God; therefore it will be \nfulfilled. Let us play a part in the fulfilment of all that \nglory and beauty. \n I wish for a bright future for all human beings, \nthe dawn of the liberation of and freedom for all \nhumans, the rule of love and affection all around the \nworld, as well as the elimination of oppression, hatred \nand violence   a wish that I expect to be fulfilled in \nthe near future. \n"

        "file_text": "It is my honour to \nparticipate in this meeting of the General Assembly \nsixty-second session as Chairman of the Presidency of \nBosnia and Herzegovina. \n I would also like to congratulate you, Sir, on your \nassumption of the presidency, and to express my \nrespect and gratitude to Sheikha Haya Rashed \nAl-Khalifa for successfully presiding over the sixty-\nfirst session. \n The United Nations and all other organizations \ndepend on the collective strength of their members. \nThat strength should be drawn from the consensus of \nthe Member States. On that note, I would like to \nexpress my regret for the loss of momentum in \nSecurity Council reform. For the past several years, our \ncountries\u2019 representatives have met at the global level \nand have been prepared to realize the goals of the \nMillennium Declaration, in which the United Nations \nplays a distinguished role. \n It is well-known that, in the recent past, my \ncountry paid a high price for the imperfect and \ninefficient United Nations system. The United Nations \nadmitted its mistake and emphasized in its first report \non Srebrenica that the United Nations experience in \nBosnia and Herzegovina was one of the most difficult \nand painful in the Organization\u2019s history. The report \nfurther noted that Srebrenica clarified the truth the \nUnited Nations and the world learned too late: Bosnia \nand Herzegovina was as much a moral obligation as it \nwas a military conflict, and Srebrenica will haunt us \nforever. \n On 27 February 2007, the International Court of \nJustice ruled on the application of the Convention on \nthe Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of \nGenocide in the case of Bosnia and Herzegovina versus \nSerbia and Montenegro. The International Court of \nJustice ruled that genocide was committed against \nBosnian Muslims in and around Srebrenica in eastern \nBosnia and Herzegovina. Members will agree, of \ncourse, that this was not an isolated case. That is one \nmore reason for our determination and commitment, \nshared by a majority of the Member States, to the \nnecessary reform of the world Organization. \n In that light, Bosnia and Herzegovina is of the \nopinion that only a strong United Nations can be an \nefficient instrument in regulating international \nrelations, in accordance with the United Nations \nCharter and international law. Apart from the necessary \nreforms, it is also essential to revitalize the United \nNations, including the General Assembly and its \ncommittees, the Economic and Social Council, the \nSecretariat and other bodies. \n That would include defining a number of issues, \nsuch as Security Council membership categories, the \nnumber of members, selection procedures for new \nmembers, veto powers, regional representation, \nworking methods, and so on. Those attest to the \ncomplexity of the ongoing reform. A productive step \nforward will inevitably lead to essential negotiations in \nthat context, rather than to the usual ongoing \nconsultations. I should like to emphasize Bosnia and \nHerzegovina\u2019s interest in reform that would create a \nlarger Security Council membership, and thus an \nadditional seat for the Eastern European Group. \n Multi-ethnic and multireligious Bosnia and \nHerzegovina, with its rich historical heritage and \nexperience of the failures of the international \ncommunity, primarily the United Nations \u2014 failures \nthat had troubling consequences for my country, but \nalso positive results in post-war peacebuilding \nalongside United Nations representatives, bodies and \nagencies \u2014 could contribute greatly to the United \nNations becoming an effective instrument in the \ncollective management of international relations.  \n My country believes that there can be no peace or \nstability without economic and social development. My \ncountry maintains its support for the Security Council \nas a critical body for international cooperation, peace \nand the development of the rights of all nations. \nHaving met its historic challenges, Bosnia and \nHerzegovina is now able to share its experiences with a \ntroubled world. Bosnia and Herzegovina is thus \ndetermined to intensify ongoing activities leading to its \nnon-permanent membership of the Security Council \nfrom 2010 to 2012, and looks forward to the support of \nthe majority of Member States for that membership. \n I come from a post-conflict country that has \nmoved towards becoming a modern democratic society \nand taken the path to European and trans-Atlantic \nintegration. That is why my country is truly committed \nto the strengthening of international cooperation on the \nregional, European and global levels. \n It is with great pride that I can state today that \nBosnia and Herzegovina is an active participant in all \nregional south-eastern European initiatives and \nprocesses. In 2007, Bosnia and Herzegovina was \nrecognized for its proactive regional stand. The South-\nEast European Cooperation Process (SEECP) summit \nin Zagreb adopted the decision to make Sarajevo the \nregional cooperation council centre. Creating the \nregional cooperation council is the final step in the \ntransformation of the Stability Pact for South Eastern \nEurope, meaning that SEECP member States will \nassume regional responsibilities. With that decision, \nthe capital of Bosnia and Herzegovina will become a \nfuture regional cooperation centre, and Bosnia and \nHerzegovina will also be home to the regional disaster \npreparedness and prevention initiative secretariat, \ntaking strong regional ownership of the Stability Pact \nfor South Eastern Europe initiative. The representative \nof Bosnia and Herzegovina will play a lead role in the \nregional arms control verification and implementation \nassistance centre in Zagreb. \n Bosnia and Herzegovina is pursuing active \nregional cooperation in fighting organized crime. We \ncooperate actively with the Southeast Europe \nCooperative Initiative Centre for Combating \nTransborder Crime in Bucharest. It was through more \nefficient regional cooperation, electronic identity \ndatabases and efficient border control that Bosnia and \nHerzegovina was able to reduce the number of illegal \nimmigrants, as well as all forms of cross-border \ncriminal activity. \n We are developing cooperation with the \nInternational Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna on the \ndetection and prevention of radioactive substance \ntransportation and proliferation on Bosnia and \nHerzegovina territory. Bosnia and Herzegovina is \nbuilding relationships with neighbouring countries on \nthe basis of equality, complete independence, \nsovereignty and territorial integrity. Bosnia and \nHerzegovina and its neighbours are aware that \ncomplete development can be achieved only by joining \na united Europe. That goal will be achieved by \npursuing the development of all aspects of good \nrelations with neighbouring countries, the \ndemocratization of the entire region, and acceptance of \ngeneral European standards.  \n Bosnia and Herzegovina believes in \nnon-interference in the internal affairs of sovereign \ncountries, and thus that the solution for Kosovo is to be \nreached through dialogue among the interested parties. \nBosnia and Herzegovina supports dialogue between \nBelgrade and Pristina and is eager to help find a \nsolution acceptable to both sides within regional \ninitiatives. Bosnia and Herzegovina supports the efforts \nof the Troika Contact Group for Kosovo and hopes that \na satisfying solution for the future status of Kosovo \nwill be found. A further lengthy delay in the resolution \nof the status of Kosovo will certainly have a long-term \nnegative impact on the entire Balkan region. \n Bosnia and Herzegovina has also achieved \nsignificant successes in the broader international \ncontext. In late 2006, Bosnia and Herzegovina became \na member of the NATO Partnership for Peace. Further \nrecognition came in May 2007, when Bosnia and \nHerzegovina became a member of a rather significant \nnew United Nations body \u2014 the Human Rights \nCouncil. \n On 31 May 2007, Bosnia and Herzegovina \nbecame a presiding member of the Hague Code of \nConduct, which has been signed by 126 United Nations \nMember States. My country and the other signatories \nof the Code, who believe in the principle of collective \nsafety, are prepared to fight against the proliferation of \nballistic missile technology. We are aware of the great \ndanger posed by ballistic missiles in the hands of \nnon-government entities, which could abuse them for \ndestructive purposes anywhere in the world. Therefore, \nI urge all countries that have not yet signed the Hague \nCode of Conduct \u2014 particularly those with ballistic \ncapacity \u2014 to accept the Code. I also wish to urge all \nMember States to support the relevant draft resolution \nproposed by my country and Portugal. \n Bosnia and Herzegovina has participated and will \ncontinue to participate, to the extent possible, in the \ninternational efforts of the anti-terrorism coalition. We \nhave also undertaken to join the anti-terrorism efforts \nof the European Union. The Council of Ministers of \nBosnia and Herzegovina has approved an anti-\nterrorism strategic plan for the period 2006-2009. The \nongoing reform of our criminal code will result in \nadditional anti-terrorism measures that will conform to \nthe relevant international conventions. \n Bosnia and Herzegovina supports other Member \nStates in continuing joint efforts to strengthen respect \nfor all human rights, including civil, economic, \ncultural, political, social, developmental and other \nrights. Bosnia and Herzegovina has agreed to serve as a \nsponsor of the Italian initiative aimed at a United \nNations moratorium on the death penalty, to be \nconsidered by the General Assembly. Bosnia and \nHerzegovina has made significant progress in \nsubmitting the relevant reports to the Office of the \nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights \nin Geneva. \n I also wish to note that Bosnia and Herzegovina, \ntogether with Jordan, has promoted the United Nations \nBetter World Campaign for the past few years. The \nCampaign seeks to improve the timeliness and \neffectiveness of humanitarian disaster response. \n Bosnian authorities continue to be committed to \ncooperating fully with the International Criminal \nTribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY). All \nsuspected war criminals from the territories of the \nformer Yugoslavia must be brought to justice. To date, \nwe have engaged in positive cooperation with the \nTribunal on issues such as the processing of criminal \ncharges, extradition, contacting the relevant authorities, \naccess to documentation and providing appropriate \nworking conditions for Court representatives and \nothers in Bosnia and Herzegovina. \n We are creating a legal framework and have \nestablished the War Crimes Chamber within the Court \nof Bosnia and Herzegovina to begin processing war \ncrimes cases. That is one of the conditions for \nestablishing an atmosphere of mutual trust and \nreconciliation in post-conflict Bosnia and Herzegovina. \nHowever, the ICTY should not conclude its work until \nthe most notorious war criminals \u2014 in particular \nBosnian Serb war leaders Radovan Karadzic, Ratko \nMladic and others \u2014 are brought to justice. \n Bosnia and Herzegovina supports all peace \ninitiatives and conflict prevention activities. We \nsupport and are following very closely the Middle East \nRoad Map, which will lead to permanent and \nsustainable peace in Middle East. As part of United \nNations peacekeeping operations, Bosnia and \nHerzegovina has military observers in the Congo and \nEthiopia and has contributed to the civilian police \nforces in the Sudan, Cyprus, Liberia and Haiti. Bosnia \nand Herzegovina has also sent a small demining unit to \nIraq in order to help its people establish a democratic \nand self-sustainable country. \n We are certain that, by strengthening \nmultilateralism, the United Nations can develop \neffective measures to prevent armed conflict. At the \nsame time, however, it is essential to uphold the \nprinciple of the political independence, sovereignty and \nterritorial integrity of all countries, in accordance with \nthe guiding principles of international law and with full \nrespect for human rights. \n Bosnia and Herzegovina supports the Middle East \nRoad Map and the initiatives of the Quartet, which \nestablish a basis for the beginning of a true Israeli-\nPalestinian dialogue that is brokered by the United \nStates and in accordance with European Union \nguidelines. Bosnia and Herzegovina calls for a general, \nunconditional and mutual cessation of all hostilities, \nthe release of all hostages and the launching of \nnegotiations on a definitive two-State solution to the \nIsraeli-Palestinian problem. \n Bosnia and Herzegovina urges all ethnic and \nreligious communities in Iraq to put an end to sectarian \nviolence and to take an active role in political life. We \njoin the rest of the international community in calling \nfor a broad national political dialogue, emphasizing \nfull compliance with the Geneva Conventions of 1949. \n Mindful of the potentially catastrophic \nconsequences of a deepening of the crisis related to the \nIranian nuclear development programme, Bosnia and \nHerzegovina calls on Iran to be prepared to cooperate \nfully with the International Atomic Energy Agency and \nto engage in a dialogue with key partners.  \n The United Nations role in conflict resolution is \ncrucial. However, during various international crises, \nparticularly that in the former Yugoslavia, the \nOrganization has failed to play the role entrusted to it \nby the Charter. The Iraqi crisis highlights the \nweaknesses of the United Nations in preventing \nconflict throughout the world. If the United Nations \nfails to shoulder its Charter responsibilities, that could \nlead to a number of unilateral interventions, which \nwould have a very negative impact on international \nstability. \n The foreign policy of Bosnia and Herzegovina is \nfocused on long-term peacekeeping and development \nwith a view to ensuring the safety and stability of \noverall development. All our international activities are \nbased on and conform to the Charter of the United \nNations, the Helsinki Final Act of the Organization for \nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe and universally \naccepted principles of international law. \n Aware of the enormous threat to peace posed by \nnuclear, chemical and biological weapons, particularly \nin the hands of terrorists, Bosnia and Herzegovina has \ntaken significant steps towards total control in \npreventing the proliferation of weapons of mass \ndestruction. We have ratified or acceded to most of the \nmajor documents in this area. Bosnia and Herzegovina \nis also eager to cooperate fully with other countries at \nthe bilateral level through relevant multilateral \norganizations and initiatives in order to effectively \nfight the proliferation and use of weapons of mass \ndestruction. \n Bosnia and Herzegovina has adopted a law \nproviding for the implementation of the Chemical \nWeapons Convention. As one of the countries most \naffected by the mine stockpiles left over from the \nprevious conflict, Bosnia and Herzegovina is paying \nclose attention to the implementation of the Ottawa \nConvention.  \n Bosnia and Herzegovina is an active participant \nin the response and prevention programmes of the Joint \nUnited Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS. Our \ncontributions to the fight against that disease are \ndescribed in the Bosnia and Herzegovina Strategy to \nPrevent and Combat HIV/AIDS, 2004-2009. \n Bosnia and Herzegovina pays its dues on time \nand on a regular basis to the United Nations and all \nother organizations of which it is a member. We urge \nother countries, especially major contributors, to do \nlikewise. I am referring in particular to the dues to the \nICTY and peacekeeping operations that have not been \npaid in a timely manner. \n Two days ago in this Hall, we had a highly \nconstructive exchange of views on one of the most \nserous and potentially dangerous phenomena of our \ntime: global warming. Once again, I should like to \nemphasize the crucial importance of effective and \ntimely United Nations action on this issue. In 2000, my \ncountry ratified the United Nations Framework \nConvention on Climate Change, which entered into \nforce in Bosnia and Herzegovina on 15 June 2007. I \nurge all Member States that have not yet done so to \nratify the Convention without delay. \n"

        "file_text": "Kuwait congratulates Mr. Srgjan Kerim upon \nhis election to the presidency of the General Assembly \nat its sixty-second session, and recalls with \nappreciation the efforts of his predecessor, Her \nExcellency Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa, and her \nsuccessful conduct of the work of the sixty-first \nsession. \n Despite the fact that two years have elapsed since \nthe 2005 World Summit and seven years since the \nMillennium Summit, we continue to confront \nchallenges and dangers to international peace and \nsecurity, such as terrorism, poverty, hunger, the spread \nof dangerous infectious diseases like HIV/AIDS and \nmalaria, deterioration of the environment and \nviolations of human rights. Recent times have seen a \nnumber of outstanding achievements, most important \namong them the establishment of the Peacebuilding \nCommission, the Human Rights Council, the Central \nEmergency Response Fund and the United Nations \nDemocracy Fund, and the introduction of \nadministrative and financial reforms of the work of the \nSecretariat. These were all necessary achievements, but \nthey are not enough to combat terrorism, eliminate \nweapons of mass destruction, affect climate change and \nachieve sustainable development in the developing \ncountries, including the least developed among them. \n Moreover, the revival of racial bias, religious \nsedition, incitement of hatred and xenophobia represent \na serious threat to international peace and security. The \nOrganization must be strong in confronting that threat \nseriously and firmly. \n The time has come for us to change our method \nand approach in dealing with these universal \nchallenges and dangers and to move from the phase of \ndetermining what should be done to the phase of actual \nwork and the faithful fulfilment of the commitments \nwe have taken upon ourselves at international \nconferences and in international agreements and \nconventions that we have signed and ratified. \n The State of Kuwait has made good progress in \ntranslating the commitments and resolutions of the \n2005 World Summit into tangible realities. It has also \nattained the Millennium Development Goals, \nparticularly in the fields of education, health and \nadvancing the role of women in society. It has designed \npolicies capable of uplifting society and achieving \nfurther progress and social and economic development, \nas well as raising the standard of living of individuals. \nSuch policies contribute to efforts to consolidate the \nprinciples of tolerance, moderation and the rejection of \nfanaticism. \n Based upon the State of Kuwait\u2019s absolute belief \nin the human values of supporting the downtrodden \nand helping the needy, my country has, since its \nindependence, implemented a generous aid programme \nfor developing countries. In 1961, it established the \nKuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development, which \nhas financed hundreds of infrastructure projects in \nmore than 100 countries. The value of those projects \nexceeds $12 billion.  \n The State of Kuwait is also committed to \nproviding annual voluntary contributions to numerous \ninternational specialized agencies and organizations, as \nwell as to regional organizations and funds that assist \ndeveloping countries in achieving their development \ngoals. Recently, the State of Kuwait allocated $300 \nmillion to the Islamic Development Bank for the \nelimination of poverty in Africa. That is in addition to \nwhat we contribute in humanitarian and relief aid to \nmany countries ravaged by natural disasters.  \n It is regrettable that poverty, hunger and disease \npersist in developing countries. It is even more painful \nto see that more than half of the world\u2019s population is \nliving on less than $2 per day   a matter that requires \nserious examination and a real review of the \nimpediments to development in developing countries. \nIn that connection, the State of Kuwait calls upon the \nWorld Trade Organization and the Bretton Woods \ninstitutions to ease the restrictions imposed on exports \nfrom developing countries and to propose a more just \nand equitable trading system for least developed and \npoorest countries. \n Kuwait is following with concern the \ndevelopments in the situation in Iraq. We welcome the \nimprovements in security conditions in some areas and \nprovinces of Iraq, as a result of the implementation of \nrelevant arrangements and a security enforcement plan \ncarried out by the international forces in Iraq with the \nparticipation of Iraqi security forces. But there is still a \ndire need to redouble efforts at all levels, particularly \non the political track, in order to address the security \nchallenges posed by terrorist operations that target \ncivilians, houses of worship and State institutions and \nthat cost the lives of scores of innocent people daily. It \nis our hope that the Iraqi Government\u2019s efforts to \nachieve national reconciliation will be successful and \nproduce positive results that can lead to a \ncomprehensive national consensus in Iraq that takes \ninto consideration the concerns and the rights of all \nsectors of the Iraqi people. National reconciliation is \nthe only way to build a democratic, free, secure and \nindependent Iraq that is at peace with itself and its \nneighbours and that respects its international \nobligations and commitments. \n In that context, we welcome the adoption of \nSecurity Council resolution 1770 (2007), which \nconsolidated the duties and the mandate of the United \nNations Assistance Mission for Iraq. We look forward \nto the international community playing its vital role in \nhelping Iraq to fulfil its political and economic \nobligations within the context of the International \nCompact with Iraq. \n With regard to the issue of the three occupied \nEmirati islands, Kuwait would like to reaffirm its \nsupport for the position of the Gulf Cooperation \nCouncil on this issue. We hope that efforts and contacts \nat all levels will intensify between the sisterly United \nArab Emirates and the friendly Islamic Republic of \nIran in order to find a solution to this dispute consistent \nwith the principles and rules of international law and \ngood-neighbourly relations, thereby contributing to \nstrengthening the security and stability of the region. \n The Middle East crisis has been stagnant since \nthe middle of the past century. The plight of the \nPalestinian people continues: their rights are violated, \ntheir lands are occupied and Security Council \nresolutions are frozen   despite intensive international \nand regional efforts to revive the Middle East peace \nprocess. The Israeli Government, instead of putting \nconfidence-building measures in place, continues to \ncreate obstacles that serve to increase tensions and \nviolence and that hinder the establishment of a climate \nconducive to moving the peace process ahead. Do \ncontinuing settlement activities help to achieve peace \nmore quickly? Do the policies of detention, land \nconfiscation, curfews, closures and restrictions of \nmovement promote an environment of trust and \nstability? The answer is definitely no. Who could think \nthat this conflict is subject to the principles of a zero-\nsum game? Anyone who thinks that Israel will achieve \nsecurity for itself at the expense of the security of the \nPalestinian people is making a serious mistake. \nSecurity must be for everyone. There will be no \nsecurity except through the implementation of \nresolutions of international legitimacy.  \n The State of Kuwait therefore reiterates its \nsupport for the convening of an international \nconference with the participation of all the parties \nconcerned in the peace process. That meeting should \nfollow the terms of reference of the Madrid \nConference   including the provisions of Security \nCouncil resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973)   the \nprinciple of land for peace, the Road Map endorsed by \nthe Security Council in its resolution 1515 (2003) and \nthe Arab Peace Initiative. The comprehensive, just and \nlasting peace that the international community seeks to \nachieve must ensure that the Palestinian people attain \nall their legitimate political rights. That includes the \nestablishment of their own independent State on their \nown land, with Jerusalem as its capital. It must also \ninclude Israel\u2019s withdrawal from all the Arab land \noccupied since 1967, including the Syrian Golan \nHeights.  \n Turning to Lebanon, we congratulate the \nLebanese Government on its success in putting a \ndecisive end to the Nahr Al-Bared sedition. We would \nalso like to express our gratitude to the Lebanese army, \nwhich dealt with that sedition ably and firmly. We hope \nthat that accomplishment will contribute to the return \nof all Lebanese parties to the negotiating table and the \nresumption of a Lebanese national dialogue to address \nthe issue of presidential entitlement and the political \nprocess, in accordance with the constitution.  \n While we commend the regional and international \nefforts to achieve national reconciliation among all \nLebanese parties, we condemn the political \nassassinations and the recurrent terrorist bombings \naimed at disrupting peace and stability in that sisterly \ncountry. We renew Kuwait's commitment to stand by \nLebanon and to support it in a manner that will \npreserve its security, unity, territorial integrity and \npolitical independence. \n As for developments on the Iranian nuclear issue, \nwe reaffirm our firm belief in the need to respect \ninternationally recognized principles, including that of \nresolving conflicts through peaceful means. The State \nof Kuwait calls upon the international community to \ncoordinate its efforts and to continue to work towards \nachieving a peaceful resolution of this crisis, so as to \nsafeguard the peace and stability of the Gulf region. \nWe also welcome the recent agreement reached \nbetween the Islamic Republic of Iran and the \nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) as an \nimportant step towards dispelling fears and doubts \nsurrounding the Iranian nuclear programme. It is our \nhope that dialogue and cooperation will resume with \ntotal transparency. That would allow us to address all \nthe elements of this issue, so as to foster the conditions \nconducive to making the Middle East a zone free of \nnuclear weapons and all other weapons of mass \ndestruction. \n In that connection, we call upon the international \ncommunity to exert pressure on Israel to join the Treaty \non the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and to \nplace all of its nuclear facilities under IAEA \nsafeguards. We emphasize the right of all the States of \nthe region to obtain the technology and know-how \nnecessary to peacefully utilize nuclear energy in \naccordance with the terms specified by relevant \ninternational conventions. \n Finally, we renew our commitment to work \nthrough the United Nations to fulfil the hopes and \naspirations of our peoples to live together in a world \nwhere peace, justice and equality prevail. \n"

        "file_text": " Allow me,  Mr. President, to join others in welcoming you and \ncongratulating you on your election as President of the \nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-second session. We are \nconvinced that your leadership will contribute to \npromoting both your country and our entire region, as \nwell as to a successful outcome at the current session. \n May I also extend wholehearted congratulations \nto the Secretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon. He can \ncount on the full support of Montenegro, as the \nyoungest Member of the United Nations. Particular \nthanks go also to Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa for \nher successful presidency of the General Assembly at \nits sixty-first session. \n It is time for all countries   and particularly \nsmaller and developing countries   to realize that \nmultilateralism is the pre-eminent form of interaction \nin our changing world. Multilateralism provides a \nframework for choosing democratic, development and \ncultural options that can most effectively meet the \nmajor challenges ahead, including the maintenance of \npeace and security, climate change, development \nprocesses, the fight against terrorism and the protection \nof human rights. \n Mindful of the importance of multilateral \norganizations, in particular the United Nations, \nMontenegro stands ready to actively participate in \nmaking those principles a reality. As a society that is \nimplementing major structural economic and social \nreforms, we understand and support the reform \nprocesses taking place under the auspices of the \nOrganization. Furthermore, as a Member State, we are \naware of our obligation to respect the international \nlegal order and to contribute to the consolidation of \npeace and democracy in the international community. \n Good-neighbourly relations and regional \ncooperation, as integral components of the processes of \nEuropean and Euro-Atlantic integration, form the basis \nof Montenegro\u2019s foreign policy. We strongly believe \nthat Montenegro and the Western Balkans clearly have \na European future. In that context, we support the \nefforts of all of our neighbours to adopt and implement \nEuropean standards and values. \n In mid-October, we shall sign a stabilization and \nassociation agreement with the European Union (EU), \nthus establishing the first contractual relationship \nbetween Montenegro and the Union. That will \ncomplete the current phase of intensive activities on \nour path towards Europe, which will enable us to enter \na new and enhanced phase in our European relations. It \nis in that context that we view our recent accession to \nthe Partnership for Peace initiative. Our commitment to \nEuropean and Euro-Atlantic integration has been \nreaffirmed in all the strategic documents that we have \nadopted since the restoration of our independence. \n Many development processes are now taking \nplace in Montenegro: an expansion of our open-market \neconomy, the transformation of ownership structures \nand reform of our public sector, judicial and security \nstructures. Our institutional reforms and development \nprogrammes, which have been the focus of our \npolitical activities during the current phase, are guided \nby the principles of European and Euro-Atlantic \nintegration, which are a guarantee of stability and \nprosperity. It is with a full sense of responsibility that \nwe are creating an environment that ensures the rule of \nlaw, equality and respect for human, minority and \nreligious rights. In that way we can contribute to \nregional stability as well. \n Although we are a small State, we stand ready to \ncontribute, to the best of our ability, to the \nestablishment of conditions that will enable the region \nto continue along the path of mutual trust, enhanced \nstabilization and unhindered cooperation. \n By becoming independent, Montenegro has taken \ncharge of its integration into the system of international \nrelations as an equal partner and has shouldered its \nresponsibility for the maintenance of peace, security \nand stability in the region, while building an open and \ndemocratic civil society. \n In that context, we believe that the direct \nnegotiations that have begun on Kosovo\u2019s future status \nwill be fruitful. Montenegro strongly supports that \nnegotiating process, in which the international \ncommunity has invested considerable effort, convinced \nthat it will lead to a lasting and sustainable solution \nthat will contribute to the strengthening and \npreservation of regional stability over the long term. \n Montenegro is particularly sensitive to the theme \nunderlying the sixty-second session of the General \nAssembly: our response to climate change. As the \nSecretary-General stated in paragraph 8 of his report \non the work of the Organization (A/62/1), \u201c[C]limate \nchange, and what we do about it, will define us, our \nera, and ultimately our global legacy\u201d. Here, the idea \nof the world as a global village, an indivisible whole, is \nperhaps most evident. Without a common approach, \nthere can be no correct response. No one has the right \nto remain indifferent to this challenge, either \nindividually or in global terms. \nThe negative impacts of climate change could be \nmany. It could affect countries such as my own in ways \nthat include a rise in the level of the Adriatic Sea, \nrising temperatures and damage to forest and other \necosystems and to biodiversity. In that context, \nMontenegro is making efforts to keep pace with global \ntrends, contributing to endeavours to ensure better \nliving conditions and a more humane environment for \nus and future generations. We are carrying out many \nactivities and projects to that end, including efforts in \nfulfilment of our international obligations. We have \nratified the United Nations Framework Convention on \nClimate Change and the Kyoto Protocol, and we have \nbegun to prepare our first report on implementation of \nthe Protocol. We also recently adopted a national \nsustainable development strategy and are now \nestablishing a network of public institutions to plan \nactivities related to the challenges of climate change.  \n Mindful of our country\u2019s natural resources and of \nour responsibility to preserve them, the parliament of \nthe Republic of Montenegro decided in 1991 to declare \nMontenegro an ecological State. As an ecological State, \nMontenegro has an additional obligation to support \nUnited Nations efforts to promote sustainable \ndevelopment throughout the world. Through robust \nefforts, we shall continue to strengthen Montenegro as \na State that guarantees sustainable development for its \ncitizens. \n We therefore welcome the efforts of the United \nNations and particularly of the Secretary-General in \nthis area. We are encouraged by the messages \nemanating from the present General Assembly session \nand the recent high-level event on climate change. We \nhope that those messages will contribute significantly \nto the success of the Bali process in December and that \nthe Bali Climate Change Conference will produce \nadditional constructive proposals and sustainable \nsolutions, particularly with regard to the post-2012 \ngoals. \n In recent months, we have seen the United \nNations continue to make significant efforts in hot \nspots throughout the world. The contributions made by \nthe United Nations in Darfur alone have repeatedly \ndemonstrated the Organization\u2019s capacity to adapt and \nto play its appropriate role in today\u2019s world. \n We therefore believe that the United Nations is \ncapable of undertaking comprehensive reform of its \nsystem to respond to the increasingly complex \nchallenges facing it. Given the importance of the \nOrganization to world peace and security, the \nmodalities of such reform should result in a stronger, \nmore organized, better coherent and more effective \nUnited Nations. \n We are of the view that effective coordination \namong the principal United Nations organs is vital. We \nhave seen some progress in this area since the 2005 \nWorld Summit.  \n Another essential aspect of United Nations \nreform is reform of the General Assembly, which \nremains the primary decision-making organ of the \nUnited Nations. Work on that aspect, together with \nothers, must be intensified and made more results-\noriented. \n The same thing applies to the ongoing debate on \nreform of the Economic and Social Council and, in \nparticular, of the Security Council. Equitable \nrepresentation for the Group of Eastern European \nStates, to which we belong, should be guaranteed in \nthat important organ. \n For a small country like Montenegro, effective \ncooperation with the United Nations is crucial. We are \ntherefore most interested in being the agent and \npromoter of that cooperation, be it through the One \nUnited Nations Initiative or through a similar modality. \nOur commitment to cooperation with the United \nNations is also demonstrated by the project to build the \nfirst United Nations eco-building as the focal point for \nall United Nations activities in Montenegro. \n As a developing country, Montenegro looks \nforward to the High-level Dialogue on Financing for \nDevelopment and to the successful conclusion of the \nDoha Round negotiations, which we hope will lend \nfresh impetus to bringing together economic, financial \nand social issues with the aim of achieving \ncomprehensive progress and development. The world \ntoday faces a multitude of challenges in this area. \nMontenegro stands ready to contribute to the global \npartnership for development. \n In that context, Montenegro will continue its \nactivities conducive to the full implementation of the \nMillennium Development Goals, for we are convinced \nthat in that way we will contribute to improving quality \nof life and overall stability. \n With a view to meeting the legitimate security \ninterests of nations, we must be united and decisive in \ntackling terrorism, which continues to threaten the \nworld. The United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism \nStrategy and its Plan of Action (resolution 60/288) are \nof great importance, and call for agreement on a \ncomprehensive convention on international terrorism. \n Montenegro will continue to demonstrate its full \nand unequivocal commitment to, and compliance with, \ninternational obligations through its cooperation with \nthe International Criminal Tribunal for the Former \nYugoslavia (ICTY). We shall continue our concrete \ncooperation with the ICTY, contributing not only to the \nrule of law but also to implementing the Tribunal\u2019s \ncompletion strategy. \n We shall continue to craft our policies and to \nwork towards our development on the basis of the \nprinciples set out in the Universal Declaration of \nHuman Rights, which represent the foundations of \nmodern democracy. We therefore view the United \nNations as the most important forum for achieving \nprogress, a more equitable future and a community of \nequal nations. \n Our country is proud of its multi-ethnic and \nmulticonfessional harmony. That is one of our \ncherished values, which distinguishes Montenegro in \nthe regional and broader international context. With \nour traditions and culture, Montenegro is part of the \nage-old historical currents of the Balkans, the \nMediterranean and Europe. We are at the crossroads of \ncivilizations and religions, and share the intertwined \ninfluences emanating from them. We want to preserve \nand enhance that legacy by working together not only \nwith our neighbours but also with all other countries \nwith which we share such advantages of geography, \nculture and values. \n The world Organization is the only true global \nforum, because it reflects all the diversity and qualities \nof its Members, which are united by principles and \nvalues that, after 62 years, continue to serve as a \nbeacon in an increasingly changing and dynamic \nworld. Following that course while being prepared to \nchange is an imperative for us all. \n"

        "file_text": "At the outset, let me express, on behalf of \nthe Lao delegation, my cordial salutations and \ncongratulations to Mr. Srgjan Kerim on his election as \nPresident of the General Assembly at its sixty-second \nsession. I should also like to take this opportunity to \npay tribute to the Secretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, \nfor his strong commitment to the reform process in \npursuit of a strong, fully mobile and multifunctional \nUnited Nations. His great efforts and dedication to the \ncause of enhancing peace and security and promoting \nglobal socio-economic development and justice also \ndeserve our praise.  \n The issue of development is becoming \nincreasingly prominent. Today, our world remains far \nfrom secure. Parts of our planet are beset by violence, \nnatural disasters and pandemics. All of humankind \ncontinues to live under the threat of nuclear weapons \nand in fear of terror and the spread of weapons of mass \ndestruction. That fear will become much greater if \nthose weapons fall into the wrong hands. Furthermore, \nthe use or threat of use of force to resolve international \nproblems, together with violations of the sovereignty \nof Member States, persists. That hinders progress in the \nenhancement of international peace and security and \ndevelopment cooperation among Member States. \n Despite the fact that globalization offers new \nopportunities for development, developing countries   \nin particular least developed, landlocked and small \nisland developing States   have not reaped its \nbenefits, as they ought to be able to do. That is due \nprimarily to a lack of basic infrastructure, as well as a \nlack of access to markets, modern technology, \nfinancing and investment. In order to guarantee greater \nbenefits for the most vulnerable countries, the \ninternational community must intensify its concerted \nefforts to assist them in fully and effectively \nimplementing its respective programmes of action, as \ncalled for in the 2005 World Summit Outcome \n(resolution 60/1). This should include strengthened \ninternational partnerships, increased official \ndevelopment assistance, greater market access and \nspecial and preferential tariffs for their exports.  \n Further measures should be taken to ensure debt \nsustainability, technology transfer and the promotion of \nequitable structures of international trade and finance \nin favour of those vulnerable countries. In addition, the \ninternational community should give priority to the \nprovision of both financial assistance, in the form of \ngrant aid or soft loans to those countries, and technical \nassistance. \n The world community is facing challenges caused \nby human activity, such as climate change, which \naffects all nations, rich and poor. Yet the Member \nStates who suffer most from this catastrophe are the \nleast developed countries and small island developing \nStates, due to their lack of resources and capacity for \nadaptation. In that context, I believe that the outcome \nof the High-level Event on Climate Change will \nsignificantly contribute to successful negotiations on a \ncomprehensive agreement under the United Nations \nFramework Convention on Climate Change to deal \nwith the matter.  \n I hereby affirm that efforts to address climate \nchange should not compromise attainment of the \ndevelopment objectives of developing countries. \nAddressing the issue should fully cover the three \npillars of sustainable development. The efforts should \nbe based on the principle of common but differentiated \nresponsibility between the developed and developing \ncountries. In order to enable the developing countries, \nparticularly the two most vulnerable groups among \nthem, to achieve sustainable development and address \nclimate change, the developed countries should provide \nthem with the necessary financing for adaptation, \nmitigation and the transfer of appropriate technology. \n For the United Nations to meet the daunting \nchallenges that lie ahead, it should transform itself into \na strong, efficient and effective organization. To that \nend, the United Nations reform process should be \nconducted in a comprehensive, inclusive, transparent \nand balanced manner. A strong and effective United \nNations would better perform its mandate to maintain \ninternational peace and security through the peaceful \nsettlement of disputes and the promotion of \ninternational cooperation for development. However, \nthe United Nations reform process would not be \ncomplete without the Security Council being \nrestructured into a more legitimate, representative, \ndemocratic and effective organ. \n Like other Member States, the Lao People\u2019s \nDemocratic Republic welcomes the progress achieved \nin the implementation of the outcome of the Six-Party \nTalks on the nuclear issue in the Korean Peninsula. We \nbelieve that through committed efforts by all concerned \nparties, the results of the talks will be fully translated \ninto action, thus contributing to the eventual \ndenuclearization of the region. \n The Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic reaffirms \nits continued support for the General Assembly \nresolutions urging an end to the economic, commercial \nand financial embargo imposed on Cuba. Contrary to \ninternational law and the United Nations Charter, those \ncoercive measures have caused great difficulties and \nlosses to the people of Cuba. \n The prolonged and persistent violence in the \nMiddle East remains a cause of concern to the world \ncommunity. As a result, the Palestinian, Lebanese and \nIraqi peoples have suffered great losses in human life \nand property. The Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic \nreaffirms its support for the Palestinian people in their \nstruggle for the right to self-determination, including \nthe right to establish a sovereign and independent State \nof Palestine, living side by side in peace with Israel \nand other countries in the region. \n The Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic is \nenjoying unwavering peace, political and social \nstability and economic growth. This year is the second \nyear of the continued implementation of the country\u2019s \nsixth Five-Year Socio-Economic Development Plan, \nfor 2006 to 2010. As a result, significant achievements \nhave been recorded. The poverty rate declined from 48 \nper cent in 1990 to 28 per cent in 2005. Opium \ncultivation was completely eradicated in 2006. The \npractice of shifting cultivation declined six times from \n2001 to 2005. Tourism, particularly cultural and \necotourism, has been broadly promoted and expanded, \nthus attracting more and more tourists to the country. \nThe Lao Government continues to pursue a \ndevelopment policy that is aimed at promotion of \nsustainable development, sustained use and \nconservation of natural resources, exploitation of clean \nenergy and protection of the environment and the \necosystem. \n In November 2006, in cooperation with the \nUnited Nations Development Programme, the Lao \nGovernment held the ninth Round-Table Meeting, \nwhich provided a consultative forum for the \ndevelopment partners and various Lao Government \nagencies to engage in a constructive and frank dialogue \non development assistance. The meeting adopted the \nVientiane Declaration on Aid Effectiveness, which \nreflects the commitments of the Lao Government and \nits development partners to improve the coordination \nand effectiveness of official development assistance. \n In pursuance of its foreign policy of peace, \nfriendship and cooperation with all countries in the \nworld, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic has had \ndiplomatic relations with 125 countries and has \nbecome a member of various regional and international \norganizations, with a view to integrating itself into the \nregional and international economic system. One of the \nsignificant events for the Lao People\u2019s Democratic \nRepublic this year is the convening of the twenty-third \nministerial meeting of the International Organization of \nla Francophonie on 20 and 21 November 2007 in \nVientiane. As the host country, the Lao Government \nwould like to encourage all member States to \nparticipate and actively contribute to the success of \nthat meeting. \n To conclude, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic \nRepublic reaffirms its unswerving commitment to \ncontinue cooperating with the international community \nin pursuit of a peaceful, equitable and prosperous \nworld, free of fear and want, in order to ensure the \nwell-being of all peoples on the basis of respect for the \nprinciples of the United Nations Charter and \ninternational law, as well as the recognition of diversity \nand respect for the social, cultural and historic reality \nof each country. To that end, greater efforts and \nsacrifices are definitely required from us all. Yet I am \nsure that together we will be able to make it happen. \n"

        "file_text": "Allow me, first of all, \nto congratulate you, Mr. President, on your election to \nthe high post of President of the General Assembly at \nits sixty-second session. On behalf of my delegation, \nlet me wish you, sir, every success in your important \nmission and assure you of our full support. \n I would like to extend warm words of \nappreciation to your predecessor, Mrs. Haya Rashed \nAl-Khalifa of the Kingdom of Bahrain, whose \nextensive diplomatic experience and skilful guidance \nthroughout the sixty-first session greatly contributed to \nits success. \n Allow me also to take this opportunity to express \nour support for the ambitious plans and consistent \nefforts of the Secretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, to \nre-energize the Organization, strengthen its capacity \nand update the United Nations system in the new \ncentury. \n International terrorism remains one of the most \nserious threats facing humankind today. Last year the \nGeneral Assembly, by adopting the United Nations \nGlobal Counter-Terrorism Strategy, made a concrete \ncontribution to combat terrorism in a coordinated \nmanner at the national, regional and international \nlevels. We believe that the adoption of a definition of \nterrorism during the current session would be a starting \npoint in assessing counter-terrorism measures taken by \neach State. \n My country joined the anti-terrorist coalition at \nits inception and has made a significant contribution to \nits activities. In the last five years, all 13 international \ncounter-terrorism treaties have been ratified by the \nUkrainian Parliament. \n On the governmental level, we support \ninternational anti-terrorist efforts, in particular, through \nparticipation in the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear \nTerrorism. This fall, we plan to organize in Ukraine the \nthird international forum on measures to counteract \nacts of nuclear terrorism with the participation of civil \nsociety, scholars and non-governmental organizations.  \n Disarmament and non-proliferation are among the \nmost important challenges on our agenda. As a country \nthat voluntarily renounced its military nuclear arsenals, \nUkraine is truly disappointed that a world without \nweapons of mass destruction (WMDs) remains a \ndistant dream. \n The international community continues to be \nintimidated by the threat of WMD proliferation. The \nstrengthening of international legal norms and political \ninstrument to prevent WMD proliferation remains a top \npriority. In this regard, I would like to stress the \nimportance of the universalization of the Treaty on the \nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and the \nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, as well as the \nBiological and Toxin Weapons Convention. \nCommemorating in 2007 the tenth anniversary of the \nChemical Weapons Convention (CWC), Ukraine is \nready to contribute to the Organization for the \nProhibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) efforts on \nensuring universal adherence to the CWC, particularly \nby Middle East countries. \n With this in mind, Ukraine proposes to host next \nyear, together with the OPCW, an international \nconference with the participation of, inter alia, \ncountries from the Middle East and North Africa. The \nanticipated outcome of such a conference might be a \njoint statement of the intention of the countries \nconcerned to adhere to the CWC. \n We are convinced that the only way forward is to \nmake simultaneous progress in the areas of both non-\nproliferation and disarmament. \n We cannot but underscore our concerns over the \nrecent tendencies that have already caused the erosion \nof the multilateral regime in the arms control and \ndisarmament spheres with a negative impact on mutual \ntrust and confidence among States. The very recent \nevents around the Treaty on Conventional Armed \nForces in Europe have seriously put into question the \nfuture of this important arms control instrument, \nwidely recognized as the cornerstone of European \nsecurity. \n Speaking about global peace and security, I \ncannot but draw attention to the problem of the \nprotracted conflicts in the GUAM Group area. These \nconflicts create instability and insecurity and constitute \na threat to peace in the region. There is no doubt that \nthese conflicts endanger the sovereignty and territorial \nintegrity of the countries of the region, while also \nhampering their economic and social development. \n We are concerned that numerous international \nefforts to settle those conflicts have yielded no results. \nIt is crucially important that the world community \ncontinue taking practical steps to that end. In our \nopinion, the United Nations, regional organizations and \nother relevant mechanisms should harmoniously \ncomplement one another, using their comparative \nadvantages in peacemaking efforts. \n In this context, I would like to stress Ukraine\u2019s \nunequivocal support for a lasting settlement in Kosovo. \nThat objective cannot be achieved by undertaking \nunilateral steps nor by steps seeking to bypass the \nUnited Nations. A hasty settlement can only destabilize \nthe situation in the region and have negative \nimplications for the entire system of international \nrelations, since similar scenarios could be pursued by \nseparatist entities in other regions. \n Ukraine has always supported United Nations \npeacekeeping efforts, both politically and practically. \nWe are glad to note that the recent noticeable increase \nin peacekeeping activities has taken place in \naccordance with the reform strategy of Peace \nOperations 2010. That is especially important in light \nof the ongoing and expected deployments in the future. \nIn this context, Ukraine supports the Secretary-General \nin his efforts to strengthen the United Nations capacity \nto manage and sustain peace operations. \n I would also like to draw your attention to the \nfact that next year will mark the sixtieth anniversary of \nUnited Nations peacekeeping operations. In this \nregard, our delegation proposes to adopt, at the sixty-\nthird session of the General Assembly, a special \ndeclaration to commemorate this event. \n United Nations credibility will always be \nmeasured by its ability to respond adequately to \nvarious threats in all regions of the world. No \norganization is better equipped to deal with those \nissues. The United Nations should lead multilateral \nefforts with a view to reaching solutions in the interest \nof all. But, to address them effectively, we need to take \nfurther steps in reforming and improving existing \nmechanisms of the United Nations in order to make \nthis Organization more relevant in the twenty-first \ncentury. \n Unfortunately, the process of reforming the \nSecurity Council, which is the key element within the \nprocess of renewing the United Nations, is still only an \nagenda item. We are of the view that the reform \nprocess can only benefit from new, creative approaches \nthat will eventually bring about tangible results. In this \nregard, I would like, once again, to stress Ukraine\u2019s \nposition that one of the necessary elements of Security \nCouncil reform should be the allocation of an \nadditional non-permanent seat to the Group of Eastern \nEuropean and other States, whose membership has \nmore than doubled since 1991. \n In today\u2019s world, adherence to sound economic, \nsocial and environmental policies and good governance \nare the key factors in achieving sustainable \ndevelopment. We share the view, expressed in a \nnumber of statements during this session, that \nsustainable development is a global challenge. Ukraine \nbelieves that only through concerted efforts, using \nuniversal, multilateral mechanisms as well as regional \nand subregional forums, will those challenges be \nadequately addressed. \n For Ukraine and other countries of the region, the \nOrganization of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation \nhas become an important element in achieving \ninternationally agreed Millennium Development Goals.  \n At the same time, the forces of nature, \ncomplemented by reckless and irresponsible human \nbehaviour can disrupt development plans, reshape \ncontinents and even wipe out whole countries from the \nworld\u2019s map. Science has shown, on many occasions, \nthat climate change, global warming and pollution may \ncause sudden and dramatic consequences if not \naddressed in timely, proper and effective ways. Ukraine \nis firmly committed to the international agreements in \nthe area of climate change, including the United \nNations Framework Convention to Combat Climate \nChange and the Kyoto Protocol. \n This year, we marked the twenty-first anniversary \nof the Chernobyl catastrophe, the worst technological \ndisaster ever faced by humankind. Chernobyl severely \naffected my country and the entire region. We call upon \nUnited Nations agencies and individual donors to \ncontinue to provide assistance to the affected States \nand to work together on the implementation of the \nrelevant programmes in a spirit of cooperation. \n Ukraine, as a 2007 coordinator of the Chernobyl \nAgenda, has proposed, together with the Republic of \nBelarus and the Russian Federation, the adoption at the \nsixty-second United Nations General Assembly \nsession, of a new resolution on strengthening \ninternational cooperation to mitigate the consequences \nof the Chernobyl disaster. In this regard, we would \nwelcome broad support for that initiative during this \nGeneral Assembly session. \n Ukraine is approaching the seventy-fifth \nanniversary of one of the most tragic pages in its \nhistory   the Holodomor   or Great Famine. The \nartificial famine of 1932-33, perpetrated by the Soviet \ntotalitarian regime for the purpose of annihilating the \nrural population, the backbone of the Ukrainian nation, \ntook the lives of millions of innocent people. For more \nthan seven decades this horrific crime, which ranks \namong the worst catastrophes ever experienced by \nhumankind, still awaits adequate international \ncondemnation.  \n We sincerely hope that the United Nations, as a \ncollective moral authority and effective instrument in \nsafeguarding human rights and fundamental freedoms, \nwill raise its voice and denounce the horrendous \ndisaster that was purposely inflicted on the Ukrainian \npopulation in the early 1930s. By doing so, due tribute \nwill be paid to honour the memory of millions of our \ncompatriots who were outrageously deprived of their \nlives. It is important to remember the past in order to \nlearn from it and to avoid repeating crimes against \nhumankind in the future. \n A decision of the General Assembly to establish \nan international day of remembrance of victims of \ngenocide would be a worthwhile and timely \ncontribution to the attainment of that goal. Likewise, it \ncould facilitate the effective implementation of the \nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights and the \nConvention on the Prevention and Punishment of the \nCrime of Genocide, as the world approaches the \nsixtieth anniversary of those instruments in 2008. We \nare confident that this event deserves the adoption of a \nspecial resolution.  \n In the context of human rights, Ukraine attaches \ngreat importance to the harmonious coexistence of \ncivilizations, dialogue and cooperation among various \ncultures and peoples. In this regard, we support the \nAlliance of Civilizations established under the \ninitiative of the Prime Ministers of Spain and Turkey, \nand we intend to join the Group of Friends of the \nAlliance in the near future. \n The problems before us are daunting. We believe \nthat the United Nations is the only Organization with \nthe worldwide membership, global reach and universal \nlegitimacy needed to address today\u2019s global threats and \nchallenges, which no country can resolve on its own. \n I take this opportunity to reaffirm Ukraine\u2019s \nreadiness to continue making an active contribution to \nthe further strengthening of our Organization. \n"

        "file_text": "I congratulate the \ndelegation, Government and the people of the Republic \nof Macedonia on Mr. Srgjan Kerim\u2019s election as \nPresident of the sixty-second session of the United \nNations General Assembly. On behalf of my \nGovernment, I acknowledge the astute diplomatic \nskills and wisdom that he brings to this important \nassignment. May he rest assured of my delegation\u2019s \nsupport in his endeavours. \n Similarly, it gives me great pleasure to \ncongratulate our new Secretary-General, Mr. Ban  \nKi-moon, of the Republic of Korea, on his election as \nSecretary-General of this Organization. It is the belief \nof my Government that the United Nations will greatly \nbenefit from his wealth of experience as a seasoned \ndiplomat and statesman. \nNearly two years ago, Liberia held its first post-\nconflict elections, following more than 14 years of \ncivil war. We were strongly supported by the United \nNations, the African Union, the Economic Community \nof West African States (ECOWAS) and members of the \ninternational community, including the United States, \nthe European Union, the People\u2019s Republic of China \nand Japan. We commend you for your continued \nsupport toward our national reconstruction \nprogrammes. \n My Government welcomes and highly appreciates \nthe recent decision of the Security Council to lift the \nsanctions which it saw fit to impose on the timber and \ndiamond sectors in Liberia. We pledge our fullest \ncooperation with the United Nations as it partners our \ncountry\u2019s reform, which undoubtedly will strengthen \nthe good governance procedures. Although the \nimposition of sanctions was considered by many as \npunitive, I am gratified to inform you that the Liberian \npeople viewed the sanctions as prudent and corrective. \nThe sanctions helped to accelerate the adoption of new \nlaws and the institutionalization of appropriate \nmechanisms to ensure that we would never again allow \nconditions such as those that gave rise to their \nimposition. \n We also thank the international community for its \ncontinued support to peacebuilding and the \nstrengthening of instruments of security and stability in \nLiberia. In spite of the gains of peace, Liberia remains \nfragile. The recent decision by the Security Council to \nextend the mandate of the United Nations Mission in \nLiberia (UNMIL) is timely and relevant. Liberia \nremains grateful for that and other decisions aimed at \nsustaining peace and stability in the country. \n Democracy is on an irreversible course in Africa. \nThe values of democratic governance and the rule of \nlaw are also on an upward march. My Government \nnotes with great delight the successful holding of \nrelatively peaceful, free, fair and democratic elections \nin Sierra Leone, Nigeria, Mauritania and Mali. From \nour experience in Liberia, we know that democratic \nelections in themselves do not provide quick answers \nto the monumental problems and challenges that face a \nnew and emerging post-conflict nation. They do, \nhowever, create the environment, and potentially \nunleash opportunities, for freedom and individual \nenterprise to thrive and prosper. Because such \ndemocracies are in their infancy, they need the support \nof bilateral and multilateral partners. We therefore call \non the United Nations, the African Union and bilateral \nand multilateral partners to support all new \ndemocracies and to help us meet the multifaceted needs \nof our people. \n Liberia reaffirms its belief in the United Nations \nas the best institution for the promotion and protection \nof international peace and security and the resolution \nof crises around our world. Our faith in the United \nNations is rooted in our conviction that it represents \nmankind\u2019s best hope and vehicle for the advancement \nof the common purpose of humanity. \n Our generation must avoid the temptation to use \nthe instruments of our common Organization for \nnarrow agendas that undermine its Charter. In this new \nmillennium, the United Nations must continue to renew \nits resolve to promote, protect and sustain the universal \nvirtues of liberty, equality, solidarity, tolerance and \nnon-violence, while simultaneously respecting and \nprotecting our environment, pursuant to the mandate of \nthe Millennium Summit. Liberia commits itself to \nbeing a strong partner and advocate for the promotion \nof these shared values of our common humanity. But as \nthe United Nations pursues those objectives, we must \nrecognize that it cannot expect to succeed using \nframeworks that are nearly three quarters of a century \nold. The United Nations needs to be, and must be, \nreformed.  \n Liberia and other Member States have advanced \npractical suggestions for the reform agenda. Liberia \noffers the following proposals: first, a timely review \nand reconfiguration of the Security Council, including \nthe current decision-making machinery and processes \nof the Organization, should be conducted to make it \nmore relevant and representative of the world \ncommunity; secondly, mechanisms should be put in \nplace to ensure that the Charter remains inviolate; and, \nthirdly, careful consideration should be given to due \nprocess in dealing with Member States. \n Pursuant to our call for reform of the United \nNations, we today call on Member States to give \nmeaning and expression to gender equality. We propose \nthat the United Nations recommit itself to ensuring an \nequitable partnership of women and men in the \nleadership of the Organization. Reforming the United \nNations also means reforming our attitude towards \nwomen and other minority groups worldwide. There is \nno doubt in our mind that women will significantly  \ncontribute to the process of change in this \nOrganization. \n Fully cognizant of the evidence that the dividends \nof peace and security are always greater than the \ndebilitating effects of conflict, Liberia continues to \nwork within the regional framework of the Mano River \nUnion, the Economic Community of West African \nStates (ECOWAS), and the African Union to ensure the \nrealization and advancement of peace in the subregion \nand on the African continent. It is said in my country \nthat there is no capitalism without capital. Peace is \nsustained only with the economic empowerment of all \npeople. \n In that regard, since its inauguration our \nGovernment has engaged in active subregional \ninitiatives to improve and strengthen ties of friendship \nand economic cooperation with our immediate \nneighbours in the Mano River Basin and the ECOWAS \nCommunity. As a result of our efforts, the instruments \nof peace and security and the potential of trade \nrationalization in our subregion are stronger today than \nthey ever were a few years ago. Under the \nchairmanship of Her Excellency President Ellen \nJohnson-Sirleaf, the Mano River Union has assumed a \nnew vibrancy and renewed sense of cohesion and \ncommon purpose. Citizens of the Mano River Union \ncountries are exchanging more frequent visits, and \nundertaking programmes aimed at enhancing \nintegration and peace. That is why we were happy to \nhost President Ernest Bai Koroma a few days following \nhis inauguration as President of Sierra Leone. \n As events in the Middle East continue to claim \nour attention in the world community, we must not lose \nsight of similarly grave situations in Africa. I refer to \nthe continuous humanitarian catastrophe in Darfur in \nthe Sudan, and crises in Somalia, Guinea-Bissau, C\u00f4te \nd\u2019Ivoire, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Chad, Burundi, the \nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, the Central African \nRepublic and Uganda, among others. My Government \ntherefore welcomes Security Council resolution 1769 \n(2007) and the consensus reached for the deployment \nof a hybrid African Union-United Nations force in \nDarfur following months of painstaking negotiations. \nWe further urge countries that have pledged logistical \nand other support to fulfil their promises to ensure the \ntimely deployment of the peacekeeping force in Darfur. \nWe applaud the progress made in the resolution of the \ncrisis in our sisterly Republic of Cote d'Ivoire. My \ndelegation calls for strong support of the Ouagadougou \nagreement, which provides the best possible framework \nfor peace, security and stability in that country. Peace \nand security in Cote d\u2019Ivoire means peace and security \nin Liberia, and indeed, in the Mano River Basin and \nthe Economic Community of West African States. \n The world has witnessed and continues to witness \nphenomenal advances in science and technology \nleading to the transformation of industrialization and \nthe improvement of the human condition. We must \nwork to save our planet, because, when we save our \ncommon Earth, we assure the survival of all of its \ninhabitants. \n Liberia supports the efforts of the Commission on \nSustainable Development, the Kyoto Protocol, the \ndecision reached on Agenda 21 at the 1992 Rio \nConference and the recent high-profile conference \nhosted here on climate change, intended to raise \ninternational awareness of the degradation of the \nenvironment and the need for collaborative efforts to \nreverse negative trends. There could be no theme more \nappropriate and timely for this year\u2019s general debate \nthan the theme \u201cResponding to Climate Change\u201d.  \n This debate will, we are confident, accentuate the \nissues of environment and stimulate increased \ninternational action. Liberia is concerned about the \nrapid degradation of the climate. We hope that this \nsession will produce a consensus on how to save \nsucceeding generations from the impact of \ndeteriorating climate.  \n In our world today, there is a correlation between \nwar, civil conflict and the spread of HIV/AIDS. The \nHIV/AIDS pandemic targets and destroys our human \ncapital, the backbone of our socio-economic \ndevelopment. The records of the United Nations and \nother organizations show that the prevalence of \nHIV/AIDS increases in countries affected by war and \ncivil conflicts, owing to the mass movement of \npopulations. Post-conflict countries therefore need \nspecial attention if the scourge of HIV/AIDS is to be \novercome.  The devastating impact of HIV/AIDS, \nmalaria and other diseases has contributed significantly \nin retarding the progress of the developing nations.  \n African nations must develop the political will to \ncombat the health crisis on our continent. To this end, \nwe call upon our partners in the developed world to \ntreat the issue of antiretroviral drugs as a purely social \nand humanitarian matter of an emergency nature, \noutside of politics. Liberia recently set up its National \nAIDS Commission to advance practical strategies that \nwill help to halt the spread of this deadly disease. We \nare hopeful that prudent action, including a change of \nlife styles coupled with antiviral drugs, will help \naddress this emerging catastrophe.  \n Liberia continues to be burdened by huge debts \nowed to bilateral and multilateral creditors. Servicing \nthese debts remains a major priority of the Government \nof Liberia. However, our capacity to make payment is \nconstrained owing to the severe resource challenges \narising out of a 14-year civil war. There is a traditional \nparable in my country which says that you cannot dig a \nhole to fill a hole. We renew our Government\u2019s plea for \ninternational empathy and favourable consideration of \nour debt cancellation request. \n We reassure all of our bilateral and multilateral \ncreditors of our commitment to continue to work with \nthem to develop the necessary framework toward the \nactualization of Liberia\u2019s debt relief initiatives. \n We also thank all our partners, especially the \nUnited States, Great Britain, China and Germany \namong others, for active steps taken toward debt relief \nfor Liberia.  \n I assure you that after learning a costly lesson in \nviolence, the people of Liberia are determined to settle \ntheir differences through peaceful means. With your \nsupport, we have found a better way to resolve our \ndifferences. We have resolved to forgive one another, \npick up our dignity and pride and move forward in \nunity and oneness of purpose with strong determination \nto work for a better and brighter future. Our unity in \nfostering the faith of our founding fathers to build a \nnation dedicated to freedom, liberty and justice for all \nremains undaunted. \n We are confident that our international partners \nwant to see a success story in Liberia. Let me assure \nthis Assembly that nobody wants that more than \nLiberians themselves! May the Almighty God bless us, \nprotect our sovereignties, unify us, preserve our \ndignities and keep us safe. \n"

        "file_text": "Let me first of \nall say that I am happy to see the former Yugoslav \nRepublic of Macedonia, represented by Ambassador \nKerim, presiding over the General Assembly at its \nsixty-second session. \n My country extends to him wishes for the greatest \nsuccess in accomplishing his mission. We would like to \nassure him of our full cooperation. Please also allow \nme to pay tribute to Ms. Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa of the \nKingdom of Bahrain for the skill with which she \nconducted the work of the sixty-first session.  \n I would also like to welcome the presence among \nus of Mr. Ban Ki-moon, Secretary-General of the \nUnited Nations. I congratulate him on his accession to \nthis post of the highest prestige in our Organization. \nThe vast experience and the qualities of a diplomat that \nhe is known for are a guarantee of success in this lofty \nfunction. I am convinced that he will be able to work \nfor the benefit of our Organization in continuing the \nefforts of his predecessor, Mr. Kofi Annan, to whom I \nwould like once again to pay tribute. \n The general debate in this Assembly is a special \nmoment in international life. Indeed, it is an \nopportunity every year for heads of Member States to \ntake stock of the world\u2019s affairs, to exchange views in \nthis regard and to reflect the aspirations of their \nnations.  \n The sixty-second session of the General \nAssembly opens this year again in a rather troubled \ninternational context. At the dawn of the twenty-first \ncentury, the challenges facing humanity are more \npressing and more complex with each passing day, \ngiving rise alternatively to hope and fears.  \n The first of these challenges to which I would \nlike to refer here today has to do with peace and \nsecurity. International events today highlight even \nmore than before the paramount need to breathe new \nlife into efforts for disarmament and non-proliferation. \nNuclear proliferation is a threat, not only to \ninternational peace and security but also to the very \nsurvival of humankind. Attempts by terrorist \norganizations to acquire weapons of mass destruction \nare also indicative of the reality of this threat. \nTerrorism, indeed, is a particularly great danger to the \ninternational community, a threat that we can only face \nthrough concerted and resolute global action.  \n It is because of this conviction that Cameroon has \nin the past year contributed to the adoption by the \nGeneral Assembly of the Global Counter-Terrorism \nStrategy. Once again, I would like to salute this historic \naccomplishment. For the first time, Member States \nhave decided to take up concrete political, operational \nand legal measures to coordinate their fight against \nterrorism. They have committed themselves to \nstrengthening their capacity to react, as well as the \ncapability of the United Nations in this regard. They \nhave agreed to address situations that could lead to the \nextension of this scourge. Today, the problem is to \napply this fundamental text, both in letter and spirit. \nMy country would like to reaffirm its availability and \nits determination in terms of taking on commitments in \nthis work. \n In many regions around the world, peace and \nsecurity continue to be seriously threatened. For years \nnow, the unrest in the Middle East has been a serious \nthreat to international peace and security. The \nevolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict causes deep \nconcern. It is paramount that Israel and the Palestinian \nAuthority resume a constructive dialogue. That is the \nonly way, in the opinion of my country, to move \nforward toward a settlement. Cameroon is convinced \nthat only the efforts of all concerned parties, supported \nby the Great Powers and based on the principle of two \nStates   Israel and Palestine   coexisting in peace \nand security, will make it possible to reach a definitive, \nfair and just settlement to this conflict. \n In Lebanon, as in Iraq, reconciliation among the \nvarious communities of these countries is the only \nhope for a sustainable stability.  \n In Africa, in spite of initiatives undertaken by the \ninternational community, there remain a number of \nhotbeds of tension. Please allow me to highlight some \nof these.  \n The crisis in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire seems to be reaching a \nturning point. We are convinced that, with the firm and \nsincere commitment of all parties and the support of \nthe international community, this fraternal country will \nhave definitively turned a particularly painful page in \nits history. The people of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, we are sure, \nwill be able to persevere in their choice of peace and \nnational reconciliation. It is extremely important that \nthey work together in good faith for a full and rapid \nimplementation of the Ouagadougou peace agreement. \n The situation in Somalia continues to threaten \npeace and security in the region. Cameroon is deeply \nconcerned by acts of violence in Somalia. We would \nlike to congratulate the mission of the African Union \nfor the support that it has extended to the Transitional \nFederal Institutions. We are sure that the speedy \ndeployment of the envisaged United Nations force will \ndefinitely have a positive effect on the stability in that \ncountry and on the security of the population.  \n The human toll of the Darfur crisis causes \nprofound concern. It seems to us of paramount \nimportance that all efforts be undertaken to break the \ntragic cycle of violence in that region. The effects of \nthe crisis have already been deeply felt by \nneighbouring States and threaten to extend further. It \nshould be understood that Cameroon welcomes the \nannouncement of the deployment of the hybrid United \nNations-African Union peacekeeping operation in \nDarfur. I am convinced that this operation will make it \npossible to stabilize the situation in the area and save \ninnocent lives. My country welcomes the fact that the \nGovernment of Sudan has unconditionally accepted the \ndeployment of this mission. In our opinion, this is a \ndecisive stage in the resolution of the crisis. At the \nsame time, Cameroon believes it is very important to \ncontinue efforts to address the causes of the conflict, \nby relaunching the political process and by \nimplementing a real programme of development in the \nregion, specifically by ensuring access to water \nresources. \n Cameroon follows with close attention the \ndevelopments in the situation in Chad and the Central \nAfrican Republic. Those fraternal countries with which \nwe have long common borders have, for a number of \nyears, been facing instability fomented by various \ninsurgent groups. That situation poses a serious threat \nto peace and stability in those countries and to the \nsecurity and well-being of their populations and \ntriggers a true humanitarian tragedy in the region. It \nalso causes cross-border insecurity that affects other \ncountries in the region, including Cameroon. For that \nreason, my country resolutely supports the upcoming \ndeployment of a multidimensional presence of the \nUnited Nations and the European Union on the borders \nof Chad, the Central African Republic and the Sudan. I \nwish to reiterate from this rostrum that my country is \nready to cooperate fully with the United Nations in the \nimplementation of that operation. \n With regard to the Democratic Republic of the \nCongo we welcome the progress accomplished towards \npeace in terms of establishing democratic institutions \nin that country. The situation in the eastern part of the \ncountry continues to be a source of concern to the \ninternational community. It seems to us that seeking a \nsolution to the crisis of the two Kivus should be based \nfirst and foremost on political and diplomatic methods \ncorresponding to the problem at hand. \n The challenges we must face in terms of peace \nand security are considerable. However, they must not \neclipse in our minds the equally significant challenges \nconfronting us in other areas. It seems crucial to me \nthat every necessary effort be exerted to reach the \nMillennium Development Goals. This year we are \nreaching the midpoint of the timetable we have \nestablished for ourselves in that regard. It is very \nimportant that States live up to the commitments made, \nto the extent possible. The reduction in official \ndevelopment assistance in 2006 underlines the need for \ndonors to try to increase the level of their aid so that \nthe goals set for 2010 and 2015 may be reached. \n Furthermore, I wish again to state the hope that \nthe negotiations of the Doha Round are completed on \nschedule and ensure that the interests of the countries \nof the South are protected and that the globalization of \ntrade retains its significance. \n I cannot remain silent about the terrible \nexperience of thousands of young people from Africa \nwho, for a number of years now, have set forth at risk \nto their lives in their attempts to reach Europe   in \ntheir eyes the new promised land. That migration keeps \nincreasing and is of course attributable to the \ndifference in the level of development between the \nNorth and the South. In that regard, the countries of \norigin, the countries of transit and the receiving \ncountries must intervene to seek humane solutions that \ntake into account the underlying causes of that \nphenomenon. It is indeed clear that neither controls nor \nrepatriation will offer an adequate or sustainable \nresponse to the problem.  \n The issue of climate change is becoming one of \nthe most important and most urgent issues of our time, \nas has been recognized by all, and it is urgent that we \nact. The destinies of future generations depend on that. \nIn that context I wish to congratulate the Secretary-\nGeneral for his initiative in convening the High-level \nEvent on Climate Change, which has just been \nconcluded here. \n The holding of negotiations in December 2007 in \nBali, Indonesia, on the United Nations Framework \nConvention on Climate Change and on the post-Kyoto \nregime should also be a focus of our attention. \nFurthermore, we welcome the intention of the Tunisian \nGovernment to organize from 18 to 20 November \n2007, an international conference on the effects of \nclimate change and strategies for adaptation on the \nAfrican continent and in the Mediterranean region. In \nthat domain we should try to reach a global agreement \nthat would be part of the United Nations Framework \nConvention process and which would tackle the matter \nof climate change in all its aspects. \n The challenges we have just discussed can only \nbe taken up on a global scale. The United Nations \nshould be at the forefront of that struggle and for that \npurpose needs the active cooperation of all its \nMembers, particularly the great Powers. But it should \nalso constantly adapt itself to the changing realities of \nour time so as to be in a position to efficiently fulfil its \nmission.  \n Accordingly, Cameroon attaches the greatest \nimportance to the reform of the United Nations. It \nsupports a progressive, gradual reform of the current \nUnited Nations system which would take into account \nthe changing balances in the world in recent years and \nthe emergence of many new States. It is our intention \nto continue to cooperate with other Member States for \na renewed United Nations, a model of modern and \neffective governance, in its participation in world \naffairs. \n"

        "file_text": "I congratulate His \nExcellency Mr. Srgjan Kerim on his election as \nPresident of the General Assembly at its sixty-second \nsession and pledge Nepal\u2019s support in the successful \nexecution of his duties. I would also like to place on \nrecord our appreciation of the leadership of Her \nExcellency Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa during the \nsixty-first session. My delegation expresses its \nappreciation to the Secretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, \nfor his stewardship of the United Nations and wishes him \na very successful tenure. \n The United Nations today remains the only truly \nglobal Organization to seek solutions to the world\u2019s \nmost pressing issues. The increasing importance of \nmultilateralism has made the United Nations \nindispensable. The principles and purposes enshrined \nin the United Nations Charter should continue to guide \nus to address all the issues that confront us. Nepal has \nadopted these purposes and principles as the basic \ntenets of its foreign policy. \n The General Assembly has before it an important \nagenda that seeks to deal with the world\u2019s most \npressing issues and problems. I fully agree with the \npriorities that the President of the General Assembly \nhas outlined for this session. \n The pledge of a road map for development in the \nform of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) \nremains to be fully achieved. As we approach the half-\nway point, this Assembly should review the progress \nmade to devise ways and means for achieving the full \nand effective implementation of the commitments \nmade in the Millennium Declaration. The follow-up \nconference on Financing for Development to be held in \nDoha in 2008 should be used as an opportunity to \neffectively meet the financing gap and explore \ninnovative ways of financing for development. \n We commend the Secretary-General for \nconvening a high-level meeting on climate change. I \nhope that the momentum generated will pave the way \nfor an agreement on climate change with long-term and \ncomprehensive global commitments beyond 2012, \nstarting the process in Bali later this year. \n Climate change is linked to human security, \nsocial and economic development and environmental \nprotection. Scientific studies point out that a solution to \nclimate change is within human reach and that we can \nachieve it without compromising economic \ndevelopment and human progress, if we start to act \nnow. \n Climate change demands a coordinated and \ncomprehensive global response. As enshrined in the \nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate \nChange, the principle of common but differentiated \nresponsibilities should be the basis for addressing the \nchallenges of climate change. Mandatory targets for \nemissions reduction are necessary in order to stabilize \nthe greenhouse gas concentration in the atmosphere at \nsafe levels. Industrialized countries should assume \nleadership and demonstrate the necessary political will \nin adopting long-term commitments to reduce \nemissions. \n While sea levels are rising, the Himalayan \nglaciers are retreating, and surrounding areas are \nwitnessing an increasing intensity of disasters induced \nby climate-change, such as glacial lake outbursts, \nextreme rainfalls, recurring floods and massive \nlandslides. \n The President returned to the Chair. \n It is ironic that the world\u2019s most vulnerable \ncountries, such as least developed and small island \ncountries, get the worst affects of climate change \nalthough they are the least responsible for the same. In \nthe new compact in climate change, there should be \nspecial provisions for addressing the mitigation and \nadaptation needs of the least developed countries \n(LDCs) and small island nations to address their \nspecial vulnerabilities. \n Nepal stands firm against any form of terrorism. \nWe have been implementing the provisions of various \nUnited Nations Security Council resolutions to combat \ninternational terrorism. Effective implementation of the \nprovisions of the United Nations global counter-\nterrorism study adopted last year can foster \ninternational cooperation against terrorism. We call for \nan early conclusion of a comprehensive convention on \ninternational terrorism. There should be a coordinated \nglobal response, including through the mechanism at \nthe United Nations, to address the underlying social, \neconomic and political causes of the existence and \nspread of global terrorism. \n Reform of the United Nations has constantly \nengaged us. We need to reflect contemporary realities \nfor making the Organization more effective, \nrepresentative, responsive and capable of handling the \nincreasingly complex global problems. The General \nAssembly needs to be further strengthened as a true \ndecision-making body. We should develop an effective \nmechanism to implement its decisions. \n The reform of the United Nations should include \nreform of its Security Council. We support extending \nmembership in both permanent and non-permanent \ncategories to reflect the realities of the day. We feel \nthat India, Brazil, Germany and Japan deserve \npermanent places in the expanded Council, while \nAfrica should also be fairly represented. We also \nfavour a tangible improvement in the working methods \nof the Council, and we welcome the agreement that the \nGeneral Assembly should start the intergovernmental \nnegotiations on this important issue as soon as \npossible. \n Nepal welcomes the restructuring of the \npeacekeeping-related departments of the United \nNations Secretariat, including the creation of a new \nDepartment of Field Support. In view of the increasing \ncomplexity and size of the peacekeeping operations, \nwe hope these changes will further enhance \neffectiveness of peacekeeping operations and ensure \nthe safety and security of peacekeeping personnel. \n Nepal has continuously participated in the in \nUnited Nations peacekeeping operations for last five \ndecades. To this date, Nepal has sent more than 60,000 \ntroops to over 30 United Nations missions. At present, \nNepal is the fourth largest contributor of troops and \npolice personnel to United Nations peacekeeping \nmissions. Nepalese Blue Helmets have been \ncommended for performing extremely well in all \ncircumstances. Many have sacrificed their invaluable \nlives to the cause of peace worldwide. \n Peacekeeping is the soul of the United Nations, \nits largest function and the most successful invention in \nthe realm of international relations. This enterprise can \nsucceed only with meaningful participation of troop-\ncontributing countries in decision-making processes \nand their increasing role in senior positions. \n Nepal stands for general and complete \ndisarmament of all weapons of mass destruction, \nincluding biological, chemical and nuclear weapons \nunder effective international control in a time-bound \nmanner. \n We are concerned by the lack of progress in \nmajor multilateral negotiations in disarmament, \nincluding in nuclear disarmament, and in control of \nillegal proliferation of small arms and light weapons. \nWe call upon Member States, especially the nuclear \nweapon States, to step up measures for disarmament to \nrelease much-needed dividends for development. We \nhope that the newly established office of High \nRepresentative for Disarmament Affairs will infuse \ndynamism into the process. \n We look forward to the inauguration of the \nUnited Nations Regional Centre for Peace and \nDisarmament for Asia and the Pacific soon in \nKathmandu, in accordance with resolution 61/94, \nadopted by the Assembly last year for relocation of this \ncentre. The Government of Nepal and the United \nNations Secretariat have already signed the host \ncountry agreement and the memorandum of \nunderstanding to this effect. Through this Centre, \nNepal is committed to revitalizing the process of \nregional disarmament, including the Kathmandu \nprocess. \n The ideals of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) \nremain as valid today as they were when the Movement \nwas founded. The principled position of the NAM \ncountries should guide the Assembly\u2019s deliberations. I \nwish to reiterate Nepal\u2019s commitment to the principles \nof the Non-Aligned Movement, including the \nprinciples of non-interference in internal affairs and the \npeaceful coexistence of States. \n The Group of 77 and China has become highly \nrelevant in advancing the interests of the developing \ncountries in the United Nations. The Assembly should \ncontinue to protect the interests of the developing \ncountries. We also need to advance meaningful South-\nSouth cooperation to complement global partnership \nand North-South cooperation. \n We call for concerted efforts to address the \nspecial needs and difficulties of the LDCs and the \nlandlocked developing countries, including the \nnegative impacts and marginalization of globalization. \nWe urge the developed countries to meet the targeted \nofficial development assistance to the LDCs, give \nproducts of the LDCs duty-free, quota-free and \nunhindered market access and extend debt relief \nmeasures to cover all LDCs. We should ensure \neffective implementation of the Brussels Programme of \nAction for LDCs for the rest of decade, based on the \nmid-term review held last year. \n I would like to draw the attention of the \ndevelopment partners to addressing the special needs \nof the LDCs emerging from conflict and the need to \nsupport them financially and technically, to help them \nachieve sustained peace and development and prevent a \nrelapse into the conflict situation. \n The landlocked developing countries face special \ndifficulties in the transit and transport of goods and \nservices to and from the sea. The Almaty Programme \nshould be sincerely implemented for meaningful \ncooperation in transit, transport and trade facilitation in \nthe landlocked developing countries. The mid-term \nreview process of the Programme, to be held in 2008, \nshould focus on fulfilling gaps in implementation of \nthe agreed commitments. \n We must not further delay the World Trade \nOrganization trade negotiations for advancing the Doha \nDevelopment Agenda. Those negotiations should find \nways to further protect the interests of the least \ndeveloped and landlocked countries to make them able \nto compete in global markets. In particular, the \ninternational community must meet the resources gap, \noperationalize aid for trade initiatives, strengthen \ntrading capacities and support trade adjustment costs in \nthe LDCs and the landlocked developing countries.  \n Nepal welcomes the proposal for United Nations \nsystem-wide coherence on development, environment \nand humanitarian issues. This process should \nstrengthen the national and regional focus and country \nownership of development programmes. \n We support effective gender architecture in the \nUnited Nations and an even stronger regional and \ncountry presence of the United Nations on gender \nissues. Nepal accords high priority to promotion of \nwomen\u2019s right, gender equality and the empowerment \nof women. A parliamentary declaration adopted on  \n30 May 2006 has provided for equal property and \ncitizenship rights to women and for their representation \nin at least one third of the elected bodies, including in \nthe Parliament. \n Nepal is committed to the protection and \npromotion of the rights of children, including those \naffected by conflict. The peace agreement provides for \nimmediate release of children if found recruited as \ncombatants and their rehabilitation and integration \nback into their families. The Government is committed \nto implementing recommendations of the Security \nCouncil Working Group on Children and Armed \nConflict in Nepal. \n The United Nations has been rather slow to \nrespond to the world\u2019s major conflicts and \nhumanitarian crises, in places ranging from the Middle \nEast to Darfur and Somalia. Although the agreement on \nthe African Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in \nDarfur is a step forward, there were missed \nopportunities in addressing the long-standing \nhumanitarian crisis in that region. \n The situations in Afghanistan and Iraq demand \nmore proactive United Nations engagement. The \nOrganization should continue to play a constructive \nrole in helping those countries to achieve stabilization, \nnational unity and reconciliation. \n We support the democratic aspirations of people \nall over the world. We hope that a solution to \nMyanmar\u2019s internal situation will be found by the \npeople of that country through dialogue and the \ndemocratic process. \n Since 1990, Nepal has been sheltering more than \n100,000 refugees from Bhutan on humanitarian \ngrounds. There is a stalemate in this long-standing \ncrisis, mainly because of Bhutan\u2019s reluctance to \nimplement the agreements already reached or to engage \nin negotiations with a view to finding some other \nacceptable solution. That procrastination has caused \nrefugees to run out of patience. The true solution to \nthis problem lies in giving refugees the opportunity to \nbe able to return to Bhutan and to participate in the \ncountry\u2019s political process in a fully democratic way, \ntaking into account the people\u2019s cultural diversity and \nhuman rights. However, we are positively considering \nthe offers made by some countries to give refugees the \nvoluntary option of third-country resettlement, should \nthey so choose it, as part of a provisional solution. That \nshould not absolve Bhutan of its responsibility towards \nits exiled citizens, which is a problem between the \nrefugees and the Bhutanese regime. Nepal appreciates \nthe continued humanitarian assistance extended by the \ninternational community, the Office of the United \nNations High Commissioner for Refugees and other \nagencies for the care of refugees. \n Nepal is in the process of leaving behind its \ndecade-long internal conflict though a unique and \ninternally driven peace process. We are committed to \nbringing that process to a successful conclusion. The \nGovernment is engaged in dialogue with the \nCommunist Party of Nepal (Maoist) to ensure that the \nelections to the Constituent Assembly are held on \n22 November, thus sincerely honouring and \nimplementing the commitments set out in the peace \nagreements.  \n It was through dialogue that the Government of \nNepal recently concluded agreements with the leaders \nof the Madhesi Janajati movement, enabling them to a \nhave stronger voice in the political arena and broader \nrepresentation in the Constituent Assembly. \n Despite the challenges associated with the peace \nprocess, the Government is determined to hold the \nelections to the Constituent Assembly on time. With \nthe necessary technical, legal and logistical \ncompetence, the Election Commission has made \npreparations for holding the elections as scheduled and \nin a free and fair manner. I would like to invite friendly \ncountries and organizations to send observers to Nepal \nduring the elections. \n The people of Nepal have expressed their desire \nfor a peaceful political and socio-economic \ntransformation. They have spoken out in favour of an \ninclusive, democratic and participatory restructuring of \nthe State. I have every confidence that the peace \nprocess will reap numerous dividends for the Nepalese \npeople through the creation of a new Nepal. In that \nprocess, we expect generous assistance from our \ndevelopment partners, including assistance in meeting \nNepal\u2019s reconstruction and development needs. \n On behalf of the people and the Government of \nNepal, I wish to express sincere gratitude to the \ninternational community for its strong support and \nsolidarity during our struggle for democracy and our \nongoing peace process. \n Last year, we invited the United Nations to \nfacilitate the peace process through arms monitoring \nand through technical support for the Constituent \nAssembly elections. We express our appreciation to the \nSecretary-General for his personal attention and \ninterest in assisting the peace process. We also \ncommend the role played by the United Nations \nMission in Nepal in that process. \n The Government is steadfast in protecting and \npromoting human rights, in keeping with its \ninternational commitments. We welcome the adoption \nby the Human Rights Council of the universal periodic \nreview of all Member States. That exercise should be \nfree from politicization, selectivity and double \nstandards. \n There has been a remarkable improvement in the \nprotection of human rights in Nepal since the start of \nthe peace process. The Government has extended full \ncooperation to the Office of the High Commissioner \nfor Human Rights in Nepal. The recent appointment of \nmembers of the National Human Rights Commission of \nNepal is expected to further enhance our national \ncapability to protect and promote human rights. \n The Government is determined to bring an end to \nthe environment of impunity that was present during \nthe armed conflict. We hope that the establishment of a \ntruth and reconciliation commission, as stipulated in \nthe peace agreement, will also help us to put our past \nbehind us and to prevent a recurrence of such grave \nhuman rights violations.  \n As a nation that has a diverse ethnic composition \nand that is home to various indigenous peoples, Nepal \nwelcomes the adoption of the United Nations \nDeclaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples by the \nGeneral Assembly this year. We hope that the \nDeclaration will serve as a useful reference for \nindigenous issues throughout the world. \n In conclusion, the General Assembly has before it \nan important opportunity to address the most pressing \nissues of our times   issues that are of lasting \nsignificance. We should strive to advance agreements \nto address climate change, follow up on the \nMillennium Development Goals, seek new resources \nfor development financing, break the impasse in the \nnegotiations on trade and disarmament and reform the \nSecurity Council. We should also seek solutions to \nunresolved conflicts and humanitarian crises. \n Today, the world's major problems demand the \nleadership of the United Nations. We should rise to the \noccasion and demonstrate our ability to work together \nto solve urgent problems that confront us. Solutions to \nmost global problems are within our reach if we act in \nunison, guided by our collective wisdom and reason. \nTogether, we can make progress in all these areas. I \npledge Nepal\u2019s constructive participation in arriving at \nimportant decisions on all these issues here at the \nUnited Nations. \n The President: Before proceeding further, I \nwould like to remind members that, as announced in \ntoday\u2019s Journal, the informal meeting of the plenary to \nobserve the first International Day of Non-Violence \nwill be held tomorrow, 2 October, from 9.30 to 10 a.m. \nin this Hall. All are invited to attend. \n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, the Holy See takes this opportunity to \ncongratulate you on your election and looks forward to \nworking with you. At the same time, it is my pleasure \nto greet the Secretary-General, His Excellency \nMr. Ban Ki-moon, and wish him well at his first full \nsession of the General Assembly. \n Less than a year ago, the General Assembly \napproved the project to renovate these United Nations \nHeadquarters. Such material renovation seems an \nappropriate reminder for States of the need to be \nconstantly renewed in the pursuit of the great \nobjectives that inspired the creation of the Organization \nof the United Nations.  \n Sixty-two years ago, the United Nations was \nestablished in order to save future generations from the \nscourge of war, to reaffirm faith in fundamental human \nrights and in the dignity and value of the human \nperson, to ensure respect for international law and to \npromote social progress in universal freedom. Today, \nonce more, we must reaffirm those values in order to \ndeliver a forceful \u201cno\u201d to war and an equally forceful \n\u201cyes\u201d to human dignity. \n The Preamble of the Charter of the United \nNations, in its reference to the fundamental rights and \nthe dignity of the human person, uses the word \u201cfaith\u201d \nand links it to dialogue and cooperation among nations. \nIn this way it is affirmed that there is such a thing as \nuniversal and transcendent truth about man and his \ninnate dignity, which is not only prior to all political \nactivity but determines it, so that no ideology of power \ncan eliminate it. \n This innate dignity also determines the just \nmeasure of national interests, which may never be \nconsidered absolute, and in defence of which not only \nis it never right to harm the legitimate interests of other \nStates, but there is an obligation at the same time to \nhelp promote the common good of all people. Respect \nfor human dignity, therefore, is the deepest ethical \nfoundation in the search for peace and in the building \nup of international relations corresponding to the \nauthentic needs and hopes of all the peoples of the \nEarth. To forget or to accept partially and selectively \nthat principle is what lies at the origin of conflict, \nenvironmental degradation and social and economic \ninjustice. \n The terrorist attacks that marked the beginning of \nthe twenty-first century have given rise to pessimistic \nvisions of humanity based on a supposed clash of \ncivilizations. At times, people respond by returning to \nextreme forms of nationalism, or by extending \njustification for the use of force, or by further \nrelativizing values essentially tied to human dignity, in \nparticular the universal right to life and to religious \nfreedom. \n Nowadays, the binomial \u201cculture and religion\u201d is \nincreasingly heard in this Hall. The Holy See welcomes \nthe initiative to hold a High-level Dialogue on \nInterreligious and Intercultural Understanding and \nCooperation for Peace, which will take place here on  \n5 October under the leadership of the General \nAssembly President. Indeed, dialogue among peoples \nof different cultures and religions is not an option; it is \nsomething that is indispensable for peace and for the \nrenewal of international life. \n The Holy See hopes that the increased interest on \nthe part of non-religious bodies and institutions will \ncontribute to a greater respect for religious freedom \neverywhere. Today, the right to religious freedom \ncontinues to be disregarded, and even violated, in \ncertain places. Such violations have become a pretext \nfor various other forms of discrimination. If religious \nleaders and believers expect States and societies to \nrespect them and acknowledge their religions to be true \ninstruments of peace, they themselves must respect \nreligious freedom; they must show that they pledge to \npromote peace and shun violence; they must \ndemonstrate that religion is not and must not become a \npretext for conflict; and they must declare without \nambiguity that to promote violence or to wage war in \nthe name of religion is a blatant contradiction. \n At the difficult crossroads at which humanity \nfinds itself today, the use of force no longer represents \na sustainable solution. It is important to help the \nConference on Disarmament find a way out of the \nimpasse in which it has been languishing for more than \na decade, to relieve the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation \nof Nuclear Weapons from the severe strain to which it \nhas been increasingly subjected lately, and to give new \nimpetus to recognizing the value of the Comprehensive \nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. This year\u2019s fiftieth \nanniversary of the entry into force of the Statute of the \nInternational Atomic Energy Agency is a most fitting \noccasion to reaffirm our commitment to a peaceful \nfuture through the non-proliferation of nuclear \nweapons, the reduction and definitive dismantling of \nexisting nuclear weapons and the non-discriminatory, \npeaceful and safe use of nuclear technology. \n Moreover, this Organization must take further \nsteps on arms control in the field of conventional \nweapons, including small arms and light weapons. The \nHoly See associates itself with all appeals that \nunderline the importance of adopting a common \napproach aimed at combating not only illegal traffic in \nsuch weapons but also other connected activities, such \nas terrorism, organized crime and trafficking in drugs \nand in precious raw materials. \n Another important area in which the Holy See \nurges serious and effective action on the part of the \ninternational community is that of cluster munitions. A \nrapid response to this problem is becoming an ethical \nimperative because of the high cost in human life, the \nmajority of the victims being civilians, especially \nchildren. \n This Organization has expressed its willingness \nmany times to devote more resources to conflict \nprevention, particularly in the area of mediation. In this \nregard, the Holy See has a particular interest in the \nefforts of the Department of Political Affairs to create a \nstanding team of expert mediators as part of the \nSecretary-General\u2019s goal to make more effective use of \nhis good offices for conflict prevention. While the \nmultiplication of peace operations could mean that \nthere has been a failure to prevent conflict situations \nfrom erupting into full-scale armed conflicts, it is also \na sign of the trust that the international community \nplaces in the mechanisms of the United Nations and in \ntheir cooperation with regional agencies. In this \ncontext, we look forward to the day that peacekeeping \nefforts in Darfur will finally be fully operational. \n I wish to recall the contribution of the United \nNations towards a just and final solution to the \nconflicts that for too long have caused bloodshed in the \nMiddle East. There is need for renewed commitment \non the part of all Member countries in the pacification \nand reconstruction of long-suffering Iraq, a \nreconstruction that is more moral and political than \neconomic. There is a need for renewed commitment in \nthe search for a solution through dialogue of the \nconflict between Israelis and Palestinians, one which is \ncapable of recognizing the legitimate expectations of \neach side.  \n Renewed commitment is needed in ensuring that \nLebanon will continue to be a free and independent \ncountry, a democratic, multicultural and multi-\nconfessional society, equitable and respectful of all \npeople and of the various trends present in its midst, \nlike a common home open to others. This is \nparticularly necessary in the present crucial period \nleading to an election of the new head of State. \n Finally, I cannot but make reference to what is \nhappening in Myanmar, which these days occupies the \nattention and concerns of the General Assembly and of \nthe whole international community. I wish to reiterate \nthe appeal made yesterday by Pope Benedict XVI: \nthrough dialogue, good will and a spirit of humanity, \nmay a solution to the crisis be found quickly for the \ngood of the country and a better future for all its \ninhabitants. \n The creation two years ago of the Peacebuilding \nCommission was based upon the conviction that it is \nnot enough to put an end to wars, but it is also \nnecessary to help reconstruct individual lives and the \nsocial and institutional fabric. Now, the biggest test for \nthe international community is to give the \nPeacebuilding Commission the mandate and the means \nto prove on the ground that it can successfully manage \nand support the difficult transition from war and \nmisery to peace and development. \n Many of the problems that are attributed today \nalmost exclusively to cultural and religious differences \nhave their origin in economic and social injustice. \nFreedom from want, illness, hunger and ignorance is a \nnecessary precondition for a serene dialogue of \ncivilizations. Forty years ago, in his encyclical \nPopulorum Progressio, Pope Paul VI stated that \ndevelopment is the new name for peace. The Holy See \nis concerned about the inability of rich countries to \noffer the poorest countries, especially those in Africa, \nfinancial and trade conditions capable of promoting \ntheir sustainable development. \n I salute the high-level event on climate change \nheld here on 24 September. The Holy See wishes to \nunderline once again the moral imperative incumbent \nupon each and every one of us in safeguarding the \nenvironment   our fundamental common good. \n We are approaching the sixtieth anniversary of \nthe Universal Declaration of Human Rights, yet many \nhave never heard of it or been given the benefits of its \nprinciples. Those rights are not based on the mere will \nof human beings, or in the reality of the State or in \npublic powers, but rather are grounded in the objective \nrequirements of the nature bestowed on man. \n The most important part of our work in that \ncontext is to ensure that the right to life is respected \neverywhere. That fundamental right must be protected \nfrom conception until natural death. Therefore, we \nmust work to stop and reverse the culture of death \nembraced by some social and legal structures that try to \nmake the suppression of life acceptable by disguising it \nas a medical or social service. In that sense, the \nabolition of the death penalty should also be seen as a \nconsequence of full respect for the right to life. \n The legitimate quest for equality between men \nand women has achieved positive results. Nevertheless, \ninequalities in the exercise of basic human rights \nunfortunately still persist in many places. That leads to \na breakdown in the social fabric and results in women\u2019s \nobjectification and exploitation. The vindication of \nequality needs to be accompanied by the awareness \nthat it goes hand in hand with and does not endanger, \nmuch less contradict, the recognition of both the \ndifference and the complementarity between men and \nwomen. \n The Holy See looks forward to the \ncommemorative high-level meeting on the follow-up to \nthe outcome of the special session on children, \nscheduled for 11 and 12 December 2007. It will be an  \nopportunity to refocus our commitments to children \nand to redouble our efforts to promote their rights, end \nviolence against them and support the family. \n Faith in human dignity demands that the problem \nof migration be approached in the context of human \nrights, family rights and children\u2019s rights. While it is \nessential to fight human trafficking and legitimate to \ncurb illegal migration, no one can justify measures \nwhich put lives at risk or gravely offend human dignity \nand human rights. The Holy See welcomes the \nmomentum created by the first meeting of the Global \nForum on Migration and Development, held in \nBrussels in July, and looks forward to more progress in \nthat regard. \n We must continue to ensure that peace and \nsecurity and development and human rights are \neffectively combined and mutually reinforcing, in \norder to show the international community that the \nrenovation of United Nations Headquarters is not only \nphysical, but also a renewal of the Organization\u2019s \nideals and intentions. A renewal that reaches into the \ndeepest corners of the Organization is one in which all \nnations of the world will rightly take pride. \n"

        "file_text": "I am happy to have this \nopportunity to address the General Assembly at its \nsixty-second session. I convey my congratulations \nMr. Kerim on his election as President of the Assembly \nat this session. The Malawi Government would like to \nassure him of our support in carrying out his duties as \nPresident. \n I also take this opportunity to thank our hosts, \nPresident George W. Bush and the Government and the \npeople of the United States of America, for the \nhospitality accorded to me and my delegation since our \narrival in the state of New York. \n I commend the previous President of the \nAssembly, Her Excellency Sheikha Haya Rashed \nAl Khalifa, for the sterling leadership, direction and \nguidance she gave in steering the Assembly at its sixty-\nfirst session. \n I wish to focus my address on Malawi\u2019s efforts to \nmeet the objectives of the Millennium Development \nGoals (MDGs). Malawi believes that the MDGs are the \ntools for enhancing growth and development and for \nimproving the livelihood of people in the poor \ncountries of the world. I am pleased to state that my \ncountry is making steady progress in the \nimplementation of the MDGs. We have adopted the \nMalawi Growth and Development Strategy as a home-\ngrown overarching national policy for creating new \nwealth, for achieving sustainable economic growth and \ndevelopment and for combating the poverty that still \nengulfs many of our people. \n The people of Malawi share a common vision to \neliminate poverty in the shortest period possible by \ntransforming the country from a predominantly \nimporting and consuming to a predominantly \nmanufacturing and exporting economy. That, we \nbelieve, will enable our country to position itself \nwithin the global economy and to compete favourably \nin the world markets. \n To achieve that vision, we are implementing a \nsound system of economic governance in both the \npublic and private sectors. That includes fighting \ncorruption, reform of the public and private sectors, \nsafeguarding human rights and the rule of law, \nincreasing social protection for vulnerable groups, and \ndeveloping infrastructure for development. My \nGovernment has also placed research, science and \ntechnology, including information and communications \ntechnology, gender empowerment and environmental \nprotection, at the top of our development paradigm. \n Based on the limitation of our resources, financial \nand human alike, we have identified six priorities \nwithin priorities that we believe can pull Malawi out of \nthe poverty trap. Those include agricultural \ndevelopment and food security, irrigation and water \ndevelopment, transport and communications \ninfrastructure development, energy and power, \nintegrated rural development, and management and \nprevention of HIV and AIDS. I am pleased to report \nthat the Malawi Government began to implement those \npriorities in 2004 and that, by 2006, we had achieved a \nphenomenal growth rate of 8.5 per cent. We therefore \nbelieve that the selection of these top priorities is a \ngood one. We are also implementing an effective \nsystem of income distribution targeting the rural poor. I \ncan therefore boldly say that the Malawi Government \nis confident that most of the Millennium Development \nGoals will be met or even surpassed by the year 2015. \n I now wish to briefly review some of the \nMillennium Development Goals. For instance, we are \ncertain to decrease by half the proportion of the \npopulation that suffers from extreme poverty and \nhunger, and to improve their nutritional status by the \nyear 2015. Malawi has also made significant progress \nin the past three years in reducing poverty. In 1998, for \ninstance, people living below the poverty line \nrepresented 53.9 per cent of the total population. That \nnumber was reduced to 45 per cent in 2006.  \n For the past two years, Malawi has achieved a \nhigh rate of agricultural production and food security. \nPresently, Malawi has a food surplus amounting to 1.4 \nmillion metric tons over and above our national food \nrequirement. We are now able to export food to other \ncountries in southern Africa. \n Malawi has one of the highest budgetary \nallocations to agriculture and food security. We are \nempowering smallholder farmers to access essential \nfarm inputs, mainly seeds and fertilizer, through a \nsubsidy programme. We also support the development \nof viable small-, medium- and large-scale irrigation \nschemes to reduce dependence on rain-fed agriculture. \n The other aspect of the MDGs that Malawi \nconsiders critical is the reduction in maternal and child \nmortality. Here again, my country has achieved \nremarkable progress, largely through the adoption of \nthe Essential Health Package as the main strategy for \nthe delivery of a cost-effective package of health \nservices through a donor-funded sector-wide approach \nprogramme. We are also addressing the challenge to \nreduce the under-five mortality rate by two thirds by \nthe year 2015 and to reduce the maternal mortality \nratio by three quarters. \n We have identified several highly preventable and \ntreatable diseases, such as malaria, pneumonia, \ndiarrhoea and malnutrition. Malawi is therefore on \ntrack towards attaining the Millennium Development \nGoals. We have reduced the rate of child deaths per \n1,000 from 189 live births in 2000 to 133 in 2006. \n In the fight against malaria, Malawi has so far \ndistributed about 5 million insecticide-treated mosquito \nnets to various households. The percentage of pregnant \nwomen and children under five sleeping under treated \nnets increased from 8 per cent in 2000 to 20 per cent in \n2006. In 2007, we plan to give out 3 million more \nmosquito nets with support from the Global Fund and \nPresident George Bush\u2019s Malaria Initiative in that area. \n One of Malawi\u2019s biggest challenges is the \nmanagement and prevention of tuberculosis, whose \nprevalence rate is very high, especially with regard to \npatients having HIV and AIDS. The Malawi \nGovernment has therefore declared tuberculosis to be \nan emergency and launched a five-year plan for \naddressing the problem. \n I am pleased to state that Malawi is one of the \nfew African countries that have been successful in \nmeeting the challenges of the HIV/AIDS pandemic. \nMalawi has also been successful in its public \nawareness campaign about the HIV/AIDS epidemic \nand its consequences. In 2004, Malawi had 14 \nvoluntary counselling and testing centres, and those \nhave now been increased to 250. Over 5 million people \nwithin Malawi have been tested within a period of less \nthan three years. With the support of the Bill Clinton \nFoundation, Malawi now has over 130,000 people \nreceiving free antiretroviral drugs. Additionally, in the \nprevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV and \nAIDS, we are now reaching over 60 per cent of \npregnant women in Malawi. The General Assembly \nmay wish to note that the Malawi national HIV and \nAIDS and antiretroviral therapy programmes are \namong the fastest growing in the world and that the \npandemic is showing signs of a decline. \n I wish to reiterate the statement I made to this \nAssembly in 2006 that we should regard HIV and \nAIDS not only as a medical crisis, but also as having \neconomic, socio-cultural and political dimensions. That \nbeing the case, the solution to the crisis must be \ncomprehensive and holistic. I have therefore \nestablished a Department of Nutrition, HIV and AIDS \nin my Office as a technical arm in implementing the \nMillennium Development Goals. I am also pleased to \nreport that, from 2004 to date, Malawi has developed a \nnational nutrition policy and accompanying documents \nas a guide for action. As a result, 350,000 orphans are \nnow getting nutrition support. That has reduced the \nnegative impacts of malnutrition, HIV and AIDS, such \nas absenteeism, and many of those affected now return \nto work quickly and are reintegrated into the economy. \n The Government of Malawi recognizes that water \nis life. We have therefore placed high priority on the \ndevelopment of our water resources. We are \nrehabilitating water-supply schemes and are \nconstructing many earthen dams country-wide to allow \nrural communities access to clean water. Currently, \nabout 66 per cent of the population has access to safe \nand clean water. Malawi is therefore confident that the \nMDG on access to water for all will be achieved before \n2015. \n In the area of universal primary education, the \nMDGs have set the target for universal primary \neducation for both boys and girls. Malawi has a very \nhigh budget allocation for education, science and \ntechnology, in order to meet the relevant MDG. To \ndate, 60 per cent of Malawi\u2019s children are enrolled in \nprimary schools. We are also creating a conductive \nteaching and learning environment in order to reduce \nabsenteeism, poor performance and drop-out rates. \n Malawi is on the right path to achieving the Goal \non the management of natural resources and \nenvironmental sustainability. We have reviewed our \nnatural resources policies, legislation and programmes \nto curb the misuse and abuse of natural resources and \nto prevent environmental degradation. My Government \nis involving rural communities in the management of \nsuch existing resources as forestry, as well as in annual \nnational tree planting for reforestation and the \nprevention of soil erosion and desertification. \nFurthermore, the Government is implementing \nmanagement programmes for the sequestration of \ncarbon, as well as other ecosystem services to \nencourage the extensive planting of trees. \n In the area of gender equality the MDGs set out \nto promote gender equality and the empowerment of \nwomen by integrating targeted programmes for women \nto enable them to become part of economic growth. \nMalawi has a high level of female adult illiteracy, \nnamely, 48 per cent   as compared to 24 per cent for \nmen. However, girls in Malawi also have a high drop-\nout rate from the formal schooling system, as well as \nhigh vulnerability to HIV and AIDS infection. We are \naddressing those problems. \n My Government is also empowering women in \nthe political, economic and social areas. In the past \nthree years, there have been more women in ministerial \nand other management positions than ever before. The \nfollowing key positions are now held by women: the \nposts of attorney-general, deputy governor of the \nReserve Bank of Malawi, five full Cabinet ministers, \none deputy minister, chairperson of the human rights \ncommission, clerk of Parliament and several \nambassadors, principal secretaries and chairpersons of \nstatutory corporations. \n I would like to conclude by stating that Malawi \nhas successfully positioned itself to attain the MDGs. \nWe are optimistic that many of those objectives will be \nattained. We therefore appeal to the United Nations to \nrecognize Malawi\u2019s heroic efforts and assist us to \nmaintain the development momentum.  \n I would also like to appeal to our development \npartners to support Malawi\u2019s policy to manufacture \nnew goods and to provide new services to meet the \nMDGs. We need support to conduct our own research \nand to apply science and technology   including \ninformation and communication technology   to \ncreate new wealth, to build new capacity and to move \nMalawi from poverty to prosperity. \n"

        "file_text": "The pleasure is mine at \nthis juncture, to join the other Members of the United \nNations family in congratulating you, Mr. President on \nyour election as President of the General Assembly at \nits sixty-second session. We wish you success in all \nyour efforts and assure you of our full cooperation. We \nalso wish to express our appreciation to your \npredecessor, Sheika Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa, for the \ndiligent manner in which she spearheaded the work of \nthis body at its sixty-first session. \nIn similar vein, we express our continued support \nfor the endeavours of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. \nWe are confident that he will continue to provide \ncommitted leadership to this Organization in the \ndefence and promotion of its noble principles and \nvalues in every corner of the globe.  \n I begin my address on a sad note. It is with much \npain that I must inform this body that the person who \nbrought Saint Lucia to independence and consequently \nto this body and who, but for the will of the Almighty \nwould have addressed you today   Sir John George \nMelvin Compton, our first and latest Prime Minister   \nwas laid to rest in Saint Lucia last Tuesday, \n18 September. Our nation and region suffered a great \nloss, but we remain committed to seizing every \nopportunity to carry on his life\u2019s work of aiding the \ncause that needs assistance against the wrong that \nneeds resistance, and in so doing continue to honour \nhim. What I am about to say reflects his thoughts on \nand aspirations for this Assembly and for the United \nNations Organization in general.  \n We note that a significant part of our journey \ntowards the realization of the Millennium Development \nGoals (MDGs) has been covered in terms of time and \nthat in some respects there has been some achievement \nto date. However, it is also true that only mixed \nprogress, regionally and internationally, has been \nrecorded so far. Millions continue to live in conditions \nof abject poverty, despite the commitments made in \n2000 and 2005. The sad fact is that a great deal of work \nstill remains to be done, and urgently, if we are to \nachieve the MDGs and see real changes in the \nconditions of existence for such large numbers of \npeople. \n We would be well advised to embark upon a \nperiod of serious reflection and stock-taking, an \nexercise involving an honest assessment of our \nachievements and failures, with a view to repositioning \nourselves as necessary to ensure that we achieve the \nnoble objectives set out in the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals by the projected year 2015.  \n On our own front, Saint Lucia has made \nsignificant strides over the years towards the \nachievement of the MDGs. We intend to continue on a \nsteady path towards that end. Not only has the country \nattained universal primary education, but a programme \nof universal access to free secondary education for our \nyoung citizens has been introduced. \n Saint Lucia\u2019s progress in the health sector is also \nevident. Over the last 25 years, the country has \nexperienced significant improvements in most health-\nrelated indicators, including life expectancy, \nimmunization coverage and infant mortality, while \nsignificant reductions have been experienced in respect \nof communicable diseases and lifestyle-related \nillnesses. A universal programme of free health care is \ncurrently in the early stages of implementation. \n Over the years, too, Saint Lucia has consistently \nworked toward a reduction in the incidence of \nnon-communicable diseases. Serious attention has also \nbeen given to combating the HIV/AIDS problem, \nwhich remains a major challenge to Saint Lucia and \nother countries in the Caribbean region. Efforts to \naddress this issue are being pursued, mainly through \neducation, including the elimination of stigma \nassociated with this disease, early detection and \ntreatment programmes and the provision of free or \nsubsidized antiretroviral drugs. \n As a small island developing State, Saint Lucia \nfinds it beneficial to undertake this daunting task \nthrough regional and international cooperation. \nAccordingly, through the Pan-Caribbean Partnership \nagainst HIV/AIDS, we collaborate with other countries \nin the wider Caribbean region in addressing the \npandemic. While this regional mechanism, which \nincludes the 15 members of the Caribbean Community \n(CARICOM) as well as other countries in the wider \nCaribbean region, has facilitated our cooperative \napproach to addressing this challenge, it is clear that \nincreased and sustained international cooperation is \ncritical to our efforts if we are to succeed in our fight \nagainst this disease. In this regard, we welcome the \nassistance being provided by the Global Fund to Fight \nAIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, working with other \npartners, and we look forward to its continued support. \n Let me take this opportunity to thank our \ntraditional friends and donors, such as the United \nKingdom, the United States, Canada, France, the \nEuropean Union and the Commonwealth, to name the \nmost prominent, who over the years have provided \nmuch financial and technical assistance to our country \nand to the region. We also welcome the contribution of \nthose other States and institutions that have \ndemonstrated their readiness to work with us in the \nrealization of our development objectives. We are, of \ncourse, always willing to develop new beneficial \nrelationships and to collaborate with all who \nunderstand and appreciate our efforts and our \nprinciples. In this regard, we take special note of the \nannouncement by Norway of its pledge of $1 billion \nover 10 years to support the Millennium Goals on child \nand maternal support. \n Within the context of South-South cooperation, \nSaint Lucia will continue to work with other \ndeveloping country partners in its quest for economic \nand social development. In the light of the positive \nbenefits gained from cooperation programmes with \nthose partners, we remain convinced that, according to \nthe United Nations Development Programme \nAdministrator\u2019s report on this issue, South-South \ncooperation is one of the main drivers of development \neffectiveness, requiring its integration in the \ndevelopment cooperation activities of all the \norganizations in the United Nations system.  \n Saint Lucia therefore welcomes continued United \nNations support for efforts geared towards \nstrengthening and advancing South-South cooperation. \nWe are convinced that this cooperation modality should \nbe strengthened in partnership with our developed \ncountry partners and other stakeholders and should \ntherefore complement rather than substitute for North-\nSouth cooperation. \n The Government of Saint Lucia reiterates its \ncommitment to the ideals of regionalism and to the \ndeepening of the integration process within our region. \nSaint Lucia continues to partner with sister States of \nthe Organization of Eastern Caribbean States and the \nwider Caribbean Community (CARICOM) to develop \nmechanisms, including the Eastern Caribbean States \nEconomic Union and the Caribbean Community Single \nMarket and Economy, to enhance the prospects for \nimproving the quality of life of our people. We \ntherefore welcome the assistance of this body and that \nof those who have travelled the road to regionalism \nbefore us. \n Saint Lucia is pleased to note that Haiti\u2019s march \ntoward democratic governance, recommenced just over \none year ago, continues to be assisted and sustained by \nthe generous efforts of the international community. \nWhile we had hoped for a longer mandate period for \nthe United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti in \nthat country, we accept the decision of the Security \nCouncil to extend that mandate to enable it to continue \nto work towards ensuring that Haiti\u2019s political and \nsocial stability are restored and maintained.  \n Under no circumstance should Haiti be left \nstranded in midstream, as the consequences would be \ntoo catastrophic to contemplate. We continue, \ntherefore, to call for the sustained release of pledged \ndevelopment resources so that the Government and the \npeople of Haiti may continue to meaningfully, and in a \nsustainable manner, address the numerous challenges \nfacing their country. \n Saint Lucia places great importance on the \nfollow-up of the international development agenda \nespoused in the Monterrey Consensus on financing for \ndevelopment. Given the plethora of challenges \nconfronting developing countries such as Saint Lucia \nin this increasingly globalized and inequitable \ninternational economy, financing for development \ncontinues to be key to the achievement of the MDGs \nand the internationally agreed development goals. \n Saint Lucia recognizes the important \ncommitments made over the years by some developed \ncountry partners with regard to development finance. \nWe also appreciate the pledges made to significantly \nimprove the level of official development assistance \n(ODA) in order to achieve the goal of 0.7 per cent of \ndeveloped countries\u2019 gross domestic product. \nMoreover, we are pleased about the Group of Eight \ndecision in 2005 to forgive the debt of some African \ncountries, and its more recent decision to double \ndevelopment assistance to Africa. \n We lament, however, that, despite these \ncommitments, development assistance declined in \n2006. Moreover, development financing continued to \nbe subject to conditionalities imposed by donors and \nfailed to meet and support the nationally defined \npriorities of developing countries. It is our hope that \nthe 2008 Doha Review Conference will seriously \naddress those concerns in the light of the significance \nof financing for development at this stage of our \njourney towards 2015. \n Saint Lucia is well aware of the increasing \ninterdependence that characterizes this international \ncommunity, the importance of building partnerships \nand the need to work within a multilateral framework \nin order to meet the challenges of this century. For this \nreason, we welcome the continued search for ways to \nreposition the United Nations system so it can better \nfulfil its mandate in accordance with its Charter. While \nwe are conscious of the magnitude of the task of \nreforming the United Nations, we remain confident that \nMember States will bring the requisite political will to \nbear on the process. \n Saint Lucia continues to underscore the \nimportance of social and economic development, basic \nhuman rights, mutual respect and goodwill among \nnations, and their relevance to the maintenance of \ninternational peace and security. For these reasons, we \nare concerned that peace and security remain the \nexclusive preserve of the Security Council and a few \nselect Member States. Saint Lucia continues to support \nreform and expansion of the Security Council aimed at \nmaking it more representative. It is our hope that this \nreform would reflect the role and contribution of \ndeveloping countries in helping to resolve the ever-\ngrowing and increasingly complex challenges of \ntoday\u2019s world. \n Many, if not all of our countries celebrate our \nsovereignty with pomp, ceremony and pride, and in \naccordance with that sovereignty, we take our seat in \nthis body. All of the rules and requirements for \nmembership are spelled out in the Charter of our noble \ninstitution. Within this body our relationship with our \npartners is based on a commitment to the principles of \nmutual respect and understanding. For this reason, we \nrecognize that the Republic of China   Taiwan   a \ndemocratic country of over 23 million people, has \ncontinued to abide by the principles enshrined in the \nCharter of the United Nations, although it is not a \nMember of the United Nations. Taiwan has made \nsignificant contributions to global development by \nproviding economic and technical assistance to other \ndeveloping countries in their pursuit of development \nand their attainment of the MDGs. \n We believe that sovereignty is derived from the \nwill of peoples and from the realization or actualization \nof the right to self-determination. We are therefore \nsaddened that the will of the people of Taiwan, \nexpressed by their duly elected representatives, \ncontinues to be ignored by this body. Saint Lucia \ntherefore looks forward to the day when Taiwan will \nassume its place alongside other countries of the world \nin the halls of this Organization. \n For small States, peace and security are critical to \ntheir sustainable development. Thus, the spread of \nsmall arms to our region continues to be an especially \ndisturbing issue and is a major contributing factor to \ncrime and insecurity. This situation is particularly \nironic given the fact that neither arms nor ammunition \nare produced in our region. We therefore call on those \nStates that produce small arms and ammunition to \nenact appropriate measures to reduce their illicit \nexport, which threatens the security and stability of the \nCaribbean. \n Saint Lucia and other small island developing \nStates continue to express concerns about our extreme \nvulnerability to the adverse impacts of climate change. \nSmall islands and low-lying coastal areas are \nthreatened daily by the impact of a rising sea level, \nwhile others are already experiencing the untold effects \ncreated by the increase in the melting of polar ice and \nthe consequent loss of significant portions of their land \nmass.  \n For us, this climate change issue is directly \nrelated to our development. It threatens the very core \nof our social, economic and political security. It \nthreatens our very existence. \n The dangers we face as a result of the hazardous \nlevel of greenhouse gas concentrations in the \natmosphere are well known and documented. Urgent, \nresolute action is therefore required to reverse this \nsituation. \n Saint Lucia welcomes the efforts currently being \nmade to place the issue of climate change more visibly \non the agenda of the United Nations. We acknowledge \nthe recent G-8 commitment to work positively within \nthe framework of the United Nations Framework \nConvention on Climate Change to address the issue. \nWe maintain the view that this important issue should \nbe discussed within the appropriate forums in order not \nto lose sight of the real development-related objectives \nthat vulnerable small island developing countries like \nSaint Lucia are seeking to promote. \n Saint Lucia joins with other members of the \nAlliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) in calling for \nthe problems of the rise of sea level and climate change \nto be addressed as a matter of urgency. We will \ncontinue to play our part through the development of \nappropriate national development strategies and the \ncreation of mechanisms to enable us to mitigate against \nand adapt to the adverse impact of climate change. We \nstress, however, that the largest producers of \ngreenhouse gases must bear the responsibility for the \ndamage being caused to the global environment and in \nparticular to the vulnerable countries whose \nsustainability and very existence are increasingly \nthreatened by their actions. \n We remain concerned that the international \ncommunity has yet to honour its responsibility and \ncommitment to the full implementation of the \nMauritius Strategy for the Further Implementation of \nthe Programme of Action for the Sustainable \nDevelopment of Small Island Developing States. We \ninsist on the urgent and proper mainstreaming of the \nStrategy into the appropriate work programmes of the \nUnited Nations agencies and international conventions. \nWe look forward to the thirteenth meeting of the \nConference of Parties on Bali in Indonesia in \nDecember of this year, where we hope significant \nnegotiations will be launched with a view to seriously \naddressing the disastrous effects of climate change on \nsmall island developing States. It is our wish that this \nConference of Parties should seek to achieve \nsubstantial and legally binding emission reductions in \nthe shortest possible period, as well as explore ways to \nsignificantly increase the level of resources available to \ndeveloping countries, and to the small island \ndeveloping States, in particular, to assist in adapting to \nthe impacts of climate change. \n While economic and trade policy reform, in \nprinciple, holds much promise for small developing \ncountries, the international community must \nunderstand that the \u201cone size fits all\u201d approach to trade \narrangements is inappropriate and unrealistic and will \nnot advance the cause of equitable global economic \ndevelopment. This approach has led to a reversal in \nmany small States of the progress made through hard \nwork and sacrifice by their populations.  \n This fact is most evident in the case of Saint \nLucia and other small banana- and sugar-producing \ncountries of the Eastern Caribbean. The mindless \napplication of inappropriate rules has caused much \npain among the same populations that are being \nchallenged to meet the MDGs. Saint Lucia therefore \nreiterates its call for the establishment of a set of \ntrading rules flexible enough to take into account the \nconcerns of small States, assist them in promoting \neconomic development, provide opportunities for their \npeople and, consequently, assist them in achieving the \nMDGs by the stipulated deadline date. \n Lastly, and looking towards the future, children \nare the future, and poverty impacts children \ndisproportionately, seriously affecting their ability to \nachieve. Unless we can all maintain the development \nmomentum achieved by previous generations, the \nfuture of our children, and indeed our societies, will be \ncharacterized by insecurity. \n Saint Lucia therefore looks forward to the high-\nlevel plenary meeting devoted to the follow-up to the \noutcome of the special session on children, to be \nconvened in December to evaluate progress made in \nthe implementation of the Declaration and Plan of \nAction (resolution S-27/2, annex), bearing in mind that \nseveral of the time-bound and quantified commitments \nshould have already been met. \n We in Saint Lucia will continue to spend a \nconsiderable amount of our resources on our children, \nand we hope that the international community will \ncome to the aid of all those who recognize the future in \nchildren, providing for them an enabling environment \nfor advancement through opportunity, safety, love and \npeace. \n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, at the outset I should like to offer you \nmy sincere congratulations on your brilliant election to \nthe presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-\nsecond session. I assure you of my delegation\u2019s full \ncooperation. It will spare no effort to contribute to the \nsuccess of the deliberations of this session, at your \nside, of course, because Benin is one of the Vice-\nPresidents. \n I also pay tribute to the excellent job done by \nyour predecessor, Her Excellency Mrs. Haya Rashed \nAl-Khalifa. Throughout her term she was able to give \nnew momentum to the General Assembly by \nrelaunching the dialogue on the implementation of the \nglobal partnership for development. Under her clear \ndirection our delegations were able to thoroughly study \nthe many questions that have been pending within the \nframework of the implementation of the conclusions of \nthe 2005 Summit, and they have been able to assess the \nchallenges to be met.  \n We also express appreciation to the new United \nNations Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Ban \nKi-moon. He has been able to follow in the footsteps of \nhis illustrious predecessor, Mr. Kofi Annan, by \nmaintaining the pace of his reforms. Mr. Ban has not \nonly maintained the momentum of the reforms but has \nalso given them a visible personal mark that denotes a \nwill to streamline in an innovative and consensual way \nthe use of resources available for concrete action in \nkeeping with the perils that confront us.  \n We support the United Nations, which must assert \nitself as an effective organization, capable of serving as \na melting pot for multilateral, inclusive, productive and  \nconclusive cooperation in the search for appropriate \nsolutions to the many challenges of our time. \n These challenges include ongoing conflicts, the \nrise of extremism, the weakening and destabilization of \nentire regions, the continued impoverishment of the \nmost vulnerable populations and the practice of trade \nsubsidies and protectionism in developed countries. \nThey deny us our comparative advantages and stifle \nour producers by distorting the international market. It \nis necessary and urgent to establish a safety net so that \nAfrican countries affected by subsidies can compensate \nfor the enormous losses that they suffer. In addition, \nsocial inequalities between States and within our \nsocieties are ever greater. The proliferation of endemic \ndiseases decimates human resources. Malnutrition, \ndesertification and coastal erosion dangerously reduce \nvital space and accentuate competition for survival, \ntogether with repeated flooding resulting from global \nwarming linked to climate change. \n We have indeed made considerable progress since \nthe Rio Summit in terms of the implementation of \ninstruments for global governance in the area of the \nenvironment. Given the warnings and many alarms that \nscientists have sent us in recent years we now need to \naccelerate their comprehensive implementation, \nbecause they give clear guidance to the efforts \nundertaken by men to restore control over phenomena \nand changes that jeopardize the conditions of our \nexistence on Earth. It is urgent to maximize synergies \nwithin the framework of the implementation of these \ninstruments to ensure greater effectiveness. That is one \nof the urgent tasks to be put on the agenda of the \nConference of the Parties to the United Nations \nFramework Convention on Climate Change scheduled \nfor December 2007 in Bali, Indonesia. \n The risks stemming from climate change are \nterrifying, particularly for low-income coastal \ncountries such as Benin. They dictate that we act in \nadvance instead of in response because we need to deal \nwith well-established contingencies via a precautionary \napproach and by consistent implementation of the \nprinciple of common but differentiated responsibility. \nBeyond the vast investments required to deal with \ncoastal erosion and the deterioration of lands, the \neradication of poverty and improving the living \nconditions of the poorest sections of the population are \nessential aspects of efforts undertaken to strengthen the \nresistance of our societies to the negative impacts of \nclimate change.  \n Above all we must increase our efforts to \ntransform our patterns of consumption and global \nenergy policies by using renewable energy sources. By \nway of example, switching from firewood to solar \nstoves would save many hectares of forests that are \nannually decimated by the poorest populations to \nensure their energy supplies. It has been established \nthat the manner in which the world\u2019s energy needs, \nparticularly those of developing countries, will be \ncovered in the decades to come will be key to our \nability to address climate change. We need to carry out \na change of mindset to bring about a change in \nbehaviour. To do this, the question of financing needs \nto be resolved in a clearly understood spirit of \ninternational solidarity and interdependence. \n The international community will need to deliver \non the pledges made in Monterrey and Gleneagles by \nmobilizing the funds to ensure implementation of the \nnational programmes of action and adaptation and the \nimplementation of the Millennium Development Goals. \nIt is fortunate that the high-level dialogue to be held in \nNew York on 23 and 24 October 2007 and the meeting \nto be held in Qatar in 2008 will give us an opportunity \nto bring about a thorough evaluation of the situation in \norder to seek the optimum solutions to the problems \nbefore us.  \n Assessing performance in the area of financing \nfor development is how we should measure the \neffectiveness of international financial institutions. Our \nhope is that appropriate reforms will be undertaken so \nthat they will be able to fully shoulder their \nresponsibilities in terms of mobilizing resources for \npoor countries so that they can make up the lag. \n Special attention needs to be given also to \ninternal constraints related to governance and to the \nmeagre mobilization of local resources that curb \neconomic and social development. The Government of \nBenin, for example, has intensified its efforts to root \nout corruption and promote transparent and effective \nmanagement of public finances. Our efforts in these \nareas are coupled with measures to facilitate \ninvestment, including the establishment of a \npresidential investment council and the proclamation \nof free nursery and primary schooling, measures that \nhave been judged to be essential for the continued \nstrengthening of democracy, economic growth and \nsocial progress. The assistance from the international \ncommunity is greatly appreciated and is now being \ndirected exclusively to the goals agreed upon. In this \nregard, Benin has joined the peer review mechanism \ninstituted by the African Union within the framework \nof the promotion of good governance and \npeacebuilding continent-wide. \n Our search for solutions to the new threats can \nonly progress if we are able to preserve international \npeace and security. It is disappointing that our efforts \nsince the 2005 Summit to reform the body which has \nthe primary responsibility for this, have been less than \nconclusive. We need to rekindle our fervour in order to \ngive the Organization a Security Council that is more \nrepresentative in terms of its membership and more \ntransparent and effective in its working methods. \nWhatever the formula decided upon, reform of the \nSecurity Council cannot be viable if it does not take \ninto account the realities of today\u2019s world, which differ \ngreatly from those of the 1940s. It cannot be fair if it \ndoes not rationally rectify the boundless harm done to \nAfrica by excluding it from the category of permanent \nmembers of the Security Council. \n Reform of the Council will undoubtedly reflect \non its authority and its ability to fulfil its mandate in a \nsatisfactory manner with respect to the situations \nconcerning the fundamental principles of the Charter, \nsuch as the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian conflict, which \nis more than 50 years old now. That conflict continues \nto destabilize the Middle East, and it cannot be \notherwise so long as the vision of two sovereign, \ncontiguous States has not been implemented and the \noccupied territories, including the Golan Heights and \nthe Shaba\u2019a farmlands, have not been returned. \n We are also concerned by the continued arms race \nand the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, \nas well as the stalemate in the multilateral negotiations. \nWe need to stem the illicit trafficking in small arms and \nlight weapons by adopting and implementing a treaty \non arms trafficking. The proliferation of non-State \narmed groups, widespread violations of international \nhumanitarian law and war crimes against civilian \npopulations, particularly against women and children \nin situations of conflict, must continue to be given our \nunswerving attention. The perpetrators of these crimes \nneed to be tried by the International Criminal Court, \nwhose role as a deterrent needs to be enhanced by \ngreater cooperation with the Security Council and the \nauthority to initiate proceedings itself. We welcome the \nfact that great progress has been made in the \ndeployment of a United Nations mechanism for \nmonitoring and outreach on the recruitment and use of \nchildren in armed conflicts and on the possibility of it \nbeing extended. \n Cooperation between the United Nations and the \nAfrican Union within the framework of the \nimplementation of the Union\u2019s 10-year plan of support \nfor capacity-building needs to be continued in \naccordance with the spirit of Chapter VIII of the \nCharter. Management of the situation in Darfur has \ngiven us a field for experimentation that will enable us \nto draw lessons to strengthen the effectiveness of this \ncooperation beyond the constraints and handicaps by \nlooking at optimal solutions. We welcome the \nestablishment of the hybrid force. Our hope is that its \nnumerical and logistical capacities will enable it to \ndeal with the crisis. We hope that similar efforts will be \nundertaken for Somalia. \n The promotion of human dignity is necessary to \nbe able continually to strengthen international peace \nand security. It is at the heart of the Universal \nDeclaration of Human Rights, proclaimed on \n10 December 1948. We commemorate its sixtieth \nanniversary next year. This is an opportunity to \nundertake singular and proactive action to disseminate \nhuman rights for rural and peri-urban populations and \ncommunities, which are for the most part illiterate. \nThese social strata have been cut off from the benefits \nof human rights but would be empowered and would \nbecome responsible for their own fulfilment if given \naccess to human rights.  \n My country, which is firmly committed to \ndemocracy, here reiterates its unswerving commitment \nto make an effective contribution commensurate with \nits means to the protection and promotion of human \ndignity. That is the aim of my country\u2019s proposal for a \nnew agenda item at the current session of the General \nAssembly with the consensus title of \u201cCelebration of \nthe sixtieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of \nHuman Rights\u201d. A draft resolution will be submitted \nand negotiated under this item. It could also serve as \nthe framework for the proclamation of an international \nyear for the promotion, dissemination and \nappropriation of human rights. \n In that connection, my country, together with the \nUnited Nations Democracy Fund (UNDEF) and all \ninterested parties, proposes to organize an international \nconference in 2008 on the challenges and issues \ninvolved in democratic changes of government. I urge \nall United Nations Member States to support these  \ninitiatives so that they will come to pass for the \nbetterment of our peoples. \n"

        "file_text": "I am honoured to join \nprevious delegations in congratulating the President on \nhis election as President of this Assembly at its sixty-\nsecond session. Let me assure him of Grenada\u2019s \nunconditional support as he guides our important and \ncrucial deliberations towards a fruitful and tangible \nconclusion. \n I also take this opportunity to pay tribute to Mrs. \nHaya Rashed Al-Khalifa, who laboured tirelessly \nduring her presidency of the Assembly at its sixty-first \nsession, and to her timely and productive initiatives. In \naddition, my delegation would like to renew its support \nto the Secretary-General in his endeavour to advance \nthe agenda of the United Nations and to make it more \neffective. \n In his opening remarks to this General Assembly \nthe President identified five areas as our priorities: \nclimate change, economic development, the \nMillennium Development Goals, terrorism and United \nNations reform. Grenada salutes that vision in \nrecognizing the critical issues facing our world today, \nand it is through this lens that I would like to project \nthe views of my country. \n On the question of climate change, we applaud \nthe Secretary-General for convening the recently \nconcluded High-level Event on Climate Change, and \nwe are satisfied that this will provide the stimulus and \nmomentum required for the forthcoming negotiations \nin Bali. Indeed, for this sixty-second session, my \ndelegation welcomes the tremendous emphasis being \nplaced on climate change and, based on the statements \nmade thus far, we are heartened to note the \noverwhelming commitment to preparing a better world \nfor our future generations.  \n The recently concluded event was not our first \nattempt. Climate change was also addressed in Rio de \nJaneiro, Barbados and Mauritius. It seems that we are \nblessed with a penchant for songs of praise in this \nmultilateral temple of commitment and sacrifice. The \nchorus of our voices reverberates loudly in these halls \nof wisdom, only to sound a hollow note as we exit the \narchways of these chambers and backslide into reality. \nAs in all of these conferences, the real challenge that \nwe face is to convert what seems like a religious \nfervour into good deeds in the neighbourhood of our \nglobal village. As we preach, so too must we become \nconverts. Let us move from resolutions to results. \n As we head towards Bali, we must craft a \nnegotiating table that extends well beyond the \ndimensions of the intergovernmental process. That \ntable must have seats for the unborn generations, as \nwell as seats for this generation wishing to taste the \nsocial and economic prosperity of a new world order. \n Because of sea-level rise, we in the small island \nStates face the spectre of environmental refugees and \nour people are already being displaced. For example, \nthe Maldives with its 1,900 islands, that country has \nundertaken significant expenditure building sea \ndefences and in creating safe zone resettlements for its \npeople. \n The low-lying islands and countries of the world \ndeserve a far more robust and accountable response \nfrom the international community. In that regard, we \nwelcome the investigation in the Maldives of the \nhuman dimensions of climate change. \n As Grenada knows so well, the effects of climate \nchange represent the most dangerous threat to the \neconomic development, peace and security and \nterritorial existence of small island States. We therefore \nwelcome the efforts of the British Mission here in New \nYork, which has worked ceaselessly to raise awareness \nand understanding of the threat posed by climate \nchange, echoing the very concerns that many small \nStates and low-lying coastal nations have raised over \nthe last 15 years. \n In fact, one thing that has become painfully clear \nto Grenada is how easily   in the blink of an eye   \nan entire country can be flattened. In our case, it was \nthe eye of Hurricane Ivan. Hurricanes and cyclones are \nappearing in unusual latitudes and with greater \nferocity. They are appearing further south in the \nAtlantic, affecting islands like Grenada, and they are \nappearing further north in the Indian Ocean and hit the \nSeychelles for the first time in 50 years. Just this \nsummer we have seen two category five hurricanes, \nDean and Felix, make landfall in the Caribbean within \ntwo weeks of each other, causing loss of lives and \nhundreds of millions of dollars in damages. \n In Grenada\u2019s case, the destruction was twice its \ngross domestic product. However, with the help of \nGod, the resilience of the Grenadian people, the help \nfrom our Caribbean and international friends including \nthe United States of America, and with the leadership \nof my Prime Minister, we continue our aspirations to \nbuild back better. In that regard, I would like to pay \nspecial tribute to the People\u2019s Republic of China, \nwhose generous assistance and commitment to our \ndevelopment have been greatly appreciated by the \nGovernment and the people of Grenada. Because of \ntheir help, Grenada was able to host Cricket World Cup \n2007 at our new stadium, which was financed and \nconstructed by the People\u2019s Republic of China. \n Despite all concerted efforts, climate change has \nled to a downward assessment of our sovereign credit \nrating and Grenada is now under the guidance of the \nInternational Monetary Fund. Grenada cannot borrow \nmoney on the international market to replant its \nnutmeg, to mend its coastal infrastructure, or to \nupgrade its tourism industry. As a result, we have \nimposed a reconstruction levy on our people, at a time \nwhen global energy and food prices are increasing. The \neconomic burden of global warming is hitting the \npockets of ordinary women and men in the streets of \nGrenada, the poor farmer, the hardworking teacher and \nthe waiters and waitresses in our hotels. Those ordinary \nisland citizens are paying the price for the lifestyles of \nthe major emitters. \n A new paradigm is needed within the United \nNations system and the Bretton Woods institutions. \nWithin that paradigm must lie an understanding that \nsmall island developing States have an environmental \nand economic vulnerability that warrants a new set of \nmetrics, a new set of rules and a new level of support. \n As we head towards a post-2012 agreement, we \nneed aggressive mitigation targets. Those targets are \ncritical for us, because sea temperature rise is already \ncausing bleaching of the coastal reefs. Loss of those \necosystems has a harmful impact on fish stocks, one of \nour main sources of protein and foreign exchange. \n The Caribbean Community Climate Change \nCentre has said that a further one degree temperature \nrise will lead to significant loss of tuna and dolphin \nstocks. And to compound the matter, in Mauritius and \nthe Seychelles, tuna stocks are diving deeper seeking \ncooler waters. In recent years, the fish catch has \ndwindled and revenues have diminished. To alleviate \nthose problems, more investment is now needed in new \nstudies, as well as in fishing technologies, equipment \nand practices. \n As we approach the Bali meeting, Grenada \nreiterates its position, articulated by the Alliance of \nSmall Island States, that the viability and adaptability \nof the most vulnerable, such as small island developing \nStates, must be the fundamental benchmark against \nwhich all negotiations are framed. In the efforts to \nmitigate climate change, no nation must be left behind. \nLet that be our guiding principle, if we are to make \nmeaningful progress in Bali. \n While these negotiations are ongoing, my country \nand many other islands and low-lying countries are \ntaking all necessary steps to cushion the fallouts and \ndislocations. Adaptation funding and funding for \neconomic development are almost indivisible. \n Grenada calls for the urgent completion of the \ninstitutional arrangements for the Adaptation Fund, in a \nmanner that guarantees that priority should be given to \nthe needs of the small island developing States. On the \nquestion of the Global Environmental Facility, we \nwelcome the energy, enthusiasm and flexibility of its \nnew Chief Executive Officer. We are, however, \ndisappointed with the implications of the Resource \nAllocation Framework. Nonetheless, we look forward \nto strengthening the working relationship with the \nFacility following reforms that make it more \nresponsive to the needs of small island States. \nClimate change, energy, economic development \nand the Millennium Development Goals are so tightly \ninterwoven that over the long term, we cannot tease out \nany one thread without weakening the fabric of our \ncommon aspirations for prosperity and peace. \n It is well known that women are the most affected \nby poverty and suffer the highest levels of \nmarginalization. As the United Nations continues its \nstudy of the issue of gender architecture and the \ngeneral advancement of women, Grenada sees the \nempowerment of women as being critical for our own \ndevelopment. We therefore urge other States to \ncontribute to the many bodies of the United Nations \nthat promote and seek to secure avenues for women in \nthe development process. Let us contribute to their \nbudgets and not to their demise; for even if only a few \nbenefit, that sets the stage for others to follow. In our \nview, the advancement of women represents a most \npowerful force for social and economic progress. \nInvestment in gender mainstreaming is an investment \nin social justice, economic diversity and political \nstability. \n The United Nations must lead by example. \nGuided by the tenets of the Millennium Development \nGoals, Grenada is working assiduously to improve the \nstatus of women. Several years ago only a few women \nheld high political or other public offices in Grenada, \nbut today we are proud to report that approximately 50 \nper cent of the Cabinet of our executive branch is made \nup of women and that many others hold top positions \nwithin the public service. \n The challenge facing the vulnerable States of the \nworld can be resolved only if we ourselves transform \nour thinking and reform our methodologies. For that \nreason, we support the revitalization of the General \nAssembly. My delegation joins the call for the \nexpansion of the membership of the Security Council \nin both categories to allow for a Council more \nrepresentative of the 192 States and five regions which \nit represents. That way we can achieve much in \nassembling a stronger and more powerful Council \nwhich will be better able to fulfil its mandate in a fair, \njust and transparent manner. \n Grenada, as small as it is, has the honour to \nhighlight its humble but valuable contribution to the \nsecuring of stability in Haiti. This year Grenada has \nincreased its deployment of police personnel to the \nUnited Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti. We \nencourage others to give whatever support they can, no \nmatter how minute, to the efforts of international \npeacekeeping initiatives. We are, however, hopeful that \nvery soon our unit and others like it will no longer be \nneeded. \n In closing, I must indicate that despite the \nchallenges I have outlined relating to our economic \nviability and territorial integrity, we still have to pay \nclose attention to terrorism and other threats to world \npeace and security. Grenada therefore remains steadfast \nin its commitment to the international community to \nfight terrorism in all its forms and to ensure that the \nseeds of that poisonous weed never take root on our \nshores. Grenada is convinced that a free and \ndemocratic world is our best hope and therefore \npledges its full support towards the betterment of lives \nworldwide. I call on all nations, big and small, rich and \npoor, to contribute even more to that noble task. \n We are all obviously singing from the same song \nsheet. Let us harmonize the sound of our voices to \namplify action for the citizens of our world. It must \necho triumphantly across the generations, so that when \nit is replayed with fidelity to our children and our \ngrandchildren they will listen with dignity, and not \nwith disdain. \n"

        "file_text": "Allow me to begin by \nexpressing my sincere appreciation and congratulations \nto you, Mr. President, upon your election to the \npresidency of the United Nations General Assembly at \nits sixty-second session and to wish you full success in \nthis challenging endeavour. At the same time, I should \nlike to extend my appreciation to Her Excellency \nSheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa for her excellent \nwork as President at the sixty-first session. Romania \nfully subscribes to the statement delivered by His \nExcellency Jos\u00e9 Socrates, the Prime Minister of \nPortugal, on behalf of the European Union. I would \nalso like to add some reflections on the interests of my \ncountry. Romania remains firmly attached to its \nengagement in favour of efficient multilateralism on all \nthree pillars of United Nations activity   peace and \nsecurity, human rights and sustainable development. \n Romania wishes to be an active participant in all \nongoing reform processes according to the guidelines \nwe accepted in the Millennium Summit Outcome. It \nseems there is a quasi-consensus on the principle of the \nenlargement of the Security Council but not yet on the \npractical ways in which this could take place. We all \nknow that this is because the structural reform of a \nprincipal organ has profound political implications. It \nseems also that there is little disagreement on the \ngeneral principle that the Security Council should \nreflect the geopolitical configuration of the present-day \nworld. We believe that the comprehensive solution \noffered by an intermediary stage should be regarded \npositively, precisely because at this stage it is general \nenough to allow everybody to see that the new \nconfiguration would come closer to one\u2019s aim. Let us \nsee if it stands the test of substantive negotiations. \nNevertheless, negotiations on the enlargement of the \nSecurity Council should not prevent progress and \ndecisions being made on other dimensions, namely, \nimproving the working methods of the Security \nCouncil, particularly on the issue of the transparency \nof Security Council activity and the possibility of \nlimiting veto use. Finally, with 23 members the Eastern \nEuropean Group should be entitled to at least one \nadditional seat in the Security Council in any formula \nto be agreed upon. It should also be re-emphasized \nthat, despite being the most dynamically growing \nregional group within the United Nations General \nAssembly, the Eastern European presence in \nmanagerial positions in the United Nations Secretariat \nand in United Nations bodies is still minimal. \n Romania follows with particular attention the \nlatest developments in Kosovo. The solution for the \nstatus of the province of Kosovo needs to be in line \nwith the international law in force. We welcome the \nefforts of the Troika to facilitate the negotiations \nbetween the two parties. The direct talks that were held \ntoday here in New York represent a positive evolution, \nand similar meetings should be organized in the \nmonths to come. Direct negotiations between Belgrade \nand Pristina will contribute to reaching a genuine \ncompromise that will support the stability of the \nWestern Balkans and the European perspective of this \nregion. \n In Iraq positive developments in the area of \ninstitution building, interfaith reconciliation and \nsecurity must be consolidated through regional and \ninternational support. The new Security Council \nresolution 1770 (2007) represents a broad United \nNations mandate to provide assistance for development \nand reconstruction and mediation for political dialogue \nat the national and regional levels. We welcome the \nministerial meeting on Iraq on 22 September last, \nchaired by the Prime Minister of Iraq and the United \nNations Secretary-General. We believe that the efforts \nof the international community with regard to Iraq will \nbear fruit. Romania is present on the ground and stands \nwith the people and Government of Iraq. \n Preventing and combating terrorism require \neffective multilateralism, based on the norms of \ninternational law. We must meet the threat of \ninternational terrorism with concerted action. Global \naction against terrorism requires measures to disrupt \ngroups involved in terrorist activities through \ninternational cooperation. Our efforts to combat \nterrorism must be unrelenting but they must respect \nfundamental human rights and freedoms. Combating \nterrorism must also take account of the social and \neconomic roots of terrorism. No country can ensure its \nsecurity alone. Romania supports efforts undertaken by \ninternational, regional and subregional organizations to \nbuild up international solidarity against terrorism in \naccordance with international law, and it cooperates \nbilaterally with other countries to prevent and combat \nthis scourge. \n The Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) remains the \npillar for the international legal system in the area of \nnuclear non-proliferation. It is also an essential \ninstrument for promoting international peace and \nsecurity. Despite all the difficulties in recent years, the \nNPT is still relevant and significant. The balance \nbetween rights and duties enshrined in the Treaty is \nessential for the stability of the international system. \nThe maintenance of the fundamental principles of the \nTreaty on the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and \ninternational cooperation, as well as guarantees to \nobserve non-proliferation requirements, are essential.  \n Romania places a great deal of importance on \ndeveloping nuclear energy and promoting its peaceful \nuse in areas such as medicine, industry, agriculture and \nin other areas of public usefulness. Romania also \nagrees with the idea that adopting nuclear energy as an \necologically sound alternative source of energy in the \ncontext of implementing the Kyoto Protocol is an \nimportant choice. \n The international community must give priority \nattention to the threat of the proliferation of weapons \nof mass destruction and access by terrorists to these \ntypes of weapons. My country does not neglect \nproblems related to conventional weapons and firmly \nsupports the need to start structured consideration of \nthe question of a future international legal instrument \non the weapons trade.  \n Romania is participating actively in peacekeeping \noperations by providing military observers, staff \nofficers, guards and police officers to 10 peacekeeping \noperations in four continents   Haiti, Congo, Ethiopia \nand Eritrea, Sudan, Liberia, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Nepal, \nTimor-Leste, Georgia and Kosovo. Romania is also \nparticipating in peace operations in the Western \nBalkans, Iraq and Afghanistan.  \n The Blue Helmets deserve the gratitude of host \ncountries and of the international community. We \nbelieve that in setting up multinational forces under the \nauspices of the United Nations we should take account \nof the cultural and linguistic characteristics of the \ncountry where the Blue Helmets are deployed. \n Romania, now a member of the European Union, \nevolved under the political idea that democracy, human \nrights and the rule of law are essential for the \ndevelopment of our societies. That is why we would \nlike to commit to supporting, in an imaginative \nfashion, human rights, democracy, tolerance and \ndiplomacy as a means for settling all disputes, as well \nas dialogue between cultures and civilizations. It is \nworthwhile recalling that Bucharest hosted the \nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe \n(OSCE) High-Level Conference on Combating \nDiscrimination and Promoting Mutual Respect and \nUnderstanding in June 2007. That Conference was an \nopportunity to highlight the need to react at the \npolitical and institutional levels to combat all forms of \nintolerance and discrimination in order to guarantee \nrespect for human rights and to ensure that every \ncitizen feels protected by the law and has concrete \nproof of the solidarity of others when his or her rights \nare flouted.  \n I believe that the international community needs \nto give deeper consideration to some sensitive issues in \norder to adopt appropriate measures. I am thinking \nabout the need to ensure that the rights of children are \nprotected, and that is why Romania supports the \nestablishment of the post of Special Representative of \nthe Secretary-General to combat violence against \nchildren. \n My Government pays particular attention to \naction taken by the Human Rights Council, especially \nsince from last June to mid-2008 the chairmanship of \nthis new institution is held by Romania. The \ninstitutional structure of this organization is almost \ncomplete. What we have achieved is a compromise. \nThe new Council is not the irreproachable body that we \nhad imagined, but it needs to be used, because \npromotion of respect for human rights is a battle we \nmust wage relentlessly. The General Assembly\u2019s \napproval of the report of the Human Rights Council, \nwhich also includes the institutional package adopted \nhalfway through this year, will certainly help us meet \nthis goal. This new institution must put to greater use \nits calling, which is to increase awareness of and \nrespect for human rights and to strengthen those rights \nworldwide. It must also ensure that States honour their \ncommitments. Romania reiterates its confidence in the \ncapacity of the Human Rights Council to become a \nsound and credible example in the institutional system \ndevoted to protecting human rights. \n Democracy is a global process. Twenty-five years \nago, less than one third of the States worldwide could \nbe deemed to be true democracies. Now that \npercentage has increased considerably and represents \nthe standard. We believe that progress in the principles \nof democracy and human rights in political decisions \nrepresents a victory for us all. With the common efforts \nof member States, a considerable number of resolutions \nand declarations on various aspects related to \ndemocracy have been adopted. For example, in 2000 \nthe Commission on Human Rights adopted resolution \n2000/47, \u201cPromoting and consolidating democracy\u201d, \nintroduced by my country.  \n The resolution brought together, for the first time \nin a single coherent document, the principles, values \nand practices that represent a framework for actions \ntaken by governments to promote democracy.  \n Of course there are close ties between democracy \nand respecting human rights. That is the primary \nmessage that Romania and other sponsors wanted to \ntransmit through resolutions on pursuing dialogue on \nmeasures to promote and consolidate democracy, \ndemocracy and human rights, and reinforcing the role \nof regional, subregional and other mechanisms and \norganizations to promote and consolidate democracy. \nAll those resolutions were adopted. \n We are also very pleased to see that the \nCommunity of Democracies has now become an active \ngroup committed to promoting the values and standards \nof democracy. We are prepared to work with other \ndelegations that are members of the working group in \nthe Community of Democracies. Romania recently \ntook on the task of coordinating the group in \nanticipation of the next ministerial conference, to be \nheld in Bamako. \n As a Member of the United Nations that benefits \nfrom constant and sound economic growth, Romania \nwill join the group of donor countries by the end of this \nyear. Official development assistance designed as a \ngradual and progressive commitment will now be a key \npart of our foreign policy and an expression of our \ninternational solidarity with countries in transition or \ndeveloping countries. We already have a national \nstrategy, an institutional structure and a budget with a \nline item for official development assistance. Above \nall, we have unswerving political commitment. We will \nlook closely at all options for providing voluntary \ncontributions through the United Nations system in \nsetting our initial priorities. \n On climate change, the United Nations clearly \nhas a key role to play in assisting regions devastated by \nnatural catastrophes. We are fully aware of the \nstaggering impact of climate change on human beings. \nLet us recall the words of Immanuel Kant, who said \nthat \u201cTwo things fill the mind with ever new and \nincreasing admiration and awe: the starry heavens \nabove me and the moral law within me\u201d. Let moral law \nand reason prevail so that we can preserve the starry \nsky. It is likely that the general degree of freedom has \nnever attained such a high level in the history of \nmankind as it has in our day. If we are freer, more \ninformed and more aware than our forefathers, we also \nhave a greater responsibility to care for our \nenvironment. This year, Romania, like other countries, \nhas suffered the consequences of climate change   \nextremely hot temperatures and drought followed by \ntorrential rains and flooding. Political leaders must \nsupport the formulation of a new legal instrument. \nThey must support scientific research in order to \nreduce the world economy\u2019s dependence on fossil fuels \nand to stimulate the discovery of new technologies.  \n In 1990, Romania began political and economic \naction towards sustainable development and a \nsustainable economy. Thus, in 1994 Romania ratified \nthe United Nations Framework Convention on Climate \nChange and in 2001 the Kyoto Protocol. Given these \nalmost unprecedented phenomena, we need to \nconsolidate regional and European capacity to act. To \nthat end, the relevant Romanian institutions have \nconsidered holding a high-level regional meeting to \ndiscuss policies in response to global warming, in \nparticular action and support mechanisms with regard \nto problems related to drought. This initiative will be \nconcentrated on Central Europe and South-East \nEurope. \n Romania places particular importance to the \ndialogue among cultures and religions. We believe this \nhas become essential for meeting today\u2019s global \nchallenges. My country is rich in cultural diversity. It \nlies at the crossroads of cultures and civilizations and \nis fully engaged in international and regional initiatives \nto promote intercultural and interfaith dialogue. The \nthird European Ecumenical Assembly, which was held \nat the beginning of September at Sibiu, Romania   the \nEuropean Capital of Culture for 2007   is a clear \nrecent example of our culture of dialogue. \n Today\u2019s world is constantly changing and \nrequires increased cooperation within the international \ncommunity. That is why we welcome the joint \nactivities of the United Nations and the International \nOrganization of La Francophonie (OIF). From 25 to \n29 September 2006, that forum met in Bucharest, \nRomania. As host country for the eleventh Summit, our \ncountry chaired the Conference of Heads of \nFrancophone State or Government, as well as the \nMinisterial Conference of La Francophonie. In playing \nthis double role we felt it our duty to be very actively \ninvolved not only in institutional reform but also in \nfurthering cooperation among French speakers. \n Despite criticism, deserved or not, the United \nNations is still a necessary organization without which \nthe international community would lose its way. \nEconomic globalization and the information society are \nstrengthening, not weakening, the universal calling, the \nlegitimacy and the moral authority of this \nOrganization. But it is up to us, the Member States, to \nserve the Organization beyond our narrow or fleeting \ninterests. \n"

        "file_text": "Thank you for inviting \nme to be here today. I bring you greetings from the \npeople of the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and \nPrincipe. This is my first opportunity to personally \ncongratulate Mr. Ban Ki-moon and to thank him for \ntaking on the huge responsibilities he has assumed as \nSecretary-General. We offer him our full support for \nthe difficult tasks ahead. \n I would also like to congratulate Mr. Srgjan \nKerim for his election as President of the current \nsession and to thank Ms. Al Khalifa for her work in \nguiding the sixty-first session so well.  \n I would like to take this opportunity to \ncongratulate the Secretary-General for the choice of the \ntopics for this session, such as climate change, finance \nfor development, the Millennium Development Goals \nand countering terrorism. \n We come together this year at a time of enormous \nchallenges for the United Nations. The world situation \nis very serious. One difficulty is that the problems are \nof such enormous complexity that the mass of facts \npresented to the public by the media make it \nexceedingly difficult for average people to understand \nthe situation.  \n Many of us in this room today live far from the \ntroubled areas of the earth. So, it is, perhaps, hard to \ncomprehend the plight of long-suffering peoples like \nthose in Afghanistan, Darfur, Iraq, Palestine, Sierra \nLeone and Somalia, among so many others. But we \nmust reject prejudice and discrimination and end those \nconflicts. \n For those who still ignore our existence, may I \nremind them that my country, Sao Tome and Principe, \nis an African nation composed of two islands in the \nGulf of Guinea and independent from Portugal since \n12 July 1975. So, I wanted to say that we also join the \ncalls to defeat terrorist extremism everywhere. \nHowever, we have already seen that this will not be \nachieved by military force, but by ideas and ideals that \nwin hearts and minds. \n Regarding the Millennium Development Goals, I \nwant to express my regret that so little progress has \nbeen made towards achieving these worthy ends. How \ncan we ignore those who are to be helped by those \nGoals, the least, the last and the lost? As the Nobel \nLaureate Martin Luther King once said,  \n  \u201cInjustice anywhere is a threat to justice \neverywhere. We are caught in an inescapable \nnetwork of mutuality, tied in a single garment of \ndestiny. Whatever affects one directly, affects all \nindirectly\u201d.  \n I join previous speakers in saying that despite all \nthe technological and scientific advances, half of the \nworld\u2019s population lives on less than $2 per day. \nTwenty per cent of everyone alive suffer from chronic \nhunger. Every single day, 30,000 children die \nneedlessly from dehydration, diarrhoea or infections, \nwhich could be all too easily prevented or cured. In \nmany countries, children are not even given a name \nuntil they are one month old because so many of them \ndo not live that long. One billion adults today are \nilliterate; 100 million children cannot go to school \nbecause of their poverty. \n Now, with regard to how to finance development, \nwe are told that globalization is the way, that a rising \ntide will lift all boats. But in many parts of the world \nthe rising tide of globalization lifted the yachts and \nswamped the rowboats. Can private corporations \nrealistically be expected to combine their \nentrepreneurial activities with furthering social causes? \nObviously, some companies must improve their \npractices and be held accountable for cleaning up their \nenvironmental disasters, such as those in the Niger \nDelta. But to cast companies in the role of economic \nreformers is unrealistic. It seems that perhaps \nglobalization has made the right to shop more \nimportant than the right to vote. \n At the same time, we must also be realistic about \nthe results of aid. It seems that international \norganizations sometimes suffer from poverty of \nexpectations. Our own people in the developing world \nare also at times crucified on the poverty of their own \ndesires. Instead of raging against our destiny, we have \nlowered our standards. I think the humiliation of \npoverty actually scorches the heart and creates despair. \n How can we come here year after year and see \nthis despair, disease and hunger and not feel enormous \nsorrow? We must accept that global poverty is the \ndisgrace of our affluent era. So how do we alleviate \npoverty? Many say that Africa is poor because of bad \ngovernance and corruption. I strongly reject that view. \nIs it shameful to remember how all of our countries in \nAfrica, all of us, were when we became independent, \nor how we were even more recently in Sao Tome and \nPrincipe. \n Let me say a little bit about how it was and how it \nis in Sao Tome and Principe. The majority of people \ngrew up in wooden shacks, with no running water, no \nelectricity, no toilet and no chance for an education. In \n1975, the country emerged from centuries of slavery \nand oppressive colonialism to independence with \nalmost no teachers, no doctors, totally unprepared to \ngovern ourselves or create an economy that did not \ndepend on slave or contract labour as the only means \nof profit. We have struggled. We have stumbled. But \ntoday we have a vibrant and stable democracy that we \nare proud of. We have a high percentage of girls in \nschool. We have literacy rates far above the average in \nthe developing world. We have free health care for all \nof our citizens, although it is woefully inadequate for \nlack of funds. We have almost eradicated malaria. We \nhave low corruption, while also being rated among the \nbest countries in the world for freedom of the press. \nWe spend almost no money on defence and we have \nnever fought a war. \nWe are grateful for aid. My people would suffer \neven more than they already do without the World \nFood Programme, for example. The World Health \nOrganization and the Global Fund to fight tuberculosis \nand malaria are working with us very well. The \nRepublic of Taiwan, the people of the island of \nFormosa, with their well-known generosity and special \nattention to our realities, have been crucial in our own \nsuccess against malaria. Many organizations and \nindividuals have worked with us for many years with \nopen hearts and generous spirits, and we thank them all \nfor that. \n Throughout our 32 years of independence, we \nhave followed the advice of international organizations \nand built up some $350 million in bilateral and \nmultilateral debt, most of which was recently forgiven \nunder the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative \nand other programmes. Allow me to take this \nopportunity to present, on behalf of the people of Sao \nTome and Principe, our deepest gratitude. \n As long as massive poverty, injustice and obscene \ninequality persist in our world, none of us can rest. I \nsay to all, please do not look the other way. Do not \nhesitate. The future might say that what we failed to do \nwas tragic, but let me also say that what we did do was \ntruly heroic.  \n Finally, before ending, and as I have done in prior \nyears, I wish to refer to two situations to which I call \nthe attention of members and implore their solidarity, \nregardless of whether they are poor or rich. \n One of those situations is the issue of Taiwan. \nThere are 23 million people living on Formosa island, \nalso called Taiwan. They do not ask the international \ncommunity to help them because they are poor. On the \ncontrary, they are one of the main recognized world \neconomic powers, and they are helping other countries, \nsuch as Sao Tome and Principe. They only ask to be \nrecognized as a sovereign country and to be included \nas such on the lists of the United Nations and its \nagencies. This is a question of justice.  \n Also a question of justice is the issue of the \nUnited States Government lifting the embargo against \nCuba, repealing the Helms-Burton Act of 1996 and \nallowing for free trade and free travel. Let the Cubans \nsettle their problems among themselves. This is a \ndemocratic act.  \n I thank all members for being here today and \nlistening. May God bless us all. \n"

        "file_text": "Allow me, at \nthe outset, to address my warmest congratulations to \nthe President of the General Assembly at its sixty-\nsecond session. With that election, which honours your \ncountry, the Group of Eastern European States and the \nmembers of this Assembly have unanimously \nrecognized, Sir, your eminent competence and your \nperfect knowledge of the Organization. You and the \nother members of the Bureau may be assured of the \nactive cooperation of my delegation. \n You have chosen the theme of climate change for \nthis sixty-second session. I would like to thank you for \nthat initiative, which has been commended by all. \n Today, I would like to share my observations on \nthis issue as well as my personal commitment in \nservice of this cause. Very early on, I learned to \nappreciate nature and to take the necessary measures to \nprotect it. From my very earliest years, I was taught to \nshare and to give back. Then I wanted to see and learn \nthings for myself, and my responsibility today is to \ntestify and to act. \n That is why, in June 2006, I decided to make my \nown contribution, as well as that of the Principality, by \ncreating a Foundation. The mission of the Prince \nAlbert II Foundation is to identify priority and \nsymbolic projects and to accelerate their \nimplementation in order to reach concrete results \nthroughout the world aimed at a sustainable and \nequitable management of natural resources. \n The Foundation\u2019s activities are based on three \nstrategic principles. The first is to act alongside \nnations, international institutions and opinion leaders \nin order to enhance consciousness of and accelerate \ndecisions for sustainable development. I am personally \ncommitted to leading consciousness-raising missions \non the ground around the world. I will also stand with \nother heads of States, as I do today, and take part in \ninternational negotiation meetings regarding the \nenvironment. \n The second objective of my Foundation is to \npromote initiatives, activities and corporate actions that \ncombine innovation with environmental protection. \nThe Foundation in supporting and financing about \n30 projects as of this year. Through its activities, the \nFoundation also wishes to attest to the fact that it is \npossible to engage in sustainable practices and \nbehaviour that are respectful of the environment and \ncompatible with economic, social and human \ndevelopment. \n Lastly, its third objective is to create the broadest \npossible public understanding of the environmental \nchallenges and responsibilities involved in those issues \nvia outreach activities. I commit myself to devoting the \ntime and energy necessary to the success of those \nactions. \n All the programmes adopted by the Foundation \ncomply with the environmental policy of my country. \nMonaco has long been active in protecting the marine \nenvironment and in developing scientific research in \nmarine biology. The creation a century ago of the \nOceanographic Museum and the Museum of \nPrehistoric Anthropology by my great-great-\ngrandfather Albert I, and the more recent creation of an \nunderwater reserve by my father, Prince Rainier III, \nbear witness to that policy. The RAMOGE Agreements \nfor the control of marine pollution and the Agreement \non the Conservation of Cetaceans in the Black Sea, the \nMediterranean Sea and contiguous Atlantic Area \nreinforced that international engagement. That vocation \nis part of the history of my country. \n This year, I agreed to sponsor an ambitious \ninternational initiative launched by the United Nations \nEnvironment Programme, the objective of which is to \nprovide for the planting of at least 1 billion trees \nthroughout the world in 2007. Seven months after the \nlaunch of the operation, that objective was achieved. It \nis an extraordinary sign of hope, and I must commend \nthe dynamism of the Programme, whose actions within \nthe United Nations are essential for the environment. \n The time for action is today. We already know \nthat the future of humanity is at stake. This is a \ncollective responsibility. To tackle this urgent matter, it \nis necessary to raise awareness, mobilize capacities and \nrevolutionize our lifestyle. That is how we will forge a \nnew relationship to nature. As Yves Coppens, a French \nscientist, stresses: \u201cfor millennia, climate has dictated \nman\u2019s behaviour; today, it is man who dictates his \nbehaviour on nature\u201d. \n It is also necessary to commit ourselves to \npromoting a new ethic   that of the right to the \nprotection of the environment. What better place is \nthere than this prestigious institution to lead the way \nforward? That new ethical dimension can be achieved \nonly if built on the sincere commitment of each \nindividual. That is why Bill Clinton, in his recent book, \ncalls for concrete mobilization. As he says so well, \n\u201ceach one of us can give something. There is so much \nto do; it is never too late to start\u201d. Like President \nClinton, I believe that generosity is at the heart of that \nmobilization. \n It is thus imperative to transcend our own \nselfishness and inertia, and to learn to develop a \nharmonious relationship between humankind and \nnature. Safeguarding our planet is the challenge of the \ntwenty-first century. That challenge requires courage, \ntenacity, commitment and generosity. Above all, let us \nact. Peter Frumhoff, one of the main contributors to the \nreport of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate \nChange, declared, following a large-scale study \nundertaken by the Union of Concerned Scientists, that \n\u201csome changes are inevitable, but the worst \nconsequences can be avoided if we act quickly\u201d. That \nmessage was reiterated over and over again yesterday \nduring the high-level event on climate change \nconvened by the Secretary-General. \n The European Union has shown the way by \ncommitting to a 50 per cent reduction of its greenhouse \ngases by 2050. Let us help developing countries by \nfinding new financial resources; let us quickly update \nour modes of production and consumption. To meet \nthat challenge, we must work together to find solutions \nto existing problems. Individual announcements or \nactions will never solve the problem. The threat is \nglobal. As the climatologist Edouard Bard has pointed \nout, \u201cglobal warming concerns our entire ecosystem \nand the consequences of this phenomenon can be done \nonly at the global level\u201d. \n We have long lived in a world fraught with \nthreats, but for the first time we are facing a planetary \nthreat that threatens humankind itself. The evolution of \nhuman mindsets and behaviour will inevitably take \ntime, but the planet cannot wait. Thus, without further \ndelay, we must adopt a culture of responsibility. We \nmust meet this historic challenge so that we may \npreserve planet Earth for our children. Let us make the \nchoice of hope based on humanistic values, and let us \nnot forget the power of courage when it is supported by \nthe will to place humankind at the core of our \npriorities. \n There are also ethical considerations which \ninspire my country\u2019s constant and resolute commitment \nin the fight against terrorism. In no circumstances can \nviolence ever be a legitimate means to pursue any \ncombat, whatever the cause may be. \n To consolidate its legal framework in compliance \nwith international standards, and according to the \nrecommendations of the Financial Action Task Force \non Money Laundering (FATF), the Principality of \nMonaco took measures identical to the European Union \ndirectives adopted to fight money laundering and \nterrorism. Without waiting for the new report of the \nSelect Committee of Experts on the Evaluation of Anti-\nMoney Laundering Measures, in this area, my \nGovernment enacted new laws and regulations on these \nissues. With those tireless efforts, Monaco has been \npublicly recognized for leading the way in this field. I \nwill maintain the required vigilance so that our \nlegislative framework and our security policy will \ncontinue to guarantee the reputation of the Principality \nas a safe State. In so doing, I reiterate my unfaltering \ndetermination to combat the manifestations of \nterrorism regardless of their forms. \n For my country, sustainable development and the \nfight against poverty go hand in hand, in that we are \ncalled upon to identify a new manner of growth more \nrespectful of the resources of our planet, which, while \nabundant, are not inexhaustible. That is the reason why \nI asked my Government to increase by 30 per cent for \nthe year 2008, under the heading of international \ncooperation, the total of the Principality\u2019s voluntary \ncontributions to the funds and programmes of the \nUnited Nations. This significant increase of funding for \nofficial development assistance is proof my country\u2019s \ndetermination to eventually reach the target of devoting \n0.7 per cent of gross national income to official \ndevelopment assistance. A great deal remains to be \ndone in the fields of education, access to health care, \nthe fight against pandemics and HIV/AIDS, human \ncrises following natural disasters or conflicts and, \nlastly, the fight against poverty. \n I pay particular attention to the Principality\u2019s \nactions through multilateral and bilateral assistance \nprogrammes, supplemented by the generous initiatives \nof the charitable organizations in Monaco, which are \nalso part of my country\u2019s tradition. \n Children\u2019s welfare has, for a long time, been a \npriority commitment for the Principality. My sister, \nHer Royal Highness the Princess of Hanover, is \nactively involved with this issue through the World \nAssociation of Children\u2019s Friends (AMADE \nMondiale). In December, the General Assembly will \nhold a debate to evaluate progress in the \nimplementation of the Declaration and Plan of Action \nentitled \u201cA world fit for children\u201d (resolution S-27/2), \nadopted in 2002. Considerable progress has been \nachieved in five years, although there still are too many \nneeds to be met. \n Monaco has also joined the campaign entitled \n\u201cUnite for children. Unite against AIDS,\u201d sponsored by \nUNICEF, the Joint United Nations Programme on \nHIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) and the World Health \nOrganization. My sister, Princess Stephanie, Special \nRepresentative of UNAIDS, has committed herself \nwholeheartedly to harnessing the energies of the \nPrincipality and beyond to advance in the fight against \nthis scourge. \n Reform of the Security Council remains a current \nissue. I reaffirm my country\u2019s support for a process of \nincreasing the membership of this Council. In fact, the \nchances of maintaining international peace and security \nwill be that much greater if the representation of the \ninternational community in the Security Council were \nthe most equitable possible. \n I also express the wish that the newly established \nDepartment of Field Support, working alongside the \nDepartment of Peacekeeping Operations, will facilitate \nthe actions of United Nations personnel on the ground \nworking valiantly to safeguard peace. I congratulate \nthe Secretary-General on the efforts he has undertaken \nto these ends. \n My country became a Member of the United \nNations 14 years ago. Ever since, the Principality has \nincreased its participation on the international scene. \nThe Principality has taken pleasure in hosting many \ninternational meetings and high-level conferences in \nrecent years.  \n Accordingly, I am delighted that in February \n2008, the tenth special session of the Governing \nCouncil of United Nations Environment Programme \nand the Global Ministerial Environment Forum will be \nheld in Monaco. On that occasion, I will proudly \nreceive ministers of the environment of Member States \nto discuss topics similar to those we are tackling within \nthe General Assembly framework and thus to continue \nthe debate launched here. In so doing, my country will, \nI hope, contribute once again its part to the \nfundamental debates of our time and will reaffirm its \nwill to be at the heart of the genuine struggle. \n"

        "file_text": "People and planet. \nThey are our alpha and our omega. They are the \nfoundation and objective of actions by bodies such as \nthe United Nations. \n The Earth is blue like an orange, said the poet \nPaul Eluard. That is a logical statement, as our planet \ntakes its blue colour from the sky and the oceans that \nprotect us, and the orange colour from the fruit that \nnourishes us. The Earth is a sphere that moves and \nturns with infinite interdependence. The human \nattitude, nature and peoples are bound together to form \na single scheme of debate, impossible to resolve \nseparately. \n Every year in the General Assembly we are \npleased to feel that our work is centred on the ideals of \na better world in the environment of a democratic \nstructure, dialogue, the brotherhood of cultures and \nfinancial and social interchange, supportive and \nprosperous between peoples. \n The latest data available to us on the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) show a positive trend. We \nhave made great progress in the reduction of child \nmortality and we have applied various measures of \ntruly surprising simplicity that have demonstrated their \neffectiveness in eradicating many illnesses. And yet the \ninhabitants of the world \u2014 the people, flora and fauna \nof the planet \u2014 look at our organizations and all of us \nsomewhat suspiciously. There is much concern. There \nis great uncertainty. \n With your permission, my words today will not \nbe of self-complacency either for the results \nobtained or for the undeniable improvement in some of \nthe ailments that undermine our dignity as people. \nCongratulations can give way to relaxation and can \nhave a perversely soothing effect on our consciences. \nThe development of global societies has become \nessential in the light of the positions affecting \neconomic, social, cultural, military and political \nsystems on a worldwide scale. There is an urgent need \nfor conceptualization in the face of the evident poverty \nresulting from the sudden and profound \ntransformations suffered by peoples, regions and \ncountries. Successive waves of contributions of capital \nand human resources combine with pre-existing human \nsubstrata, creating superimposed layers that further \naccentuate differences. When those investments cease \nto be profitable, resources are redirected. That results \nin situations of change or crisis. \n The realities on which we have to concentrate are \nthose of a world in which, according to the latest data \npublished by UNICEF, 9.7 million children\u2019s lives \nwere lost in one year; a world in which human life \nexpectancy can differ by more than 30 years; a world \nin which more than 39 million people are infected with \nthe AIDS virus; and a world in which too many people \nare still without access to safe drinking water. That is \nnot doomsaying on my part; it is a recognition that the \nadvances made cannot conceal the profound \nshortcomings that still exist or hold back the \nachievement of results. \n Indignation and rejection in the face of every \nunacceptable reality have made possible the finest \nachievements for the progress of humanity in a \nremarkable way at the United Nations and must now \nenable us to obtain more resources, to go faster, to have \nmore ideas and to be even more effective. \n Mr. Beck (Palau), Vice-President, took the Chair. \n For more than six decades, the United Nations \nhas sought to be the moral and legal force which \nensures that dialogue, cooperation and solidarity take \nthe place of oppression, weapons, famine, ignorance, \nmisery and injustice. However, during the years of \nexistence of the United Nations, wars, poverty and \nintolerance have not stopped. On the contrary, we have \nhad to add new ills, such as the radicalization of \nfundamentalism or the degradation of the environment, \nand increasingly frequent natural disasters. \nEarthquakes, hurricanes, typhoons, cyclones, tornadoes \nand floods and the thawing of many of the glaciers at \nthe two poles are vivid examples of the climatic \ndisorder that we have to combat. To tell the truth, the \nplanet is threatened; but I do not think that this is an \naccurate assertion. Those really threatened are the most \nvulnerable persons and countries. They are the ones \nwho suffer from war, illness and underdevelopment. \nClimate change will affect all of us, but not all of us \nequally. \n At the same time, trafficking in, and the abuse of, \nchildren and women continue despite the legal \ninstruments with which we have equipped countries \nsuch as Andorra, where the defence of human rights \nand liberties is considered to be a fundamental \ninspiring principle. \n The world of the twenty-first century views \narmed conflicts, terrorism, violations of human rights \nand extremely precarious situations in many areas with \nsomething between resignation and impotence. I would \nrefer, merely as an example, to the extreme situation \nthat has affected the population of Darfur for many \nyears.  \n We should not be surprised that, faced with all \nthose hard realities, international institutions like ours \nare suffering serious crises of discredit and significant \nerosion. Nevertheless, if we are here today it is because \nwe believe that we can improve the world \u2014 people \nand planet \u2014 because we are convinced that together \nwe are able to react. Hope remains intact. Every \ncountry \u2014 whatever its size \u2014 and every director and \nevery organization with the capacity for action has to \nfight to make law into the essence of vitality and to \nachieve open and sincere dialogue in the international \narena. As Charles de Gaulle said, it takes several to \ndeliberate, and one to act. As Al Gore told us on \nMonday, the world requires a global Marshall Plan, \nbecause our planet is in an emergency situation. \n We are delighted with the thrust and  \ndynamism displayed by the new Secretary-General,  \nMr. Ban Ki-moon, since he took office. We praise the \nefforts of the General Assembly in setting up a \nWorking Group on Security Council reform, as well as \nthe proposals that are being studied. We fully support \nthe model of society proposed by the United Nations \n\u2014 rooted in the principles of peace, solidarity, liberty, \ncooperation, social development and economic growth. \n With regard to goals, I applaud the initiative of \nthe Millennium Development Goals. At the time of \ntheir introduction, the previous Secretary-General \nwarned us that we needed to break with routine. He \ntold us that we could not achieve results in a day \nbecause success would require sustained action over \nthe 10 years envisaged for implementation. Today, \nbefore the entire Assembly, I add my full support to \nthose words. I call upon everyone to maintain the pace \nand to press the foot down a little harder on the \naccelerator. \n We all benefit from the progress that we have \nmade. We know the enduring relationship that exists \nbetween poverty and nearly all the challenges we face: \nmortality rates, differences in life expectancy, ill \nhealth, injustice, intolerance, marginalization and \narmed conflict. Let us reject before the world and \nbefore all peoples some of the pernicious prejudices \nthat prevent us from advancing. Permit me to recall \nthree truths that have been defined a number of times \nby Jeffrey Sachs, the director of the Earth Institute at \nColumbia University. \n The first is that the illnesses ravaging poor \ncountries are perfectly avoidable and can be prevented. \nThe second is that to avoid all the thoroughly \nunnecessary deaths caused by them will not affect the \npopulation explosion. The third is that poor countries, \nas has already been shown and in refutation of some \nvoices deliberately ignorant of their prejudices, are \ncapable of installing efficient public health \nprogrammes when they receive adequate aid. \n As a result of the terror and the material and \nmoral misery suffered during the Second World War, \ncountries, peoples and their representatives came to an \nagreement, saying \u201cenough\u201d and creating organizations \nsuch as the United Nations to regulate and mediate \nconflict. They did this with a sense of generosity, a \nbreadth of purpose and a boldness that today must \ninspire our action even more. \n The ideals of the fathers of the Charter of the \nUnited Nations were founded on a respect for \nindividuals, on liberty and on access to knowledge and \neducation to achieve welfare and peace around the \nworld. Only through an energetic renewal of those \nideals can we ensure that the balance on planet Earth \nimproves perceptibly and continues to do so year by \nyear. Only with the unity, understanding and \ncooperation of all nations can we obtain results. \n The small size of Andorra has not prevented us \nfrom maintaining good neighbourly relationships with \nFrance and Spain for more than seven centuries. We are \nfully concerned and involved with the objectives of the \nUnited Nations. With our long and, at the same time, \nhumble experience, we could even become a neutral \narea, impartial and isolated from partisan interests, in \nthe case of any conflict in need of resolution. \n We must be realistic, but this must not stop us. \nWe must advance with modest but continuous reforms, \ntangible and firm reforms that lead us to a better future. \n"

        "file_text": "It is my pleasure to congratulate you, Sir, upon your \nelection as President of the Assembly at this session. \nThere is no doubt that your expertise and your \nknowledge of international affairs will ensure anther \nsuccessful session this year and will contribute to \nfulfilling the aspirations of our peoples for the United \nNations. \n I take this opportunity to express my deepest \nthanks and appreciation to our dear sister, Her \nExcellency Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa, President \nof the General Assembly at its sixty-first session, and \nto commend her for the way in which she so ably and \nwisely guided the work of the Assembly. As a result, \nserious ideas were put forward that yielded tangible \nresults for the development of the Organization and the \nrevitalization of its role. In that respect, we want to \nexpress our appreciation to all delegations that \ndisplayed a spirit of cooperation with her during her \npresidency. \n I have the pleasure also to thank His Excellency \nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his ongoing efforts \nto strengthen and develop the role of the United \nNations. We are confident that the Secretary-General\u2019s \nlong experience as an able diplomat will enable him to \nundertake further efforts to strengthen the effectiveness \nof our international Organization. \n In our joint endeavours to achieve world peace, \nprosperity and justice, we must address the challenges \nand dangers confronting our world today from a \nstandpoint of faith in our one human destiny. We \nshould realize that international security is based on \njoint efforts to guarantee regional security and the \nstability of States. At the same time, international \npeace requires respect for international legitimacy, the \nrule of law and justice. Since comprehensive \ndevelopment is a national and international \nrequirement, it is important that we collectively and \nseriously face threats regardless of their forms or \nmanifestations, such as conflict, war, nuclear \nproliferation, terrorism, environment disaster, poverty, \nbackwardness and extremism, in accordance with the \nprinciples and purposes of the Charter of the United \nNations and the resolutions and decisions adopted by \nthe General Assembly, including the United Nations \nMillennium Declaration (resolution 55/2). \n The resolution containing the Millennium \nDeclaration was a unique and pioneering endeavour \nwhich embodied a consensus among the world leaders \nwho set out the goals we must reach in this new \nmillennium. In this respect, the Kingdom of Bahrain is \nproud, by the grace of God, to have witnessed \ncomprehensive political developments in its \ndemocratic march forward, under the leadership of His \nMajesty King Hamad bin Isa Al-Khalifa, King of \nBahrain, where free and fair elections were held with \nbroad participation. \n Meanwhile, its comprehensive development \nefforts were crowned by the United Nations presenting \nthe 2006 Special Citation of the United Nations Human \nSettlements Programme Scroll of Honour Award to His \nHighness Shaikh Khalifa bin Salman Al-Khalifa, Prime \nMinister of the Kingdom of Bahrain. This reflected \ninternational appreciation for the developments that \ncontinue to be witnessed by the Kingdom, especially in \nthe field of urban development. \n Social and economic achievements, under the \npatronage also of His Highness Shaikh Salman bin \nHamad Al-Khalifa, Crown Prince and Commander-in-\nChief of the Bahrain Defence Force, have continued \nunabated. They are based on strategies and policies \ndesigned to ensure the welfare of all citizens by \nencouraging investment, strengthening the national \nhuman rights machinery, reforming the labour market \nand developing the education sector. \n In the decades since the establishment of the \nUnited Nations, our world has witnessed both unipolar \nand bipolar world orders. Worldwide events and the \nensuing results proved that such orders were not \nenough to guarantee security, peace, stability and \nprosperity in the world. Therefore, the time is now \nright to enable everybody to participate effectively in a \nuniversal system based on a just multilateralism that \nguarantees collective work towards achieving common \ngoals. \n We, as the United Nations, pledged in the \nCharter, in the name of our peoples to save succeeding \ngenerations from the scourge of war and to reaffirm \nfaith in fundamental human rights. That calls upon the \ninternational community promptly and effectively to \naddress threats to international peace and security. At \nthe forefront of those threats are the ongoing regional \nissues that the Middle East faces on various fronts, the \nmost important of which is the situation in the \nPalestinian and other occupied Arab territories. \n In this respect, we welcome the initiative of \nPresident George Bush of the United States to convene \nan international conference on Middle East peace this \nyear. We hope that this will mark the beginning of a \nnew stage in dealing with the core issue of the Arab-\nIsraeli conflict in a just and equitable manner, putting \nan end to the suffering of the Palestinian people and to \nthe occupation since 1967 of the Palestinian territories, \nthe Syrian Golan and other occupied Arab territories in \nsisterly Lebanon. It should also lead to the \nestablishment of an independent, contiguous and viable \nPalestinian State, with Jerusalem as its capital. Such a \nState should also be able to engage in development and \nto live in peace and stability with all States in the \nregion, including Israel, in accordance with the Arab \nPeace Initiative, United Nations resolutions and other \nrelevant international agreements and terms of \nreference. \n The second front is represented by the events in \nbrotherly Iraq, whose people suffer from continued \ninsecurity and instability as a result of the ceaseless \nwaves of violence and the killing of innocent people. It \nis our view that the responsibility for breaking out of \nthis vicious circle and achieving national reconciliation \nand stability lies primarily with the Iraqi people and \ntheir political leadership. To enable Iraq to do that, \nthere must be no interference in Iraq\u2019s internal affairs, \nand its borders must be fully respected. We stress here \nhow important it is for neighbouring States, the Arab \nLeague and the United Nations to continue to support \nthe legitimate Iraqi Government and its efforts to \nmaintain security and stability in Iraq and to preserve \nits Arab and Islamic identity. \n It seems clear that the attainment of stability in \nLebanon is closely bound to free national \nreconciliation, and to strengthened national, Arab and \ninternational efforts and support for Lebanon\u2019s \nlegitimacy, with a view to preserving its security, \nsafety and stability. Lebanon is an integral part of the \nsystem of regional peace and security in the Middle \nEast and as such should be supported. We express our \nregret at the assassinations of many politicians, \nofficials and innocent people in Lebanon. We hope that \nLebanon will overcome the current crisis so that its \npeople can live in security and peace. \n The stability and unity of the Sudan are \nfundamental pillars of the political, economic and \nsocial unity of Africa. We commend the decision of the \nbrotherly Sudan to agree to the deployment of a United \nNations-African Union hybrid force in Darfur. In that \ncontext, we hope that the parties to the conflict in the \nSudan will come together for the sake of their country \nand its prosperity. \nThe Kingdom of Bahrain recently joined the \nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), because \nof its belief in the Agency\u2019s important role in \nstrengthening nuclear non-proliferation. In order to \navoid a nuclear arms race in the Middle East, the \nKingdom of Bahrain underlines the importance of \nfreeing the region from nuclear weapons. It therefore \nurges the parties concerned, including the Islamic \nRepublic of Iran, to be more transparent and to \ncooperate fully with the terms of the Treaty on the \nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) so as to \nbuild tranquillity and peace of mind among \nneighbouring States in the Gulf. The Kingdom of \nBahrain reaffirms the right of all States to utilize \nnuclear power for peaceful purposes. It also demands \nthat Israel place all its nuclear facilities under the \ncomprehensive safeguards regime of the IAEA and \nbecome a party to the NPT in order to promote the \nTreaty\u2019s universality. \n In order to promote friendly relations and \ncooperation between members of the Gulf Cooperation \nCouncil (GCC) and the Islamic Republic of Iran, the \nKingdom of Bahrain reaffirms the right of the brotherly \nUnited Arab Emirates to recover its three occupied \nislands. It hopes that the two countries will increase \ntheir efforts and their contacts to resolve this issue \neither through direct negotiation or by referring it to \nthe International Court of Justice. \n Global climate change has become one of the \nmost dangerous challenges threatening the world and \nits inhabitants. Climate change not only has an impact \non the environment, but also severely affects the \nworld\u2019s economic and social order and hinders \ndevelopment. We therefore call upon all States to \ncooperate in order to identify solutions and ways to \ndeal with this phenomenon. Here I wish to commend \nthe high-level event on climate change, convened by \nthe Secretary-General on 24 September 2007 in New \nYork, on the theme \u201cThe future in our hands: \nAddressing the leadership challenge of climate \nchange\u201d. \n Our faith in a single human destiny requires us to \nconsolidate a culture of peace, brotherhood and \ndialogue among all nations and peoples and to abandon \nphenomena of hatred, discrimination and division \u2014 \nincluding what has been dubbed Islamophobia \u2014 \nwhich some are promoting to incite upheaval and \nhatred between peoples in order to serve their own \nnarrow political agendas and interests. Those \nindividuals forget that Islam is a monotheistic religion \nand that it stresses brotherhood, love, coexistence and \ntolerance. We hope in this context that the High-level \nDialogue to be held by the General Assembly on 4 and \n5 October will contribute to reinforcing the values of \ntolerance, understanding and respect for religions and \ncultures. \n The Kingdom of Bahrain reaffirms the \nimportance of joint efforts towards a new international \nenvironment, in which we can achieve our hope and \naspiration to live in peace, security and stability in a \nworld in which mankind will also live in respect, \ndignity and humanity; a world in which nations will \nachieve development and build prosperity and well-\nbeing; a world that will accept the cultures of others in \npeaceful coexistence, free from hatred and intolerance; \nand a world that believes in the unity of human destiny \nand will work to attain security, prosperity, justice and \npeace for humankind. \n"

        "file_text": "At the  beginning of my statement, I would like to convey my \nsincere congratulations to you, Sir, on your election to \nthe presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-\nsecond session. Your election, Mr. President, \nconstitutes undoubtedly significant recognition of your \ncountry for its prioritized and resolute actions with \nrespect to implementation of the goals of the United \nNations. But it is also, in personal terms, the successful \noutcome of a long and fruitful career as a diplomat and  \nprofessor of international relations. In addition, in \nwarmly congratulating you, I would like to assure you \nof the support my country, and of my own support, as \nyou carry out your challenging and noble mission. \n Allow me also to pay a well-deserved tribute to \nthe President of the General Assembly at its sixty-first \nsession, Her Excellency Ms. Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa, \nfor the dedication, wisdom and skill with which she \nsteered our deliberations, and particularly for her \nhaving led the necessary negotiations with respect to \nconsideration and implementation of the important \nrecommendations of the 2005 World Summit, which \nincluded reform of the Economic and Social Council \nand the Security Council. \n To the Secretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, I \nwould like to express my full encouragement as he \ncarries out his functions at the head of the United \nNations. The major reform that he has initiated in order \nto adapt the Organization to the needs of a world in \nconstant change deserves everyone\u2019s support. \n The theme for the general debate, climate change, \nwhich you have proposed for this year, is one of the \nprimary concerns of the international community. The \nselection of this very theme by the Secretary-General \nas the framework for the discussion during the high-\nlevel debate that was just held is additional evidence of \nthis. The Kyoto Protocol entered into force in 2005 and \nwas a major historical milestone in the process of \nreducing greenhouse gas emissions. \n With respect to trends in this phenomenon, every \none can note that the goals set forth in the Protocol \nhave yet to be fully achieved. We, therefore, need to do \nour utmost so that the Bali meeting in Indonesia, slated \nfor December 2007, will be an opportunity to reach \nagreement on a common, global strategy in order to \ncarry out more robust, collective action to mitigate \nsignificantly the negative effects of global warming. \n Africa, which contributes least of all to the \nworsening of this phenomenon, is unfairly undergoing \nthe serious consequences of it. Therefore, the principle \nof common but differentiated responsibilities needs to \nbe applied. For its part, Gabon, whose forest is one of \nthe essential components of the major Congo Basin, \nthe second ecological lung of the planet after the \nAmazon, has unreservedly acceded to the Convention \non Biological Diversity and has joined up in the fight \nagainst climate change. \nMoreover, it has decided to devote 11 per cent of \nits territory to humankind, particularly by establishing \n13 national parks. Recently, Lop\u00e9 park was named as a \nnew UNESCO world heritage site, and Gabon is \nprepared to go much further, because protection of the \nenvironment is an important pillar in the fight against \npoverty and an essential condition to achieving the \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs). \n As is evident, then, Gabon has undertaken \nconsiderable efforts in order to bring about greater \nprotection of nature and of ecosystems. As a result, \nGabon, together with other African countries, deserves \nto benefit from compensatory measures from \nindustrialized countries, the main emitters of carbon \ndioxide.  \n From this standpoint, we urge the establishment \nof a stabilization fund to compensate for existing forest \ncarbon stocks. We also would like to ensure that our \nforests are included in the carbon market mechanisms.  \n The General Assembly is the appropriate forum \nto discuss the major challenges that our world is \nfacing. That was the strong message reaffirmed by the \nworld\u2019s leaders when they assembled here for the \nSeptember 2005 world summit. I welcome the fact that \nthe major decisions taken at that time continue to drive \nthe reform of our Organization.  \n The report of the High-level Panel on United \nNations System-wide Coherence indicates the scope of \nthe changes to be made to ensure greater effectiveness \nin implementation of the Organization\u2019s programmes. \nHere, I would like to pay a well-deserved tribute to the \nPresident of the Assembly at its sixty-first session for \nhaving launched intergovernmental consultations on \nthis important issue. \n The intensive activities of the General Assembly \nin recent years clearly attests to its central role as the \nprincipal representative organ and deliberative body \nresponsible for setting the policies of the Organization. \nI have no doubt that you, Sir, will continue your efforts \nto strengthen the authority and primary role of the \nGeneral Assembly. Similarly, one of the key measures \nthat our Organization needs to bring about to improve \nthe implementation and ensure the legitimacy of its \ndecisions is reform of the Security Council. We will \nneed to reach agreement in order to carry out this \nreform that is so important for the future of the United \nNations.  \n This session is beginning in a complex and \nunstable international context that is marked by deep \ncrises and many kinds of threats. The geography of the \nconflicts puts the spotlight on Africa and the Middle \nEast.  \n In Africa, the situation in Darfur continues to be \nof concern. However, I would like to praise the efforts \nof the Sudanese Government, which has undertaken to \nparticipate in comprehensive peace talks on 27 October \n2007 in Tripoli and to accept the principle of a \nceasefire. Gabon, for its part, will continue to firmly \nsupport the national peace and reconciliation process in \nthe Sudan. To this end, it welcomes the adoption by the \nSecurity Council of resolution 1769 (2007), \nauthorizing the deployment of an Africa Union-United \nNations hybrid force in the Sudan.  \n Furthermore, Gabon, which has for many years \nplayed a major role in the many negotiations on \nnational reconciliation in Africa, supports the efforts \nundertaken by the European Union, particularly in \nprotecting civilians and providing humanitarian \nassistance in Chad and the Central African Republic.  \n Specifically with regard to Chad, Gabon is \ncurrently facilitating peace and reconciliation talks \namong factions in that country.  \n The instability in Somalia for the past 15 years \nhas negated any possibility of development. However, \nwe need to mention the praiseworthy decision of the \nPeace and Security Council of the African Union in \nauthorizing the deployment of a peacekeeping mission \nin that country.  \n With respect to the situation in the Middle East, \nmore specifically, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, only \nconcerted and sustained efforts based on the principle \nof two States, Israel and Palestine, coexisting in peace \nand security within secure and internationally \nrecognized borders, can bring about a lasting and just \nsettlement of this conflict.  \n My country endorses the idea of holding an \ninternational conference under the auspices of the \nQuartet, in order to relaunch the process of direct and \nconstructive negotiations.  \n With respect to Lebanon, Gabon reaffirms its \nsupport for implementation of Security Council \nresolution 1701 (2006). \nWith respect to the issue of international \nterrorism, I would like to commend the General \nAssembly\u2019s adoption on 8 September 2006 of the \nGlobal Counter-Terrorism Strategy. While politically \nthat is praiseworthy progress, nevertheless in legal \nterms we need to accelerate current negotiations in \norder to adopt a general counter-terrorism convention.  \n In the twenty-first century, threats to international \npeace and security are not limited solely to terrorism, \nwar and international conflicts. Organized crime, civil \nviolence, poverty, infectious diseases, natural disasters \nand weapons of mass destruction are also phenomena \nthat can undermine the survival and foundations of the \nState as the basic element of the international system. \n With respect to weapons of mass destruction, we \nneed urgently to end the stalemate in the multilateral \ntalks and to again place disarmament and non-\nproliferation issues at the forefront of the concerns of \nthe international community. Our collective security \ndepends on it.  \n On the HIV/AIDS pandemic, which severely \naffects many African countries, we need to act \nproportionately to the seriousness of this scourge. \nFurthermore, as was underscored in the political \ndeclaration on HIV/AIDS adopted in New York on \n2 June 2006 as the outcome of the high-level meeting \non that pandemic, the African countries are already \nallocating considerable financial resources to counter \nthis scourge. Despite these efforts, our countries \ncontinue to face a shortfall of the resources necessary \nto achieving universal access to prevention, care and \ntreatment by 2010. From this standpoint, Gabon \nwelcomes the commitment taken by Group of Eight \n(G-8) in Germany, granting to Africa under \ndevelopment assistance the amount of $60 billion to \nfight malaria, HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis.  \n More than a year ago, our Organization gave \nitself a peacebuilding mechanism. Here, I would like to \nreiterate my appreciation of the work already done by \nthe Peacebuilding Commission under the presidency of \nAngola, as well as by all of the members of the \nCommission for their efforts to devise an effective \nstrategy bringing together all the national and \ninternational players involved in the processes of \nreconstruction in Burundi and Sierra Leone. \n These countries, like all developing countries, \nneed ongoing support from the international \ncommunity, in accordance with the decisions taken \nunder the Monterrey Consensus and reaffirmed at the \n2005 World Summit. From this standpoint, the donor \ncountries need to meet their pledges for assistance to \ndeveloping countries, particularly in the areas of debt \nrelief and opening their markets. To that end, the \nimplementation of the Doha programme is an \nimperative for developing countries and will \nparticularly enable countries in Africa to achieve the \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) by 2015.  \n Similarly, we need to continue our brainstorming \nin order to identify and launch innovative sources for \ndevelopment financing. That is a priority objective for \nour countries, particularly since our resources are \nlimited because of debt reimbursement, and this \nprevents us from responding effectively to \ndevelopment needs. \n Here, I would like to pay tribute to the Paris \nClub, which has agreed to the principle of Gabon\u2019s \nbuying back its debt. This agreement is key for Gabon \nin its legitimate quest for economic prosperity and \nsocial well-being. \n It is in this spirit of renewed international \nsolidarity and in effective partnership that we will be \nable to build a better world that respects the rights and \ndignity of the individual. This vision of the founding \nfathers of our Organization is also shared by my \ncountry and its President, El Hadj Omar Bongo \nOndimba, who has always been able to work for the \nprotection and promote human rights. \n In keeping with these values, the Government of \nGabon recently decided to abolish the death penalty \nand was a sponsor of the draft resolution on \nestablishing a moratorium on the death penalty. \n The United Nations has existed now for sixty-two \nyears. From the cold war to the collapse of the Berlin \nWall, it has been able to stand, together with the \nsociety of nations, the test of time. Unfortunately, \nhowever, and despite its long history, it has not been \nable to fully bring about the profound aspirations of \nliberty, equality and peace and justice, as expressed by \nthe peoples of the world. The ongoing reforms need to \nbe continued in order to enable the United Nations to \nbe the mirror of diversity and human values. \n"

        "file_text": "When I first took the floor \nseven years ago to address the representatives of the \nStates of the world on behalf of the Republic of \nCroatia, I started off with the words \u201ctime is running \nout\u201d. At the time, I did not even imagine that I would \nhave to repeat those very words seven years later, but \nwith a greater sense of urgency. However, current \ncircumstances, the problems facing us and our inability \nor inadequate ability to deal with them compel me to \nrepeat, here and now: Time is running out. \n When we attended the millennial session marking \nthe beginning of the new century and the new \nmillennium, we also formulated our millennial goals. \nQuite appropriately, we identified our tasks and our \naspirations. However, what is not appropriate is the \nfact that the implementation of the Millennial Goals is \nnot proceeding at the proper rate or in the proper \nmanner if we want them to be meaningful. \n We are running late; hence my warning: Time is \nrunning out. Among all global organizations, the \nUnited Nations is that which has been most \nsympathetic to the problems of developing countries \nand where loud and justified requests have been voiced \nto stop the stratification of the world into the haves and \nthe have-nots. I have also attended sessions and \nconferences dealing with the issue, and I have \nrepeatedly drawn attention to underdevelopment as a \ngenerator of global terrorism, along with inequality in \ninternational relations and unresolved regional crises. \nNevertheless, underdevelopment and poverty still \nweigh upon a substantial part of humankind, and the \npreferred methods for fighting terrorism have so far \nbeen shown to be less than efficient, and sometimes \neven counterproductive. We are also running late in \nthat regard, and time is running out here, too. \n We have wanted and still want this Organization, \nour own Organization, to be fit for better and more \nfunctional action in current conditions. In other words, \nwe want to reform the United Nations; we want to \ntransform the Organization from a reflection of a world \nlong gone into an instrument for safeguarding peace, \nestablishing stability and ensuring development in the \ncontemporary world and the world of future \ngenerations.  \n By declaring its candidacy for a non-permanent \nseat in the Security Council, Croatia wishes to affirm \nits commitment to the global Organization and its \nreadiness to take part in its reform. I do not want to \nmisuse the time at my disposal to lobby for that \ncandidacy. Our deeds say more than our words, and our \ndeeds include a successful struggle for national \nindependence, despite an imposed war; the peaceful \ncompletion of that struggle through cooperation with \nthe United Nations; a courageous confrontation of the \npast and of the truth about that past; the establishment \nof good relations with all our neighbours, including \nthose that waged war against us; the promotion of the \npeaceful resolution of conflicts, always and \neverywhere; current participation in 15 United Nations \npeacekeeping missions, which puts Croatia at the very \ntop of those countries whose soldiers are today \nmaintaining peace under the blue flag. Let me \nemphasize that they are participating only in those \nmissions that are under a United Nations mandate. In \nshort, we are putting forward our candidacy as a \nmature European democratic country committed to the \ngoals of the United Nations, and there is nothing more \nto be said about it. \n As I have already said, we demonstrate our \ncommitment by supporting the reform of the world \nOrganization, but even in the realization of that noble \nand certainly unavoidable goal we are running late. \nEven among us, there are voices suggesting that we \nrenounce the United Nations. There is less and less \ntime for action. Even in that context, then, I must \nreiterate: Time is running out. \n In recent decades, this Hall has heard many \ndebates on the need to establish new political and \neconomic international relations. Such new relations \ncan be based only on equality. It is true that the high \nand the mighty have a greater responsibility, but it is \nalso true that no one   no one at all   can or may \nhave greater rights, much less usurp such rights by \nforce, just as nobody\u2019s rights can be denied by force. \nThat holds true for global and regional developments \nalike. Unfortunately, force is still present in \ninternational relations, and on the European continent \nwe are witnessing dangerous signs of a possible \nrenewal of the arms race. Such a trend should be \nstopped and such conditions changed. There is not \nmuch time. Once again, time is running out. \n By complying with the requirements of often \nuncontrolled development   and not only in the most \ndeveloped countries   and by giving in to the \naggressive needs of capital, guided exclusively by \ninterest and never by social factors, we have agreed to \ncondemn millions of people to death by starvation and \nfor lack of basic medical care, and hundreds of \nmillions to bare survival in poverty, with no prospects. \nHowever, by destroying nature, we have also \njeopardized everyone\u2019s survival. Climate change and \nglobal warming are only two indicators, albeit the most \nevident, of the situation to which I am referring. The \nsummit on climate change proved that we are all aware \nof the danger we are facing. Those who underestimate \nand even deny that real danger will simply have to face \nthe truth. We are already living that truth; fast, \ncoordinated and responsible action is called for. That \naction must serve the interests of all, even if it may \nmomentarily run against the interests of some, because \ntime is running out dangerously. \n We have not met yet again in the General \nAssembly in order to describe our world and our \nenvironment from our individual perspectives. Our \nmandate is not mere diagnosis. Our mandate involves \nhealing, changing and improving. With a foreign policy \nbased on the value of the European Union, which it \nwill enter soon, and with its desire to develop good \nrelations with everyone willing to reciprocate, the \nRepublic of Croatia has shown by deeds that it is aware \nof the fact that there is no time to be lost. It has also \nshown the capacity to act and to get things going in a \npositive direction, both in its own interest and in that of \nothers. \n We have only one world. Its destiny is in our \nhands. There is room for everyone in this world, but \nthis world can, may and must be only a world of \nequals, of people enjoying not only equal rights but \nalso equal opportunities, knowing that nobody, \nhowever big and strong, can live alone and only for his \nown sake, and that together we can change our world. \nEven more importantly, however, together we can save \nand preserve it for future generations. But let us not \nforget: time is running out. \n"

        "file_text": "The  Government of Paraguay comes to the Assembly to \nreaffirm its importance in examining the world \nsituation. We have also come in order to further \nstrengthen the United Nations as a body fit to represent \nthe interests of all countries and ensure the \neffectiveness of international law. \n For that reason, Sir, I express my support for your \nsuccessful presidency of the General Assembly at its \nsixty-second session. It is urgent for us to contribute \nnot only to meeting the objectives of the United \nNations, but also to ensuring that the principles \ngoverning its functioning truly find expression. The \nworld needs a better, more just and brotherly world \norder now. \n From this lofty universal rostrum, we customarily \nspeak with eloquent urgency, but the practice of States, \nin particular of the most powerful, has not always been \none of cooperating in order to overcome the \nuncertainties that overshadow our future.  \n In recent sessions of the Assembly, we have \nfocused on the challenges of the new millennium, but \nwhile we have been looking far ahead, in the first \ndecade of this new century alone, relations among \ncivilizations have clearly been marred by an absence of \npeace and harmony.  \n It has not mattered that more than half of the \nworld\u2019s population continues to live in poverty. Of \ngreater importance has been the senseless squandering \nof money on weapons and the terrible effect this has \nhad on the world economy. Note how the price of oil \nhas rapidly increased and how countries, such as ours, \nwhich do not produce oil, have had to make great \nsacrifices. How much money could have been used to \nalleviate poverty! As long as capital is concentrated in \none area and poverty continues to rise, world peace \nwill be precarious.  \n In Paraguay, in South America, we are calling for \nthe globalization of democracy combined with social \ndevelopment. We are calling for the universalization of \nsecurity based on respect for human rights and on the \ndignity of human life. \n In this way we hope to build a regional \ncommunity and a global union, which will work \ntogether to eradicate hunger and extreme poverty, and \nwhich will effectively cooperate to promote the \nparticipation of all in prosperity by providing quality \neducation and a system of social protection without \nexclusion.  \n In Paraguay, we are struggling for economic \nstability, for political stability and for social peace. \nWith these ideals, I have been working very hard at the \nhead of the Government to make significant changes \nand score important advances. We have sought radical \nchange beyond what is needed by the Paraguayan \nsociety. The achievements we have attained require \nthat we continue the progressive policy to which we \ncommitted ourselves when we assumed office. \n Since we took office in 2003, following a \nturbulent transition that was constantly undermined by \nviolence and conspiracy, Paraguay has institutionalized \npolitical stability   not an easy task in an environment \nof political division and with a parliament that did not \nalways meet its responsibilities in governing jointly. \nNevertheless, political stability has been, and continues \nto be, one of the defining characteristics of our \nGovernment. Through great perseverance, we have \nsucceeded in permanently institutionalizing political \nstability. We did so because I understood that stability \nhad to be the framework for achieving economic \ndevelopment, which is so crucial to achieving our plans \nfor incremental growth. Having achieved economic \nstability, we began a process of growth of historic \nproportions. After 20 years, Paraguay was able to \novercome stagnation. Despite the terrible drought in \nthe country, which continues to this day, Paraguay \nexperienced an average annual rate of economic \ngrowth of 4 per cent for the period 2003-2007. \n Moreover, my country has also recorded a \nbudgetary surplus. We have also markedly improved \nour tax receipts and are waging a difficult battle to \ncontrol inflation. Through that policy, not only have we \nconsiderably increased our financial reserves, which \nhave tripled, but for the first time in its history \nParaguay is today able to pay its foreign debt in full \nand still continue to hold international reserves. Our \nexports are at a historical high, having doubled during \nmy term of office. Another relevant factor has been the \nsustained growth in per capita production, which will \nrise from $915 to $1,800 by the end of my mandate, in \n2008.  \n More generally, the Government has been \npursuing plans aimed at strengthening various areas of \nthe economy, including the industrial, commercial and \nservice sectors. We have encouraged the transformation \nof the country\u2019s economy while coordinating and \nintegrating the various sectors of production and \nfacilitating the distribution, circulation and \nconsumption of domestically produced goods. We have \nthereby been able to lower the rate of poverty we \ninherited from previous Governments   which is now \napproaching 38 per cent, down from the 46 per cent at \nwhich it stood in 2003.  \nHowever, the poverty and marginalization of \nmillions of our fellow citizens continues to be the most \nobvious threat to democracy and political stability in \nParaguay as well as the region. Our belief that we will \ncontinue to overcome poverty is due to the \nGovernment\u2019s significant investment in society. Never \nbefore have so many houses been built nor more \nresources devoted to the most vulnerable members of \nour society. Next year, we will earmark 50 per cent of \nthe country\u2019s budget for the fight to reduce poverty.  \n As a multi-ethnic country, we have not ignored \nthe education of our indigenous citizens. We have built \nschools and established special programmes. As a \nbilingual country, we have both ensured Guaran\u00ed-\nlanguage education at all levels and worked towards \nhaving it recognized as a third official language of the \nCommon Market of the South (MERCOSUR). Prior to \nthe establishment of present-day borders, Guaran\u00ed was \nalso spoken in Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay and Bolivia. \n The Government over which I preside has \nensured unfettered political freedom, as well as \nfreedom of the press, association and expression. \nUnfortunately, the media have not always taken \nadvantage of the freedom of the press in order to \nbecome channels for truthful information, serious and \nresponsible opinion and constructive and reasoned \ncriticism   much less to overcome its vestigial \nManichaeism and instead to become a source of culture \nand daily provider of knowledge and ethical values. \n Political parties are independent and represented \nin the parliament. Those not in parliament exercise \ntheir rights freely as new political parties are formed.  \n There is in fact pluralism in Paraguay, although \nthe absence of an adequate civic culture on the part of \nmost political actors has kept it from genuinely \ncontributing to the essential consensus needed to \ndefend the country\u2019s overall interests and promoting \nequitable development within it. Unfortunately, \nremnants of fascism and conservatism continue to \nhamper coexistence in an environment of diversity and \ndifference, while also conspiring against the country\u2019s \nprogress. \n Nevertheless, our struggle for a participatory and \ninclusive democracy that promotes social justice has \ntransformed the governing party. Today\u2019s governing \nparty is promoting an advanced philosophy of social \nchange. It is also the political organization generating \nrenewal and social mobilization to overcome the old \nparty-based oligarchy that was so damaging to \nParaguay. The party has therefore assumed \nresponsibility for transforming the system whereby the \nState and its policies were subjugated to individual \ninterests. Through its political independence, the party \nis in a position to able to eliminate illegitimate \nprivileges and the illicit groups that control the \neconomy, finances and large land holdings.  \n We are continuing to modernize Paraguay by \nlinking the entire country with roads, exponentially \nexpanding its economy and ensuring that all citizens \nbecome part of the nation\u2019s social capital and possess \nthe qualities and competitiveness required by today\u2019s \nsocieties. Most of the people of Paraguay understand \nthat the historic steps we have taken in that direction \nmust continue and become irreversible. Today, anarchy, \ndemagoguery and theological feudalism pose a \nregressive threat to peace, the secular State, the rule of \nlaw and the institutional order we are building. \n Paraguay is the most open and dynamic country \nwith regard to the regional integration agenda. Our \nsupport for MERCOSUR is a clear reflection of our \nnational policy. We believe in MERCOSUR. We \nbelieve in regional integration. We believe in the \npossibility of Latin America having a louder voice in \nthe world in order to manage and humanize the process \nof globalization. \n My Government also endorses and supports the \nproposed union of South American nations, which will \nabove all make us stronger in claiming and defending \nour rights in an environment of asymmetrical \nglobalization and better able to contribute to world \npeace and more equitable distribution of international \ntrade and financing for development.  \n The international mobilization of financial and \ntechnological resources is today threatening the \nstability and overall progress of countries. Speculative \ninvestments flow to countries and regions where the \nwork force is subjected to exploitation. Then comes the \ninvasion; and, through unfair competition, our \nindustries are damaged and shut down. At the same \ntime, our raw materials are undervalued. What capital \nshould do is to promote industrialization, or at least \nensure that the terms of trade become fairer instead of \nbeing imposed unilaterally.  \nWe have to change this trend. The international \neconomic order should promote a more equitable world \neconomy. Through solidarity, cooperation and fair \ntreatment, all countries of the world should be admitted \ninto the club of development. In Latin America, and in \nParaguay, we don\u2019t need charity; we need markets, \ntransparency, technology, and the lifting of protective \ntrade barriers.  \n The United Nations should reflect this \nphilosophy. For this reason, its reform cannot be \ndelayed any longer. Its priority concerns should not be \nwar, armed conflict or even terrorism, whether real or \nstrategic. On the contrary, its priorities should be \nprogrammes to end poverty, ignorance and \nunemployment. We must educate and distribute in \norder to build a culture of democratic participation in \nthe wealth of humanity. \n Paraguay, like the other 30 landlocked developing \ncountries, continues to suffer marginalization and a \nlack of proper access to international markets. The \nabsence of preferential treatment for us from the more \ndeveloped economies has denied us a more competitive \nparticipation in trade, as well as, access to quotas and \nto higher tariffs. \n Paraguay is not only aware of the serious \nconsequences of climate change; it also suffers from \nthem. Proof of this is the catastrophe our country is \nsuffering through prolonged drought and the dreadful \nfires that have destroyed a major part of our territory. I \ntake this opportunity to express my deepest gratitude \non behalf of my people and my Government to the \ncountries that have come to our aid in this national \nemergency. In particular, I would like to thank, from \nthis rostrum, my friend Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, \nPresident of Brazil, Nestor Kirchner, President of \nArgentina, my friend President Chavez of Venezuela, \nand the other heads of Government and multilateral \norganizations that have worked with us. \n Paraguay recognizes the importance of including \ngender issues in the agenda of the United Nations and \nthe need for effective coordination among all agencies \nand organs in the United Nations system in addressing \nthe situation of women in the world, particularly in \ndeveloping countries. Increasingly and emphatically, \nwe reject existing inequalities between men and \nwomen whether they be political, economic, social or \ncultural. Irrespective of the domestic actions we take to \ncombat discrimination, we believe that the United \nNations is the most appropriate forum for designing \nprogrammes in support of national policies to bring \nabout true equality.  \n The Government of Paraguay would also like to \ntake this opportunity to express once again for its \nsupport for the request for admission into the United \nNations of the Republic of China, Taiwan, a nation that \nhas continued to struggle for its freedom and wishes to \nbe a member of the United Nations in accordance with \nRules 59 and 60 of the Provisional Rules of the \nSecurity Council and Article 4 of the United Nations \nCharter. \n In conclusion, inequalities among our peoples are \nnot part of the human condition. On the contrary, they \nare the result of iniquitous relations that separate us \nand draw us apart. That being the case, we need only to \nshow determination in building a universal community \nmarked by greater equanimity and balance. This \ndetermination should be given expression by \ngovernments and citizens and should draw on the \nconcerted efforts of States and civil society.  \n What we are seeing, however, is that the \ncountries that have most want more. Their humanism is \ndisguised in hand-outs and philanthropy when what the \nworld needs is greater solidarity and justice. We need \nto share science and technology; we need to share \nmarkets. The pretence of cooperation to help countries \nachieve balanced development is not only denounced \nin fruitless rhetoric; it is also exposed in protectionism \nand in investment choices. \n As long as this bipolar situation continues to \nprevail in the world, an organization such as the United \nNations serves little purpose. Only when the powerful \ncountries stop taking advantage of the less powerful \ncountries will the United Nations be able to have a true \nimpact on the lives of people. \n This alternative is the process that we are \ninvolved in today. Many Governments representing \ncountries in the Third World have begun to seek our \nown freedom. We are drawing a new map on the \ninternational scene.  \n I am compelled to mention this historic challenge \nin my final statement to the General Assembly of the \nUnited Nations because on 15 August 2008, I will hand \nover power to the new Government in my country. But \nI will continue to fight with greater fervour to help \nchange the world. I am committed as ever to the \ndifficult struggle to build a new world order, to ensure \nequality, social justice and solidarity for all countries, \nfor all women and for all men. I will fight for their \nemancipation and their progress. \n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of the \nRoyal Thai Government, allow me first to congratulate \nyou, Mr. President, and the former Yugoslav Republic \nof Macedonia on your election as the President of the \nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-second session. The Thai \ndelegation looks forward to rendering its full support \nfor the work of this session in the coming months. \n I also wish to take this opportunity to express my \nsincere appreciation to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon \nfor his tireless devotion to the United Nations and its \nreform. The first year in office is crucial for setting the \npriorities and future direction of this Organization, and \nthe Secretary-General is certainly faced with a great \nchallenge. \n Thailand is keen to work with the Secretary-\nGeneral towards a renewed United Nations   one that \nis more responsive and empowered to address \neffectively the needs of the peoples of our world. We \nare keen to do so because we are committed to what \nthe United Nations stands for: respect for equality, for \ndiversity, for human rights and for people. \n That commitment drives us to build a stronger \ndemocracy that is more transparent and has stronger \nsafeguards for our people. That commitment also \nguides us in building a sound, open economy and a \nmore just and equitable society governed by the rule of \nlaw   crucial underpinnings for sustainable \ndevelopment. \n All of that is taking place during a very special \nyear for the Thai people, namely, the eightieth birthday \nof His Majesty the King of Thailand. \n As most representatives probably know, exactly \none year has passed since Thailand moved to address \nthe unprecedented political paralysis in our democratic \nsystem. I wish to take this opportunity to assure our \nfriends that we are keeping to the timeline for the \nrevitalization of parliamentary democracy, with general \nelections scheduled for 23 December 2007. \n Exactly 10 years ago, Thailand suffered from a \ndeep crisis of a different nature. Through globalization, \nthat economic ailment quickly spread to many \ncountries and regions. Yet we have emerged from the \n1997 Asian financial crisis a stronger and more vibrant \nfree-market economy. Now, despite high oil prices and \nother challenges, Thailand\u2019s economic fundamentals \nare strong. \n But, while continued economic growth over the \npast decade has lifted millions of Thais out of poverty, \nsome 10 per cent have not benefited. Thailand, like \nother developing countries, continues to face \nchallenges to sustainable development in the form of \nincome disparities and an urban/rural divide. \n I believe that governments have a moral \nresponsibility to address disparities in income \ndistribution. This is why Thailand has made it our \nnational priority to promote growth with equity and to \nachieve development from within. Our approach has \nbeen based on His Majesty the King\u2019s philosophy of a \n\u201csufficiency economy\u201d, which calls for moderation and \nmindfulness in consumption, prudent economic \ndecision-making and careful risk management. The \nphilosophy\u2019s recognition by the United Nations \nDevelopment Programme in its 2007 Thailand Human \nDevelopment Report has strengthened our conviction \nthat we are on the right track. \n The Government is leading that effort through \nuniversal education and investing in basic \ninfrastructure for people-centred development. We \nbelieve that emphasis on moderation and knowledge \nwill lead to a more equitable society, which is \nfundamental to sustainable development and immunity \nfrom external shocks. \n In addition to promoting growth with equity, \ngovernments must also ensure that progress does not \ncome at the expense of the environment. For Thailand, \nthe sufficiency economy\u2019s concepts of moderation and \nmindfulness relate directly to the sustainable utilization \nof natural resources. Thailand aims at cutting back on \nits reliance on fossil fuels and at lowering greenhouse \ngas emissions through energy conservation. \n At the same time, we seek to meet our growing \nenergy demand through renewable energy and biofuels. \nWe are also considering the option of nuclear energy, \npaying heed to the crucial issue of safety. \n But Thailand realizes that a significant reduction \nof fossil fuel use will likely take a few more decades, \nowing to the high costs of new technology. There must \nbe greater partnership between countries that have \ndeveloped clean energy technologies and those who \nlack them. We therefore reiterate our call for research \nand development cooperation and the affordable \ntransfer of clean coal and methane reduction \ntechnologies. \n An inevitable consequence of climate change is \nunpredictability of the water supply. As a major food-\nproducing country, and in line with His Majesty the \nKing\u2019s \u201cWater is life\u201d initiative, water conservation is a \nlong-term priority for the Thai Government. We have \nmade a commitment to increasing the country\u2019s \nforested and water catchment areas. I would like to call \non all nations to make water management a priority on \nour climate change agenda as well. \n Thailand places great importance on promoting \nhuman security and is an active member of the Human \nSecurity Network. I have spoken about Thailand\u2019s \nefforts to provide our people with freedom from want \nthrough democratic reform, respect for human rights \nand people-centred and sustainable development. The \nother side of human security is freedom from fear. As a \nresult of fear and mistrust, individuals and \ncommunities fall prey to extremist ideas that further \ndivide humanity. I strongly believe that the best \nstrategy to conquer such fear is winning hearts and \nminds, and Thailand is committed to fostering cross-\ncultural understanding. \n But terrorism continues to draw its strength from \nextremist ideologies. So we must appeal to the majority \nin the world who are moderates to join forces against \nextremism. In addition, enhancing inter- and intra-faith \ndialogue and dialogue among civilizations should take \nplace at the regional level. We are doing that in South-\nEast Asia. \n As a neighbouring country sharing a land border \nof more than 2,400 kilometres with Myanmar and \ncurrently hosting more than a million of its citizens, \nThailand is gravely concerned about what we are \nseeing and hearing about in Myanmar. Thailand and \nMyanmar, being predominantly Buddhist, share a \nbelief in non-violence and tolerance. Thailand \ntherefore finds unacceptable the commission of \nviolence and bodily harm to Buddhist monks and other \ndemonstrators in Yangon. \n This morning, the Association of Southeast Asian \nNations (ASEAN) discussed the situation in Myanmar. \nASEAN is appalled to have received reports of the use \nof automatic weapons and demands that the Myanmar \nGovernment immediately desist from the use of \nviolence against demonstrators. ASEAN expressed \nrevulsion over reports that demonstrations in Myanmar \nare being suppressed by violent force and that there \nhave been a number of fatalities. We strongly urge \nMyanmar to exercise the utmost restraint, to seek a \npolitical solution and resume its efforts aimed at \nnational reconciliation with all parties concerned, and \nto work towards a peaceful transition to democracy. We \ncall for the release of all political detainees, including \nDaw Aung San Suu Kyi. \n ASEAN fully supports the decision of Secretary-\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon to send Special Envoy Ibrahim \nGambari to Myanmar. We ask the Myanmar \nGovernment to cooperate fully and to work with him. \nMr. Gambari\u2019s role as a neutral interlocutor among all \nthe parties can help to defuse the dangerous situation. \nASEAN urges Myanmar to grant him full access to all \nparties in the country, as it has done in the past. \n Thailand is undergoing changes that will make it \na more capable partner of the international community \nand the United Nations. At the regional level, Thailand \nis eager to work with our ASEAN partners to create a \ncloser community. Strengthened by a new Charter, \nASEAN will be able to cooperate more effectively with \nits United Nations partners.  \n Indeed, promoting closer cooperation between \nASEAN and the United Nations   two organizations \nthat share the same values and goals   will be one \ncontribution to restoring faith in the multilateral \nsystem. Another will be supporting ongoing United \nNations reform efforts. Together with Chile, South \nAfrica and Sweden, Thailand has put forth the Four \nNations Initiative proposals, aimed at improving the \ngovernance and management of the Secretariat on the \nbasis of increased accountability and transparency. \n Thailand\u2019s cooperation with the international \ncommunity and the United Nations is being further \nenhanced by new people-centred initiatives. Our new \nconstitution provides for universal education and \nhealth care, gender equality, respect for children\u2019s \nrights and a social safety net for the poor, the disabled \nand the elderly. More than ever before, we are \ncommitted to combating HIV/AIDS and other global \nhealth threats. \n In the area of poverty eradication, Thailand is \nalso committed to going beyond our borders to assist \nour friends and neighbours. Our Mae Fah Luang \nFoundation\u2019s community development model is being \nreplicated in Afghanistan and Indonesia. Thai troops \nparticipating in United Nations peacekeeping missions \nare recognized for their contributions in rebuilding \nbasic infrastructures in post-conflict areas. \n We see that the immediate resumption of the \nDoha Round of multilateral trade negotiations is \nessential to help the developing world achieve the \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs). And, as the \ntwelfth session of the United Nations Conference on \nTrade and Development, to be held in Accra next year, \napproaches, Thailand is looking forward to discussing \nideas for South-South and trilateral cooperation to \naddress the opportunities and challenges of \nglobalization for development. \n This has been a year of great reform for Thailand. \nThe current political and social reforms that are taking \nplace in my country will allow us to make greater \ncontributions to a world where people can live in \nsecurity and dignity, free from poverty and despair   a \nworld where the present generation enhances the \nability of future generations to meet their own needs. \n As the world grows smaller by the day, humanity, \nmore than ever before, is sharing a common destiny. \nOur faith in the United Nations and in the multilateral \nprocess must be equal to the challenges and \nopportunities facing us. \n"

        "file_text": "I join my colleagues in \ncongratulating you, Sir, on your election as President \nof the General Assembly at its sixty-second session. I \nwould also like to wish His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-\nmoon well for this, his first full session of the General \nAssembly as Secretary-General.  \n On behalf of the Australian Government, let me \nbegin by reaffirming Australia\u2019s long-standing call for \nreform of the United Nations. Australia strongly \nsupports efforts to make the Organization more \neffective. And Australia would like to acknowledge \nSecretary-General Ban\u2019s push for reform so far. \n But reform of the United Nations is not an end in \nitself. We must reform the United Nations so that it can \nact decisively to meet global challenges. Simply \ntalking about issues does not solve problems. \n Over the past 60 years, when the United Nations \nhas acted it has proved its worth. United Nations \npeacekeeping operations around the world have saved \nlives and helped communities rebuild. Australia has a \nproud history of supporting them. Australia was the \nfirst country on the ground in what was arguably the \nfirst-ever United Nations peacekeeping operation, the \n1947 Consular Commission to Indonesia. In the past 60 \nyears, Australia has made contributions to 39 United \nNations peacekeeping operations, and we continue that \ntradition today. \n The United Nations, as the only Organization \nwith a truly global membership, has both a unique \nopportunity to meet challenges and a responsibility to \ntake action. By coming together, we can achieve more \nthan each of our countries could on its own. The \nUnited Nations has great moral authority. But, if it fails \nto act decisively, that authority will be squandered. \n As Members of the United Nations, we have set \nourselves important goals over the past 62 years: \nmaintaining global peace and security, supporting \neconomic and social development and advancing \nhuman rights. In 2005, we pledged to protect those \npeople who are most vulnerable: those facing genocide, \nwar crimes and crimes against humanity. We \nrecognized the responsibility to protect as a central \ntenet of our shared humanity.  \n This responsibility to protect underpins the notion \nthat States must protect their own populations. But, if \nthey should fail to do so, the international community \nhas a responsibility to act, not to stand idly by in the \nface of atrocities, genocide or ethnic cleansing. For the \ninternational community, that means we must commit \nto prevent and respond to these most serious of \ncrimes, wherever they occur. After the immediate crisis \nhas passed, we must support recovery efforts to help \ncommunities rebuild and reconcile, by addressing the \ncauses of the crisis. \n Last year, the Security Council drew upon the \nresponsibility to protect for the first time in a country-\nspecific resolution: resolution 1706 (2006), on Darfur. \nAnd, under a subsequent resolution, an African Union-\nUnited Nations hybrid peacekeeping operation was \nestablished, with a robust mandate to protect civilians \nand humanitarian workers. The international \ncommunity must now ensure that the deployment of \nthe Hybrid force proceeds quickly. Active cooperation \nis needed across the international community if we are \nto keep our promise to the people of Darfur. The \nalternative \u2014 to fail \u2014 is unthinkable. This is a test for \nthe United Nations and its Member States. \n But resolving the tragedy in Darfur is, first and \nforemost, a test for the Government of Sudan and other \nparties to the conflict. Ongoing military operations by \nthe Government of Sudan, and last weekend\u2019s killing \nand abduction of African Union peacekeepers by rebel \nforces, demonstrate the urgent need for the parties to \nstop these crimes and build peace. Those who have \ncommitted crimes in Darfur must be punished. \n Australia calls on the Government of Sudan to act \non the warrants issued by the International Criminal \nCourt. We call on Sudan to arrest those accused and to \nhand them over to the Court. \n Darfur is not the only humanitarian crisis we \nhave experienced or will face in the United Nations. \nTragically, other populations will also require \nprotection from crimes against humanity. The \nresponsibility to protect provides the necessary guide \nto action. But it is up to Security Council members, on \nbehalf of the international community, to act, and for \nall United Nations members to then support them. \n The events of the past week in Burma remind us \nof the irrepressible human impulse to seek democratic \nfreedoms and human rights. The United Nations and \nindividual countries must let the courageous protestors \nin Burma know that their message is understood \u2014 a \nmessage on the need to move towards genuine \ndemocratic progress and national reconciliation, and \naway from military domination. \n Australia has joined the international community \nin condemning the violent suppression of peaceful \ndemonstrations by monks and civilians. We call for the \nimmediate release of those arrested for exercising their \nfundamental human rights to peaceful protest and for \nhumane treatment of all those detained. Australia is \nalso introducing targeted financial measures against \nmembers of the Burmese regime and its supporters to \nincrease pressure on them to engage in genuine \npolitical reform and national reconciliation. \n Australia supports the consistent efforts that the \nUnited Nations has made to monitor and improve the \nsituation in Burma. We welcomed the statement by the \nUnited Nations Security Council following its special \nconsultations on 26 September. We welcome the \ncurrent visit to Burma by the United Nations Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s Special Envoy, Mr. Ibrahim Gambari, and his \naccess to Daw Aung San Suu Kyi. We urge the \nBurmese authorities to work constructively and \nmeaningfully with him in support of his United \nNations-mandated mission. Mr. Gambari is well placed \nto assist in achieving a peaceful resolution to the \ncurrent crisis. \n The responsibility to protect means that we, the \ninternational community, must act when confronted \nwith the most serious of crimes. But we also have to \nact to confront a range of global challenges, from \nterrorism and climate change to poverty. Terrorists \nstand in stark contrast to those of us who seek to \nprotect the vulnerable. Their goals are global and their \nreach transnational. No single country can solve the \nproblem alone. There have been some successes in \ncombating terrorist networks, but we need to develop \neven more effective strategies to disrupt and dismantle \ntheir networks. \n Australia calls on Member States of the United \nNations to implement fully all relevant Security \nCouncil resolutions on freezing the assets of terrorists. \nTerrorist organizations must be starved of their funds \nand support. Australia also calls on Member States to \nconclude a comprehensive convention against terrorism \nas soon as possible. A convention would provide a \nsolid foundation for international cooperation to \nprevent, prosecute and punish terrorist acts. \n The international community must support the \nefforts of States that fight terrorism \u2014 in particular, \nfledgling democratic States. We must help those States \nto establish strong democratic institutions and \naccountable Government structures, as State weakness \ncan only allow terrorism to fester. \n We should cooperate also to prevent man-\nportable air-defence systems from falling into the \nhands of terrorist groups. We should also intensify \nwork on the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear \nTerrorism. Australia urges Member States to join the \nInitiative. \n We must also act to stop the spread of weapons of \nmass destruction. Australia welcomes the robust action \ntaken by the Security Council over the past year in \nimposing sanctions against programmes relating to \nproliferation in the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of \nKorea and also in Iran. The Security Council\u2019s action \non the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea nuclear \nissue sent a strong signal to that country that the \ninternational community would not tolerate its nuclear \nprogrammes. We welcome recent progress in the Six-\nParty Talks. We call on the Democratic People\u2019s \nRepublic of Korea to maintain the momentum and \nimplement fully its commitment to denuclearize. \n The Security Council also sent a strong message \nto Iran. We welcome Iran\u2019s stated intention to work \nwith the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) \nto address long-outstanding issues. But the \ninternational community, including Australia, remains \ndeeply concerned about Iran\u2019s nuclear programme. Iran \nshould suspend its uranium enrichment programme, as \nrequired by the Security Council, and cooperate fully \nwith the IAEA. \n Australia also hopes that the United Nations can \ncontinue its work in protecting populations by raising \nbarriers against the illicit trade in conventional \nweapons. We support the development of an arms trade \ntreaty. \n Climate change is another challenge that clearly \nrequires our urgent attention. Climate change demands \nan effective and enduring global response. The United \nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change is \nthe forum to forge such a global response. On 9 \nSeptember, the leaders of the 21-member Asia-Pacific \nEconomic Cooperation (APEC) economies issued the \nhistoric Sydney Declaration on Climate Change, \nEnergy Security and Clean Development. The APEC \nleaders agreed to work to achieve a common \nunderstanding on long-term aspirational goals to \nreduce emissions and pave the way for an effective \npost-2012 international arrangement. \n Significantly, the APEC leaders, whose \neconomies represent over half of the world\u2019s gross \ndomestic product (GDP), agreed that the post-2012 \nagreement needs to be comprehensive and that all \neconomies should contribute to meeting shared global \ngoals. They also agreed that our responses must be \nequitable and environmentally and economically \neffective, as well as capable of including diverse \napproaches. \n The High-Level Event on Climate Change, hosted \nby the Secretary-General on 24 September, and the \nMajor Economies Meeting on Energy, Security and \nClimate Change, hosted by United States Secretary \nRice a few days later, highlighted these same goals and \nbuilt additional international momentum for a post-\n2012 agreement. Australia calls on parties to this year\u2019s \nUnited Nations conference on climate change in Bali to \nagree to a new mandate for the Convention that will \nmove beyond Kyoto and forge a comprehensive new \nagreement. \n The international community must also address \npressing health and human security issues, in particular \nthe spread of HIV/AIDS. Failure to combat HIV/AIDS \nwill have global economic and social consequences. \nAustralia takes its responsibility to act seriously and \ncontinues to support its near neighbours in the Asia \nPacific region to address the challenge of HIV/AIDS. \n The Australian Government believes that the \nchallenge of ending endemic poverty remains the \nsingle most difficult economic and social issue, and yet \nthe most fundamental one. In a world where \ninternational commerce moves at the click of a button, \npeople should not be starving. Commerce and \neconomic development have the power to lift people \nout of poverty. Free and open trade helps countries to \ndevelop through integration into the world trading \nsystem. We must conclude the Doha Round and deliver \nresults that increase market access and reduce domestic \nsubsidies. \n Development assistance, too, plays a key role in \nalleviating poverty. At the United Nations Summit in \n2005, Australia undertook to double its development \nassistance budget by the year 2010, and we are well on \nthe way to achieving that goal, but this aid must be \nfocused and delivered in a way that promotes broad-\nbased economic growth and encourages good \ngovernance. We need to make long-term commitments, \nparticularly in post-conflict development and \nreconstruction.  \n I have outlined today serious global challenges \nfacing the international community \u2014 humanitarian \nand political crises, including in Darfur and Burma, \nclimate change, poverty, weapons of mass destruction \nand terrorism. The Security Council has drawn upon \nthe responsibility to protect principle, endorsed by \nleaders at the 2005 Summit. It is clear that the \ninternational community as a whole has a \nresponsibility to protect those facing genocide, war \ncrimes and crimes against humanity. \n Our task is to respond quickly and effectively. \nThe United Nations has been vested with great \nauthority by its Members to effect real change. But that \nauthority will mean little unless we turn commitment \ninto action. \n"

        "file_text": "I would like to  begin by congratulating Mr. Kerim on his election as \nPresident of the General Assembly. I would also like to \nwish our Secretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, every \nsuccess at his first full session of the General Assembly \nsince taking office. He has been very active in his first \nnine months. The Netherlands fully supports his efforts \nto promote peace and development in the world and to \nmake the United Nations more effective. \n I am convinced that the success or failure of the \nUnited Nations depends on three fundamental factors. \nThe first is how much inspiration we draw from our \ncommon values: respect for human rights, for the rule \nof law and for our planet. The second is how much we \nshoulder our responsibility as members of the \ninternational community. And the third is how \nsuccessful we are in making the United Nations more \nrelevant and in increasing the impact of the \ninternational community. I will deal with each of these \nthree themes in turn   respect, responsibility and \nrelevance. \n Next year it will be 60 years since the General \nAssembly adopted the Universal Declaration of Human \nRights (resolution 217 A (III)). The values contained in \nthat Declaration and in the conventions based on it are \nour source of inspiration. In its preamble, the \nDeclaration sets out our mission: \u201cthe advent of a \nworld in which human beings shall enjoy freedom of \nspeech and belief and freedom from fear and want\u201d. \nFor the past 60 years, those values have been our moral \ncompass, our common standard of achievement. \nWhatever our differences of opinion, we must never \nlose sight of that common ideal. We all agree that \nevery human being deserves a chance to build a good \nlife. Respect for human rights and the rule of law is our \ndeepest motive and our highest aspiration. Our \ndiversity rests on that unity. We should not hesitate to \nhold one another to account.  \n As we speak, the situation in one country in \nparticular calls for urgent action by the international \ncommunity. In Burma, the military are shooting at \nmonks and civilians, who are demonstrating peacefully. \nWe strongly condemn that brutal use of force. Together \nwith the European Union and the United States, we call \non the Security Council to discuss the situation \nurgently and to consider further steps, including \nsanctions. Should the Security Council not reach \nagreement, we will shoulder our responsibility. In that \ncase, I am convinced the European Union and the \nUnited States will decide on further measures, together \nwith other well-intentioned countries. \n When it comes to human rights and the rule of \nlaw, I am not talking about abstractions. Every child \nthat can go to school, every family that can live in \npeace and freedom with its neighbours and every \ncountry that enjoys prosperity and tolerance is a step \ntowards fulfilling our dream. \n Values connect us across our cultures and \nreligions. We must not allow cultural or religious \ndifferences to create barriers to open dialogue. Asma \nJahangir, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on \nfreedom of religion or belief, tells us that religious \nfreedom is under threat in many parts of the world. So, \nwe have a lot to do. \n The Netherlands wants to join forces with all \nthose who want to promote tolerance and dialogue \nbetween civilizations. But we must not allow that \ndialogue to put the universal validity of our common \nvalues in question. We know from experience how \nfundamental our shared values are. The Netherlands is \none country in the world. But in a sense, we are also \nthe world in one country. Our capital, Amsterdam, is \nhome to 177 nationalities. We have learned that only \nthrough unity in diversity can we make progress, \nlocally, nationally and internationally. That means that \nthe rule of law must be strictly enforced so that people \ncan feel safe. It also means that we need to be more \ntolerant and willing to take a critical look at ourselves. \nStressing our differences leads to polarization and \nsolves nothing.  \n We owe respect not only to one another, but also \nto our planet. It gives us everything we need, provided \nthat we treat its natural resources wisely and do not \nupset its natural balance. That is why sustainability is \none of our most important values. A value is not \nsomething that we possess. It is not an achievement \nthat we can boast about. A value is a task, an incentive \nto action. Cherishing values automatically means \naccepting responsibility. \n Membership of the United Nations goes hand in \nhand with moral responsibility. It means more than \nattending meetings and even paying our dues. It also \nmeans keeping our commitments. The treaties we sign \nmust not remain a dead letter. Human rights must be \nrespected. The Netherlands is proud to contribute, for \nexample as a member and a Vice-President of the \nHuman Rights Council. \n In 2005 the United Nations adopted the principle \nof the responsibility to protect. In doing so, we sided \nwith all those suffering from genocide or crimes \nagainst humanity. It is now time to put that principle \ninto practice. The United Nations has a key \nresponsibility as a protector of peace and security. \nEach of us shares that responsibility. In this age of \nrapid communications and global linkage, nothing is \nfar away anymore. What happens elsewhere affects us \nall. \n We can only secure lasting peace in areas of \nconflict if we combine defence with development and \ndiplomacy. We are putting that concept into practice in \nthe Afghan province of Uruzgan, together with our \nAustralian partners and other allies. It is a difficult and \ndemanding mission under United Nations mandate. The \ninternational community must not abandon Afghanistan \nto its fate. The hopes of millions of Afghans rest with \nus. The United Nations needs to broaden and intensify \nits role in Afghanistan.  \n The Peacebuilding Commission has a vital role to \nplay in bridging the gap between conflict and \ndevelopment. In the past year, it has worked hard to \nhelp several African countries that are on the difficult \nroad of reconstruction after being torn apart by \nconflict. The Netherlands is actively supporting that \nvery promising approach, which focuses on prevention. \n Assembly President Kerim has drawn attention to \nanother responsibility we all share: the need for prompt \naction to tackle the problem of climate change. The \nindustrialized countries   and that means all of \nthem   should take the lead. But the countries that are \nnow enjoying rapid economic growth are also being \nasked to develop more sustainably. The future lies with \nthose countries that excel in energy conservation and \nthe use of cleaner technologies. We are not yet making \nsufficient use of the scope that innovation offers us.  \n The Netherlands wants to be a front-runner, not \nonly in our ambition to sharply reduce greenhouse gas \nemissions, but also in developing new strategies to deal \nwith the negative effects of climate change. It is \nimportant to take climate and nature into account in all \nour investments. The most vulnerable developing \ncountries deserve more support in tackling the \nproblems they face. \n In December, at the Bali Climate Change \nConference, the United Nations has a unique \nopportunity to take charge of the situation and create a \nunited global framework for addressing the climate \nproblem. European government leaders would like to \nsee negotiations start in Bali on a follow-up to Kyoto. \nThe Netherlands and its European partners will do all \nthey can to accomplish that. \n Responsibility also means ongoing efforts to \nmake the United Nations more relevant. The United \nNations is the platform for seeking global solutions to \nglobal problems. The world needs an effective United \nNations. How can we be more effective, efficient and \ncredible? We need to strengthen the rule of law and put \nan end to impunity. We are not yet making full use of \nthe instruments we have. I say this as Prime Minister of \na country that is proud to have the legal capital of the \nworld   The Hague   within its borders. Without \njustice, there can be no lasting peace and no \nreconciliation. We would like to see the jurisdiction of \nthe International Court of Justice and the International \nCriminal Court accepted more widely. We stress the \nneed for cooperation by both member and non-member \nStates with the International Criminal Court in general \nand with regard to the execution of arrest warrants in \nparticular. \n The Netherlands will continue to make a special \neffort to promote the international legal order. That is \nwhy we have responded positively to the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s request to host the Lebanon tribunal in the \nNetherlands. Preparations for that tribunal are in full \nswing.  \n Enforcing the rule of law is not enough to make \nthe United Nations more relevant. We also need to keep \na critical eye on how we work. Let us resist the \ntemptation to invest too much energy in resolutions we \nadopt every year. It is better to invest in strengthening \nconfidence between North and South, West and East. \nPeople and resources are scarce. We can only spend \neach euro once. If we want to achieve our common \naims, such as the Millennium Development Goals, we \nneed to coordinate our efforts. \n Several dozen United Nations agencies are active \naround the world. We have planted a forest of United \nNations flags in various countries. We need a more \nunified approach in order to help the poorest \ndeveloping countries more. We can work far more \nefficiently if we pool our resources in a single \nprogramme in each country. That makes demands on \ndonors. Several countries, including the Netherlands, \nnow fund various United Nations organizations on the \nbasis of multi-year plans. I hope that others will follow \nsuit. \n The Netherlands supports the Secretary-General\u2019s \nefforts to reform the United Nations system and the \nSecurity Council. Reforms are never easy, but they are \nessential. In a world that is changing at breakneck \nspeed, we need multilateral institutions that can \nrespond to new developments. A relevant United \nNations means a dynamic United Nations with \ndynamic institutions. \n Reforms are sometimes seen as giving up \ncertainties. I am convinced that we need to reform in \norder to safeguard what we all hold dear: respect for \nhuman rights, enforcement of the rule of law and \nsustainable development for all nations. Those values \nare the lifeblood of the United Nations. Respect for our \nvalues means taking joint responsibility. Responsibility \nmeans a constant effort to make the United Nations \nmore relevant. We want our values to take concrete \nform in the twenty-first century in people\u2019s lives and in \ninternational relations. That demands unity of purpose, \ncourage and resolution from us all. Above all, it \nrequires ambition, the ambition to make a determined \neffort   while respecting our differences   to realize \nour common ideals. What we need in the twenty-first \ncentury is united values, united ideals, a united world \nand the United Nations. \n"

        "file_text": "At the outset, I would like \nto congratulate the President on his assumption of the \nhigh office of President of the General Assembly at its \nsixty-second session. I would also like to convey \nMyanmar\u2019s appreciation to his predecessor, Her \nExcellency Sheikha Haya Rashed Al Khalifa, for her \nable stewardship of the previous session. The annual \nreport of the Secretary-General reflects the significant \nwork done in the past year by the United Nations in \nmeeting the challenges we face. We congratulate \nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his successful first \nyear in office and welcome his timely initiative with \nregard to such pressing global issues as climate change. \nThe High-level Event on Climate Change has reignited \nthe international community\u2019s interest in climate \nchange, and rightly so. Climate change remains the \nmost critical challenge that the international \ncommunity faces today. The adverse effects of climate \nchange, such as sea-level rise, hurricanes, floods, \ndrought and desertification, particularly in recent \nyears, are a stark reminder of the negative impact that \nclimate change has on the long-term economic and \nsocial development of the global community, \nparticularly the developing countries.  \n To address the adverse impacts of climate change, \nwe need concerted action at the national, regional and \ninternational levels. We need to be mindful that climate \nchange is not merely an environmental issue, but also a \nsustainable development issue. Accordingly, an \nintegrated and coordinated approach is required. For its \npart, Myanmar is pursuing a national environmental \npolicy based on the sustainable utilization of natural \nresources. In 1991, we adopted the Myanmar Agenda \n21, which serves as an important guideline for both the \npublic and private sectors. \n Myanmar also pursues a system of sustainable \nforest management. We have implemented a \nnationwide programme of afforestation and \nreforestation. As a result, we have been able to retain a \nforest cover of 50 per cent in the country. Myanmar \nwas among the 12 nations that took part in the Asia \nLeast-cost Greenhouse Gas Abatement Strategy in \ncooperation with the Asian Development Bank. The \ninventory of greenhouse gas emissions taken under the \nStrategy confirms that Myanmar is more of a sink than \na source of carbon dioxide emissions. The baseline \nprojection of the 2020 national greenhouse inventory \nalso shows that the forestry sector will continue to be a \nsignificant sink in Myanmar in the future. \n The economic activities undertaken by developed \ncountries, both historically and currently, are mainly \nresponsible for the emissions of greenhouse gases that \naffect the global climate system. The developing \ncountries, which are least responsible for contributing \nto climate change, face the greatest risk from its \nadverse impacts. Addressing the challenge of climate \nchange requires an integrated approach to economic \ngrowth, social development and environmental \nprotection. Concerted action must be taken within the \nframework of the internationally agreed United Nations \nFramework Convention on Climate Change and its \nKyoto Protocol, based on the principle of common but \ndifferentiated responsibilities. It will require developed \ncountries to provide new and additional financial \nresources to developing countries and to fulfil the \ncommitments made at various international \nconferences. \n The impact of climate change is particularly felt \nin developing countries and has adversely affected \nnational development prospects. In order to effectively \nmeet the challenge of climate change, we would also \nhave to address poverty alleviation; then and only then \nwould the developing countries be able to achieve \ninternationally agreed development goals, including \nthe Millennium Development Goals. It is, therefore, \nincumbent on the developed countries, whose \ndevelopment process rely heavily on the natural \nresource acquired from the developing countries, to \nprovide the necessary financial resource. \n Underdevelopment and mass deprivations lead to \neconomic, political and social hardships in developing \ncountries. Development provides an environment \nconducive to democracy. I would like to call upon the \nentire international community to work together for \npoverty alleviation. \n The scourge of terrorism knows no boundaries. \nCombating terrorism is the common endeavour of the \nentire international community. I would like to stress \nhere that terrorism in any form or manifestation must \nbe rejected. It is the innocent people who bear the \nbrunt of terrorist activities. To combat terrorism \neffectively, we also must address its root causes. \nPoverty, grievances and underlying political, economic \nand social conditions provide fertile ground for the \nspread of terrorism. These root causes of terrorism \nmust be addressed. \n Friendly relations among nations should be based \non respect for the principles of equal rights and self-\ndetermination. Countries should show goodwill, \npractice tolerance and live together in peace and \nharmony. Nations have various historical backgrounds, \ndiffering cultures, and different religions and customs. \nNations are not identical. However, respecting those \nbasic principles and practicing friendship and goodwill \nwill effectively contribute to our common endeavour to \ncombat terrorism. \n Today, the world is facing diverse problems and \ndaunting challenges. The United Nations, which \nrepresents the world community, is called upon to \nresolve them. Our Organization was formed in order to \nmaintain international peace and security, develop \nfriendly relations among nations and promote \ncooperation in solving international problems of an \neconomic, social, cultural or humanitarian character. In \norder to effectively address the full range of \nchallenges, the reform of the United Nations, as called \nfor by our leaders in the World Summit Outcome, must \nbe successfully implemented. \n I am confident, Mr. President, that under your \nable leadership we will make significant progress in \nthe United Nations reform process, taking into \nconsideration the position of the vast majority of the \nmembership. \n We are greatly disturbed to witness \nneocolonialism rearing its ugly head in recent years. \nThe strategies employed are obvious. As a first step, \nthe neocolonialists conduct media campaigns against \nthe targeted country and spread disinformation that the \ncountry concerned is committing gross human rights \nviolations. They portray these campaigns as a fight for \ndemocracy. Secondly, they impose sanctions, which \nhinder economic development and cause poverty \namong the people. Here I would like to stress that \neconomic sanctions are counterproductive and can only \ndelay the path to democracy. As a third step, they \nprovide political, financial and other material support \nin order to create unrest in the country. Finally, under \nthe pretext that a country is undemocratic and unstable \nand that it poses a threat to international peace and \nsecurity, they intervene directly and invade the country. \nCurrent events clearly show that such a course of \naction can only result in conflict and untold suffering \nfor the people of the country. \n My country is currently subjected to such courses \nof action. The international community should also be \nwary of those neocolonialist attempts. Here it must be \nstressed that the destiny of each and every country can \nonly be determined by its Government and its own \npeople. It cannot be imposed from outside. On our part, \nwe are determined to proceed resolutely towards \ndemocracy along our chosen path. \n In the life of every nation, there are times when it \nmust face challenging situations and overcome them. \nMyanmar has gone through such a challenge recently. \nThe situation would not have deteriorated, if the initial \nprotest of a small group of activists against the rise in \nfuel prices had not been exploited by political \nopportunists. They sought to turn the situation into a \npolitical showdown, aided and abetted by certain \npowerful countries. They also took advantage of \nprotests staged initially by a small group of Buddhist \nclergy demanding an apology for the maltreatment of \nmonks by local authorities. The security personnel \nexercised the utmost restraint and did not intervene for \nnearly a month. However, when the mob became \nunruly and provocative, they were compelled to declare \na curfew. Subsequently, when protestors ignored their \nwarnings, they had to take action to restore the \nsituation. Normalcy has now returned to Myanmar. \n The rule of law is a fundamental principle \naccepted by nations. Without it there can be neither the \norderly conduct of the day-to-day affairs of State nor \nthe enjoyment of human rights and democracy by the \npeople. \n Myanmar is a multi-ethnic and multireligious \nsociety. It is home to over 100 national races who have \nlived together in weal or woe over the centuries. \nNational unity is of paramount importance to us. We \nhave, therefore, been striving to strengthen the fabric \nof our nation. In keeping with the aspirations of the \npeople for democratization, a seven-step road map was \ndeclared, and a national convention was held to lay \ndown the principles for a new constitution. Work was \nconcluded on 3 September 2007, adopting by \nconsensus the fundamental principles for the new \nconstitution. Based on these principles, a draft \nconstitution will be drawn up by legal experts. All the \nremaining steps will be implemented phase by phase. \n This process is applauded by the people. To date, \npeople in 11 townships have convened rallies in \nsupport of the successful conclusion of the national \nconvention. Townships all over the country are \nexpected to hold similar rallies. \n Recent events make clear that there are elements \nwithin and outside the country that wish to de-rail the \nongoing process so that they can take advantage of the \nchaos that would follow. They have become more and \nmore emboldened and have stepped up their campaign \nto confront the Government. \n The Myanmar Government is fully aware of its \nresponsibility to lead the nation in the process of \ntransformation to a disciplined democracy. We have \nlaid out a road map and will work conscientiously to \nachieve our goals. Significant progress has already \nbeen made. The process can be successfully completed, \nsooner rather than later, if no obstacles are placed in \nour path. In this regard, the international community \ncan best help Myanmar by showing greater \nunderstanding. They can begin by refraining from \nmeasures which would result in adding fuel to the fire. \n One area where the international community can \ndemonstrate good faith and objectivity is to \nacknowledge the good work done in Myanmar in \ncombating the scourge of narcotic drugs. As a result of \nour efforts to rid our country of those drugs by the year \n2014, the production of opium has plummeted to \nunprecedented levels. In the World Drug Report 2006, \nthe United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime reported \nthat in 2005 the total area under opium poppy \ncultivation showed a decrease of 26 per cent when \ncompared to that of 2004. The World Drug Report 2007 \nconfirms that in 2006 the total area under opium poppy \ncultivation was approximately 21,500 hectares, \nrepresenting a decrease of 34 per cent compared to \n2005. Here, I would like to stress that in terms of \nopium production, the decline is 88 per cent over a \nspan of eight years, declining from 2,560 tons to an \nestimated 292 tons. \n Myanmar regards the eradication of narcotic \ndrugs as a national priority. We have enhanced our \nenforcement capacity and have been providing \nalternative livelihoods to farmers to encourage them to \nend their dependence on opium poppy cultivation. We \nare also taking effective measures with regard to the \nemerging threat posed by methamphetamine-type \nstimulant drugs. Myanmar neither produces nor \nimports the precursor chemicals required for the \nproduction of those drugs. \n Cooperation with the United Nations is a \ncornerstone of Myanmar\u2019s foreign policy. It is in this \nspirit that we continue to cooperate with the Secretary-\nGeneral with regard to his good offices role mandated \nby the General Assembly. We have agreed to the visit \nof his Special Adviser, Under-Secretary-General \nIbrahim Gambari, who is presently in my country. We \nwill continue to work closely and cooperate actively \nwith the United Nations. \n"

        "file_text": "Each  session of the General Assembly offers us an \nopportunity to meet in order to take stock of our \nactions and define the necessary perspectives for \nbreathing new life into our Organization. In analysing \nevents throughout the world during the past year, we \nshould note that despite the efforts of the international \ncommunity the situation is far from satisfactory. \nIndeed, international peace and security are still \nseriously threatened due to persistent conflicts   in \nparticular in Africa, the Middle East and Iraq   while \nthe risks of terrorist aggression are far from being \neliminated.  \n In economic terms, the situation   \novershadowed by extreme poverty and endemic \ndiseases continues to be a source of serious concern for \nthe majority of the countries of the planet who are \nconsidered to be the poorest. Likewise, natural \ndisasters caused by climate change are a constant \nchallenge to the human conscience, to the point of \nwondering whether the international community will \nbe able to find appropriate and lasting solutions. \n The state of our world today should inspire us to \nredouble our efforts in order to give real meaning to \ninternational solidarity. It should above all incite the \ninternational community and Member States \ncollectively and individually to seek with \ndetermination ways and means not only to ensure the \nprosperity of their national populations but also to \nreduce, at least somewhat, extreme poverty in the \nworld. \n Before continuing my speech, I wish to add my \nvoice to those of previous speakers and to express my \nwarm congratulations to the President on his election \nto the presidency of the sixty-second session of the \nGeneral Assembly. He may count on the support of \nTogo in discharging his high functions throughout the \nterm, which I hope will be fruitful. I wish to once again \nexpress my congratulations to Mr. Ban Ki-moon on his \noutstanding election to the post of Secretary-General of \nour Organization. I am certain his great wealth of \ndiplomatic experience will make it possible for the \nUnited Nations to strengthen its actions in order to \nachieve a fairer and more democratic world in which \neach country will be able to exist in freedom. \n With regard to Togo, after several years of the \ndemocratization process which unfortunately has not \nbeen smooth, the country today is now moving beyond \nthe lack of understanding and intolerance among its \nsons and daughters. To consolidate our achievements \nwe have endeavoured to find appropriate solutions for \nthe concerns of the people by implementing a policy on \nnational reconstruction which will value all Togolese \nwithout exclusion. Aware that the peace and economic \ndevelopment that we want for our country cannot be \nachieved without the effective participation of the \npopulation in managing public affairs, we have spared \nno effort to involve the Togolese political class in a \nnational dialogue in order to overcome their bitterness, \nto restore confidence and to devote our energies to \nnational construction. That ambition is possible only if \nwe strive to strengthen Togolese democracy each \nday   a democracy based upon an integral multiparty \nsystem and a State based on democratic law. \n Very soon, on 14 October 2007, Togolese \ndemocracy will become consolidated with the election \nof deputies to the National Assembly, an assembly \nwithin which we dare to hope that most of the political \nforces within the country will be represented. Those \nupcoming legislative elections, whose successful \noutcomes will be possible   thanks not only to the \npolitical maturity of the Togolese people   but also to \nthe support throughout the electoral process of friendly \ncountries and international institutions; its resulting \nselection is an inevitable event and will be a decisive \nturning point in the history of Togo. \n The Togolese Government in turn will spare no \neffort, nor will it skimp on expenses, to ensure that the \nelections take place in strict transparency and the will \nof the people as expressed by the ballot box is fully \nrespected. With that goal in mind, the population will, \nfor the first time, vote with secure voter cards with \nphotographs and the whole system will be supported by \na reliable electoral roll. Our greatest hope is that those \nelections will give an opportunity to the people of Togo \nto reconcile and an opportunity for the country to \nresume its place within the family of nations. \nFor that reason, I wish to take the opportunity \nnow to repeat my Government\u2019s gratitude to the \ninternational community   in particular the Economic \nCommunity of West African States, the African Union, \nthe countries of Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific, \nthe European Union, the International Organization of \nla Francophonie, France, Germany, the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China, the United States and all the other \nStates   for the unwavering support which they \ncontinue to give to Togo throughout these crucial \ntimes.  \n Of course, we cannot forget the United Nations, \nwhich, through the United Nations Development \nProgramme (UNDP), has played an essential role since \nthe start of our democratic process, and more \nspecifically, in the preparation for these elections. \nThese elections, which are to be held on 14 October, \nare due to a great extent on the facilitator chosen \nunanimously by the political forces   I appointed \nBlaise Compaor\u00e9, President of Burkina Faso and \ncurrent Chairman of the Economic Community of West \nAfrican States (ECOWAS).  \n Establishment of the rule of law requires \ndignified and loyal conduct from its citizens based on \nthe respect of the noble ideals that underpin the \nRepublic and promote progress in society. It also \nrequires bold measures from leaders aimed at \npromoting national peace and harmony. \n In this respect and to take into account \ncommitments undertaken through the Global Political \nAgreement, our Togolese Government is determined to \nestablish in the near future the two Commissions \nprovided for under the Agreement, namely, the \nCommission to Investigate Acts of Political Violence \nCommitted in the Past and to Study Methods for \nCompensation for Victims and the Commission to \nPropose Measures to Promote Forgiveness and \nNational Reconciliation. The Constitutional Court, one \nof whose missions is to deal with electoral disputes, \nwas set up on 20 September after its reconstitution in \naccordance with the wish of the political class as \nexpressed during the national dialogue. \n These measures, together with all the other \nactions that the Government carries out every day, are \npart of our will to ban political violence and combat \nimpunity, in all sincerity, pragmatism and discernment. \n A national programme to combat impunity has \nalready been set up and the first awareness activities \nhave been carried out with success throughout the \ncountry over a period of a month and a half. This \nprogramme, which is aimed at helping to develop \nconditions conducive to the birth of a democratic spirit, \nis supported by the Office of the United Nations High \nCommissioner for Human Rights created in Togo, and \nwe are pleased to express our appreciation of its \nefficient role in strengthening governmental action. \n The problems of peace, security and the building \nof a democratic State based on the rule of law and the \nsustainable development of Togo can only be grasped \nby taking into account the economic realities of the \ncountry. Indeed, the Togolese economy has suffered a \ngreat deal from disruption of external assistance from \nits traditional partners since 1993. This absence of \nexternal assistance has certainly had a negative impact \non social programmes and development programmes \ndesigned by the Government and has seriously eroded \npublic infrastructure and has delayed measures aimed \nat good economic governance. This situation has \nslowed the efforts of the Government to improve the \nliving conditions of the Togolese, more than 60 per \ncent of whom still live below the poverty threshold. \nHow can our collective conscience remain indifferent \nin the face of such a situation? \n Giving this alarming observation, we feel that \nTogo should be able to benefit from special assistance, \nwhich would allow it to raise its economic level and to \nbolster, as a result, its young democracy. I should thus \nlike to make an urgent appeal to all of our development \npartners that they decide to support our efforts in the \nface of the major challenges before us. The assistance \nthat we are requesting and the Togolese Government\u2019s \nown efforts will allow my country to work towards the \nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals \n(MDGs).  \n The maintenance of international peace and \nsecurity remains a prerequisite for any development \nprocess. Togo thus reaffirms its devotion to the ideals \nof peace, security and stability, both within and outside \nof States. My country feels that threats to peace and \nsecurity on the African continent require that the \nUnited Nations become more involved than it has so \nfar. \n However, I am pleased to pay tribute to the role \nthat has been played and continues to be played by the \nOrganization in Africa with regard to the restoration of \npeace and security in certain countries, particularly in \nLiberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea-Bissau and the \nDemocratic Republic of the Congo. \n We also feel that Chad, Burundi and the Central \nAfrican Republic should benefit from firm actions for \npeace and security in order to put an end to acts of \nviolence and to consolidate peace, democracy and \npolitical stability in these countries.  \n As regards C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, my country is pleased \nto note that, despite the delay in the implementation of \nthe United Nations road map, the peace process has \nreached a key phase with the signing of the \nOuagadougou peace agreement on 4 March 2007, the \nlighting of the flame of peace on 30 July 2007 and the \nannouncement of the presidential election in the next \nfew months. \n As regards Sudan, Togo welcomes the adoption \non 31 July 2007 by the Security Council of resolution \n1769 (2007) on the deployment in Darfur of a hybrid \nUnited Nations-African Union peacekeeping force. We \nhope that the international community will do \neverything in its power to ensure that the necessary \nlogistical and financial means are made available for \nthis mission. \n My country also urges the other rebel factions \nthat did not participate in the Arusha discussions in \nAugust 2007 to join the negotiating process in order to \nreach a comprehensive peace agreement. \n As regards Somalia, Togo makes an appeal to the \ninternational community that it become more involved, \ntogether with the African Union, so that a \npeacekeeping force can be deployed there. \n Beyond Africa, our eyes turn constantly to Iraq \nand the Middle East, still in the grips of violence. As \nregards the Middle East, Togo supports the idea of \norganizing an international conference under the aegis \nof the Quartet in order to restart the process of direct \nand constructive negotiations. From this viewpoint, \nIsraelis and Palestinians should be encouraged to \npersevere with dialogue in order to achieve a \ncomprehensive and lasting settlement, in accordance \nwith the relevant resolutions of the United Nations.  \n However, the prerequisite for any negotiation \nbetween the two parties lies in the need to see all of the \nPalestinian elements overcome their internal \ndifferences.  \n In the area of disarmament and the control of \nweapons of mass destruction, Togo welcomes the \nbeginnings of a resolution to the North Korean nuclear \nissue with the historic agreement concluded between \nthe Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea and the \ninternational community. In the same vein, as regards \nthe question of the nuclear programme of the Islamic \nRepublic of Iran, my country calls on the interested \nparties to pursue and give priority to talks, in order to \nachieve a negotiated solution that takes into account \nthe interests of the parties involved. \n With respect to light weapons, Togo expresses the \nhope that this session of the General Assembly will \nundertake strong commitments in order to strengthen \nefforts aimed at negotiating a treaty on trade in light \nweapons similar to what was done by the Economic \nCommunity of West African States (ECOWAS).  \n With respect to terrorism, which is also an \nobstacle to sustainable development, my country \nbelieves that, following the momentum that led to the \nadoption of the global strategy to combat this scourge, \nit is essential that we make universal and improve the \ninternational legal framework to combat terrorism.  \n In this respect, the rapid conclusion of \nnegotiations relating to the draft global convention to \ncombat international terrorism would be welcome and \nwould serve the interests of all countries and all \npeoples.  \n It is disturbing to note that today\u2019s new economic \norder continues to produce a society where profit for \nprofit\u2019s sake and inequalities of all kinds reign. The \nsolidarity which we have so keenly advocated in the \nUnited Nations has yet to be realized. At the very least, \nwe can say is that this situation penalizes the \neconomies of developing countries, which, due to \nglobalization, are frequently obliged to open their \nmarkets against their own interests. \n That is why we think that development, generally \nspeaking, should take place at the global level. From \nthis viewpoint, all countries should honour their \ncommitments related to the establishment of a global \npartnership aimed at promoting equitable and \nsustainable development for all.  \n Thus, Togo appeals once again to the \ninternational community, in particular to the developed \ncountries, that they increase their development \nassistance and promote international trade and direct \nforeign investment, particularly towards poor \ncountries. It is also essential to focus seriously on the \nurgent question of debt and to resume the Doha \nnegotiations so that trade liberalization will promote \nthe development of all nations, particularly the poorest \namong them. \n In this respect, we commend the commitments \nundertaken at the Group of Eight Summit, held in June \n2007 in Germany, to support the facilitation of \neconomic growth and investment, including \nmicrofinance; to support the establishment or \nstrengthening of development institutions in the private \nsector and structural reform which will improve the \neconomic environment; and to support efforts in the \nareas of health, in particular the prevention and \ntreatment of HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis. \n The high-level debates which the General \nAssembly held on 24 September once more illustrated \nthe fact that one of the major challenges that the \ninternational community must immediately tackle \nremains climate change, which is the source of \nnumerous natural disasters. \n Togo, which, like many other countries on the \ncontinent, has just experienced serious and deadly \nfloods, firmly believes that it is urgent that concrete \nactions be undertaken to begin a determined and \nconcerted struggle against environmental degradation. \nIt seems to us that the survival of planet Earth is at \nstake. \n The irreplaceable and unparalleled role of the \nUnited Nations in international relations should \nencourage us to reform this institution in the light of \npresent reality. However, we should not lose sight of \nthe fact that the reform of the Organization should \nreflect the principles of the sovereign equality of States \nand equitable geographical distribution and should help \nto strengthen cooperation on an equal footing among \nStates. It should also be based on the principle of broad \ninternational consensus, particularly when it involves \nissues involving the responsibility of all of the \nOrganization\u2019s constituent parts. \n That is why Security Council reform must \nguarantee that all regions of the world be represented \nwithin that organ and enable developing countries, \nwhich play an important role in accomplishing the \ntasks of the Organization, to make their contribution, \nno matter how modest, to promoting peace worldwide. \n We hope that the present session of the General \nAssembly will bring hope to the international \ncommunity, and particularly to the African peoples, \nwho are waiting to see improvement in their living \nconditions and lives through decisive and tangible \nactions. \n In order to attain the objectives that we have set \nfor ourselves, in particular during the Millennium \nSummit, it is essential that we honour all of our \ncommitments within their time frames and that we \nassume additional commitments in order to bring about \na world free of fear, hunger, extreme poverty and \ndisease   a world where we will be able to live in \nsecurity. \n Togo, in its determination to construct a State \nbased on the rule of law and to improve the living \nconditions of its population, will spare no effort in \ncarrying out its obligations. It hopes it can count on the \nassistance of the international community in order to \ndo this. \n"

        "file_text": "The Sierra Leone  delegation would like to join others in congratulating \nyou, Mr. President, on your election to preside over the \nwork of the General Assembly at this session. We also \ntake this opportunity to commend your predecessor for \nher contribution to the work of the Assembly, in \nparticular for her initiatives in the ongoing process of \nthe United Nations reform. \nAllow me to convey to you, the \nSecretary-General and this Assembly greetings from \nthe newly elected President of Sierra Leone, His \nExcellency Ernest Bai Koroma, who took the oath of \noffice just two weeks ago. President Koroma was not \nable to come to this debate because of time constraints. \n Sierra Leone would like to reaffirm its \ncommitment to the United Nations as the only \ninternational body that has the capacity to combat the \nmultifarious problems of the world. The salvation of \nthe world from conflict, natural disasters, diseases, \nhunger, poverty, oppression, abuse and violation of \nrights and the menace of climate change, and the \nachievement of our development goals will remain \ndistant dreams without multilateral action. The stronger \nour United Nations, the greater our chances to realize \nthe objectives for which we set it up. That is why \nSierra Leone will never relent in its support for the \nreform process of the United Nations to enable it to \nrespond appropriately to its numerous, diverse and \never-increasing challenges. \n The reform exercise has scored some major \nsuccesses, but the most critical and contentious reform   \nthat of the Security Council   remains elusive. As \nlong as the status quo is maintained, Africa will remain \ndisadvantaged, as the only continent without a voice of \npermanent representation on the Council. We therefore \nurge a speedy consideration of the expansion of, and \nequitable representation on, the Council, to make it \nmore representative, democratic and accountable and \ntherefore more effective. \n A new dawn has broken in the political landscape \nof Sierra Leone. Once again, Sierra Leone has \ndemonstrated exemplary performance in the area of the \nconsolidation of democracy and governance. We would \nlike to acknowledge with humility the messages of \ncommendation we received from various parts of the \nworld for the conduct of the recent parliamentary and \npresidential elections. As one influential Western \nmedia organization put it, Sierra Leone is a pearl in the \npolitical crown of African politics. \n My delegation welcomes the statement issued by \nthe members of the Security Council in which they \ncongratulated the people and institutions of Sierra \nLeone, in particular the National Electoral Commission \nand the Sierra Leone Police, on their conduct in the \nelection period and the commitment they demonstrated \nto the democratic process. President Koroma has asked \nme to convey, on behalf of all Sierra Leoneans, sincere \nthanks to members of the international community for \ntheir invaluable contribution to the electoral process. \nWe are grateful in particular for the logistical support \nthat the various institutions concerned with the election \nreceived to enable them to perform their respective \nfunctions. As the new President said after taking the \noath of office, the people of Sierra Leone must \ncongratulate themselves for their historic resolve to \nensure the victory of democracy and the free exercise \nof the will of the people. \n No one can deny that, after a brutal civil war, \nSierra Leone has enjoyed five years of relative peace. \nHowever, peace is not an event. It transcends the \nsigning of ceasefire and peace agreements. It also \ntranscends the successful disarmament and \ndemobilization of ex-combatants, and the official \ndeclaration of the end of armed conflict.  \n Peace is a process, a process that must be \nconsolidated, maintained and sustained. Indeed, that is \nwhy the United Nations was established after two \nworld wars: to promote social progress and better \nstandards of life for the peoples of the world and to \nunite our strength in order to maintain international \npeace and security. The establishment of the new \nPeacebuilding Commission to facilitate post-conflict \nrecovery is consistent with the objectives of the \nOrganization. It adds to the true meaning and scope of \nthe concept of peace.  \n The Sierra Leone Government considers the \nrecent elections as part of the peace process. The \npeople have once again exercised their constitutional \nright to choose the men and women they would like to \nserve the nation. Now we must not forget that the \npeople also have a right to economic and social \ndevelopment. The right to vote is inextricably linked to \nthe rights to food, clean and portable water, basic \nsocial services and, of course, development. All the \npraise, all the commendation that Sierra Leoneans have \nreceived in connection with the exercise of their \npolitical right, the right to vote, will be meaningless \nunless we create and intensify our collective efforts to \nensure that they see and enjoy the dividends of that \nprocess.  \n Periodic elections are important, but they are not \na panacea for all needs. Now that the elections are \nover, the Government is determined to meet the \nchallenge of translating the exercise of a political right \ninto the realization of the economic and social rights of \nall Sierra Leoneans. There is indeed a change of \nGovernment, but that change needs urgent and \nsubstantial support to produce its desired dividends for \nthe citizens. Accordingly, I would like to solicit the \nsupport of the United Nations, the entire international \ncommunity and our bilateral partners to help us to \ndeliver on the expectations linked to that change. \n Sierra Leone will continue to have high \nexpectations for the United Nations, including its \nPeacebuilding Commission and Peacebuilding Fund. \nSierra Leone was selected as one of the first two \ncountries on the Commission\u2019s agenda, and thus \nbecame eligible for funding, which has already had a \npositive impact on our ability to consolidate the peace. \nWe thank the Commission and the Fund for that timely \nconsideration. We note with appreciation, for instance, \nthe timely support that the Sierra Leone Police \nreceived from the Peacebuilding Fund to enhance their \ncapacity to manage public order during the recent \nelections. \n The four priority areas that have been identified \nby the Government in consultation with the \nCommission, the United Nations system in Sierra \nLeone and other stakeholders, including civil society, \nare still valid. They are all equally important. However, \nin view of the inherent urgency and the critical nature \nof the youth problem, the Government will make sure, \nas far as possible, that youth employment and \nempowerment continue to be accorded first priority. \n We hope that the details of the integrated \npeacebuilding strategy or framework for cooperation \nwith Sierra Leone will soon be finalized. While \nrecognizing the importance of partnership and \naccountability, we strongly believe that national \nownership must be the core principle of the framework. \n While Sierra Leoneans are being showered with \ncommendations for the outcome of the elections, and \ndeservedly so, and while the nation is today being held \nin high esteem in the area of political and \nconstitutional order, we must not forget that the \ncountry still finds itself in the unenviable position of \nbeing ranked one of the least developed countries in \nthe United Nations Development Programme\u2019s human \ndevelopment index. Unfortunately for Sierra Leone and \nthe rest of the developing world, the prospects for \nachieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) \nby the year 2015 remain cloudy and distant. My \ndelegation shares the view that practical steps must be \ntaken as a matter of urgency to accelerate the process \nof meeting the goals. We therefore welcome the recent \nlaunching of the MDG Africa Steering Group, chaired \nby Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, to mobilize the \nheads of the United Nations system and major \nmultilateral and intergovernmental organizations in \nsupport of African States in their effort to meet the \nMDGs.  \n In principle, we support all initiatives that could \nat least get Africa on track. Those include Prime \nMinister Gordon Brown\u2019s MDG call to action of last \nJuly, and the declaration signed by a number of Heads \nof State and Government and private-sector leaders. \nWe, for our part, acknowledge our responsibility to \nmeet the Goals. However, we strongly believe that the \ndeveloped countries should fulfil their commitments as \npartners in an interdependent world, with special \nsupport preference for countries emerging from \nconflict, in order to accelerate their progress towards \nmeeting the goals. \n Sierra Leone will continue to foster and maintain \nfriendly relations with all Members States of the \nUnited Nations, in particular those in our immediate \nneighbourhood, members of the Mano River Union and \nthe Economic Community of West African States \n(ECOWAS). That is why, less than a week after \nassuming office, President Koroma paid a visit to the \ntwo other founding members of the Mano River Union, \nLiberia and Guinea, and to Burkina Faso, the current \nChair of ECOWAS. \n For far too long, the situation in some of our \ncountries has been a threat to regional and international \npeace and security. Sierra Leone would like to assure \nthis Assembly that it stands ready to reverse that trend \nin the subregion of West Africa, to help reduce tension, \nprevent armed conflict and strengthen institutions and \nmachinery that have been created primarily to promote \nthe economic and social well-being of people. \n We will continue to work assiduously with the \nUnited Nations, the African Union, ECOWAS, the \nEuropean Union and individual sovereign States to \npursue the goals of peace and security enshrined in the \nCharter of the United Nations, for Africa and the rest \nof the world. \n"

        "file_text": "Allow me to congratulate \nyou, Mr. President on your election as President of \nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-second session. I wish \nyou every success. I would also like to offer my \ngratitude to your predecessor, Sheikha Haya Al-Khalifa \nfor the outstanding job she has performed as the first \nArab woman to ever preside over this austere body. \nFinally, I would like to thank His Excellency \nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon for all his efforts on \nbehalf of world peace and security. \n A year ago, I spoke from this podium about \nIsrael\u2019s brutalities against my country and its atrocious \n33-day war. I had hoped then that those tragic events \nthat we had bitterly lived and suffered through in \nLebanon would pave the way for activating the Middle \nEast process based on the Arab Peace Initiative that \nwas endorsed at the Beirut Arab Summit in 2002. \n Regrettably, nothing thrives in our region more \nthan violence and grudges, and nothing deafens more \nthan the sound of war, while all calls to stimulate the \npeace process find no response. It is against that \ngloomy background and with a mix of anticipation and \nreservation that we await the results of the Middle East \npeace conference that is to be held in the near future. \nIn that respect, I would like to reaffirm certain realities \nthat cannot be ignored in any settlement, because I \nbelieve that unless we learn from our past mistakes, we \nwill not be able to take full advantage of present \nopportunities. \n First, for any settlement to the Middle East crisis \nto succeed, it must be lasting, just and global. \nSecondly, a viable solution must call for the \nimplementation of all United Nations resolutions that \npertain to the withdrawal of Israel from all occupied \nArab territories. Thirdly, paramount to all Arab rights \nis the right of return of the Palestinian refugees in \naccordance with resolution 194 (III) and the rejection \nof all calls for their resettlement in their temporary host \ncountries. \n The resettlement of the Palestinians is contrary to \nthe expressed will of world legitimacy as embodied in \nthe General Assembly. Moreover, and more specifically \nin Lebanon, it would dangerously alter the delicate \nbalance of Lebanon\u2019s existence as a nation based on \ndiversity and the coexistence of a large number of its \nsects, which have lived side by side in harmony and \nenjoyed mutual respect. \nIn this regard, Lebanon fully rejects efforts to \nempty the Beirut Arab Peace Initiative of 2002 of its \ncontents, namely by excluding the right of return for \nPalestinians. The Initiative, we believe, contains a \nrealistic and global solution to the Middle East \nconflict, and its implementation could bring about \nstability and security for all parties. \n A year ago, the Security Council adopted resolution \n1701 (2006), which put an end to Israel\u2019s aggression \nagainst Lebanon. We were quick to abide by that \nresolution. Our armed forces have closely cooperated \nwith the units of the United Nations Interim Force in \nLebanon, as stipulated in their mission statements and as \nrecounted in the reports of the Secretary-General on the \nimplementation of resolution 1701 (2006). \n Today, as I stand here again to reiterate \nLebanon\u2019s commitment to implementing that \nresolution, I wonder why we are still in the phase of \nthe cessation of hostilities and have not yet moved into \nthe ceasefire phase, as called for in the resolution. That \nmatter remains suspect to many Lebanese, especially \nsince Israel continues, up to this very moment, to \nviolate our land, sea and skies. So far, there have been \nover 500 breaches since the adoption of the resolution. \nI call upon the world community to remain vigilant \nregarding any malicious intentions harboured by Israel \nagainst Lebanon, as that could lead to another \nconflagration in the region. \n Despite the fact that the Lebanese recall with \npain, agony and distress last year\u2019s destructive and \nhostile war against their country, they are proud of \ntheir national resistance and their army, who were able \nto jointly claim a historic victory over one of the \nworld\u2019s strongest military arsenals, which had violated \nall international and ethical norms and wanted to \nterminate Lebanon\u2019s role as a nation characterized by \ncoexistence among all its religious sects. \n With regard to securing the full implementation \nof resolution 1701 (2006), we in Lebanon believe that \nthat will only happen when our nation regains its \noccupied Sheba\u2019a farms, the Kfar Shouba Hills and \nsome northern parts of the village of Ghajar; when we \nsecure the release of Lebanese prisoners held in Israeli \njails; when Lebanon\u2019s legitimate rights to its water \nresources are restored; and when Lebanon is given \nmaps of the landmines and the sites of cluster bombs. \n In this regard, we welcome efforts made by the \nUnited Nations in terms of studying documents and \nmaps related to the Sheba\u2019a farms, and we express our \nrelief over the progress made so far in verifying their \nLebanese identity. We look forward to practical \nmeasures that would end Israeli occupation and hand \nover those territories and water rights to Lebanon. \n The United Nations has always shown Lebanon \nspecial concern, and such concern is clearly manifested \nin all United Nations resolutions on Lebanon. The \nLebanese, who reiterate their commitment to the \nimplementation of those resolutions, wish to see those \nresolutions implemented in a fair manner and on a real \nand constant basis. As you know by now, the Special \nTribunal for Lebanon, which was established to try the \nassassins of former Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri, had \nbeen a controversial issue with regard to the \ncircumstances of its establishment. We referred to that \nin detail in our letters to the Secretary-General and \nasked that copies be handed over to all Security \nCouncil Member States and other copies be kept as \nreference documents at the United Nations. \n We did this in the belief that international justice \nshould be reinforced. Since the very first moment of \nthe heinous crime of the assassination of former Prime \nMinister Hariri, we have attempted to seek the whole \ntruth, and I was probably the first to ask the then \nSecretary-General, Kofi Annan, to set up an impartial \ninternational investigation commission. \n I believe the best way now to enable all to \novercome the controversy caused by the international \ntribunal would be to hold an impartial, transparent and \njust hearing that seeks to determine the whole truth. \nOnly then would the Lebanese be assured that the \ntribunal is just. \n Lebanon is about to hold democratic presidential \nelections in which the Lebanese will make their choice \nin a free and responsible manner. Unfortunately, there \nhave been attempts by international parties to intervene \nin Lebanon\u2019s domestic affairs in a way that contradicts \ninternational norms. Such interference could instigate \nhatred and increase tensions on the Lebanese scene, \nwhich might have negative repercussions not only on \nupcoming presidential elections but also on the safety \nof the Lebanese. \n Lebanon welcomes all foreign assistance and \npays tribute to those countries that have stood by it in \nthe wake of last July\u2019s destructive Israeli war. Lebanon \nhopes, however, that any foreign assistance to Lebanon \nis made to all the Lebanese people, without any \ndiscrimination, in order to stop possible divisions \namong them. Foreign aid to Lebanon should be made \nas a gesture of support to the restoration of Lebanon\u2019s \nsovereignty and the unity of the Lebanese people. \n That is why we urge the international community, \nthrough its commitment to the Charter of the United \nNations, to stop foreign intervention in the domestic \naffairs of Member States. Consecutive events in \nLebanon have shown that the Lebanese are capable of \nmaking their own decisions and their own choices and \ncan live side by side and interact peacefully within \ninstitutional framework established by their civic \nbodies and protected by their security institutions, \nnamely their national army. \n Since we are referring to the national army, we \nshould highlight the heroic confrontations of the army \nwith an extremely dangerous terrorist organization in \nthe past three months, an organization equipped with \nupdated weapons and believing in destructive \nobjectives that targeted Lebanon and many other States \nin the region. The costly price paid by our national \narmy in terms of human losses and injuries aimed at \nreinstating Lebanon\u2019s national goals of confronting and \nfighting terrorism. Lebanon has and will always be a \nnation that supports peace and justice and promotes \ndemocratic values. However, to enable Lebanon to \nconfront and curb terrorism, real assistance should be \ngiven to its national army in order to accomplish its \nnational and security goals. \n In a world that witnesses the daily bloodshed \nknown as \u201cthe conflict of civilizations\u201d, and in a world \nthat is sharply and deeply divided between East and \nWest, I find myself addressing the international \ncommunity as a man of experience. From here, I urge \nthe world community not to allow Lebanon to fall, \nbecause the falling apart of Lebanon would mean a \ncollapse of moderation and a victory for those who \nfavour the use of force. Lebanon remains a unique \nmessage to the world, a country where religions and \ncultures interact peacefully, so that we can live \ntogether, as noted by His Holiness the late Pope John \nPaul II. \n As a citizen of Lebanon, a small country that has \nsurvived against all odds, I urge you not to retreat in \nthe face of adversity and to support what is right and \njust. A last glimpse of a burning Middle East, where \nthe flames devour the meek and the mighty, should \nallow you to reflect upon the choices ahead, lest it \nbecome too late. \n"

        "file_text": "At the outset, let me join others in congratulating Mr. \nSrgjan Kerim on his election to the presidency of the \nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-second session. I assure \nhim that the delegation of Kyrgyzstan stands ready to \ncooperate with him. On behalf of my delegation I wish \nhim every success in fulfilling his responsibilities. \n I wish to pay tribute to Her Excellency Sheikha \nHaya Rashed Al-Khalifa for her outstanding \nstewardship during the previous session of the General \nAssembly. \n I would also like to take this opportunity to \ncongratulate the Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr. \nBan Ki-moon, on his election to his high and \nresponsible post and to wish him every success in his \nimportant work. I am confident that his vast experience \nand diplomatic skill will enable him to achieve all the \ngoals of the United Nations. \n It would no doubt be difficult to come to a \ncommon agreement about the date on which the new \nmillennium began   whether it started with the \ntragedy of 2001 or harks back to 1991, when the \nstructure of the world order changed. I believe that the \nproponents of either theory would agree that a new \nperiod has emerged: a time when the interdependence \nof States has become a vivid reality leading to greater \nvulnerability. Problems have become global, whereas \nglobalization has become localized. \n In the face of all these dilemmas, the United \nNations unswervingly maintains its status as an \norganization whose core value is to promote the moral \nprinciples of solidarity. The formation of a global civil \nsociety and the recognition of universally accepted \nrights and freedoms under the auspices of the United \nNations play a significant role in furthering the process \nof consolidation. \n This clearly shows that society is capable of \nrefraining from war and solving its problems by using \nits peacekeeping potential. Thoughtfully building the \nfuture is not possible without reviewing and continuing \nstrategic planning of socio-economic development. \nFifteen years ago, one of the most noteworthy of \nUnited Nations conferences took place at Rio de \nJaneiro. There, the concept of sustainable development \nwas defined as a new tenet for humankind. The main \npurpose was to create a new mechanism enabling us to \nresolve existing social tensions and to prevent future \nones through cooperation among States and the \nformation of a global civil society. \n The relationship between the State and the \nsociety develops differently in each country. The \nKyrgyz Republic has come a long way in affirming \ndemocratic values, conducting constitutional reform \nand fiscal decentralization. All this has been reflected \nin the national development strategy approved by the \nPresident of the Kyrgyz Republic, Mr. Kurmanbek \nBakiev. The aim of that document is to achieve \nsustainable development by 2010; it is based on the \nprinciples of self-fulfilment and human security, which \nare the basic source of positive change in the sphere of \nhuman development. \n At the same time, we are well aware that long-\nterm sustainable development depends on the stability \nof human relationships based on an understanding of \nhow to use existing resources for social and economic \ndevelopment today and of what we must leave for \nfuture generations. \n Seven years ago, the General Assembly adopted \nthe Millennium Development Goals, thereby defining \nour objectives for the future and the conditions needed \nto achieve them. Attainment of the eight Goals and \ntackling of the 15 challenges will serve as a basis both \nfor our global initiative and for realizing the potential \nof regional development. \n Nevertheless, level of development varies from \nregion to region. This is particularly relevant for \nmountainous regions, which require a different strategy \nfor sustainable development which takes into account \neach area\u2019s specific potential in natural resources. In \naddition to defining the ecological parameters, it is \nnecessary to define the economic and geographic \npeculiarities of mountainous regions that call for a \nspecial system of management which would give \npriority to local self-governance. Despite their \nsignificant resource potential, mountainous territories \nneed to address as a priority problems related to living \nstandards and quality of life. In that regard, the Kyrgyz \nRepublic believes that a second Global Mountain \nSummit should be convened, at which we could \nformulate a definitive sustainable policy for \nmountainous regions, along with relevant norms of \ninternational law. \n Even what is seemingly the most insignificant \nsocial inequality can destroy the social integrity of \nhumankind. Similarly, equal protection of rights and \nfreedoms and the adoption of universal values of \nrespect for human life enable us to fulfil the principles \nof the Seville Statement Violence, which defines war as \na product of human culture. \n The primary source of conflict is, in fact, lack of \nsocial responsibility. The development strategy of \nevery single country should establish social \nresponsibility as a basic characteristic for elaborating \napproaches to regional and global coordination, thus \nimproving the environment and reducing energy \nshortages. Regional parameters of responsibility will \nthen create a new type of society, which will be no \nlonger a society at risk, but rather a society of security. \n I have no doubt that all of today\u2019s participants, as \nwell as all countries that accepted the MDGs as a basis \nfor their national development, are striving to establish \nsocial peace and social equality, but the establishment \nof a socially-oriented world order requires the \nstrengthening of mechanisms to promote the adoption \nof decisions at the highest level. It is necessary that \nsuch mechanisms include both the monitoring of joint \nefforts and parameters of progress achieved in the \nframework of the most effective implementation of the \nMDGs. The initiative of the Kyrgyz President to \nproclaim 20 February a world day of social justice \nwould serve as such a mechanism. We kindly request \nthe General Assembly to consider adopting a resolution \nto that effect at the current session. \n The establishment of social justice has been a \ndream of humankind for many millennia. There was a \ntime when some were burned at the stake for \nentertaining such dreams or attempting to establish a \ncommunity of social justice. At one time, dictatorship \nand authoritarianism prospered under the pretext of a \ncall to social justice. That happened because of a \ndisparity between the proclaimed elevated goals and \nthe means of their achievement. \n In the third millennium, the world\u2019s nations have \ndefined development goals in the framework of a \nunited society. The means to achieve those goals must \ncorrespond to a high level of civic awareness of the \npotential of peacekeeping. We already have the \ngrounds for a constructive dialogue defining the \ndynamics of peacekeeping for humankind\u2019s \ndevelopment. The United Nations has been a \nfoundation of such dialogue for several decades. \n Allow me from this rostrum to confirm the \nadherence of the Kyrgyz Republic to the goals and \npurposes of the United Nations to maintain peace, \nsecurity and a prosperous life for all the nations of the \nEarth. \n"

        "file_text": "As we meet for the \nsixty-second session of the General Assembly, we look \nagain to the United Nations as the global forum to \naddress the challenges which affect us all. \n Climate change is serious and urgent, as many \nhave said in this Hall. We welcome that it has been the \ntheme of our general debate this year. The science is \nclear. Climate change is real and will impact on all \nparts of the world. To meet the global challenge of \nclimate change, there must be widespread and effective \ninternational action. It will be important to get all \neconomies onto low carbon pathways over time. \nMarket mechanisms will have a significant role to play. \nIndividual countries will face different challenges. \nDifferent national circumstances must be taken into \naccount. \n The United Nations climate change conference in \nBali in December will be a fresh opportunity to \nre-energize our efforts in addressing climate change. \nNew Zealand wants to see a Bali road map emerge in \nDecember to set us on the course for an effective future \nresponse. New Zealand welcomes the momentum that \nis being generated by other high-level meetings in the \nlead-up to Bali, including the recent Asia-Pacific \nEconomic Cooperation Leaders\u2019 Declaration. \n Last week\u2019s high-level event deserves special \nmention. We congratulate the Secretary-General for his \nefforts in cultivating the political goodwill that will be \nvital if we are to reach agreement in Bali.  \n Taking action as an international community also \nmeans taking action domestically. In recent weeks, \nNew Zealand has announced a number of domestic \nmeasures to address climate change. An emissions \ntrading scheme will be established from 1 January \n2008 and will form the cornerstone of our efforts to \nreduce greenhouse gas emissions. It will, over time, \ncover all sectors and all gases. \n We have also identified a number of longer-term \ndomestic goals, which will move New Zealand down \nthe path to carbon neutrality. They will provide \nbenefits, including healthier homes, cleaner air and \nimproved public transport. While climate change is \ncertainly a challenge for us all, it is also an opportunity \nto move towards a more sustainable world. \n With regard to the Millennium Development \nGoals, we recognize that having passed the halfway \npoint to 2015, the international community needs to \nstep up its efforts to achieve them. At the same time, \nthere is scope for the United Nations development \nsystem to be strengthened. We welcome the newly \nestablished initiatives in the Economic and Social \nCouncil   the Annual Ministerial Review and the \nDevelopment Cooperation Forum   as practical ways \nto share information about what is working and where \nwe can improve our efforts at country level. \n New Zealand is also committed to improving \nsystem-wide coherence at the United Nations in the \nfields of development, humanitarian issues and the \nenvironment. We attach particular importance to \nworking for a strengthened, coherent, gender \narchitecture and towards effective gender \nmainstreaming across all United Nations entities. \n New Zealand welcomes the completion of the \nUnited Nations Pacific-based development agencies\u2019 \nstrategic framework for the Pacific. We are keen to \nwork closely with United Nations agencies in the \nPacific to achieve positive outcomes for our partners in \nthe areas of human rights, sexual and reproductive \nheath, HIV/AIDS, child immunization and women\u2019s \nleadership. \n A strong, prosperous and stable Pacific is a key \nforeign policy priority for New Zealand. We place a \nhigh priority on fostering solidarity and cooperation in \nthe Pacific to tackle the challenges the region faces in \ndemocracy, security and economic development. \nAround half of New Zealand\u2019s development assistance \ngoes towards the Pacific.  \n New Zealand provides assistance in the region in \nTimor-Leste, the Solomon Islands, Tonga and \nBougainville in Papua New Guinea, with each situation \ncalling for a different response. \n The Timorese people, their leaders and the \ninternational community have all made a huge effort \nover the past year to return Timor-Leste to a more \nsecure and stable path. New Zealand has participated in \nthose efforts through our contributions to the \nInternational Security Forces and to the United Nations \nIntegrated Mission in Timor-Leste (UNMIT). Timor-\nLeste will require a sustained commitment from \nUNMIT.  \n The situation in Fiji continues to be of concern to \nNew Zealand. As a neighbour of Fiji with a long-\nstanding and very close relationship, New Zealand \nworked hard to avert last December\u2019s coup, including \nby convening a meeting to mediate between the then \nPrime Minister and the military commander. We very \nmuch regret that this failed to dissuade the coup \nmakers from their illegal and unconstitutional path. \n New Zealand strongly and actively supports the \nsteps that have been taken by the Pacific Islands Forum \nto encourage an early return to constitutional \ngovernment in Fiji. We would welcome a firm \ncommitment from the interim administration to work \ntowards elections within the timeframe endorsed by the \nForum. Given that commitment, New Zealand would \nbegin to restore a more normal bilateral relationship \nthrough which we could cooperate in addressing Fiji\u2019s \nundoubtedly complex problems. \n I also want to take this opportunity to address one \nissue in particular raised in the Solomon Islands \nstatement on Monday (see ). It was \nsuggested, inter alia, that the presence of the Regional \nAssistance Mission to the Solomon Islands (RAMSI), \nwas an \u201coccupation\u201d, and that RAMSI\u2019s operation \ntransgressed Article 52 of the United Nations Charter. \nNew Zealand has always been committed to upholding \nthe purposes and principles of the Charter in every \nrespect. In our view, RAMSI is entirely consistent with \nthose purposes and principles. It is a specific example \nof Chapter VIII of the Charter in operation. To suggest \nit is contrary to the Charter is in our view wrong. \nRAMSI was established in response to a formal request \nfrom the Solomon Islands. Its presence in the Solomon \nIslands is sanctioned by treaty and by the domestic law \nof the Solomon Islands. That was recently reaffirmed \nby the Solomon Islands Parliament. Moreover, RAMSI \nstems from the endorsement by Pacific Islands Forum \nForeign Ministers of a programme of action under the \nForum Leaders\u2019 Biketawa Declaration. That provides a \nframework for regional responses in times of crisis or \nwhen members request assistance   exactly the \nsituation in this case. \n Amid all these challenges, I would like to report \non activity being undertaken by Tokelau, the tiny \nterritory 500 kilometres north of Samoa that New \nZealand administers. The people of Tokelau, all 1,500 \nof them on three atolls, have decided that they wish to \nundertake an act of self-determination to decide \nwhether they wish to change their present status. A \nvote in February 2006 narrowly missed the threshold \nset by Tokelau for a change of status. They will again \nvote on that issue from 20 to 24 October. \n As members of the Special Committee on \nDecolonization know, New Zealand supports Tokelau\u2019s \nright to choose, but has stood back from any wish to \ndetermine the direction of any change. That decision is \nentirely for the people of Tokelau. New Zealand will \nsupport their decision. \n Advancement of the rule of law at the national \nand international levels is essential for the realization \nof sustained economic growth, development and \nhuman rights. New Zealand encourages members to \nprovide their full support to the International Criminal \nCourt (ICC) by acceding to the Rome Statute of the \nICC. We also call on all United Nations Member \nStates, especially State parties to the Rome Stature, to \nfully cooperate with the Court in carrying out its \ncurrent work. Universality and full support are crucial \nif we are to end the impunity of the perpetrators of the \nmost serious crimes of international concern, such as \nthose carried out in Darfur, where International \nCriminal Court arrest warrants are outstanding. \n Efforts to protect and maintain the international \nrule of law can only be effective when built on a \nfoundation of international peace and security. \n Interfaith and intercultural dialogue can help to \ncounter religious extremism by encouraging \nunderstanding and respect among different faith \ncommunities and cultures. \n In May, New Zealand hosted two significant \ngatherings aimed at advancing global response to \ninterfaith and intercultural issues in a practical way. We \nregard the United Nations\u2019 Alliance of Civilizations as \nthe key multilateral process among the growing \nnumber of international and regional initiatives in this \narea. \n With respect to nuclear proliferation, New \nZealand welcomes the strong signals that have been \nsent to North Korea and Iran by the Security Council. \n On a different topic, New Zealand is convinced \nthat the humanitarian harm posed by cluster munitions \nmust be addressed urgently. We believe that negotiation \nof a treaty to deal with the problems caused by cluster \nmines is well overdue. We will host a meeting on this \ninitiative in February of next year. \n We are pleased, too, to promote a new initiative \nat the General Assembly this year calling for action to \nlower the operational status of nuclear weapons. \nMaintaining nuclear weapons at a high level of \nreadiness increases the likelihood of these weapons \nbeing used, with catastrophic consequences. \n The humanitarian disaster and conflict in Darfur \nthreaten security in the entire East African region. New \nZealand applauds the efforts by Members to establish \nthe new African Union-United Nations Hybrid \nOperation in Darfur. \n New Zealand is deeply concerned at the current \npolitical, economic and humanitarian situation in \nZimbabwe. We welcome the efforts being made to find \nacceptable solutions to the problems Zimbabwe faces. \nWe sincerely hope that these efforts continue and that \nsolutions can be found that will benefit all \nZimbabweans and will enable free and fair elections to \nbe held. \n New Zealand remains profoundly concerned at \nthe situation in Myanmar. Protestors have been killed, \nshot at, beaten and arrested. This violent treatment is \nreprehensible. Engaging in peaceful protests is a \nfundamental human right. New Zealand, therefore, \njoins others in calling for the immediate release of \nthose detained in recent weeks, along with the many \npolitical prisoners, including Aung San Suu Kyi, who \nhave been held without trial for much longer periods. \n The Myanmar regime should be held responsible \nfor the personal safety and treatment of all the people it \nhas detained. We call on the authorities there to stop \nthe violence and to encourage a process of genuine \ndialogue with pro-democracy leaders and ethnic \nminorities. \n New Zealand fully supports United Nations \nefforts to resolve the immediate and longer term \nsituation in Myanmar. We welcomed the visit to \nMyanmar of Special Envoy Ibrahim Gambari. We fully \nsupport continued discussion of the situation of \nMyanmar in the Security Council with a view to \nconsidering what further steps might be taken by the \ninternational community. \n Turning now to human rights, New Zealand will \nstand for election to the Human Rights Council for \n2009 to 2012. We want to do our part to help this \nfledging United Nations organization achieve its full \npotential as the pre-eminent global human rights body. \n A human rights issue of particular importance to \nNew Zealand is the death penalty. Adoption of a \nresolution on a global moratorium on this inhumane \nform of punishment would represent a historic step \ntowards global efforts to abolish the death penalty. \n In closing, New Zealand has been a committed \nand active participant in the United Nations since its \nformation. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has called \non Member States to deliver to the best of our abilities \nat the United Nations, recognizing the need for faster, \nmore effective action, as well as for a more results-\ndriven Organization that strives to have the highest \nstandards of transparency and professional ethics. New \nZealand whole-heartedly agrees.  \n We look forward to working closely with the \nSecretary-General, with you, Mr. President and with \nother Member States in all of our efforts to build a \nstronger United Nations for a better world. \n"

        "file_text": "Six  years ago, in September 2001, we, the representatives \nof the international community, stood united and in \nsolidarity in the face of international terrorism. In all \nour languages, faiths and cultures, we expressed our \ncondemnation of any terrorist act that targets innocent \ncivilians. We denounced and deplored such acts, then \nresolved to work seriously to combat this grave and \nalarming phenomenon. We agreed to work earnestly, \nnot only to deal with terrorism from a security \nperspective, but also to achieve long-awaited \nbreakthroughs in the old crises and conflicts, which \nbecause of their complexity and longevity have \noverwhelmed the desperate and the hopeless in our \nparticular region. Those conflicts fuel people\u2019s sense of \ninjustice and despair and push them into the ranks of \nthose who espouse dark extremist ideas that consider \nviolence as the only means of operation and even \nsometimes as an end in itself. \n We were all prepared for action. There was a \nwidespread belief in the Middle East region that major \nbreakthroughs were imminent, that the successful \ncontainment and eradication of international terrorism \nwould take place not only through security operations \nbut also through concurrent actions of equal \nimportance aimed at draining its intellectual resources \nand freezing its human and financial assets. \n However, we seem to have gone astray during \nthose six years. Our objectives were fragmented, and \nour energies were scattered. We failed as an \ninternational community to maintain the huge \nmomentum generated in this very Hall in September \n2001, that momentum which found expression in our \nresolve to work together to defuse tensions in our \nregion as a step towards the settlement of its chronic \npolitical conflicts. \n Regrettably, narrow-minded, domestic political \nagendas have been imposed by some, and unwise \nobjectives have replaced the lofty ones that we had \nplanned to achieve. Instead of focusing on the \neradication of the hotbeds of international terrorism   \nhotbeds which were not numerous six years ago   we \nlost sight of our main goal and vision. The eradication \nof international terrorism was no longer the goal but \ninstead became a loose phrase. There was oppression, \ntorture and humiliation, and, on the other side, more \nviolence, resistance and atrocities. \n This came as no surprise to us, since the objective \nwas regrettably lost. We all stood stunned and \nflabbergasted before the events that were unfolding in \nthis region and the world. How could we have been \ndiverted from our goal? How could it be that our world \nwas dragged down almost to the level of a clash \nbetween civilizations, cultures and religions? Why are \nsome attempting to thrust the holy religion of Islam \ninto the labyrinth of a limitless clash with the West, a \nclash that serves no one\u2019s interests? To the contrary, it \ncauses everyone grievous harm. Here comes the \nquestion: what can we, the national people of the \nworld, do to get back on course? \n In all honesty, I must tell you that this last \nquestion is our main concern in the Middle East. \nDespite the importance of the other questions, and even \nthough we are fully aware of the answers thereto, we \nprefer to leave aside these questions and to let the \nhistorians and scholars probe them, detect any errors \nand assign historical responsibility to each party. \n But in truth the more urgent task is to get back on \ncourse by finding a way out of the dark tunnel we have \nbeen forced into. In our opinion, the right way to \nproceed is to go back to where we should have started \nfrom in the first place and to address directly and \neffectively the chronic conflicts, foremost among them \nbeing the Arab-Israeli conflict and its core issue, the \nPalestinian question. \n Any attempt to achieve stability and disseminate \npeace and security in the world without a serious \nsettlement of the Palestinian question and the Arab-\nIsraeli conflict will not be successful. The opposite is \nalso true. Serious and sustained action to achieve a just \nand comprehensive settlement of that conflict and that \nquestion directly serves international peace and \nsecurity and contributes to the stabilization of the \nMiddle East region. All of us are aware of the \nimportance of Middle East stability for the stability of \nthe world at large. Furthermore, we are duty-bound to \ncontinue our work to defuse tensions in Iraq and \nLebanon and to stabilize and improve the situation in \nDarfur. \n It is hard to believe that sixteen years have \nalready passed since the convening of the historic \nMadrid Peace Conference between the Arabs and \nIsrael. Fourteen years have elapsed since the signing of \nthe first Palestinian-Israeli accord in Oslo. Eleven \nyears ago, Arab States adopted peace as their strategic \noption to end their conflict with Israel. Five full years \nhave passed since the declaration by the Arab States of \ntheir historic initiative regarding their readiness to \nestablish normal peace relations with Israel in return \nfor the latter\u2019s withdrawal from the territories it \noccupied by force in 1967 and for the just settlement of \nthe Palestinian question. It has also been five years \nsince the Palestinians and the Israelis reached a number \nof agreed points and memorandums that come very \nclose to the final settlement of this question. \n Given all of the above, one would scarcely \nbelieve that peace today still seems farther away than it \nwas in the early 1990s. It is hard to believe that there is \nnow talk going around in vicious circles about the \nbases and principles of the settlement, which are \nalready known to all of us. It is also hard to believe \nthat strenuous efforts are made to resume negotiations \nto agree yet again on mechanisms and formulations. \nRehashing those old and worn-out subjects is an \nexercise in futility. \n We in Egypt realize that the persistence of this \nconflict inflames passions and minds in the region. The \nAssembly knows the efforts and sacrifices made by \nEgypt in order to put a just and comprehensive end to \nthis historic conflict in a manner that serves the \ninterests of all parties. \n But this issue requires leadership; it requires \ncourage from all parties. It also requires a clear and \ncorrect vision that the lack of a peaceful settlement of \nthis conflict not only denies the right of a whole people \nto freedom and dignity, but also feeds directly the calls \nfor violence, extremism and the relinquishing of \npeaceful and political negotiation as a means to \nachieve the objective. Thus the conflict will continue to \nrage for years to come; peoples will continue to suffer; \nthe world will continue to face the current state of \nsharp instability and polarization, as we are currently \nwitnessing. \n Egypt has displayed and continues to display its \nconstant readiness to work with all parties: \nPalestinians, Israelis, Americans, Europeans and all \nthose who take to heart the interests of the Palestinian \npeople, the interests of the peoples of the region and \nthe interest of world peace and stability. Our purpose is \nto achieve the resumption of serious political dialogue, \nwhich would lead to a settlement within a strict, \nspecified time frame.  \n We will spare no effort to achieve that objective. \nWe will not despair in the face of problems and \ndifficulties. We will work in all sincerity because we \nare committed to the cause of our Palestinian brothers \nand to the establishment of an independent, sovereign \nPalestinian State on the Palestinian territories occupied \nin 1967, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital. We will \ncontinue to work because we are committed to the \nliberation of the rest of the occupied Arab territories in \nSyria and Lebanon and because we are committed to \nthe objective of achieving just and comprehensive \npeace in the Middle East. In this respect, the meeting \ncalled for by President Bush this fall may, if well \nprepared, provide an important opportunity to achieve \nlong-awaited progress. \n Brotherly Iraq continues to bleed; thousands of \nits citizens continue to be killed; thousands more \ncontinue to flee as a result of difficult living \nconditions. The state of today\u2019s Iraq breaks the heart of \none and all. In spite of the political process in Iraq, \nwhich we understood and encouraged, events on the \nground, with their extremely negative repercussions, \nare what shapes today\u2019s Iraq and its image before the \ninternational community.  \n Iraq today sorely needs leaders and leaderships \nthat are keen on preserving the unity of this major Arab \ncountry. It needs leaders who seek consensus and steer \naway from sectarianism and confessionalism. It needs \nleaders who extend the hand of dialogue to each other, \nwho do not point guns at one another: it needs leaders \nwho close ranks to combat the illegal armed factions \nand militias that take the lives of dozens of Iraqis \neveryday. It needs leaders who would sit together to \nagree on the shape and future of the State of Iraq in the \nIraqi Constitution, which we believe should express the \nhopes and dreams of all Iraqis without exclusion or \nmarginalization. It should build a modern developed \nState that is enriched by its diversity and that does not \nallocate its posts on the basis of sect or ethnic \nbackground in a manner that causes tension and \nincreases discord. \n Egypt reiterates the importance of the unity, \nsovereignty and territorial integrity of Iraq in a manner \nthat enjoys the consensus of all Iraqis. We also reiterate \nthe need for foreign interventions to cease influencing \ndevelopments in that sisterly country. Egypt reaffirms \nits full support for any regional or international effort \nthat assists Iraqis to overcome this difficult situation. \nBy the same token, Egypt will continue to consistently \ncall upon Iraqis to show unity and engage in dialogue \nin order to restore and strengthen trust among them. \n Brotherly Lebanon is also going through a \nsensitive crisis. The prospects for settling that crisis \nseem remote and difficult in view of internal \ndifferences and the regional tug-of-war. The situation \nin Lebanon is delicate and must not be burdened by the \nweight of the conflicts raging in the region. Therefore, \nEgypt has consistently called for Lebanon to be left to \nits people to determine what they wish for themselves. \nWe continue to encourage Lebanon\u2019s politicians to \nengage in dialogue among themselves. It is our hope \nthat they will be able to deal with the upcoming \nentitlements, foremost and most important among \nwhich are the presidential elections, in a manner \nconsistent with the Lebanese Constitution and that \nwould enable them to preserve Lebanon\u2019s \nconstitutional institutions and the proud achievements \nof its democracy. The Lebanese model of coexistence \nis significant and should not be allowed to suffer a \nsetback similar to that suffered in the past. Egypt will \nwork with all parties to achieve that objective. \n Since the onset of its crisis, the Darfur region of \nSudan has witnessed difficult conditions. This has \nrequired time, effort and hard work from all of us to \ndefuse that crisis and to reach a settlement that would \nensure for the whole population of the region the right \nto a decent life. Egypt welcomed the broad concern of \nthe international community over those difficult \nconditions and sought, in cooperation with concerned \ninternational and regional parties, to bring the parties \nin the crisis close to each other.  \n As concrete proof of its concern for the \nstabilization of the situation in Darfur, Egypt has \noffered a generous contribution of nearly 3,500 troops \nto the African Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation \nin the region. That offer still stands. In addition, Egypt \nhas contributed to the development of the region by \ndrilling 40 boreholes that would make water resources \navailable to larger numbers of people in Darfur. \n Egypt profoundly believes in the three main \npillars of international disarmament treaties:  \nnon-proliferation, disarmament and the inherent right \nof every State to the peaceful use of nuclear energy. In \n1995, Egypt accepted the indefinite extension of the \nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons \nwithin an integrated package that included a resolution \ncalling upon all States of the region without exception, \nto accede to the Treaty and compelling those States \nresponsible for the maintenance of international \nsecurity to discharge their responsibilities. However, \nthis objective is still to be achieved because Israel has \nnot yet acceded to the Treaty despite all the \ninternational and regional calls on it to do so. \n Today\u2019s world is regrettably witnessing an \nimbalance and double standards in dealings with the \nvarious parties that have nuclear ambitions, potential or \nexpertise. Egypt believes that the international \ndisarmament and non-proliferation system will be \nstrengthened and that regional security in the Middle \nEast will be reinforced only when a single standard is \napplied equally to all the States of the region without \nexception. \n The previous session witnessed many serious \nefforts and consultations concerning the question of the \nreform and expansion of the Security Council. Despite \nthe plethora of consultations, meetings and endeavours, \nthis objective remains elusive. As a member of the \nAfrican Group, Egypt once again states its full \ncommitment to the specifics of the unified African \nposition. It remains a fair and balanced position that \nwould, if implemented, achieve legitimate African \naspirations. I cannot fail to refer here to the fact that \nthe reform of the working methods of the Security \nCouncil is a genuine objective in itself that must not \nfade or be obscured by the attempts of some to expand \nthe Council. \n We have plenty of work to do, but since time is \nshort I would like to say that the state of our world is \nno cause for rejoicing. Rather it is a cause for concern. \nThis requires us to work together with open minds in \norder to change it for the better, and in order to meet \nthe aspirations of our peoples to freedom, justice, a \ndignified life, security and peace. \n During this session, Egypt will raise and defend \nthe priorities and visions I have put forward in this \nstatement along with a host of other subjects that time \ndid not allow me to address. It is our hope that we will \nall write in responding to the challenges facing us. We \nall bear responsibility and will all suffer the \nconsequences of failure. \n"

        "file_text": "Allow me at the outset to \nextend our congratulations to Mr. Kerim on his election \nto the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-\nsecond session. I wish to thank most sincerely his \npredecessor, Her Excellency Sheikha Haya Rashed \nKhalifa of Bahrain, for the able manner in which she \nhandled the vital business of the sixty-first session. I \nalso wish to express my gratitude to the Secretary-\nGeneral, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for his leadership of our \nOrganization, and most especially for his untiring \nefforts in favour of conflict resolution and peace on the \nAfrican continent and elsewhere. \n Sixty-two years ago, the founding fathers of the \nUnited Nations came together, determined, in the \nwords of the Charter, \u201cto employ international \nmachinery for the promotion of the economic and \nsocial advancement of all peoples\u201d. The Organization \nthey created was to be a centre for harmonizing the \nactions of nations in the attainment of these common \ngoals. Today humankind is faced with a common threat \nin the form of climate change. The General Assembly\u2019s \nchoice of responding to climate change as the theme \nfor this session is timely. It will help draw attention to \nthe global challenge for which no single country has a \nsolution. It is only through concerted and sustained \ninternational cooperation that action to combat the \neffects and further escalation of climate change can be \ntaken. \n There is no doubt that climate change is the \nbiggest danger facing humankind, especially the poor. \nThe threat of extreme conditions, including floods and \ndrought, is a major concern. It has many implications \nfor development, particularly for agrarian communities \nwith fewer resources to cope with additional stresses \nand shocks brought about by this phenomenon. The \nincreasing frequency and severity of prolonged drought \nthreaten water supplies to millions of people in poor \ncountries, as well as agriculture which is \noverwhelmingly subsistence and rain-fed and, \ntherefore, vulnerable to climate variability and change. \n The vulnerability of the health sector has also \nbeen evident as frequent floods result in outbreaks of \nwaterborne diseases, such as cholera, typhoid, \ndysentery and the increased incidence of malaria. \n Indeed, climate change today constitutes a danger \nto human security, considering the effects of climate \nchange on the very existence of some small island \nStates and coastal cities, as well as the devastation by \nhurricanes and typhoons. \n Several years ago, the world was alerted to the \ndanger of climate change. Under the United Nations \nFramework Convention on Climate Change, a number \nof actions were agreed upon. We all agreed to \nundertake a three-pronged approach, including \ndevelopment, access to appropriate technology, \nmitigation and adaptation. It is unfortunate that, so far, \nno meaningful actions have been undertaken to \nimplement these agreed interventions. \n My delegation believes that the time is now to \nimplement these high-priority activities. We should, \nhowever, recognize that responding to climate change \nwill require political leadership at all levels, starting \nfrom the centre and extending to the grassroots. \nIncreasing collaborative action on adaptation is \nurgently needed, so that vulnerable countries and \ncommunities can cope with the unavoidable impact of \nclimate change. Reforestation efforts and control of \ngreenhouse gas emissions are urgent actions that we \ncan undertake together. However, reforestation on its \nown will not produce the desired results without \nadequate investment in renewable energy sources as a \nmeasure against the massive depletion of forests for \nfuel. Developed countries should encourage companies \nto invest in hydro-electric power generation and other \nclean energy sources in developing countries. For such \nprojects to be undertaken, measures such as a \nsuccessful fifteenth International Development \nAssociation replenishment is critical. We all must learn \nto safeguard and use available resources sparingly for \nthe sake of future generations. \n Uganda considers the United Nations Climate \nChange Conference, to be held in Bali, Indonesia, this \nDecember, to be critical in the development of a long-\nterm response to climate change. It is an opportunity to \nbegin concrete negotiations on a global strategy that is \nacceptable to all and implementable. Prior to Bali, \nhowever, this Assembly should agree on guiding \nprinciples that can help bring together all relevant \naspects of the problem. The industrialized countries \nshould take the lead in cutting emissions, while \ndeveloping countries will have to pursue low-emission \ndevelopment strategies and benefit from incentives for \nassistance for adaptation and for limiting emissions. \nWe must commit ourselves to an approach that \nbalances adaptation and mitigation, underpinned by \nadequate financing arrangements and investments in \nnew and innovative technologies. \n As Members of the United Nations, our countries \nshare a vision of a better standard of life, in larger \nfreedom, as enshrined in our Charter. We are, however, \nchallenged by a persistence of poverty in many of our \ncountries. Recent statistics indicate that, worldwide, \n1.2 billion people live on one dollar a day, while \n2.8 billion survive on less than two dollars. The gap \nbetween the rich and the poor continues to widen, both \nwithin States and among States. \n The World Bank reported in 2003 that average \nincome in the wealthiest 20 countries is 37 times that \nof the poorest 20, which is twice the ratio of what it \nwas in 1970. Many countries, especially those in \nsub-Saharan Africa, ended the last decade with lower \nper capita incomes than at its beginning. Poverty is one \nof the biggest threats to international peace, security \nand the environment. \n At the Millennium Summit, world leaders \nexpressed their determination to halve world poverty \nby the year 2015. The midpoint progress report on the \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) that was \nreleased in July this year indicates that countries in \nAfrica and elsewhere are proving that large-scale \nprogress in achieving the MDGs is possible under \nconditions of adequate financing, much of which \nshould flow from a strengthened global partnership for \ndevelopment. It is critical that the Monterrey targets be \nmet. \n As we respond to climate change, the fight \nagainst poverty remains an integral part of the effort. \nUnless we address poverty in developing countries, the \npoor will continue to destroy the environment by \ncutting trees for firewood and employing poor \nagricultural practices. \n There are time-tested ways to bring people out of \npoverty. Trade liberalization and export-led growth \nhave the potential to lift millions out of poverty. \nHowever, to benefit from trade, developing countries \nmust add value to their raw materials and sell them as \nfinished products, taking advantage of appropriate \nvalue chains. That will not only increase earnings but \ncreate jobs, thus ending the mass migrations to the \ndeveloped countries. They should develop their human \nresources through education and better health services. \nEducation is a critical factor in transforming society. \nAn educated middle class with adequate income to \nspend is critical for industrialization and the transition \nof societies. That has happened in some countries of \nSouth-East Asia; it can happen elsewhere in the \ndeveloping world. As a priority, agriculture needs to be \ncommercialized. Related to that is the urgent need for \nregional integration so as to enlarge markets. \n Under heavy pressure, many developing countries \nhave removed trade barriers, while the developed \ncountries have not reciprocated in such key areas as \nagriculture and textiles, where the former have a \ncomparative advantage. Is it not absurd that a cow in \nthe European Union gets a daily subsidy of $2.2, while \n40 per cent of the world\u2019s population lives on less than \n$2 a day? The World Bank estimates that protectionism \nby the developed world costs developing countries \n$100 billion annually. A fair system will require \nappropriate measures to deal with the unfair trade \nprivileges of developed countries that hinder market \naccess. It is vital that the stalled trade talks under the \nDoha Development Round be resumed and \nsuccessfully concluded. \n Peace and security are necessary conditions for \nsustainable development. The rise in inter- and intra-\nState conflict has been the hallmark of the post-cold-\nwar era. Internal conflicts have spilled over borders to \ncreate regional instability. Internal displacement has \ntaken place, and equally alarming has been the \ninternational refugee crisis that has resulted from such \nconflicts. In some countries, central authority has \ncollapsed, creating havens for terrorists and drug \ntraffickers, with the attendant threats to international \npeace and security. No meaningful actions against \npoverty and in favour of environmental protection can \ntake place in that kind of atmosphere. \n The President returned to the Chair. \n Most of Africa is now peaceful, and democracy is \nbeing consolidated through regular elections, the \nobservance of human rights and constitutionalism. \nHowever, there are some areas that require urgent \ninternational attention. There is a need to ensure peace \nand stability in Darfur in accordance with the \ninternationally agreed framework under Security \nCouncil resolution 1769 (2007). Further attention \nshould be given to supporting the implementation of \nthe Comprehensive Peace Agreement between the \nGovernment of the Sudan and the Sudan People\u2019s \nLiberation Movement in the South. \n In Somalia, the General Assembly should support \nan all-inclusive peace and reconciliation process and \nthe Africa Union Military Observer Mission in Somalia \n(AMISOM) with the necessary resources to facilitate \nthe peacekeeping. Uganda has honoured its pledge of \ntroops for peacekeeping; we call on other countries that \nmade similar pledges to fulfil them. The international \neffort in Somalia should focus on capacity-building to \nempower the Somali people to solve their own \nproblems. We also call on the Secretary-General to \nfinalize plans for possible deployment of a United \nNations peacekeeping force to replace AMISOM, as \ncalled for in Security Council resolution 1772 (2007). \n In the Great Lakes region, various efforts are \nunder way to improve peace and security and to create \nan atmosphere conducive to development. Through the \nTripartite Plus One Commission, bringing together the \nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, Rwanda, Burundi \nand Uganda, we have agreed on a framework and \nactions to deal with negative forces that pose a threat \nto peace and security in the region. In that regard, we \nrefer to Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter and \nto provisions of Security Council resolution 1756 \n(2007). The Security Council should reinforce the \nmandate and the means of the United Nations \nOrganization Mission in the Democratic Republic of \nthe Congo to enable it effectively to work with \nCongolese armed forces to totally eradicate the threat \nof negative forces operating in the territory of the \nDemocratic Republic of the Congo. \n In northern Uganda, we are holding peace talks \nwith the Lord\u2019s Resistance Army (LRA). Of the five \nagenda items, two agreements have been concluded \nand signed. Those are the Cessation of Hostilities \nAgreement and an agreement on comprehensive \nsolutions. However, the LRA has not met any of the \nterms of the very first Agreement on Cessation of \nHostilities. For example, it is stipulated that LRA \nforces assemble at Ri-Kwangba in southern Sudan; \nthey have, however, not done so to date. They are still \ncamped in Garamba National park in the Democratic \nRepublic of the Congo. We urge the international \ncommunity to bring adequate pressure to bear on the \nLRA to assemble at Ri-Kwangba and to set a time \nframe for the talks. Talks cannot go on forever. As we \ninch towards a comprehensive peace agreement, \ninternational support and understanding are required to \nbalance the need for durable peace and stability on the \none hand, and the imperative for justice on the other. \n I wish to assure the General Assembly that \nUganda is fully aware of its obligations under the \nRome Statute and cannot undermine it. We cannot \ncondone impunity. To that end, we are working closely \nwith the International Criminal Court to ensure \naccountability under the complementarity stipulations. \nUganda will be convening a Consultative Group \nmeeting later this year to mobilize resources and \ncoordinate actions for the post-conflict reconciliation \nprogramme in northern Uganda. The international \ncommunity is invited to support that programme. \n When you chose \u201cResponding to climate change\u201d \nas the theme for this session, Sir, I believe you \nintended to have this session consider and recommend \nways of addressing that common threat. You believed, \nas indeed we do, that a world that pays no attention to \nthat problem is fatally damaging the interests of future \ngenerations. Addressing climate change will involve \nfighting poverty, ensuring peace and security, and \ninvesting in clean energy, especially in developing \ncountries. This session should be the turning point at \nwhich we all come together and agree on ways to save \nour planet. \n"

        "file_text": "While we  commend the United Nations for having chosen \nclimate change as the theme for this sixty-second \nsession of the General Assembly, at the same time we \nrecall that many countries in the South have, in recent \ndecades, warned the international community about \nthis phenomenon, which is being experienced here and \nthere through the drama of droughts and \ndesertification. Climate change has multiple causes, \nsome natural and others generated by human action. \nTherefore, the responsibilities of States and societies \nwith respect to these changes are not equal. Nor are the \nimpacts they have on the lives of the common citizen. \nLikewise, we do not have the same scientific, \ntechnological or financial means to prevent the \nnegative effects of climate change. \n At this point, I would like to say a few words \nabout drought and desertification, which demonstrate, \nwithout a doubt, the change of climate in the West \nAfrican subregion. It is needless to mention their \ndevastating impact on the economic and social life of \nthe populations. Unfortunately, in spite of conferences \nand grandiloquent conclusions and declarations, the \nrepeated calls from the Sahel have received half-heated \nand inconsistent responses. In view of the profound \nimplications of this stance for the lives of populations \nand States, some are depicting those responses as an \nabdication of responsibility on the part of the \ninternational community. \n Climate change is, without any doubt, a world \nchallenge with many dimensions and the potential to \nrestructure economic, social and political life. Most \nlikely, we have wasted too much time in discussion, \nthereby delaying global acceptance of the problem and, \nconsequently, the formulation of strategies for \nadaptation and mitigation. \n In brief, I would like to underline the catastrophic \neffects, both present and future, of climate change and \nmore specifically, of drought and desertification on \nsmall island States. If the projections on sea level rise \nprove to be true, we will be facing a disaster of \nunimaginable proportions. \n My country, Cape Verde, an archipelago of \nmodest physical and demographic dimensions, is a \nsmall island State and has experienced drought and \ndesertification and suffered from almost uninterrupted \nwater shortages for more than three decades. \n Indeed, Cape Verde, given its location, size, \nlandscape and the insular and archipelagic \ncharacteristics of its territory, is a prime example of the \nconvergence and concentration of the negative effects \nof climate change. Drought and desertification have an \nunquestionable impact on family income and the \npoverty rate. They also undermine Government efforts \nand strongly condition the mobilization and allocation \nof resources for development financing. \n In the light of the challenges of climate change, \none should recall the leading role that the United \nNations has had and continues to have in mustering \nefforts to raise awareness about this critical problem \nfor the future of mankind. We are convinced that the \nBali conference will set new parameters based on the \nprinciple of equity, the legitimate aspirations of \npopulations to development and the differentiated \nresponsibilities of each and everyone. \n We therefore call on the United Nations to pursue \nits efforts in this area and give very special attention to \nsmall island States, which have to contend with \nmultiple fragilities and vulnerabilities. It is imperative \nto resume and implement the Mauritius Strategy for the \nFurther Implementation of the Programme of Action \nfor the Sustainable Development of Small Island \nDeveloping States. The community of nations cannot \nbut acknowledge that, given their origins and their role \nthroughout history, small island States are a \u201cheritage \nof mankind\u201d. \n In spite of its structural vulnerabilities and its \nundeniable lack of natural resources, Cape Verde has, \nsince independence in 1975, followed a positive and \nconsistent development path. It is in this context that \nwe should consider Cape Verde\u2019s graduation or, in \nother words, its withdrawal from the group of least \ndeveloped countries as of 2008. We are resolved to rise \nto the challenge of this new development stage and \nthrough audacious strategies and decisions to transform \nthe country. We are quite aware that the main \nresponsibility for Cape Verde\u2019s development rests in \nthe hands of the Cape Verdean Government and \ncitizens. This is the spirit that has guided us in the past, \nand it is the spirit that will allow us to face the \nchallenge of graduation. Nevertheless, during the \ntransition period we hope to be able to count on strong \npartnership from the international community in \ndealing with Cape Verde\u2019s structural fragility and any \nnew vulnerabilities. \n In this regard, I call on the United Nations and \nMember States to pay special attention to the \ndeclaration of the United Nations Transition Assistance \nGroup and to the report that the Government will soon \ndeliver to the Secretary-General in accordance with the \nresolution on graduation which the General Assembly \nadopted in December 2004. \n While it is true that our development strategy is \nopen, daring and driven by the desire to create \nopportunities for foreign direct investment, it is no less \ntrue that today, more than ever, we need innovative aid \nand financing modalities that are better adjusted to the \npace we want to set for Cape Verde\u2019s development and \nto the imperatives of the transition. It is high time that \nwe move from discourse to action with respect to \nownership, in accordance with the spirit of the Paris \nDeclaration on Aid Effectiveness. \n Allow me also briefly to recall the transborder \nand global nature of many modern day phenomena. I \nrefer to climate change and, of course, to terrorism, \norganized crime and trafficking of all kinds. These \nrepresent a threat to human security and to the \ndemocratic rule of law, as they corrupt values, \ncompromise development and thwart the most \nlegitimate expectations of peoples. \n We are living at a time when problems and threats \nare of concern to all. They are not confined to a single \nState or region. Nor can there be local solutions to the \nglobal threats of our era. Responses to these issues will \nbe ineffective unless they are undertaken within a \nrobust, balanced and fair multilateral perspective. \n The United Nations is, and should continue to be, \nthe foundation, the guarantor and the forum of \nmultilateralism. We are strongly convinced that the \nUnited Nations must be strengthened for the sake of \nthe future of the world and of the ideals of peace, \nsecurity and development. And we are all faced with \nthe challenge of translating the reiterated statements of \nthe international community into coherent and \nconsistent action. It is a question of credibility in the \neyes of the world, which is watching us. \n I cannot conclude without extending my \ngreetings, congratulations and encouragement to the \nSecretary-General and wishing him success in guiding \nour common Organization towards fully attaining its \nfounding goals and meeting the imperatives of \nincreased efficiency, modernization and \ndemocratization in its work. \n Likewise, I would like to extend warm greetings \nto you, Mr. President, and to assure you of our \nconfidence that you will face the important challenges \nconfronting the Assembly with serenity and a sense of \nduty. \n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of  the people of Fiji, I extend to you, Mr. President, and \nto the General Assembly, our warm greetings: Ni sa \nbula and Namaste. We would also like congratulate \nyou, Sir, on your election to the presidency of the \nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-second session. \n I would also like to acknowledge the presence of \nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon. We wish to extend to \nhim our warmest congratulations, as this is his first full \nAssembly session as Secretary-General. We note with \ngratitude the initiatives he has taken in the brief period \nsince he assumed leadership to enhance momentum in \nthe work of the United Nations. Fiji appreciates in \nparticular his policy of inclusiveness and the attention \nthat he is giving to the vulnerable situation and the \nspecial needs of small island nations. \n At the outset, Fiji wishes to reiterate its unwavering \ncommitment to achieving the Millennium Development \nGoals (MDGs), pursuing environmentally friendly and \nsustainable development activities and addressing the \nchallenges of climate change. As those issues have been \nwidely debated in the Assembly, I would like to take this \nopportunity to address other issues of particular concern \nto Fiji. \n United Nations-led peacekeeping operations are \nrenowned worldwide and have become the human face  \nof this multilateral body in war-torn and conflict-prone \nregions of the world. For its part, Fiji continues to \nstand ready to shoulder the burden of promoting \ninternational peace. In that regard, we have offered our \nservices to the African Union-United Nations hybrid \npeacekeeping operation in the Sudan. In the same vein, \nFiji is committed to our collective resolve to enlarge \nthe presence of the United Nations in Iraq. We are \nwilling to contribute further towards that end, should \nthe need arise. \n Today, the demand for peacekeeping continues to \ngrow. With it comes the need for institutional reform to \nadequately cater for the ever-changing nature of world \nconflict. I would like to reiterate Fiji\u2019s support for all \nreform efforts, including the latest initiative of the \nSecretary-General to reform the Department of \nPeacekeeping Operations. At the same time, I would \nurge the Secretariat to continue to resist the \npoliticization of United Nations peacekeeping and to \nmaintain the sanctity of its independence as a forum \nwherein the willing may volunteer their services freely \nand without bilateral mangling and interference. \n I now seek your indulgence, Mr. President, and \nthat of the Assembly, to speak about the situation, \nparticular circumstances and needs of Fiji at this stage \nof its nationhood as an independent sovereign nation. \nFiji\u2019s overall situation is that it is in a deep rut. It needs \nthe understanding and support of the international \ncommunity to be able to move forward to regain its \ndignity and its rightful place as a responsible member \nof the international family of nations. I am mindful, as \nI stand here today in the presence of the Assembly, that \nmembers may see me as the military leader who \nremoved an elected Government. I cannot begrudge \nthem that, because that indeed is a fact. I submit to the \nAssembly that, although the Government of the day \nwas removed from power last December, such action \nwas taken with extreme reluctance. I am not a \npolitician; nor do I aspire to be one. I am certainly not \nmuch of a diplomat, and I am not used to speaking in \nforums such as this. Therefore, in what I say and in \nhow I may put it, if in any way I am remiss with regard \nto the protocols of the Assembly, I seek understanding. \n By the time the military intervened last \nDecember, Fiji\u2019s overall governance situation had \nregressed to a catastrophic level. The international \ncommunity needs to fully understand the special local \ncontext of Fiji\u2019s situation. Fiji became independent on \n10 October 1970, inheriting an institutional \ninfrastructure that could potentially have evolved \nfurther and been strengthened to allow democracy to \ntake root. At that time, almost four decades ago, Fiji\u2019s \nfuture appeared to be one of promise and potential. For \ninstance, in terms of per capita income, Fiji was then in \nthe same league as Malaysia and Thailand. We, the \npeople of Fiji, viewed our country with pride and \ndignity and felt that that was the way the world should \nbe. For more than a decade after achieving \nindependence, Fiji did continue to make steady \nprogress in economic development, education, poverty \nreduction and generally improving the living \nconditions of its people. \n Yet, in 1970, Fiji started its journey as a young \nnation on a rather shaky foundation, with a race-based \nconstitution that rigidly compartmentalized our \ncommunities. The \u201cdemocracy\u201d that came to be \npracticed in Fiji was marked by divisive, adversarial, \ninward-looking, raced-based politics. The legacy of \nleadership, at both community and national levels, was \na fractured nation. Fiji\u2019s people were not allowed to \nshare a common national identity. Of the two major \ncommunities, indigenous Fijians were instilled with \nfear of dominance and dispossession by Indo-Fijians, \nand they desired protection of their status as the \nindigenous people. Indo-Fijians, on the other hand, felt \nalienated and marginalized as second class citizens in \ntheir own country, the country of their birth, Fiji. \n The dates 14 May and 25 September 1987 are \nfateful in Fiji\u2019s history and also for Fiji\u2019s military \nforces. The military coups of that year were motivated \nby an ethno-nationalist, racist supremacy agenda. \nThose political, communal and military leaders who \nwere responsible for the coups and related actions in \n1987 carry a very large burden in their collective \nconscience for the severe ruptures to the very fabric of \nFiji society and the dislocations and suffering that they \ncaused in the lives of many of Fiji\u2019s citizens. \n In May 2000, Fiji suffered yet another major \nsetback. Again, a group of ethno-nationalist \nopportunists, backed by a small errant group within the \nFiji military, overthrew the Government of the day. As \nCommander of the Republic of Fiji military forces, I \ndid not support or condone the coup. I drew upon the \nstructural and cultural organization of the military to \nintervene and to restore order and a state of security. \n The stand-off between the coup perpetrators and \nthe military in May 2000 was potentially explosive at \nthe time and, if not resolved, could have resulted in \nmuch bloodshed and even greater chaos. As military \nCommander, I played a key role in the handing \nexecutive authority back into civilian hands in the \nwake of the 2000 coup. This rested on a number of \ncritical preconditions being met in taking Fiji forward. \n An Interim Government was appointed by His \nExcellency the President of Fiji, with Laisenia Qarase \nas caretaker Prime Minister. The Interim Government \nwas tasked to pave the way to fresh elections to be held \nin September of 2001. The other fundamental \nconditions were that all of the perpetrators of the May \n2000 coup, including the military rebels, would be \nprosecuted, and that the 2000 coup would be publicly \nrenounced as racially motivated. \n It is tragic that Fiji\u2019s recovery from the brink of \nchaos in May 2000 did not endure. In the ensuing \nyears, Fiji\u2019s overall governance took a dramatic turn \nfor the worse. In particular, this was characterized by \nthe politicization of the prison services and the \ncriminal justice system. There was also a significant \nweakening of the key institutions of governance, a \npervasive increase in corruption, serious economic \ndecline combined with fiscal mismanagement, a sharp \ndeterioration in the law and order situation and a \ndeepening of the racial divide in the country. The \nconvicted coup perpetrators were prematurely \ndischarged from prison, and certain coup perpetrators \nand sympathisers were appointed as senior Government \nministers and officials. There was also a series of \nlegislative acts that were deeply divisive and overtly \nracist. \n The 2001 and 2006 general elections were not \ncredible. They were characterized by massive rigging \nof votes, with an incumbent Government using the \nState\u2019s resources to buy support. By late 2006, Fiji\u2019s \noverall situation had deteriorated sharply, heightened \nby massive corruption and lawlessness, a severe \nerosion of confidence and an economy on the brink of \ncollapse. Also, during the latter part of 2006, Fiji\u2019s \nmilitary had to pay particular attention to certain \nexternal threats to the sovereignty of the nation. \n Under our current constitution, Fiji\u2019s military is \ncharged with national security, defence and the well-\nbeing of Fiji\u2019s people. Under the circumstances, the \nmilitary, under my stewardship, could not possibly see \nsuch an unacceptable situation unfold without seeking \nto address it. \n History is testament to how I did in fact respond \nto the situation. For almost four years, I was strenuous \nin my efforts to constructively engage the elected \nleadership of the country, seeking to cause it to reverse \nits course of action, which was taking the country \ndown the path of destruction into an abyss. The \nprotracted efforts that I made to constructively engage \nwith the previous Government came to no avail. On the \ncontrary, a prominent High Chief connected to the \nruling Soqosoqo Duavata Lewenivanua (SDL) party \nincited a mutiny within the military, and attempts were \nmade not only to remove me, but also to eliminate me. \n It was with the utmost of reluctance that Fiji\u2019s \nmilitary, under my leadership, removed the former \nGovernment from power in December 2006. \n Many have criticized that decision. In response, I \nsay this: Fiji has a coup culture, a history of civilian or \nmilitary coups executed in the interests of a few and \nbased on nationalism, racism and greed. In order to \nremove that coup culture and to make a commitment to \ndemocracy and the rule of law, policies which promote \nracial supremacy and further the interests of economic \nand social elites must be removed once and for all. \nRacism, elitism and disrespect for the law are \nundemocratic. They lead to hatred. They lead to \nviolence, poverty and moral bankruptcy. We saw that in \nthe years leading to the Second World War. We saw the \ngenocide, the concentration camps, the rampant \nimperialism   which resulted, in turn, in the creation \nof the United Nations. \n Within a month of the removal of the previous \nGovernment, the President of the Republic of Fiji \nresumed his constitutional authority. On 5 January \n2007, the President appointed an Interim Government \nwhich is mandated to govern Fiji until a new \nGovernment is duly elected. With the exception of \nmyself, the make-up of the Interim Government is all \ncivilian. The presidential mandate provides the \nframework within which the Interim Government, in \nwhich I serve as Prime Minister, administers the affairs \nof the State. We are resolved to take the measures \nnecessary to convene free and fair elections as soon as \npractically possible. On this, the Interim Government is \ncoordinating closely with Fiji\u2019s fellow members of the \nPacific Islands Forum and the larger international \ncommunity, including the European Union. \n Steady progress has been made in a number of \nareas pertaining to upholding the existing constitution, \ninvestigation into alleged abuses of human rights, \nmaintaining the independence of the judiciary and \npreparatory work for the return of Fiji to parliamentary \ndemocracy. \n Fiji\u2019s situation is not only complex; its problems \nare also deep-rooted and structural. There are no quick \nor easy fixes. The country is now at a very critical \ncrossroad; the situation could escalate into more \nserious deterioration and instability. It is imperative \nthat any such greater disaster or civil strife be averted. \n We therefore seek constructive dialogue and \nengagement with the international community, with all \nour bilateral and multilateral development partners, \nwhom we urge to work with us, to help support us, in \naddressing our fundamental problems in moving Fiji \nforward. Fiji needs the support of the international \ncommunity to develop a political and governance \nframework that is truly democratic, accountable, \ninclusive, equitable and non-racial and that unifies \nFiji\u2019s diverse communities as a nation. That is indeed \nthe larger and most critical of challenges that Fiji now \nfaces. \n For our part, we firmly resolve to tackle these \nchallenges on at least four levels: first, to restore \nstability, law and order and confidence; secondly, to \nstrengthen institutions for good governance including \ntransparency, accountability and an independent and \neffectively functioning judiciary; thirdly, to carry out \nmajor reforms in the economy to facilitate sustainable \nprivate-sector-led growth; and lastly, to convene free \nand fair general elections within a constitutional and \ngovernance framework that will ensure that \nparliamentary democracy is not only restored but can \nbe sustained in Fiji. \n To achieve all this, the Interim Government is \npreparing to launch a major national initiative, referred \nto as the Peoples Charter for Change and Progress   \nthe PCCP. Through the PCCP, the broad cross section \nof Fiji\u2019s people will be fully engaged and involved, \nthrough consultation and participation, in the \ndevelopment of a comprehensive agenda of actions and \nmeasures, as Fiji\u2019s own way of addressing its \nproblems. \n For the future, Fiji will look at making the \nnecessary legal changes in the area of electoral reform \nto ensure true equality at the polls. At present, all \ncitizens have the right to vote for two candidates: one \nfor a national seat of any ethnicity, and another from a \ncommunal raced-based seat. This in turn has kept our \nraces apart.  \n Although democracy in the form of electing a \nGovernment was introduced in Fiji at the time of \nindependence, researchers and analysts have suggested \nthat Fijians live in a democracy with a mentality that \nbelongs to the chiefly system. In essence this means \nthat at election time, Fijians living in village and rural \nareas are culturally influenced to vote for the candidate \nselected for them by their chiefs, their provincial \ncouncils and their church ministers. This leads me to \nask whether the countries that are demanding that Fiji \nimmediately return to democracy really understand \nhow distorted and unfair our system is, both legally \nand culturally.  \n This must change. Every person will be given the \nright to vote for only one candidate, irrespective of \nrace or religion. This will send a message to our people \nthat Fiji\u2019s leadership no longer tolerates racial divisions \nand race-based politics. All men and women are equal \nin dignity and in rights. Electoral reform in this respect \nwill be looked at by a National Council for Building a \nBetter Fiji, which is designed to entrench the very \nprinciple on which the United Nations was founded.  \n The draft Peoples Charter that will emerge from \nsuch a national-level undertaking will provide the \npolitical and governance framework, with effective \nsupporting and functioning institutions, to make Fiji a \ntruly democratic and progressive nation.  \n The draft of the PCCP proposal was circulated \nwidely within the country, with comments and \nsuggestions invited. Additionally, I personally wrote to \nthe leaders of Fiji\u2019s bilateral and multilateral \ndevelopment partners, including the United Nations \nSecretary-General, on the PCCP initiative.  \n I am pleased to report that in general this \ninitiative has been received with very strong support \nwithin Fiji, in particular from highly reputable and \nrespected civil society and community leaders in the \ncountry. The Peoples Charter, once formulated and \nadopted, will provide the strategic framework or \nfundamental foundation within which the Interim \nGovernment, and successive elected Governments, will \nbe expected to operate.  \n In the current absence of an elected Government, \nthere is the issue of legitimacy and mandates. To deal \nwith this, the Interim Government is willing to \nconsider putting the draft Peoples Charter to a \nreferendum to get the mandate of the people for the \nfundamental changes, including changes to the \nConstitution of Fiji, as may be considered necessary \nand appropriate.  \n Fiji needs both financial and technical support \nfrom its bilateral and multilateral development partners \nto be able to effectively realize the vision that \nunderpins the PCCP initiative. Above all, we seek the \nunderstanding of the international community to help \nus rebuild our nation in the true spirit of internationally \nacceptable precepts of good governance and a \ndemocracy that can be made to work and that can be \nsustained in Fiji. \n We must thank those Governments that have \nstood by and supported Fiji in our hour of need. Fiji is \nindeed very grateful and is deeply touched by their \nunderstanding and goodwill. \n Some in the international community, including \nthe closest of our neighbours in the Pacific, have seen \nfit to impose punitive measures upon Fiji. Of course \nwe know that those powerful States are protecting their \nown economic and political interests in the region. \nHowever, we in Fiji are protecting our democracy and \nstrengthening our democratic institutions. Those \npowerful States are undermining our attempts to \nrebuild our nation on strong foundations and are \nundermining our attempts to appoint people of merit \nand honesty to our State institutions, regardless of race \nand religion. Current sanctions target any person \nappointed by the Interim Government.  \n This is hypocrisy at its worst on part of those \nStates as they are clearly undermining our efforts to \npromote and practice good governance. These \nactions   such as the travel bans, described as smart \nsanctions   have had a debilitating impact on our \nstruggles to revive, to recover and to reform. \n Good governance requires effective, functioning \ninstitutions. Since the coups of 1987, Fiji has suffered \na massive exodus of the country\u2019s skilled and educated \npeople. The major beneficiaries of the transfer of those \nquality human assets have been Australia and New \nZealand, and from those neighbours in particular we \nseek understanding and support. Our capacities and \ninstitutions have been severely eroded over the years. \nIn all of this, we desperately need help, not a closing of \ndoors.  \n I shall conclude my statement by reaffirming \nFiji\u2019s commitment to the United Nations and to the \nvarious United Nations conventions on human rights, \nthe rule of law and democratic governance. Fiji does \nnot seek any unwarranted exemptions from any of \nthose obligations. All we seek is your deeper \nunderstanding of our particular circumstances and the \ncomplex situation of Fiji. We hope that you will work \nwith us, assist us to rebuild and move Fiji forward.  \n In closing, I take this opportunity to extend to the \nSecretary-General an invitation to Fiji and indeed to \nour Pacific region during his tenure.  \n"

        "file_text": "Let me begin by  congratulating Mr. Kerim for his well deserved \nelection as President of the General Assembly at its \nsixty-second session. He can count on Tanzania\u2019s full \nsupport and cooperation as he discharges his mandate. \nI also commend his predecessor, Sheikha Haya Rashed \nAl-Khalifa, for having skilfully presided over the sixty-\nfirst session. \n We also congratulate Mr. Ban Ki-moon for his \nunanimous election as the eighth Secretary-General of \nthe United Nations, which reflects his distinguished \ndiplomatic track record, integrity and commitment to \ninternational diplomacy. I thank him for the honour and \ntrust he has bestowed upon my country, by appointing \nan accomplished Tanzanian academic and diplomat to \nthe post of Deputy-Secretary-General. I take this \nopportunity to once again congratulate Ms. Asha-Rose \nMigiro, for her appointment to that high office. I trust \nthat such a combination of diligence and devoted \nleadership will steer this important institution towards \ngreater heights of success.  \n I highly commend the Secretary-General for his \ndecision to convene the High-Level Event on Climate \nChange four days ago. The meeting gave us an \nopportunity to discuss the state of health of our \ncommon planet. It also gave us the opportunity to \nrenew our commitment to take the necessary steps to \ncorrect the mistakes we have made. It is indisputable \nand is attributable, by and large, to human activities. \n Unfortunately Africa and many small island \nStates contribute the least to the greenhouse gases that \ncause this phenomenon and yet suffer the most from \nthe impact of climate change. Climate change can also \nadversely affect our abilities to achieve the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). It also threatens to undo \nthe results of many decades of development efforts.  \n I wish to emphasize that international collective \naction is critical in developing an effective response to \nglobal warming. Indeed, a review process to consider \nfurther commitment on the part of the Parties under the \nKyoto Protocol beyond 2012 is urgent and necessary. \nTanzania promises to participate actively in the Bali \nConference.  \n Tanzania welcomes the recent milestones in the \nUnited Nations reform process, namely the \nestablishment of the Peacebuilding Commission, the \nHuman Rights Council and the Central Emergency \nResponse Fund. We attach great importance to these \nnew initiatives, and we want to contribute to their \nsuccess.  \n In its report of November 2006 entitled, \n\u201cDelivering as One\u201d, the High-level Panel on United \nNations System-wide Coherence made valuable \nrecommendations, including the establishment of a \n\u201cOne United Nations\u201d system at the country level. We \nin Tanzania believe that the development coordination \nagenda is best served when we have one programme, \none budgetary framework, one leader and one office at \nthe country level. Tanzania is pleased to be among the \neight \u201cOne United Nations\u201d pilot countries. The One \nUnited Nations Initiative is a logical development from \nthe United Nations Development Assistance \nFramework (UNDAF), a framework that is fully \naligned with our national priorities. The efficiencies in \naid delivery expected through \u201cOne United Nations\u201d \nwill certainly contribute to enhancing our capacity to \nattain the MDGs. \n I call upon Member States to give our \nOrganization, the United Nations, the resources it \nneeds to implement this pilot project. The project \nshould not fail for lack of resources. I also urge the \nBretton Woods institutions to take a keener interest in \nthis initiative and join in the efforts to realize its \nobjectives. \n The need to make the Security Council more \nrepresentative is an age-old demand we all share. We \nneed to move from rhetoric to action. Now is the time. \nTanzania assures the entire United Nations membership \nof our wholehearted support and cooperation in this \nprocess. \n We are now almost halfway through the timeline \nof 2015 set for achieving the Millennium Development \nGoals. Yet, we are not halfway in realizing the targets \nas spelt out at the Millennium Summit of 2000. We are \nin this unfortunate state of affairs because the \nadditional resources expected and promised by the \ndeveloped countries have not been delivered. I urge \nthis Assembly to renew its appeal to the developed \nnations to deliver on their promise. \n In this regard, we welcome the initiative \nmentored by the Norwegian Prime Minister, Mr. Jens \nStoltenberg, to launch a global campaign to mobilize \nresources for achieving Goal No. 4 on reducing infant \nmortality rates and Goal No. 5 on reducing maternal \nmortality rates. Tanzania supports the effort and we are \nhappy to be associated with it. I appeal to all Members \nto support the initiative. It is our hope that developed \nnations will support the campaign by providing the \nrequisite resources.  \n In the same vein, we commend Secretary-General \nBan Ki-moon for establishing the MDG Africa Steering \nGroup. Africa is excited about it, and we trust that it \nwill give new impetus in assisting Africa attain the \nMillennium Development Goals.  \n We also welcome the historic decision taken by \nthe President of the General Assembly to convene a \nspecial summit of leaders to discuss the MDGs during \nthis session. We support this wise decision of our \nPresident, for we believe it will provide the needed \nmomentum for the timely achievement of the MDGs in \nAfrica. Tanzania promises to participate actively in this \nimportant meeting.  \n We are happy with the tremendous progress made \nin Burundi. Peace has been restored, and life has come \nback to normal. Tanzania will continue to work with \nthe region and South Africa to ensure the full \noperationalization of the peace agreement signed \nbetween the Burundi Government and the Parti \nLiberation du Peuple Hutu   Forces nationales de \nliberation (PALIPEHUTU-FNL) rebel group.  \n We are concerned with the fluidity of the \nsituation in North Kivu. We hope wisdom will prevail \non the parties concerned to give peace a chance. The \npeople of the Democratic Republic of the Congo \ndeserve peace; they have missed it for too long. We in \nTanzania promise to play whatever part may be \nrequired of us. \n With peace restored in Burundi and many parts of \nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo, it is incumbent \nupon us in the international community to encourage \nand assist refugees to go back to their respective \ncountries. That is what the tripartite commissions, \ninvolving Tanzania, the Office of the United Nations \nHigh Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the \nrespective countries of Burundi and the Democratic \nRepublic of the Congo, have been doing. Our joint \ncommissions have been encouraging the repatriation of \nrefugees on a voluntary basis, and we have been \nassisting those who have come forward. The results are \nencouraging, but things could be better. A word of \nencouragement from the Organization could make a \ndifference. \n Tanzania believes that the return of refugees to \ntheir countries of origin, after peace has been restored, \nis a sovereign right that should not be denied. It is also \nthe ultimate testimony to and guarantor of peace that \nhas been attained. It is not fair   it is not right   for \npeople to continue to live in refugee camps after peace \nhas been restored in their countries of origin. \n The progress currently being made with regard to \nDarfur gives us hope. The adoption of Security Council \nresolution 1769 (2007), on the deployment of a hybrid \nforce from the African Union and the United Nations, \nand the renewed political dialogue among the parties to \nthe conflict hold promise for the stalled peace process \nand for the humanitarian crisis that unfortunately \npersists there. Tanzania applauds the unique \npartnership which has evolved between the African \nUnion and the United Nations. We stand ready to \ncontribute troops to the hybrid force. \n We are encouraged by the recent developments \nwith regard to internal political dialogue in Somalia. \nWe are equally happy with the attention given to \nSomalia by the Security Council and the Secretary-\nGeneral. We welcome the recent Security Council \nresolution 1772 (2007), which supports the political \nprocess in Somalia and the role of the African Union \nMission in Somalia (AMISOM). We commend \nUganda\u2019s contribution of peacekeepers to Somalia and \nthe good work they have been doing so far. As a \nmember of the International Contact Group on \nSomalia, Tanzania promises to continue to be proactive \nand offers to contribute in the training of the Somali \nmilitary. \n The United Nations should remain seized of the \nissue of Western Sahara. Tanzania reaffirms its support \nfor the inalienable right of the Saharawi people to \ndecide and choose the way forward. We urge the \nUnited Nations to intensify its efforts to find an \nhonourable and just solution to this long-standing \ndecolonization issue. \n The crisis inside the Palestinian territories is \nunfortunate; it is a matter of great concern to many of \nus. Tanzania remains supportive of efforts aimed at \ncreating two States, Israel and Palestine, living side by \nside and at peace with each other. This presents, in our \nview, the best hope for sustainable peace in the region. \nWe applaud and welcome the renewed international \ninterest and efforts being expended in line with the \nrelevant United Nations resolutions. \n In conclusion, Tanzania reaffirms its belief in and \ncommitment to multilateralism and the United Nations. \nThe Assembly can count on Tanzania\u2019s continued \nsupport to this Organization and the ideals for which it \nstands. \n"

        "file_text": "I should like to begin by remembering the \nmillions of human beings who are the victims of the \npolicies of colonialism and neo-colonialism. Let us \nremember the victims of the Holocaust. Let us \nremember the victims of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Let \nus remember the victims of slavery and apartheid. Let \nus remember the victims of the wars of occupation of \nViet Nam and Afghanistan, the Dominican Republic, \nGrenada, Panama and Nicaragua. Let us remember the \nheroic and noble Cuban people, who have suffered all \nkinds of aggression and a brutal and inhumane \nblockade. Let us remember the five heroes who are \nprisoners of the empire because they were fighting \nterrorism. Let us remember the victims of the terrorist \nattacks on the World Trade Centre and the millions and \nmillions of men and women who have been and \ncontinue to be victims of the genocide caused by global \ncapitalism. Let us remember the victims of \ndiscrimination and apartheid at the hands of those who \nrefuse to admit into the developed countries, peoples \nwho, in Latin America, are attempting to come into the \nUnited States, and people in Africa and Asia who are \ntrying to go to the European nations. Our thoughts, our \nappreciation and our solidarity go to the victims of \nnatural disasters, who are at the same time victims of \nglobal imperialist capitalism, which, through its \ndevelopment-oriented policy continues to bring \ndestruction, death and poverty, becoming the greatest \naggressor of mother Earth, now destroyed by the \navarice of imperialist capitalism. \n Let us remember the recent victims of natural \noccurrences triggered by these spoliations resulting \nfrom imperialist global capitalism: the victims of \nHurricane Katrina, the victims of the earthquake in \nPeru, the victims of the floods in Africa, the victims \namong the indigenous peoples   the Miskito and \nMayan peoples   of Hurricane Felix, in Central \nAmerica, Latin America and the Caribbean and the \nland of Sandino and Rub\u00e9n Dar\u00edo. Our brothers and \nsisters in the Miskito and Mayan peoples who achieved \nautonomy in 1987 and who, today, are part of a process \nwhereby their full rights will be recognized, under the \nAutonomy Act, have asked me to express their \nappreciation to the United Nations because that battle \nhas been going on for more than 20 years and now we \nare beginning to recognize the rights of indigenous \npeoples. They have asked me to circulate here, in the \nUnited Nations, a document signed by our brothers, the \nleaders of the Miskito and Mayan peoples, \nAfrodescendant peoples, victims of Hurricane Felix, so \nthat it may be seen by you all, our brothers and sisters \nwho represent the peoples of the world. \n In the period from 1979 to 1989, I had the \nopportunity to speak before the United Nations General \nAssembly, and I remember well the speeches and \nmessages and positions from that time. Eighteen years \nhave gone by, and thanks to the unending struggle of \nthe Sandinist people, I am here again today to address \nthese words to the Assembly. This morning, when this \ngeneral debate began, I listened carefully to the words \nof the second speaker, who spoke for exactly \n20 minutes   and I myself hope not to exceed \n20 minutes   and I cannot find any difference between \nthe thoughts, words and actions of those who, at the \ntime, were at the helm of that imperialist power, and \nthe speech that I heard this morning. \n The presidents of the United States change, and \nthey may come to office with the best intentions and \nmay feel that they are doing good for humanity. But \nthey fail to understand that they are no more than the \ninstruments of yet another empire among the many \nempires that have imposed themselves on our planet, \nand they forget that the life of empires is ephemeral. \nThey rise, they grow arrogant and mighty and then \nbegin to dictate as if they were gods   telling people \nwhat is good and bad, determining how they provide \nwhat they call assistance   which is no more than \npaying back the historical debt they owe to our \npeoples. What they are doing is simply responding to \nempire, to the politics of Empire and for that reason we \nshould not be surprised that not only are we hearing the \nsame speeches all over again, but also that we are \nseeing the same conditions of oppression and violence \nand terror being suffered by humanity. And today, we \nare more threatened than we were 18 years ago when I \nlast had the opportunity to speak before the United \nNations. \n Today, under the tyranny of global imperialist \ncapitalism, there is an international economic order, of \ncourse there is, but who dictates that international \neconomic order? It is dictated by a minority of \ndictators who impose their interests, the same old \ninterests. They are the ones who enslaved Africans and \nenslaved and oppressed our indigenous forefathers. \nThey are the ones who wiped out the original peoples \nof the United States. Then immigrants from Europe \ncame over here and unperturbedly   by what right?   \nbegan to mix with those people, and to become in turn, \nowners of what did not belong to them. They robbed \nthe original peoples of their rights and their cultures \nand imposed their culture and the interests of the \ncolonizers. That is what gave rise to what we call today \nthe most exemplary democracy in the world, when \nreally, it is a tyranny   the biggest, most \noverwhelming dictatorship that has ever existed \nthroughout the history of humanity. \n I am referring to the tyranny of the United States \nempire. If anyone has doubts, let us see how its \nPresident spoke to us this morning. He spoke of Cuba \nwith a complete lack of respect while representing a \nsystem that ordered the assassination of its President, \nour dear brother Fidel Castro, whom we had for his \nextraordinary solidarity, firmness and principled \nconsistency in his struggle for the cause of humankind. \nThey have maintained a brutal blockade against \nCuba, while for interests of State, they set aside their \nso-called democratic principles when, for economic \nreasons, they act together with other nations with \nwhich they supposedly have ideological differences: \ncapital unites them and ideological differences \ndisappear.  \n On what authority and by what right does he \nquestion the right of the peoples of Iran and the \nDemocratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea to nuclear \ndevelopment for peaceful purposes? And even if they \nwanted to use nuclear power for military purposes, on \nwhose authority and by what right does the only State \nin history to have dropped atomic bombs on innocent \npeople, as it did on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, condemn \nthe people of Iran, who are working to develop nuclear \nenergy for peaceful purposes? They have decided that \nthis is not for peaceful purposes, but who gave them \nthat right? They gave it to themselves, and they are \nimposing that on the General Assembly, and the \nAssembly is simply a reflection of the realities of a \nworld where a capitalist and imperialist minority is \nimposing global capitalism and establishing an order to \nexploit, repress, impoverish, enslave and impose \napartheid against Latin American migrants and against \nAfrican migrants in Europe. Global capitalism has only \none head, but it has tentacles everywhere.  \n On what authority can the country that possesses \nthe greatest nuclear arsenal in the world, or any other \ncountry possessing nuclear weapons, come here and \nseek to question the rights of other countries to the \npeaceful development of nuclear energy? What moral \nauthority do they have to question the right of any \npeople to develop nuclear energy for peaceful or even \nfor military purposes?  \n Objectively, this is not the best path for \nhumankind. The best path for humankind is for nuclear \nweapons to disappear altogether. If the United States, \nits people and its Presidents   and I do not want to \nsingle out any individual President or leader of an \nempire; an empire is an empire, and it does not matter \nwho is heading the empire, whether they call \nthemselves Democrat or Republican   really want to \ndemonstrate their commitment to putting an end to the \nthreat of nuclear energy being used for military \npurposes, then they have to be the first to move \ntowards a policy of nuclear disarmament, a policy that \nshould encompass all those that possess nuclear \nweapons. Then they would have the moral authority to \nsay that no people in the world should devote resources \nto developing nuclear technology for military purposes. \nThen, all nations would have the possibility and the \nright to opt for nuclear energy for peaceful purposes   \nan option that they would seek to deny to developing \npeoples. \n Eighteen years ago, from this very rostrum, I \nspoke of the Palestinian issue. The Palestinian people \nendure an ongoing bloody conflict with a country that \npossesses nuclear weapons and that is entrenched in \nthe historic territory of the Palestinian people.  \n Eighteen years ago we spoke of the people of \nPuerto Rico, a nation which is still fighting for its \nindependence. The United States continues \nunambiguously to pursue its neo-colonial policies, \ncombining the most advanced and modern forms of \ndomination with the most retrograde forms of \ndomination, such as its military base in Guant\u00e1namo.  \n Eighteen years ago we spoke of armament, and \nnothing has changed. Eighteen years ago we spoke of \nwar, and today things look much worse because of the \nbrutal war imposed by the empire and by its economic \nand oil interests. They thought it would be easy to \noccupy Iraq and Afghanistan, but they have met with \nresistance from those peoples. It was an invasion \nlaunched on the basis of a campaign of lies: it was \nuncertain that Iraq was in a position to produce nuclear \nweapons.  \n So what can I conclude? I can conclude that the \nenemy is still the same after these 18 years: here I am \nagain in the United Nations, and the enemy is still the \nsame. \n The enemy is called global imperialist capitalism \nand it is only we, the people, who can change things. \nPeoples that have attained liberation were not given it \nby those that enslaved them, but rather thanks to their \nown struggle and the blood they shed, for example in \nSouth Africa\u2019s independence struggle. How many years \nof disgrace, suffering, slavery and apartheid did they \nendure in South Africa? That story is true for the whole \nof the African continent. Those peoples achieved their \nfreedom despite modern colonialists consistently trying \nto sustain these forms of occupation. To be sure, they \nhave adopted new forms of occupation and domination. \n The liberation of our peoples is not guaranteed. \nOur peoples must continue to give battle. The unity of \nour peoples is the key: the unity of the Latin American \npeoples, the Central American peoples and the \nCaribbean peoples under the Bolivarian Alternative for \nthe Americas (ALBA). They are trying to repeat the \nkind of action taken against Venezuela, when a \ndemocratically elected president was faced with a \nmilitary coup. They are trying to repeat the history of \nSalvador Allende, the history of Chile. But the United \nNations was not convened to say what barbarity had \ntaken place. Yet what had happened in Venezuela \nneeded to be condemned, because the Government had \nbeen democratically elected. But no: in fact, the \nimperialist Power moved immediately to recognize the \nleaders of the coup. It was the Venezuelan people who \nrose up to return the elected President to his place. \nThus, it is the people who decide their own fate.  \n Hence, we can all be full of the best intentions \nabout changing the United Nations. I do not doubt that \neven representatives of countries that espouse global \ncapitalism and imperialism come here with the best of \nintentions   some of them. But they lose sight of the \nfact that they are continuing their handout proposals \nand approaches   for these are indeed handouts. When \nthey talk about aid, they are insulting us. They have to \nunderstand that once and for all. They have profited \nfrom the privatization carried out in developing \ncountries by the huge multinational corporations. They \nsay that they come to help us. What businessman \ncomes to help? When a businessman invests, he invests \nin order to make the biggest profit he can: not to invest \nin the country, but rather to take away, because we \ndeveloping countries are considered to be insecure. In \nshort, we are the victims of a ransacking. \n Compare the volume of the wealth that the \ncapitalist and developed countries are currently \nextracting from our countries, the developing \ncountries, through their big companies and \nmultinational corporations with what Latin American \nimmigrants send back to their families from the United \nStates or what Asian and African immigrants in Europe \nsend back to their families: the latter really is a \nmiserable amount compared to the volume of wealth \nthat is being plundered on a daily basis by these \ninstitutionalized forms of oppression.  \n However, immigrants working in the United \nStates or in Europe work harder than anyone else. They \nare doing jobs that neither Europeans nor Americans \nwant to do, and for miserable wages. So who is doing \nwhom a favour? Indeed, nobody is doing any favours \nfor the Latin Americans who find work in the United \nStates and who manage to put aside a bit of money so \nthey can send $100 or $200 back to their families, \ncompared to the plundering by big businesses, which \ngo to developing countries not only to reap enormous \nprofits, but also to take advantage of cheap labour and \nthe conditionalities imposed by free trade agreements. \nHuman beings, societies and nations are all clashing \nwith free trade, and it remains to be seen who is the \nstrongest. Logically, it will be the strongest who \nprevail. Free trade is the law of the jungle. \n What the world needs is fair trade. What the \nworld demands is genuine change in the capitalist, \nglobalized, imperialist countries. They have to change \ntheir concept of a free market; they have to exchange \nthe concept of free trade for that of fair trade and a fair \ninternational market. Solving this problem is not a \nquestion of reducing subsidies because plainly the \ndisparities are so enormous that that is impossible. This \nproblem will never be resolved piecemeal but through \nprofoundly radical change leading to the \ndemocratization of the minority on planet Earth who \nown the wealth, own the nuclear weapons, impose their \npolicies on the Assembly and go over the heads of the \nSecurity Council. They impose their own laws, which \nare now solidly entrenched, and they have no respect \nfor humanity. It is only by changing the policy within \nthose peoples, within those nations, within those \nGovernments that we can really obtain the fair world \nthat we are all talking about. For we all talk about a \njust world. We all talk about a peaceful world. We all \ntalk about a world of brotherly love and solidarity. But \nthere is a wide gap between words and deeds. \n Dear brothers and sisters, please accept the \ngreetings of the people of Nicaragua, a fighting people, \na people that has suffered interference from the empire \nsince 1856   before the triumph of the October \nRevolution, the great Lenin revolution. Before the \nEast-West conflict had begun, Nicaragua was already \nsuffering from the expansionist policies of empire; \nalready we had to take arms to defend ourselves \nagainst those who wanted to trample upon us and \nimpose Yankee presidents.  \n Dear brothers and sisters, we ask you to pass on \nto your peoples our belief   our certainty   that \ntoday, more than ever, there exist conditions for unity \namong the Latin American and Caribbean peoples. We \nare seeing growing unity among the African peoples. \nThe unity of the Asian peoples must grow as well, but \nfree from global capitalism. What good is speaking \nabout socialism if what we are actually building is \ncapitalism and if we are just creating a holy alliance \nwith global capitalism and imperialism? We have to \nbuild this great unity in Africa, in Asia   and in Latin \nAmerica, where we are marching with the same \nstrength, the same vigour and the same living \nprinciples that were those of the African fighters like \nLumumba and Sekou Tour\u00e9; the principles of the Latin \nAmerican fighters; the principles of the North \nAmerican fighters, the United States fighters; the \nprinciples of the European fighters; the principles of \nthe Latin America of Bol\u00edvar, of Mart\u00ed, of Sandino, of \nTupac Katari, of Tupac Amaru. Those principles still \nlive and will live as long as these forms of oppression \npersist. \n I have faith in God and the certainty that, just as \npeoples, despite so much oppression and destruction, \nhave not surrendered or sold out, today, more than ever \nbefore, peoples should rise up with pride and firmness \nand dignity. They are not going to sell out and they are \nnot going to surrender to the global capitalist empire. \n"

        "file_text": "Allow me,  Sir, to congratulate you on your election as President \nof the General Assembly at its sixty-second session. I \nbelieve that, under your presidency, this Organization \nwill make further progress in its reforms, enabling it to \nrespond promptly to the challenges faced by the \ninternational community. \n From the outset, I would like to thank your \npredecessor, Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa, for her \nefforts in performing the challenging tasks on the \nagenda of the sixty-first session of the General \nAssembly. \n The Slovak Republic fully aligns itself with the \nstatement delivered by the representative of Portugal \non behalf of the European Union. In addition, I wish to \nmake a contribution to the general debate on behalf of \nthe Slovak Republic. \n In spite of notable progress in some areas, the \nSlovak Republic is not satisfied with the current pace \nand scope of the United Nations reform process. We \nthink it necessary to make the work of newly created \nstructures and institutions more dynamic and to prepare \nthe United Nations to ensure the targeted prevention \nand solution of concrete problems and conflicts. \n We appreciate the establishment of the \nPeacebuilding Commission. We hope that it will \nbecome a pivotal tool in post-conflict stabilization. It \nshould give the international community a vehicle for \nsolving issues that extends the scope of crisis \nmanagement. \n Slovakia also encourages efforts towards overall \nreform in the system of human rights protection. We \nhave welcomed the commencement of work by the \nHuman Rights Council and recognize its primary \nresponsibility for promoting universal respect for the \nprotection of human rights and fundamental freedoms. \nWithin the ongoing process of institutional changes, we \nexpect the Council to effectively enforce its mandate \npursuant to resolution 60/251. The Slovak Republic \nendorses the concept of protecting and promoting \nhuman rights at the national and international levels. In \nthat context, we are prepared to assume our share of \nresponsibility. We will be honoured to receive the \nsupport of other United Nations Member States for the \ncandidacy of the Slovak Republic to the Human Rights \nCouncil for 2008-2011 in the election scheduled for \nspring 2008. \n The Slovak Republic appreciates the measures \ndesigned to reform the Secretariat. We support the \nmodernization of the Secretariat\u2019s management system \nso that it can flexibly respond to current needs and \nchallenges, and the strengthening of its accountability \nfor the implementation of its tasks. As a country \nparticipating in several United Nations-led \npeacekeeping missions, we have also expressed our \nsupport for the restructuring of the Department of \nPeacekeeping Operations. \n United Nations reform cannot be complete \nwithout also reforming the structure and working \nmethods of the Security Council. Slovakia has been \nactively engaged in this reform effort during the term \nas a non-permanent member of the Security Council. \nThe membership of that United Nations body should \nreflect the changed geopolitical reality. The number of \nboth permanent and non-permanent Council members \nshould increase and the Global South countries should \nacquire more seats. Germany and Japan have our \nexplicit support in their ambition to become new \npermanent members of the Council. As a small country, \nwe also support those proposals for the non-permanent \nmembership category that would restrict countries from \nso-called \u201cflip-flopping\u201d between categories.  \n Nor may the General Assembly evade the reform \neffort. It is necessary to strengthen its role and \nauthority by focusing the Assembly\u2019s attention on real \nand acute problems of the current world. The Assembly \nshould also create mechanisms that would allow for the \nmonitoring of the implementation of its decisions and \nat the same time provide for the elimination of \noutdated measures that overburden its work.  \n Thought should also be given to the \nrepresentativeness of the bodies established by the \nGeneral Assembly. Slovakia, as a member of the Group \nof Eastern European States, appreciates the election of \nMr. Srgjan Kerim as President of the Assembly at its \nsixty-second session. At the same time, it should be \nemphasized that the Eastern European Group is the \nmost dynamically growing regional group in the \nGeneral Assembly, yet its representation in managerial \npositions in the Secretariat and in United Nations \nbodies does not reflect that situation. A prime example \nof the situation is the fact that this year not one of the \nAssembly's Vice-Presidents is from the regional group \nof which the Slovak Republic is a member. \n Besides the efforts aimed at reforming the United \nNations, the Slovak Republic wishes to pay special \nattention to the issue of security sector reform during \nthe sixty-second session. We believe that insufficient \nreform or lack of reform in the security sector is often \na source or catalyst of conflicts, or even causes post-\nconflict countries to lapse back to a conflict state. It \nshould also be borne in mind that a well-governed \nsecurity sector should, above all, ensure human \nsecurity, which represents the foundation for the \nstability, good governance and, ultimately, \ndevelopment of a country. \n We are expecting a comprehensive report by the \nSecretary-General on security sector reform, which \nshould become the basis of a more in-depth discussion \non this issue within the United Nations. Therefore, \nSlovakia has decided to initiate a thematic discussion \non security sector reform during the sixty-second \nsession. \n The Slovak Republic also expects the sixty-\nsecond session to revitalize the discussion on \ndisarmament and non-proliferation of weapons of mass \ndestruction. Slovakia has had an opportunity to \ncontribute to these efforts through its chairmanship of \nthe Security Council Committee established pursuant \nto resolution 1540 (2004). In this context, in February \n2007 Slovakia also initiated an open debate in the \nSecurity Council on non-proliferation of weapons of \nmass destruction. \n The destructive potential of weapons of mass \ndestruction increases along with the growing threat of \ninternational terrorism. We therefore also wish to pay \nspecial attention to this threat to international peace \nand security. The United Nations Global Counter-\nTerrorism Strategy adopted by the General Assembly \nlast year (resolution 60/288) provided for wide-ranging \ninternational cooperation in this field. \n The Slovak Republic pays due attention to the \neconomic and social aspects of the United Nations, \nwhere we wish to engage even more actively. In 2003, \nwe submitted our candidacy for membership in the \nEconomic and Social Council for the years 2010 to \n2012. We will be pleased to receive support from other \nMember States for our candidacy. \n As a new development aid donor, we want to \nfacilitate more effective cooperation with both \nbeneficiary and donor countries, integrate the work of \ninternational agencies and make more efficient use of \nthe existing United Nations capacities in this area. We \nwish to pay special attention to the development of \npost-conflict regions, which currently receive the \nlargest portion of development aid. We believe that \nthere will be room in the Economic and Social Council \nfor Slovakia to utilize its experience in the field of \nsecurity sector reform in the joint work with other \nbodies of the United Nations system. \n Over the past two years, Slovakia has worked for \nthe first time as a member of the Security Council. \nWhen adopting our decisions on the sensitive problems \nof the modern world, we took into consideration the \npeculiarities of individual cases, yet at the same time, \nwe sought to promote the value system of a member of \nthe European and trans-Atlantic community. Slovakia \nwill continue to work within the United Nations in this \nsame spirit, even after the completion of its current \nterm in the Security Council. We also wish to make \ngood use of the experience we have gained in our work \nin other United Nations bodies. \n The Slovak Republic is frustrated that no solution \nto the Kosovo issue has yet been found. In our opinion, \nKosovo must not thwart the unification of European \nnations nor set a negative precedent in terms of \ninternational law. \n It is with hope that we view the adoption of \nSecurity Council resolution 1769 (2007), granting a \nmandate for the deployment of a joint African Union-\nUnited Nations peacekeeping operation in Darfur. This \nunprecedented decision has moved the cooperation \nbetween the United Nations and regional organizations \nto a new level. \n With regard to the Middle East issue, Slovakia \nendorses a peaceful, fair and permanent solution to the \nIsraeli-Palestinian conflict. The talks should result in \nthe establishment of a viable Palestinian State that will \ncoexist with Israel in an atmosphere of perpetual peace \nand security. In this context, we appreciate the \nresumption of dialogue between Israel and Palestine \nand the measures taken in this respect by the Quartet. \n It has been seven years since our Millennium \nsession, when we discussed our vision for the future of \nlife on our planet. It has been neither seven rich nor \nseven poor years. The United Nations has made some \nprogress. On the other hand, it has failed to cope with \nmany challenges. We must do better together to make \nthe future score fall more in favour of the United \nNations. \n"

        "file_text": "I wish  to express to Mr. Srgjan Kerim, President of the \nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-second session, Papua \nNew Guinea\u2019s congratulations on his election. We \nassure him of my country\u2019s full cooperation during his \npresidency. We compliment his predecessor, Her \nExcellency Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa, for her \nstewardship of our work during her tenure, and we \nwish her well in her future endeavours. \n I would like to express our support to the \nSecretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon, \nfor his leadership of the United Nations. Let me thank \nhim, in particular, for his courage and strong leadership \non the issue of climate change. By the same token, I \nwould also like to thank the staff of the Secretariat and \nall United Nations agencies who continue to give \nvaluable service to my country, Papua New Guinea. \n On 18 September 2007, two days after \ncelebrating 32 years of independence, Papua New \nGuinea convened its eighth National Parliament. This \nwas a result of another successful general election. \nDemocracy is a challenge, but Papua New Guinea \ncontinues to thrive under it. My country of more than \n800 tribes and languages continues to find in the \ndemocratic principles the binding force and unity in \ndiversity in the 32 years of unbroken democracy. \n Papua New Guinea remains committed to the \nprinciples and purposes of the United Nations. We \nagree with the President that we must continue to work \nwith common purpose to renew, modernize and \nstrengthen this Organization so it can rise to the \nchallenges of the twenty-first century. \n The increasing incidence of human atrocities, \ngenocide and war, poverty, terrorism, HIV/AIDS, the \nresurgence of malaria and tuberculosis, the \nproliferation of small arms and light weapons, drug and \nhuman smuggling, environmental degradation and \nclimate change are issues that, we believe, the United \nNations is best placed to address. \n Again we agree with the President that global \nchallenges demand multilateral solutions. The United \nNations is the appropriate multilateral forum to take \nsuch action. That is why the revitalization of the \nGeneral Assembly deserves our highest attention. To \nrevitalize the Assembly is also to renew our faith in \neach other and in our common values and destiny. \n We strongly endorse the President\u2019s five priority \nissues of climate change, financing for development, \nachieving the Millennium Development Goals \n(MDGs), countering terrorism, and the United Nations \nreform agenda. To complement efforts in other forums, \nPapua New Guinea with other countries of the Pacific \nregion has agreed to pool our limited resources under \nthe Pacific Plan, in order to address, as the basis of our \ncooperation, many of these same issues, in particular, \nsustainable development, climatic change and regional \nintegration. \n Let me turn now to an issue which my country \nfeels strongly about: climate change. To be clear, we \nare very concerned to see certain industrialized nations \nattempting to avoid responsibility for their own carbon \nemissions and shifting the focus to developing nations. \nOnly after industrialized nations take responsibility for \nthe consequences of their own actions will the pathway \nbecome clear for lasting solutions. \n However, as developing countries, we are willing \nto contribute equitably towards a sustainable future. \nDuring my earlier statements at the high-level event on \nclimate change, I put forward key principles needed to \nguide future international agreements on climate \nchange after the year 2012. \n The time for leadership is now. If we are to defeat \nthis self-inflicted calamity, we must succeed in six key \nareas: we must construct a shared vision for lower \nglobal greenhouse gas concentrations; we must \naggressively deepen reduction commitments by \nindustrialized countries; we must create more \nmechanisms to provide positive incentives for \ndeveloping countries; we must launch a global \nframework to reduce emissions from deforestation and \ndegradation; we must scale up adaptation financing for \nfuture generations; and we must mobilize sufficient \nand sustainable resources to support positive incentives \nand adaptation. \n The science is clear. Our planet is in distress. As \nco-inhabitants of this world, we all must address the \nroot causes of the problem. To succeed, leadership is \nrequired on both sides of the economic divide. \nTogether, and only together, we can grasp the \nchallenges before us and construct a sustainable future. \n Papua New Guinea supports the ongoing reforms \nin the United Nations Secretariat. In order to \nstrengthen it to better address some of the key \nchallenges facing the membership, reform should \nreflect the geopolitical, economic and social realities of \ntoday, taking into particular account the different levels \nof development facing the membership. Above all, the \nreform must be fair and equitable. \n Global trade today is uneven and characterized \nmore by unfair trade practices by those already holding \ndecided advantages than by the opportunities it offers \nto developing countries like Papua New Guinea. Our \nefforts to develop a more equitable trading order are \nhampered by the reluctance of our developed partners \nto open their economies and engage in genuine \ndevelopment discussions. \n The Doha Round of negotiations are at a critical \njuncture. We need to collectively ensure that those \nnegotiations are revived so that different trade needs of \nits members are addressed. \n Papua New Guinea has moved forward from an \nexport-driven economic growth strategy to a policy of \neconomic consolidation and empowerment. Its core \npolicy objective is to provide every Papua New \nGuinean equal opportunity to build home, community \nand country. To achieve this, strong emphasis will be \nplaced on agriculture, which has always been the \nmainstay of our rural populace. Along with this aim, \nrelevant infrastructure will be built to support that \nimportant sector. \n The country\u2019s five-year medium-term development \nstrategy is being reviewed to strengthen its alignment \nwith the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). \nAchieving the MDGs by 2015 is a challenge that \nrequires our collective input in its implementation. \n We call on development partners, including the \nUnited Nations, to play a supportive role in \nimplementing and sustaining these activities. That can \nbe done through fair trade opportunities, equitable \nmarkets, increased foreign investment, transfer of \ntechnology, capacity-building and providing quality \noverseas development assistance. \n The HIV/AIDS pandemic is a serious threat to \nsocial and economic security in many of our countries. \nGreater efforts must be made to arrest it. In Papua New \nGuinea, my Government has passed HIV/AIDS \nlegislation underpinned by a comprehensive HIV/AIDS \npolicy framework. We consider HIV/AIDS to be a \ndevelopment issue and deal with it separately from \nother health issues. But our experience suggests that \nnational action alone is not enough. A concerted global \nresponse is required. HIV/AIDS is a threat that must be \naddressed on all fronts and by all countries. We thank \nthe United Nations and its related agencies for their \nefforts in addressing HIV/AIDS. We also thank former \nPresident of the United States, Mr. Bill Clinton, for his \ncontribution to this work in my country.  \n Of equal importance are the battles against \nmalaria, tuberculosis and other preventable diseases. \nWhile, as a global community, we have focused on \nHIV/AIDS and avian flu, little attention is given to \nmalaria, which remains the biggest killer disease in my \ncountry. We therefore thank Mr. Bill Gates for \nassistance given to research work on malaria in Papua \nNew Guinea. We call upon development partners to \nsupport Papua New Guinea and other countries in \naddressing these challenges. \n Despite many United Nations resolutions, the \nconflict in the Middle East remains unresolved. Papua \nNew Guinea appeals to all parties to the conflict, \nincluding those Powers that have the capacity to \ninfluence a positive outcome, to make the necessary \nconcessions for a peaceful resolution to this long-\nstanding issue. We appeal to all parties to make full use \nof the dispute-settlement procedures of the United \nNations. \n The work of the Special Committee on \nDecolonization remains unfinished. There are still 16 \nNon-Self-Governing Territories   some in the \nPacific   that have yet to exercise their right to self-\ndetermination. The forthcoming referendum in Tokelau \ndemonstrates once again the true spirit of cooperation \nbetween Tokelau and New Zealand. We congratulate \nboth Governments and assure the people of Tokelau of \nour respect for their ultimate decision. In the same \nvein, we hope that other Administering Powers will \nfollow the example of New Zealand and assist other \nterritories reach a decision of their choice. \n While our world today provides untold \nopportunities, we are at the same time faced with many \ncomplex challenges. We must renew our commitment \nto and faith in the United Nations and seek to reform it \nin ways that are reflective of the realities of today. \nThirty-two years ago, when I brought my nation to take \nits seat in the General Assembly, I said, and wish to \nreaffirm today, that, within the limits of our resources, \nPapua New Guinea will play an active and positive role \nin the United Nations. That commitment remains. \n"

        "file_text": "It gives me great pleasure to \nexpress, on behalf of the delegation of the United Arab \nEmirates, our sincere congratulations to you, Sir, and \nto your friendly country on your election as President \nof the General Assembly at its sixty-second session. \nWe look forward to working closely with you as you \nseek to successfully discharge your mission. \n I would also like to express our appreciation to \nyour predecessor, Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa, for \nher remarkable achievements during her presidency at \nthe sixty-first session of the General Assembly, in \nparticular her efforts to stimulate more active debate \namong cultures. \n I also take this opportunity to express our \nwarmest greetings to His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon, \nthe Secretary-General, and to note our appreciation of \nthe initiatives he has taken to promote the role of the \nUnited Nations since assuming his post. \n Our world still suffers from a wide range of \nregional and international issues, conflicts and threats, \nmost visible among which are the worldwide spread of \npoverty and epidemics, the degradation of the \nenvironment, terrorism, organized crime, the spread of \nextremism and violations of human rights, and attempts \nto obtain nuclear weapons. This should prompt us to \nmake sincere and determined efforts to implement the \nrecommendations, decisions and plans of action \napproved by the world\u2019s leaders and by the United \nNations. \n Given its interest in and commitment to the \nprinciple of good-neighbourly relations, as well as its \nrespect for the national sovereignty of other States, the \nUnited Arab Emirates would like to draw attention to \nthe fact that, thus far, no progress whatsoever has been \nmade on the issue of the Iranian occupation since 1971 \nof three islands belonging to the United Arab Emirates: \nthe Greater Tunb, the Lesser Tunb and Abu Musa. This \nis despite the consistent efforts expended and the \npositive peaceful initiatives taken by my country, \nwhich wants this issue settled by peaceful means, \neither through bilateral and unconditioned negotiations \nor by referral of the issue to the International Court of \nJustice for legal arbitration. \n Severe conflict has sorely wounded our region, \nand quick and effective treatment is required. As for \nIraq, we express our firm belief that all should abstain \nfrom interference in Iraq\u2019s internal affairs and should \nshow respect for the national sovereignty and territorial \nintegrity of Iraq. This requires that all parties should \ncooperate to bring to an end the cycle of violence and \nthe inflaming of passions, and it calls for partition and \ndivision. Let us give our support to an Iraqi \nGovernment that truly works to achieve national \nreconciliation. The United Arab Emirates renews its \nencouragement for the efforts made to promote \nreconstruction in Iraq. \n Regarding the Middle East crisis, we call on the \nUnited Nations, and the Security Council in particular, \nto play a more active role, together with the Middle \nEast Quartet, to give new momentum to the Middle \nEast peace process. We stress that no solution to the \nArab-Israeli conflict is possible without Israel\u2019s \nacceptance of the Arab Peace Initiative, which is based \non the relevant United Nations resolutions and offers a \nbalanced and comprehensive solution to this long-\nstanding conflict. \n In this context, we are following with interest the \nefforts to convene the international peace conference \nfor the Middle East later this year with the \nparticipation of all concerned parties. We look forward \nto a balanced and fair settlement of the issue on the \nbasis of the Arab Peace Initiative, the United Nations \nSecurity Council resolutions, and the rules of \ninternational legitimacy. We also renew our support for \nSyria\u2019s right to regain its full sovereignty over the \noccupied Golan Heights. \n We note with satisfaction the United Nations role \nin restoring security and stability in Lebanon, thanks to \nthe pressure put on Israel to fulfil its legal obligations \nunder Security Council resolution 1701 (2006), \nincluding respect for Lebanon\u2019s sovereignty, \nwithdrawal from the Shaba\u2019a farmlands and the village \nof al-Ghajar and the handing over of detailed maps and \ncoordinates of the landmines that Israel planted in \nsouthern Lebanon. \n We reaffirm our support for the reconstruction \nefforts and for the stability and territorial integrity of \nLebanon as well as for the maintenance of its \nconstitutional institutions. In this respect, the United \nArab Emirates has undertaken a number of \nreconstruction projects in Lebanon and has provided \nhumanitarian assistance. The United Arab Emirates \ncollaborates closely with the Lebanese Government \nand the United Nations to remove mines and \nunexploded ordnance, this work having originally \ncommenced as part of an initiative taken by the United \nArab Emirates in 2001, when my Government provided \ninitial funding of $50 million. \n We hope that talks between Iran and the \nInternational Atomic Energy Agency will eventually \nlead to a permanent, peaceful solution that will spare \nthe region further tensions and conflicts and will help \nto reassure countries in the region that they will not be \nfaced with any threats to their security. We stress again \nthat Israel should not be excluded from the terms of the \nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. \n The United Arab Emirates continues to cooperate \nfully with all efforts to combat all forms of terrorism, \nincluding associated money-laundering. We also \nemphasize the importance of promoting dialogue \namong cultures and civilizations and of enhancing \ntolerance among religions. \n The United Arab Emirates contributes generously \nto the financing of development projects in some \n95 States. Such assistance has exceeded $70 billion and \nis intended to promote a culture of peace and stability \nin those countries and throughout the world. Consistent \nwith that approach, the United Arab Emirates has \ncreated a number of institutions, including the Abu \nDhabi Fund for Development, the Zayed Charitable \nand Humanitarian Foundation, the Khalifa bin Zayed \nFoundation for Charitable Work and the Mohammed \nbin Rashid Al Maktoum Charity, which recently \nlaunched the \u201cDubai Cares\u201d charity campaign, which \nseeks to guarantee education for 1 million children \naround the world, especially in Asia and Africa. \n Since its creation in 1971, the United Arab \nEmirates has achieved economic, social and cultural \nprogress that has helped to establish stability and well-\nbeing for citizens of the Emirates and job opportunities \nfor the millions who work in our country. \n We have also launched an interim political reform \nplan, in whose first phase half of the members of the \nFederal National Council were elected as an important \nstep towards political participation. In this context, I \nshould also like to make reference to the significant \nnational gains that have been made by women in the \nUnited Arab Emirates. Two women sit in the Council \nof Ministers, and women hold approximately a quarter \nof the seats in the Federal National Council. They are \nalso represented in the judiciary and in other senior \nleadership and decision-making positions. \n In the context of its national, regional and \ninternational efforts and cooperation, the United Arab \nEmirates has enacted laws to counter terrorist crimes \nand money-laundering and has frozen many suspect \nbank and corporate accounts. It has also enacted laws \non issues such as human trafficking and international \njudicial cooperation on criminal matters, and has \nadopted import and export control procedures for a \nrange of commodities. \nIn its desire for educational and cultural contact \nwith the rest of the world, the United Arab Emirates \nhas launched a number of initiatives, including the \n$2-million Sheikh Zayed Book Award, designed to \nmotivate creative writers and intellectuals to make \ncontributions in all spheres of the humanities. \n As part of our efforts to bring the experience of \nthe world\u2019s most prestigious universities to the United \nArab Emirates, we have recently launched the Paris-\nSorbonne University Abu Dhabi and have inaugurated \nthe Emirates Foundation to raise our educational, \ntechnological, intellectual and research resources to the \nhighest global levels. Further underlining our belief in \nthe importance of cultural communication among the \nworld\u2019s peoples for the preservation of the historical \nheritage of human civilization, we have agreed to build \ntwo world-class satellite museums in the United Arab \nEmirates: the Louvre Abu Dhabi and the Guggenheim \nAbu Dhabi. \n The United Arab Emirates prides itself on being \nhome for people of all religions, ethnicities, cultures \nand countries from all continents. Indeed, the number \nof countries represented in the Emirates exceeds the \ntotal membership of the United Nations. All these \npeople live in the Emirates in harmony, forming a \nmodel for what the modern world should be like. \n In compliance with its obligations under \ninternational human rights and labour treaties, the \nUnited Arab Emirates has enacted legislation to \nguarantee the full rights of its expatriate workforce in \naccordance with relevant national and international \nlaws and treaties. I affirm here that the relevant \nauthorities in the United Arab Emirates are determined \nthat these laws and treaties should be fully \nimplemented so as to protect workers and provide them \nwith the best working and living conditions. \n Finally, we hope that our deliberations on the \nurgent international issues on the agenda of the current \nsixty-second session of the General Assembly will \ncontinue in a spirit of solidarity and will lead to \npositive steps towards the eventual fulfilment of our \naspiration to peace, development and prosperity for our \nworld and its peoples. \n"

        "file_text": "Please  accept our warm congratulations, Sir, on your well-\ndeserved election to the presidency of our Assembly. \nWe are convinced that you possess all the necessary \nqualities for the sound direction of our work. My \ncountry assures you of its support as you carry out your \nimportant task.  \n We also wish to convey our gratitude to your \npredecessor, Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa, for the \nefficiency with which she guided the work of our \nsixty-first session. I also wish to pay a well-deserved \ntribute to our Secretary-General, His Excellency \nMr. Ban Ki-moon, who has been constantly playing a \nsignificant role since his election in advancing the \nideals of our Organization.  \n One important event has caught the attention of \nChad. On 25 September, the Security Council adopted \nunanimously resolution 1778 (2007) authorizing an \ninternational operation on the eastern border of Chad \nand the north-east border of the Central African \nRepublic. That operation   and we should stress the \ndefensive nature of its mandate: the protection of \nrefugees, displaced persons, civilian populations and \nhumanitarian workers   is something that in Chad we \nare very satisfied to see since it will lighten the heavy \nburden borne thus far by the Chadian local police since \nthe beginning of the crisis in Darfur.  \n Chad also wishes to thank the Office of the \nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and \nthe friendly countries who have supported the local \nChadian police. At this point, I wish also to pay tribute \nto their courage and dedication because they did their \nbest in order to accomplish their sensitive and \ndangerous mission.  \n The new operation will be able to rely on the \navailability and cooperation of Chadian authorities. We \nventure to hope that it will stabilize and create \nconditions for the reconstruction of the eastern part of \nour country, which has been destroyed by incursions of \nthe Janjaweed militias from the Sudan and other armed \ngroups from Darfur. It will also especially require that \nthe Chadian displaced persons, who have so far been \nneglected by the international community, be \nreinstalled in their original localities.  \n Above and beyond our hopes of stabilization and \nreconstruction in the eastern part of our country, we \nhave the legitimate hope that the Darfur crisis will end. \nMore than any country, Chad would gain by that, \nespecially since our populations in the eastern part of \nChad have been the victims of the crisis as often if not \nmore than our sister populations of the Sudan in \nDarfur. For that reason, our country has tirelessly \nendeavoured to restore peace and security to Darfur. In \nthat regard, no one can ignore the extremely important \nrole played by the President of the Republic, His \nExcellency Mr. Idriss Deby Itmo, in supporting the \npeacekeeping measures taken by the international \ncommunity.  \n The Republic of Chad has no intention of \ndeparting from that course. For that reason we will \nmake the fullest possible contribution to the success of \nthe resumed inter-Sudanese peace talks on Darfur that \nare scheduled for Tripoli on 27 October. We have also \ncontributed to the preparation of the peace talks \nthrough our participation in meetings bringing together \nthe non-signatory movements of the Abuja Peace \nAgreement, including meetings at Abeche in Chad, at \nAsmara in Eritrea, at Tripoli in the Libyan Arab \nJamahiriya and at Arusha in Tanzania, as well as the \nlast Seminar of N\u2019Djam\u00e9na in Chad   all of which has \ntaken place under the auspices of the joint mediation of \nthe United Nations and the African Union.  \n We have just underscored our resolve to work for \npeace in Darfur in particular, and of course, in the \nSudan in general, because that work is in the interest of \npeace and security in the subregion of Central Africa in \ngeneral and of Chad in particular. We all need peace \namong our neighbours in order to fend off any risk to \nthe stabilization of our countries and to continue, \nguided by the inspiration of His Excellency Mr. Idriss \nDeby Itmo, President of the Republic and Head of \nState, to build upon the democratic process that our \ncountry has been committed to since 1990, as well as \nto ensure the peace, security and social well-being of \nthe Chadian people.  \n In that regard, we should highlight that, since last \nyear, Chadian political life has witnessed some positive \ndevelopments. A number of military and political high \nofficials of the Chadian rebellion have had their legal \nrights restored, individually or in small groups or with \ntheir entire organization.  \n On 4 March 2007, a new Government was formed \nunder the leadership of one of the well known figures of \nthe political opposition to the presidential majority   \nPrime Minister Sem Nouradine Delwa Kassire \nKoumakoye. Moreover, the new Government has \nresponded to the expectations of the opposition by \ndeciding to postpone the legislative and communal \nelections in order to wait for the conclusions of a \npolitical dialogue begun under the auspices of the \nEuropean Union. That dialogue is aimed at \nstrengthening the rule of law and the democratic \nprocess by organizing the elections under conditions \nthat are acceptable to all actors in our political life, or \nat least by the greater majority, which is devoted to the \npeaceful settlement of political conflicts and has \nrenounced recourse to weapons and anti-constitutional \nchanges.  \n That political dialogue led to the signing of a \npolitical agreement on 13 August 2007. The signing of \nthat important agreement by the parties of the \ngovernmental majority and the democratic opposition \nclearly stems from the constant resolve of the President \nof the Republic, His Excellency Mr. Idriss Deby Itmo, \nto establish a peaceful political life in the country.  \n Furthermore, we wish also to warmly thank our \ndevelopment partners, in particular the European \nUnion, whose valuable assistance enabled us to \nproduce the agreement that we consider historic. That \nnew fact in Chad\u2019s political life has enabled us to note \nwith great satisfaction that a number of political exiles \nhave returned or intend to return without delay to the \ncountry. We owe that situation to the facilitation of the \nheads of State who are friends of Chad and we mention \nin particular His Excellency El Hadj Omar Bongo \nOndimba of Gabon and His Excellency Mr. Boni Yayi \nof Benin. In addition to the notable progress with the \ndemocratic opposition and the Chadian political exiles \nwe note that we are looking forward   with the \nsupport of the guide to the Libyan revolution and the \nmediator of the Community of Sahelo-Saharan States \n(CEN-SAD), our brother Muammar Al-Qadhafi   to \ncontinuing with the useful discussions taking place in \nTripoli with the armed movements aimed at reaching \nagreements with those organizations that have not yet \nrejoined the great Chadian family. We hope that those \nmovements will renounce any recourse to weapons and \nexpress their expectations within the peaceful \nframework set by the historic political agreement of 13 \nAugust 2007 and with respect for the institutions of the \nRepublic.  \n It is our view that all political initiatives having \nto do with national reconciliation should fall within the \nframework of the political agreement of 13 August and \nshould contribute to strengthening the State apparatus \nfor the benefit of the general interest. For we should \nnot forget that since its independence, Chad has known \nonly conflict or post-conflict situations, often, indeed, \ninternal, but including in particular those fuelled from \nthe outside to weaken the State or to topple the \ncountry\u2019s institutions. This is why we count on the \ninternational community to unreservedly condemn all \nattempts to destabilize the Chadian State, and also all \nwho use unconstitutional means, notably force, to seize \npower. The Chadian people, victims of insecurity due \nto the interminable armed struggles for power, \ncondemn these sterile struggles and rely on the \ndemocratic political actors and on the international \ncommunity to block the path to violence. \n If we must extend a hand to the rebels, whose \ncauses sometimes seem to be from the world of a \nrevolutionary utopia, this should not be done to the \ndetriment of the highest interest of the rule of law and \nof democracy. Unhappiness is at the heart of rebellions. \nWe find mercenaries in the pay of someone from the \nexterior, and adventurers who use it as a source of \ncommerce to gain unwarranted material advantages or \nto satisfy personal ambitions in exchange for their \nreturn to legality, in disdain of the authority of the \nState apparatus, of the law and of the country\u2019s \nregulations. \n After this brief overview of Chadian political \nquestions, allow me to raise some other issues \nregarding today\u2019s challenges: globalization with its \nhopes and anguishes, poverty, inequitable international \ntrade, terrorism, the AIDS pandemic, and so forth. A \nnumber of international meetings have been held on \nthese topics and on others. Resolutions and \nrecommendations have been adopted. However, no \ndecisive advances have been made in these areas. We \ncan only hope that the international community will \nhonour its commitments and that the richest will keep \ntheir promises vis-\u00e0-vis the poorest. \n We cannot simply ignore another important event, \nthe High-level Event on Climate Change and its \nconsequences, which was held right here. We hope that \nthe international community will learn lessons with a \nview to acting instead of indulging in fine statements, \nas was the case after the United Nations Framework \nConvention on Climate Change in Kyoto. \n Yes, we need to act, and for us the most tragic \ncase deserving the attention of the international \ncommunity is that of the shrinking of Lake Chad, \nwhose surface has been reduced in a few decades from \n25,000 square kilometres to 2,500 square kilometres. \nSaving Lake Chad would not only contribute to the \nstruggle against disastrous climate change on a \nplanetary level, but would also meet the needs of \n25 million people in the countries adjacent to the Lake. \n Another issue is just as worrisome, and that is the \nconflict situations in Africa and on other continents. \nHow can we not take a stand? We applaud the efforts \nof the African Union (AU) and the United Nations to \nfind lasting solutions to the conflicts in Africa or \nelsewhere in the world. \n This prompts us to underscore the importance of \nanother event that has caught our attention. That is the \nSecurity Council meeting held at the level of heads of \nState on 25 September on the question of peace and \nsecurity in Africa. We are mindful of the Council\u2019s \nsteadily growing interest in Africa, and that meeting \nseems to pave the way for the strengthening of \ncooperation between the United Nations and the AU, \nespecially with a view to building the capacities of the \nAU so that it can accomplish its peace missions in the \nbest possible conditions. This is the moment to \ncondemn the recent barbarous attacks on the African \nforces in Darfur and to express our condolences to the \nfamilies of the missing. \n We have great hope for the settlement of all crises \nin the framework of the rebirth of multilateralism and \ncollective security, which our Secretary-General has \nvery strongly endorsed: hopes for peace in C\u00f4te \nd\u2019Ivoire, in Western Sahara, in the Democratic \nRepublic of the Congo, in the Horn of Africa, in the \nMiddle East and so forth. \n Before I conclude, I would like to recall that we \nhave constantly condemned before this Assembly all \nforms of violence and intolerance, especially their most \nextreme form   terrorism. We reaffirm our \ncondemnation and our commitment to fighting these \nphenomena. We would like to reaffirm our commitment \nto strive to eliminate all sources of conflicts and all the \nthreats that jeopardize peace and security around the \nworld. \n In this regard, I wish to recall the need to respect \nthe principles of peaceful coexistence, which are \nrespect for the sovereignty and the territorial integrity \nof States. This, of course, prompts us to reaffirm our \ndevotion to respect for internationally recognized \nhistorical borders. We cite as an example our \nattachment to the policy of a single China and our \nopposition to Taiwan\u2019s attempts to bring about a kind \nof accession to the United Nations, under whatever \nname they might choose. \n This also prompts us to express respect for the \nsovereign right of States to develop nuclear energy for \npeaceful purposes. And we welcome the good \narrangements to find solutions to the question of \nnuclear energy through negotiations and to find a \npeaceful solution to the problem of the dissemination \nof weapons of mass destruction. \n This last prompts us once again to launch a \npressing appeal to our Assembly, especially to the \npermanent members of the Security Council, to redress \nthe injustice of the African continent being the only \ncontinent that does not have a permanent member seat \non the Council, when the bulk of the Council\u2019s agenda \nis comprised of African situations. \n"

        "file_text": "I wish to begin by congratulating \nyou, Mr. Kerim, on your assumption of the post of \nPresident of the General Assembly at its sixty-second \nsession. Your wise and energetic leadership will reflect \nthe abilities of the people of your country and of our \nregion as a whole. I also wish to congratulate and \nextend my best wishes to the Secretary-General, \nMr. Ban Ki-moon, and to pledge him my full support. \nIt is evident that the Secretary-General recognizes the \nmultitude of challenges the world is facing today. Only \ntwo days ago, I took part in the high-level meeting on \nclimate change here at the United Nations. That \nmeeting was organized by the Secretary-General to \nhighlight the urgent need for decisions that will prevent \nlong-term negative consequences. Now we must all \nwork together towards achieving a satisfactory \noutcome to the Bali Conference, which is to be held at \nthe end of this year. \n I welcome the fact that the Security Council was \nable to adopt the groundbreaking resolution 1769 \n(2007), which authorized the deployment of the Hybrid \nOperation in Darfur. It is now imperative that the \nresolution be translated into reality. We all recognize \nthe difficulties involved. It is also imperative to \ncontinue the political process. Only a negotiated \nsolution has the potential to bring sustainable peace to \nthat long-suffering region. \n To a great extent, the stability and prosperity of \nIraq depend on support from its region. We therefore \nwelcome the fact that the Security Council could unite \nto adopt resolution 1770 (2007). That resolution gives \na renewed and strengthened mandate to the United \nNations Assistance Mission for Iraq. With the launch of \nthe International Compact with Iraq, last May, the \nworld community now possesses an effective \ninstrument for rendering further assistance to the areas \nin Iraq where it is most needed. The Compact has \nalready been used to achieve positive results. We \nencourage the Government of Iraq to continue to take \nsteps towards promoting economic reform and \nachieving peace and stability for its people. \n Just a couple of weeks ago, I visited Afghanistan. \nI had a chance to meet with President Karzai, \nrepresentatives of the Afghan Government, Latvian \ntroops and civilian experts. The message from all those \nmeetings was clear. Providing assistance through the \nInternational Security Assistance Force is just one side \nof the coin; the other entails contributing to building a \nsolid foundation for the country\u2019s sustainable \ndevelopment.  \n Latvia is present in Afghanistan as part of both \nthe international military and the civilian rebuilding \neffort. Latvia\u2019s Government is contributing financially \nto the reconstruction of infrastructure in Afghanistan. \nHowever, it is my strong conviction that the key to \nsuccess in Afghanistan is cooperation   cooperation \namong countries and international organizations. To \nsucceed, the European Union, the United Nations, \nNATO and others must adopt a comprehensive, long-\nterm approach to development assistance for the \ncountry. \n In the Middle East, the past year has brought no \nsignificant breakthrough. Yet, we continue to place our \ntrust in the work of the Quartet, which supports the \nefforts of responsible regional States in helping to calm \nthe situation. It is a crucial tool to promote a \nnegotiated, comprehensive, just and lasting peace in \nthe Middle East, in line with the relevant resolutions of \nthe Security Council. I am sure that the Quartet\u2019s \nnewly appointed Special Envoy will use his great \nexperience and make sincere efforts to fulfil his \nchallenging mandate. \n The international community is currently also \nseized of the matter regarding the final status of \nKosovo. The Secretary-General has endorsed the \nComprehensive Proposal of his Special Envoy Martti \nAhtisaari. The Proposal currently remains the only \nviable diplomatic solution on the table. The active \ninvolvement of the European Union is important to \nachieve a lasting solution. We urge both parties to \nshow flexibility and commitment to a peaceful \nnegotiated outcome. We sincerely hope that the \nongoing talks under the auspices of the Contact Group \ntroika will result in success. \n In my previous capacity as a surgeon, I \nperformed many operations. But I also closely \nfollowed the recovery process of every one of my \npatients. I ensured that they got the necessary post-\noperative treatment and encouraged them to maintain \nhealthy habits. In that phase I had to rely heavily on \nthe work of my able and dedicated team. Likewise, it is \nnot enough for the Security Council to prescribe \npeacekeeping operations, crucial as they are for \ninternational peace and security. The whole United \nNations system is necessary for the long-term recovery \nof conflict zones.  \n In that regard, I would like to pay special tribute \nto the peacekeepers and to the United Nations staff \nworking in difficult conditions on the ground. It is our \nduty in our capitals, and here at United Nations \nHeadquarters, to support their efforts, each Member \nState according to its capacity. At the same time, we \nexpect high standards in peacekeeping forces. \n For many decades, Latvia suffered extensively \nfrom foreign occupation. Now that we have regained \nour freedom, we hope to prevent the suffering of \nothers. We wish to promote the healing process. The \ninternational community must bring to justice those \nwho have committed war crimes and massive \nviolations of human rights. Latvia commends the work \nof the International Criminal Court. We have placed \nour hopes in the Peacebuilding Commission   that it \nwill be an effective tool for consolidating long-term \npeace. \n Even where military conflict is not a factor, \nhuman security in many parts of the world is \nundermined by poverty, hunger and disease. The 2007 \nMillennium Development Goals Report gave us some \ngood news. However, it warned us that the Goals will \nnot be achieved by the year 2015   certainly not in \nsub-Saharan Africa   unless our efforts are scaled up. \nLatvia therefore supports the call to review progress \ntowards the Millennium Development Goals and \naccelerate action. \n Latvia is a candidate in the 2010 elections for the \nEconomic and Social Council. We have know-how to \nshare, and we also have empathy for the pain that \nreforms may cause. As an emerging donor, we have \nundertaken commitments in the area of overseas \ndevelopment assistance. We believe that our recent \nintensive and successful experience in development \nwill be an asset to the work of the Council. \n Latvia has a strong commitment to \nmultilateralism and the values embodied in the Charter \nof the United Nations. We want to see an Organization \nthat embodies effectiveness, efficiency and authority. It \nis regrettable that the reform process launched at the \n2005 World Summit has been slow and uneven. We \nrecognize the forces that make the reform so difficult, \nbut we must not give in to fatigue and frustration. \nManagement reform is vital. I already mentioned the \ndire necessity for a comprehensive approach among the \ndifferent international players on the ground. Likewise, \nthere is a great need for system-wide coherence of the \nvarious United Nations funds and programmes. The \nprovision of aid should be targeted and efficient. Our \nfocus should be on those in need. We look forward to \nassessing the results of the \u201cOne UN\u201d pilot \nprogramme, which is now under way in eight volunteer \ncountries. \n The beginnings of the new Human Rights \nCouncil were a cause for concern. Still, we are \nconfident that after making important decisions on \ninstitution-building earlier this year, Member States \nwill take full advantage of the Human Rights Council. \nWe have to live up to our task to further promote and \nprotect human rights. The Council now has the tools, \nbut it will be up to Member States to use those tools. It \nwill be up to Member States to advance the credibility \nof the United Nations as an Organization able and \nwilling to protect and promote human rights.  \n Latvia has always placed the promotion of human \nrights among its top priorities. In the light of that \ncommitment, we have decided to aim for membership \nin the Human Rights Council in the 2014 elections. \n No reform will be more difficult or more \nsignificant than that of the Security Council. The \nSecurity Council has had many achievements. \nHowever, we share the widespread belief that the \ncomposition and the working methods of the Council \nneed to be brought up to date. We have stated many \ntimes our reasons for supporting the model of reform \nbeing promoted by the G4 nations, namely, Brazil, \nGermany, India, and Japan. We consider it to be the \nbest of the models currently available. We welcome the \nprospect of intergovernmental negotiations beginning \nin the current session and hope that they will produce \nearly positive results. \n The United Nations is as important as ever, being \nthe only truly universal forum for global dialogue. We \nmust not forget that it is also the only truly universal \nforum for decision-making and action. But above all, \nwe must emphasize that this is the forum where all \nStates, big and small, have a voice. This is also a forum \nwhere all States have a responsibility to contribute.  \n Latvia looks forward to a fruitful sixty-second \nsession of the General Assembly. \n"

        "file_text": "I bring warm greetings \nfrom my Government and the people of the Republic of \nKiribati, on whose behalf I am honoured and privileged \nto address this important gathering this afternoon. \n Allow me to join preceding speakers in offering \nmy sincere congratulations to Mr. Kerim on his \nelection as President of the General Assembly at its \nsixty-second session. I am confident that with his \nwisdom, experience and diplomatic skill, he will steer \nthe course of this Assembly to a successful conclusion. \nLet me assure him that Kiribati pledges its full support \nto him in the performance of his challenging task. \n I take this opportunity to also extend my \nappreciation to his predecessor for the exemplary way \nin which she guided the proceedings of the sixty-first \nsession of the General Assembly. \n I wish to commend as well the Secretary-General \nand members of his team in the Secretariat for their \nperseverance and relentless efforts in pursuit of the \ngoals of the United Nations. In particular, I \ncongratulate the Secretary-General on his sterling \nleadership of this Organization since taking over his \ntop and challenging job at the beginning of this year. \nOur world is confronted more than ever with a \nnumber of serious threats and major challenges. Every \nyear, we all come together from different parts of the \nworld to this beautiful city of New York with our hopes \nof finding practical and workable solutions to those \nchallenges. Indeed, situations in some regions of the \nworld show no sign of improvement and are further \nconfronted by crises that have proven difficult to settle. \nThose challenges affect us each as individual countries, \nsmall and big, rich and poor, developing and \ndeveloped. In a world characterized by globalization \nand interdependence, the need for the human family to \nundertake constructive and sustained cooperation has \nbecome more urgent. \n With the growing complexity and uncertainty of \nevents in this world of ours, especially in the context of \nglobalization and with the emergence of new \nchallenges to peace and security, the fulfilment of the \nrole of the United Nations remains critical. Kiribati \nremains committed to supporting the reform of the \nUnited Nations. \n We continue to believe that the reform of this \nOrganization is in the best interests of humanity, and \nwe would like to see the reform processes move \nforward and be concluded as early as practicable in \norder for the Organization to be able to respond \neffectively to today\u2019s challenges to global peace, \nsecurity and economic and social progress. \n Seeking peace and economic development \nrepresents the common wish of all nations. Without \nglobal peace there can be little positive development in \nour countries. Kiribati is committed, within its resource \nand capacity constraints, to working closely with other \nlike-minded countries in pursuit of world peace and \nstability, economic development and progress of \nmankind. As the only universal multilateral \ninternational organization, the United Nations remains \nthe best forum for allowing all States to come together \nto resolve problems of a global character, regardless of \ntheir size or wealth. \n States Members of the United Nations are all too \naware that globalization has brought us all to a point at \nwhich everything is interconnected and the well-being \nof almost every citizen is affected by global \ndevelopments. Events that happen in one part of the \nworld have a direct bearing on the rest of the world. \n Sometimes however, we are all affected and \ninvolved in a much more substantial way. Like other \nleast developed countries and small island developing \nStates, Kiribati has so many constraints. Our very \nremoteness from world market centres, narrow \neconomic base and high population growth rates are \nfactors that we must contend with. The continuing \nsharp increase in world oil prices and our total reliance \non imported oil and fossil fuel has already put a lot of \npressure on our economy. Our options for containing \nthe adverse impact of increasing world oil prices are \nvery limited. We must also contend with the HIV/AIDS \npandemic and tuberculosis, among others, which \nrequire the diversion of the already meagre resources \nwe have at our disposal to finance our development. \n Those complex economic situations of ours will \ncontinue to undermine our efforts and determination to \nrealize the achievement of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals and other internationally agreed \ndevelopment goals. In order to be able to realize our \naspirations to attaining sustainable economic \ndevelopment and to sharing the benefits of \nglobalization, Kiribati would like to call on the \ninternational community to look at a new global \nstrategy that would create an enabling economic \nenvironment for the most disadvantaged States \nMembers of this noble institution, such as my own. \n Even with those complex economic development \nchallenges, we are forced to operate in an environment \nof uncertainty. I say \u201cuncertainty\u201d as our very survival \nas a nation and as a people with a distinct culture and \nway of life is at great risk, as we are being threatened \nby global warming and sea-level rise. \n Our islands are widely dispersed and small; most \nrise barely over 0.2 metres above mean sea level. For \ncountries such as Kiribati, global warming and sea-\nlevel rise are critical security concerns. Those concerns \nare ones that we, as individual countries and as \nmembers of this collective body, need to continue to \nwork together to address. \n We will continue to call on the international \ncommunity to agree on a unified global response to \nthose environment issues. We will also continue to \nwork with like-minded countries in pushing the case \nfor a unified global response to those issues. As a small \ncountry, Kiribati places great confidence on the \ninternational community for its survival, and we hope \nthat our repeated appeals to this body to address that \ncritical issue will receive stronger political support and \ncommitment this time. There is no more time to debate \nthe issue, as climate change is now a fact of life. It is \nnow time to put words into action so that this living \nplanet is protected from complete destruction and \npreserved for use by our many generations to come. \n We wish to commend the Secretary-General for \nhis initiative in calling the high-level event on climate \nchange on 24 September this year. That in itself means \na lot to those who are now living under the cloud of \ndesperation, fear and uncertainty. We remain confident \nthat further meaningful actions will follow and that \nconsensus will soon be achieved on finding a global \nsolution to climate change before it is too late. \n Terrorism is an ongoing concern that affects all \ncountries large and small. Kiribati condemns terrorism \nin all its various forms and manifestations and will \ncontinue to support the global fight against terrorism. \n This time last year, Kiribati joined other States \nMembers of the United Nations in expressing our \ndisappointment over the continued neglect and \nrejection of the desire of the 23 million people of \nTaiwan to join this Organization. It is further saddening \nto note that Taiwan\u2019s request for admission this year \nwas again not given a fair opportunity to be heard by \nthe General Assembly. \n With a population of 23 million, giving it the \nforty-seventh largest population in the world, Taiwan \nhas continued to respect and abide by the United \nNations Charter based on the principles of democracy, \nmutual respect and understanding. We feel that Taiwan \nand its 23 million people deserve justice from this \nnoble institution. It is Kiribati\u2019s fervent hope that \nTaiwan will one day be given the nod to assume its \nrightful place in this highly respected Organization. \n Let us all work together to make this world a \nbetter place   a place where citizens of all of our \nnations can live together in harmony, peace, security \nand prosperity for many years to come. \n"

I am confident, \nSir, that your able leadership, steadfastness and \ncommitment will assist us in our search for consensual \nsolutions to the issues that affect humanity in order to \nmake the world an increasingly safer, freer and fairer \nplace. \n Today, the world is confronted with global \nwarming, a consequence of the atmospheric pollution \nresulting from human activity on Earth, which is \ncausing dramatic and dangerous climate change. The \nworld is also confronted with extremists who resort to \nterrorism and the use of religion for political ends; with \ngrowing militarism as a would-be response to \nterrorism; and with the hoarding of capital, information \nand know-how, all of which widen the gap between the \nrich and the poor and generate social tensions around \nthe world. \n On the issue of terrorism, the model of an open, \ndemocratic and tolerant civilization, with a State that \nserves the interests of all, has shown that parties that \nalternate in political office in the post-cold-war period \ncan coexist and fight for their principles and values \nthrough peaceful means. I believe that the same model \ncan be successful if properly adjusted to the concrete \nrealities of other regions. \n At the same time, we must continue to deepen our \nstudy and analysis of the threat of terrorism and use \npeaceful means to seek an ever-broader consensus on \nthe collective responses needed to counter it.  \n Islam can peacefully coexist in societies with \nother religious beliefs. However, it is necessary to \nneutralize fanaticism and prevent the Islamization of \nthe State, which is contrary to humanity\u2019s modern legal \nconcept of a secular State. \n In our opinion, it is necessary to defend cultural \ndiversity and to render more inclusive and fair the \nprocess of political, economic and social development; \nto support and stimulate, in countries that are \npredominantly Islamic, all the forces and movements \nthat defend modern life and the separation of State \nfrom religion; and to support the values and privileges \nof the universal culture that are enshrined in \nconventions, charters and international treaties. This \nmovement is immense, it continues to grow and it can \nbe more effective than military action, which in our \nunderstanding should only constitute a last resort.  \n Ecumenism and dialogue among cultures are \nother avenues for action that can be better and more \nfrequently used to bring together the dominant \nreligions and all the people of the world, based on the \nideals of peace, solidarity and fraternity. \n The fight against poverty and hunger in the \nworld, with a global plan monitored by the United \nNations as an international convention, higher and \nfairer remuneration for commodities or natural \nresources extracted from developing countries and \ntechnical support to poor States would contribute \ngreatly to eliminating social inequalities and the social \nseedbed and support of those who prefer violence. \n In this regard, the globalization of the economy \nmust be regulated in order to mitigate the asymmetries \nbetween the centre and the periphery of the economic \nsystem and to ensure that each person has the \nnecessary means for survival with dignity. \n Such regulation should further address \nenvironmental matters. There are countries that have \nexperienced rapid industrial development without \npaying due attention to the protection of the \nenvironment. Other countries are now involved in an \nidentical endeavour, thus increasing the production of \ncarbon dioxide and worsening the greenhouse effect. It \nis plain that a new meeting of all world leaders is \nurgently required in order to approve and begin the \nexecution of a global plan of environmental protection. \n We therefore support the initiative of the \nSecretary-General to that end, convinced that the \ncountries that most pollute the atmosphere, such as the \nrichest countries, should contribute more resources to \nits protection. \n Today, the Republic of Angola is in a position to \nengage more actively in this collective effort of \nsolidarity for humanity, because the country has been \nat peace for a little more than five years and is moving \ntowards complete normalization of its political, \neconomic and social life. Proof of that lies in the fact \nthat Angola has already signed all the international \nprotocols in favour of environmental protection, such \nas the Kyoto and the Montreal Protocols, while \ncontributing to conflict resolution and peace in its \nregion and in the African continent as a whole. \n As a country that has recently chaired the \nPeacebuilding Commission, we are pleased to learn of \nthe important progress achieved in consolidating the \npeace processes in the Democratic Republic of the \nCongo, Burundi, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Liberia and Serra \nLeone. \n However, the conflict between Ethiopia and \nEritrea and the conflict in Darfur, Sudan, still prevail, \nwhile the issue of Western Sahara\u2019s self-determination \nremains unresolved. I am convinced that the \nOrganization will remain engaged in the search for a \nsolution to these problems in the shortest time possible \nand that United Nations forces will be urgently \ndeployed in Darfur. \n The Commission of the Gulf of Guinea is \ncurrently headquartered in Luanda, where the \nrepresentatives of the Zone of Peace and Cooperation \nof the South Atlantic met recently at the initiative of \nAngola. Both institutions promote peace, security, \n\nstability and multiform cooperation among their \nmembers, in consonance with the principles of the \nUnited Nations Charter. \n I must highlight the decisive role that regional \nand subregional organizations can play in the \nprevention and resolution of conflicts. At the same \ntime, they can alert everyone to the need to strengthen \nthe mandates and the financing of United Nations \npeacekeeping operations, without prejudice to post-\nconflict activities, such as disarmament and the \nresettlement of populations, among other actions. \n In the particular case of Africa, it is in our \ninterest to see the Millennium Development Goals \n(MDGs) fully achieved, so that the growth rate of the \nentire continent can be aligned with that of the world \neconomy. The reduction of extreme poverty by 50 per \ncent by 2015, as foreseen by the United Nations, must \nbe accompanied by a decisive fight against hunger and \ndisease, including HIV/AIDS and other endemic \nscourges. The effectiveness of these actions depends, \nhowever, on complementary achievements, such as \nfairer trade with developed countries, greater fluidity \nin the transfer of capital, official development \nassistance and forgiveness of foreign debt. \n In recent years, significant progress has been \nmade in the reform of the United Nations system. It is \nnevertheless important to continue to move forward in \nthat process, especially in regard to the Security \nCouncil, with the objective of strengthening the \nauthority and the effectiveness of the Organization and \nmaking it more representative, more democratic and \nmore participatory in the areas of international security, \ndevelopment and human rights. \n In spite of criticism and some known failures, the \nUnited Nations remains the only institution at the \ninternational level with the prestige and credibility to \nresolve inter-State conflicts and crises that, due to their \ndimensions, escape the control of the authorities of a \nState or endanger its population. \n The United Nations-led fight against \nconventional, nuclear, chemical and biological \nweapons and landmines, in addition to the \npeacekeeping and humanitarian operations of the Blue \nHelmets in many regions, have contributed to greater \nworld security. In that regard, it is important to \nstrengthen the monitoring of the implementation of the \nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons \n(NPT), so as to move towards a global disarmament \nprocess and discourage a new arms race. It is also \nurgent to relaunch the Middle East peace process in a \ncommitted and comprehensive manner, for the Middle \nEast remains unstable and the source of a constant \nthreat to world peace. \n A recurring theme in the Assembly\u2019s agenda is \nthe embargo against Cuba. It is imperative to put an \nend once and for all to the economic, trade and \nfinancial embargo imposed by the United States of \nAmerica, as it violates the principles of international \nlaw and Chapters I and II of the United Nations \nCharter. Angola hopes that the United Nations will \nstate its view on this matter and remain faithful to the \ncore of its Charter, according to which all actions must \nbe the result of a debate and a collective decision, thus \nexcluding unilateralism. \n The challenges that lie ahead of us entail a \nconstructive dialogue among all the countries involved, \nespecially among heads of State and Government, who \nwill have to overcome possible differences and \nimpediments and will have to find middle ground \nbetween the possible and the desirable, between \nboldness and realism. \n We believe that through joint action, the \npromotion of dialogue among civilizations and the \nrevitalization of the spirit of international solidarity, it \nwill be possible to build a better world for all. A world \nof peace, based on justice and the rule of law, without \nweapons of war and without dangerous pollution is a \nsafer world. Its construction depends entirely on the \npolitical will of all States Members of the United \nNations, especially the permanent members of the \nSecurity Council. Let us all unite our forces for a better \nworld for all.\n"

        "file_text": "I wish to offer you my \nheartfelt congratulations, Sir, on your election to \npreside over this sixty-second session of the General \nAssembly. Your experience in international affairs and \nyour first-hand knowledge of the Organization make \nyou particularly suitable for this important post. At the \nsame time I sincerely thank your predecessor, \nMs. Haya Rashed Al Khalifa, for her wise and \ndedicated leadership of the Assembly. \n I want to begin my statement where I left off last \nyear, with Italy\u2019s decision to defend human rights in \nthe world and to oppose the death penalty. In recent \nmonths, Italy has worked very hard to enable the \nAssembly to adopt a resolution on a universal \nmoratorium on the death penalty, with a view to its \ncomplete abolition. It has been a source of great \nsatisfaction to see support for our initiative growing \nday by day in Europe and in every other region of the \nworld. We have now reached a decisive moment. \n I trust that we shall all be united in this battle, \nwhich is supported by Nobel laureates, statesmen and \nstateswomen, and free men and women throughout the \nworld, and that the \u201cgrowing trend in international law \nand national practice toward a phasing out of the death \npenalty\u201d   to quote Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon \n(Press release SG/SM/10839)   will be officially \nsanctioned by this General Assembly\u2019s adoption of the \ndraft resolution we are about to submit together with \nmany countries from every regional group and from the \nEuropean Union. If genuine politics means showing \nforesight, we shall perform a great political act through \nthe adoption of that draft resolution. It will \ndemonstrate that humankind is capable of making \nprogress not only in science, but also in the field of \nethics. \n A United Nations resolution against the death \npenalty will prove that human beings are better today \nthan they were yesterday, even in moral terms. An \noutcome with enormous consequences, heralding a \nmore just future, and a society that has at last freed \nitself from the spiral of revenge, demonstrating that it \nhas heeded the ancient admonition: if you want peace, \nyou must work for justice. \n Last year we welcomed the ceasefire in Lebanon \nand the launch of the new United Nations Interim \nForce in Lebanon (UNIFIL), which has been under \nItalian command for several months now. Today, \nthanks in part to our common commitment, Lebanon is \nin a better situation, although it has not yet solved its \nproblems, as the brutal attacks of recent days have \nunfortunately demonstrated. \n We must continue to support the Lebanese \nreconciliation process and help the country to regain its \nunity through the election of a new President. We must \ndo this without ignoring the root causes of the conflicts \nafflicting the Middle East, first and foremost the \nPalestinian question. In short, we must continue to \nmobilize support for reconciliation among peoples and \nwithin a single people. \n Restoring peace to the Middle East is the top \npriority of the international community, because if one \nday this region should find greater peace, freedom and \nprosperity, we shall all live in greater peace, freedom \nand prosperity. I am therefore delighted that the United \nStates has promoted a new international meeting. We \nare ready to provide our input and we are already \npreparing it, knowing that the more countries in the \nregion that are behind this meeting, the greater the \npossibility of success. \n Italy will continue to play its part in the rest of \nthe region too, beginning with dialogue. For it is \nthrough dialogue that the most difficult issues can be \nresolved. I have never seen a lasting solution to a \nproblem when the solution was imposed from above or \nfrom outside. \n Today\u2019s challenges, such as bringing peace to the \nMiddle East, are complex. If we wish to overcome \nthem we must rise to their dimensions. In other words, \nwe have to set aside all partisan interests in a world \nthat is increasingly shaped by global processes.  \nThis applies also to climate change, to which this \nsession is most appropriately dedicated. As I said \nyesterday at the panel convened by the Secretary-\nGeneral, Italy considers climate change a priority \nissue. We are among the European supporters of a \nunilateral 20 per cent reduction in greenhouse gas \nemissions by 2020. We have made similar \ncommitments on energy efficiency, renewable energy \nsources and biofuels. In Europe we have already made \nvarious strategic decisions, but it is obvious that any \npost-Kyoto agreement can only be achieved within the \nUnited Nations, because when speaking about global \nwarming we are speaking about the pre-eminent global \nproblem of our day.  \n National approaches to solving the world\u2019s \nproblems no longer exist. The era of making and \nunmaking national borders is long over. It is only \nthrough multilateralism, by marshalling everyone\u2019s \nenergies, that we can hope to do good. \n Our task today is to adapt the multilateral \nstructures at our disposal to a changing world and to \nthink of new forms of global governance, for there is \nno other way to manage global processes.  \n The challenge facing Europe today is not to \nbecome resigned to the world as it is, but to seek to \nimprove it based on the values in which Europe \nbelieves: freedom, democracy, respect for others, and \nrespect for the rules of peaceful coexistence. That is \nwhy we are adapting our founding treaties. That is why \nwe are building a common foreign and defence policy. \nThat is why we have invented a new citizenship, \nEuropean citizenship, to which we are entitled by \nchoosing to share certain values, not by virtue of \nkinship or nationality.  \n The European dream is thus the child of the \nuniversal dream of the United Nations. In the past year \nthe United Nations has continued to play a central role \nin resolving international disputes. The cases of \nLebanon and Darfur demonstrate that if Member States \nare willing to give the United Nations a strong central \nrole, the Organization is today up to the task. We have \nto ask ourselves what the United Nations needs in \norder to fulfil its worldwide mission and to be equally \neffective in different crisis areas. \n First and foremost, we need an Organization \ncapable of renewal and adaptation. In the past two \nyears the revival of the reform process produced its \nfirst positive results. One essential aspect of reform \nrelates to the General Assembly, which remains the \nmain decision-making organ of the Organization. I \nnever tire of repeating that we have to restore the \nGeneral Assembly\u2019s central position, and exploit its \npolitical guidance potential and, above all, its \nuniversality. \n The principles of democracy and the \nrepresentation of every Member State underpin the \nUnited Nations system. That is why we are opposed to \nany concept of Security Council reform that would \nestablish new permanent members. The growing \ncontribution of a growing number of countries to the \nOrganization should not be wasted by introducing \nelitist and selective reforms. \n It is clear that reforming the Security Council \nmeans addressing one of the fundamental pillars of the \nglobal security architecture. The Council\u2019s central role \nand its nature as the paramount source of international \nlegitimacy impel us to seek shared political solutions.  \n Last year, in this very Hall, I advocated that \nnegotiations be started to break the deadlock and help \nstrengthen the Organization. I spoke of the need to start \nnegotiations based not on imposing predefined models \nand positions, but rather on the search for solutions \nbased on the widest possible consensus. \n I am therefore delighted that, one year later, the \nGeneral Assembly has decided to make every effort, \nthrough intergovernmental negotiations among others, \nto reach a general agreement on Security Council \nreform that we all hope will open a new chapter with a \nview to an agreed solution, a solution that I hope can \ninclude strengthening the presence of the leading \nregional stakeholders in the Security Council. My \ncountry is ready and will not fail to demonstrate \ncommitment and to contribute ideas in this new phase \nof the Security Council reform process.  \n Reform is also intended to make the Organization \nmore effective in the areas and on the issues where, by \nhistory and vocation, it can provide greater added \nvalue: Africa and development issues. \n The United Nations is deeply engaged in Africa. \nOver two thirds of the Blue Helmets are deployed in \nAfrica on peacekeeping missions. Italy will pursue this \ngoal through the establishment of the African Peace \nFacility fund, which will complement its European \ncounterpart fund. Darfur and Somalia remain two of \nour central concerns. \nBut it would be a mistake to look only at the \nnegative side and forget the many encouraging signs of \ndevelopment and unity coming from Africa. I am \nreferring to the growth of the economy and to the hope \nthat has arisen in many parts of the continent. \n In Europe we are now preparing for the second \nAfrica-Europe Summit. I hope that it will be held \nsuccessfully before the end of the year. Italy is working \nabove all to ensure that the Summit will spark a \nEuropean policy for Africa that is worthy of the name. \n That brings me to development. It is the \nresponsibility of the United Nations to keep \ndevelopment at the top of the international agenda. It \nwill take more than lip service to the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals to achieve them. We all have to \nwork for their attainment. I have already expressed my \nwillingness to sit at a table next year for a progress \nreport on the implementation of the commitments we \nmade seven years ago. \n We can no longer ignore the reality around us: \none half of world trade and investment benefits 14 per \ncent of the world\u2019s population; the 49 poorest countries \nin the world receive 0.5 per cent of the global product; \nand 90 per cent of the planet\u2019s wealth lies in the hands \nof only 1 per cent of its inhabitants. Efforts are needed \nfrom everyone, particularly those who have more to \ngive. The G-8 can play an important role in this area. \nHere and now I pledge to make this issue the \ncentrepiece of the Italian presidency in 2009. \n The principles of solidarity and cooperation \nunderlying this Organization are as sound today as they \nwere 62 years ago. The spread of democratic values \nand greater attention to the protection of human rights \nshould not make us forget that these principles and \nvalues are still threatened and violated in far too many \nparts of the world. What is more, insecurity leads more \nand more people and countries to close themselves off. \n The danger is that this sense of insecurity can \ncause societies to regress. Even the most free and \ndemocratic nations, if they feel they are under threat, \nmay adopt measures that will undermine peace and \nwith it, the civil and political rights of their citizens. \n In the face of such risks, the principles and values \nof the United Nations are our beacons and our stars. \nThey make it possible for us to navigate even by night \nand in rough waters. Staying on course is not just a \npolitical imperative. It is above all a moral imperative \nfor all of us. \n"

        "file_text": "My delegation associates \nitself with the compliments extended to Mr. Srgjan \nKerim on his election to preside over the General \nAssembly at this session and to his predecessor, \nSheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa of Bahrain. I also \nwish to take this opportunity to welcome His \nExcellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon and to assure him of my \ncountry\u2019s unconditional support during his tenure as \nSecretary-General of the United Nations. \n Lesotho congratulates the presidency on having \ninvited Member States to comment on the theme \n\u201cResponding to Climate Change\u201d during this session. \nIn 1992, the first Earth Summit, the United Nations \nConference on Environment and Development, was \nheld in Rio de Janeiro. It was at that conference that we \ncommitted ourselves to achieving sustainable \ndevelopment in the twenty-first century. We reaffirmed \nour commitments in Johannesburg at the 2002 World \nSummit on Sustainable Development. It would seem \nthat, for far too long thereafter, we agreed to disagree \nuntil we were confronted by the glaring and compelling \nscientific evidence that the link between global \nwarming and human activities was unequivocal. We \nwaited for the adverse effects of climate change to \nbegin to be felt all over the globe before we could \nacknowledge that consensus was essential for \nconcerted action on climate change. \n Sadly, natural disasters have begun to strike. As is \nusually the case, it is the poorest nations and the most \nvulnerable countries that are being worst affected. My \ncountry is one of these. Unfavourable climatic \nconditions that are attributable to climate change have \nled to severe drought, which has resulted in acute food \nshortages. In order to address that crisis, my \nGovernment has declared a state of emergency on food \nsecurity. \n As the world prepares for the United Nations \nclimate change conference, which will take place in \nBali, Indonesia, in December 2007, we need to be \nreminded of the urgent need to build a solid and \nsustainable consensus on a global response to climate \nchange for the period following the expiry of the 1997 \nKyoto Protocol in the year 2012. My delegation calls \nupon the international community to endeavour to \nreach consensus on, among other things, steps that \nmust be taken to reach the 60 to 80 per cent emission \ncuts that are required to stabilize the atmosphere. In \nthat regard, the industrialized countries must assume \nthe major responsibility, because scientific evidence \nhas confirmed that it is the greenhouse gas emissions \nfrom those countries that are making natural disasters \nworse. The international community must also reaffirm \nits commitment to assisting the regions, such as Africa, \nthat are the most vulnerable to climate change. In \naddition, my delegation calls upon developed countries \nto assist developing countries in strengthening their \ncapacity to adapt to climate change. \n Allow us further to share our thoughts on what \nwe consider to be the role of the United Nations in the \ntwenty-first century. Our thoughts cover three areas: \ndemocracy, conflicts and development.  \n The United Nations was formed against the \nbackdrop of colonialism, particularly on the African \ncontinent. As colonial rule slowly but surely ended, it \nleft behind a legacy of undemocratic Governments. \nAfrican countries were characterized by coups d\u2019\u00e9tat \nday in, day out. Very few African countries have not \nhad the \u201cpleasure\u201d of military rule. \n Faced with that disturbing reality, some regional \norganizations adopted instruments to deal with \nunconstitutional changes of Government by carrying \nout sanctions. Here, mention should be made of the \nOrganization of African Unity; its successor, the \nAfrican Union; and the Commonwealth group of \nnations. Significantly, however, our Organization, the \nUnited Nations, has not adopted any instrument to \ncarry out sanctions against defaulting Member States. \nThat is what the United Nations must now do. \n Today, the overwhelming majority of the world\u2019s \ncountries adhere to the principles of democracy. Those \ncountries hold periodic elections. However, the \nbroadest common denominator of developing countries \nis the non-acceptance of election results; it has become \na tradition for losing political parties to dispute them. \nRegrettably, that is done through unlawful means more \noften than not, despite the fact that there are always \nlawful mechanisms for challenging election results. \nThis is one area in which we see a role for the United \nNations, as the universal institution with the capacity \nnecessary to assist requesting Member States in \nreversing these trends. \n Just as the United Nations plays a critical role in \nworld economic development, it should see as part of \nits role aggressively inculcating the culture of \ndemocracy in all nations. In particular, the \nOrganization must help developing countries fight the \nculture of impunity. The common understanding must \nbe a simple one: \u201cWhen the people have spoken, \nrespect their voice\u201d. Victors must learn to accept \nvictory with humility and magnanimity, and losers to \naccept defeat with grace. In that way, the post-election \nperiod can be devoted to development, with all sides \njoining hands in a collective national effort. We must \nhasten to acknowledge the role that the United Nations \nis now playing in democratization processes, but we \nfeel that it can do more. \n That brings us to the second area: conflicts. \nConflicts always feature prominently in our addresses \nbefore the Assembly. We must acknowledge that inter-\nState conflicts are on the decline across the globe. The \nsame, however, cannot be said about internal conflicts. \nIt cannot be denied that intra-State conflicts occur \nwhere there is little or no regard for democratic \ngovernance. If a country is not accustomed to holding \nelections or to accepting election results, conflicts \narise. Other causes, which are also attributable to lack \nof democratic governance, include a lack of judicious \nsharing of a country\u2019s wealth, rampant poverty and \nethnic strife. \n In all such conflicts, small arms and light \nweapons have become weapons of choice. We therefore \nstill consider it regrettable that in the year 2005, \nMember States were not able to adopt a legally binding \ninternational instrument on the marking and tracing of \nsmall arms and light weapons. We share the view that \nsuch an instrument could curtail the production, \ntransfer and civilian possession of illicit small arms \nand light weapons. It is the urgent responsibility of the \nUnited Nations to facilitate the adoption of an effective \ninternational instrument for curbing the illicit trade in \nconventional weapons, which would make it harder for \nsuch weapons to end up in the hands of criminals. We \nhope that the arms trade treaty that is being proposed \ncan be concluded expeditiously. \n We must recall that in the year 2005, the \nAssembly solemnly proclaimed that the role of the \nentire international community, acting through the \nUnited Nations, was to protect populations from \ngenocide, war crimes and other crimes against \nhumanity. Unfortunately, that is not what is happening \non the ground. We still notice inaction on the part of \nthe Security Council, or its reaction coming too late. \nThe harrowing experiences of Rwanda and now Darfur \nare living testimony to that. We attribute such inaction \nto the skewed composition and powers of the Council, \nespecially the right of veto, which we are now \nconvinced, more than ever before, is extremely \nsubjective and exercised according to the interests of \nthe concerned permanent member. That has, in some \ninstances, caused a breaking of the ranks among the \nbig five. \nWe continue to witness unilateral economic and \nfinancial blockades being imposed against other \ncountries, and the denial to peoples of their right to \nself-determination, while others are still subject to \noccupation. Cuba, Palestine and the Western Sahara are \nhere cases in point. We submit that it must remain the \nrole of the United Nations in the twenty-first century to \nproactively preserve international peace and security. \nOur call is therefore that, where peace and security are \nthreatened, the United Nations, through the Security \nCouncil, must act swiftly and decisively at all times. \n But the United Nations can do so only if its \nstructures are reformed to make them democratic and \nrepresentative. Our basic premise would continue to be \nthat the United Nations in the twenty-first century \nshould inculcate democracy not only in Member \ncountries, but also within itself. \n It is a hard fact that the reform of the United \nNations will not be complete without the reform of the \nSecurity Council. Members of this body have on \nseveral occasions reiterated the fact that the Security \nCouncil in its current form does not reflect the realities \nof today\u2019s world, and yet, for more than a decade now, \nthe Assembly has remained stagnant on that issue. The \npresentation per se of various positions by major \nstakeholders, as well as various attempts to bridge \nmajor differences in those positions, have thus far \nfailed to produce tangible results. Hence, my \ndelegation shares the view that it is now time to move \nforward and begin intergovernmental negotiations. \nHowever, we wish to underline that, while the reform \nof the Security Council is possible, all Member States \nneed to garner the necessary political will to attain that \ngoal. The credibility of the Council is at stake. \n Sustainable world peace and stability create the \nnecessary space to deal with the development \nchallenges of our countries and peoples. The world has \nacknowledged that the HIV and AIDS pandemic \nrepresents the top most challenge. The untold miseries \nbrought about by that scourge are common cause. To \nthe extent that no cure is available, HIV/AIDS will \ncontinue to be a threat to human existence. That threat, \nparticularly in Africa, is compounded by worsening \npoverty and famine levels brought about, in most \ncases, by unfavourable weather conditions, \ncompliments   in large measure, of climate change. \n It is our view that, in a country enjoying political \nstability, the potential for all sectors of that nation to \naddress those challenges is greatly enhanced. \nMoreover, no economic development can take place \nwithout democracy, peace and stability. Of course, the \nsupport of the developed countries will always be \ncalled for; hence, the need for them to fulfil their \npromise on official development assistance, which \nplays such a critical role in the economic development \nof the developing countries. \n My delegation congratulates the Secretary-\nGeneral, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, on his commitment to the \nstrengthening of the Organization. For this \nOrganization to acquit itself successfully in the twenty-\nfirst century, the role of its Secretary-General must \nremain sacrosanct. He must remain immune to \ninfluence by the interests of any groups or Powers. He \nmust be faithful to the interests of all in the service of \nour family of nations. Above all, he must help, through \nthe United Nations, to create a world at peace with \nitself. \n"

Now that the climate change debate has \nfinally become the rage, those of us who see the \nchange and worry about the inevitable must \nunfortunately still contend with entrenched special \ninterests who, despite the overwhelming evidence now \navailable, continue to argue otherwise. \n We are focusing our general debate on climate \nchange, and it is the hope of my delegation that this \nwill lead to more decisive action by all Member States \nso that we can begin to make the changes we believe \nare necessary for us to reverse the trends which so far \ncontinue to lead us down a destructive path. \n We already agree that negotiations on action to \ntackle climate change should be conducted within the \nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate \nChange. We subscribe to the principle that each of us \nhas a role to play. Those who are the largest polluters \nmust reverse these trends. Those who are not among \nthe largest polluters must take the necessary measures \naimed at mitigation, as well as adaptation methods, to \nhelp in reversing those trends. \n Developed countries must recognize the special \nneeds of the most vulnerable, in order to support our \nefforts towards sustainable development and to assist \nus to make our communities more adaptable to change. \nWe must develop the capacity to take action. We must \nadopt more sustainable practices. For that to occur we \nmust take specific action to limit greenhouse gas \nemissions. It is not enough to say that we will reduce \nharmful emissions.

Other developed \ncountries and regions, as well as emerging economies, \nmust take substantial steps towards mitigation and \ndevelop and share the technologies which result in \nlow-carbon or no-carbon economies. \n In Belize, the symbiosis between our ecology and \nour economy is evident. Agricultural production, \nfishing, mineral extraction and hydrocarbon \nexploration as well as tourism are all subject to the \ncaprices of the climate. Must we also be subjected to \nan uneven playing field in the arena of international \ntrade, which is fast reaching the crisis level? To mix \nmetaphors, sometimes a rising tide can swamp \nvulnerable boats. \n The international community must keep \ndevelopment in perspective in the current climate \nchange debate, since, as has been said before, \neconomic development better enables countries to \ntackle climate change. Our focus on the urgency of the \ncurrent situation should not, however, detract from the \nequally urgent if not dire situation of the development \nagenda, resulting from complex factors including \nclimate change and the failure of the international \neconomic system to reinvent itself. \n At the heart of the crisis is a fundamental distrust, \nand no place is this more evident than in the Doha \nDevelopment Round. Doha doled out harsh \nconsequences for developing countries, particularly \nthose that are commodity and preference dependent. \nWe ask the question: Is there is a serious commitment \nto the survival of the multilateral trading system? If the \nanswer is no, we can expect to see even more bilateral \nand regional arrangements, resulting in a movement \naway from the idea that together we are better at \nsolving our common problems. \n The discussions on climate change and the larger \ndevelopment debate exhibit the need for an effective, \nlegitimate multilateral system that is fair and balanced \nand that operates in a transparent and inclusive manner. \nResponsible leadership that adheres to the basic \nprinciples of justice and the rule of law is even more \ncritical to achieving that system and maintaining its \nintegrity. \n It is in this spirit of respect for law and justice \nand of the desire for equity and for the preservation of \nhuman rights that we continue to struggle with the \ndecision of this body to exclude any true debate over \nthe inclusion of the right of the 23 million people of \nTaiwan to representation in this institution. The desire \nof the people of Taiwan is not only to take part in the \ndeliberations of this institution but, indeed, to be \nengaged on the critical issues facing the international \ncommunity. We remain steadfast in our support for \ntheir aspirations and will continue to advocate for their \nrepresentation, as well as that of the Saharawi people, \nwho lack a voice in our United Nations. \n We continue to monitor the situation in the \nMiddle East with great concern. The question of \nPalestine remains the crux of the conflicts in the \nregion. In that regard, it is high time that we realized \nthe vision of two States, Palestine and Israel, living \nside by side in peace and security. We join those who \nexpect that the international meeting to be held in the \nnear future will yield results substantial enough to \ntranslate that vision into reality. \n The United Nations remains the key institution to \nfacilitate cooperation and build global solidarity to \nsolve our pressing economic, social and political \nproblems. Its effectiveness has been challenged. The \nUnited Nations and its Member States have responded \nto this challenge by embarking on a comprehensive \nreform process to overhaul the system and to ensure \nthat it is better equipped to meet contemporary global \ndemands.  \n We applaud reform that has been achieved in \npeacebuilding, human rights and humanitarian \nassistance and encourage the United Nations to \nmonitor these developments for their effectiveness and \ntheir compliance with their mandates and with the \nCharter of the United Nations. Belize continues to \nsupport comprehensive reform of the Security Council. \nIn particular, we agree with other Member States which \nhave called for a more results-oriented debate during \nthe sixty-second session. \n Building trust requires a return to basics. To \nadvance development, we must return to the basic \nprinciple of equity. In international peace and security, \nwe must return to the basic principles of the United \nNations Charter and the rule of law. \n In the matter of climate change, that greatest \nchallenge to our civilization, we must look to science \nto make those arguments which will diminish the \nsceptics. And we must return to the basic principles \nenshrined in the United Nations Framework \nConvention on Climate Change. \n Let us give meaning to the moment. Let us get to \nwork. \n"

        "file_text": "For Peru, Sir, your election as President of the General \nAssembly at its sixty-second session is a guarantee of \nexperience and exceptional work. I am convinced that \nyour performance will strengthen the principles of \ndialogue and coordination that guide the efforts of the \nUnited Nations to attain realistic commitments that \ncontribute to well-being in the daily life of humankind. \n On 15 August, an earthquake occurred in the city \nof Pisco, seriously impacting the southern populations \nof Peru, claiming priceless human lives and causing \ngreat material damage. The Peruvian people deeply \nappreciates the immediate and generous response of \nthe international community, as well as the speedy \naction of the United Nations Office for the \nCoordination of Humanitarian Affairs. The Office\u2019s \nsupport showed that united action can make a \ndifference in a crisis situation and contributed to the \nGovernment\u2019s activities in attending to the urgent \nneeds of the victims. Our sincere recognition goes to \nthe cooperation received, which is now being \nchannelled by my country\u2019s Fund for Southern \nReconstruction. \n The stabilization and growth of the Peruvian \neconomy over the past 76 months have generated \nnational and international confidence and expectation. \nWe are convinced that the investment and participation \nof our productive forces will allow us to maintain \ncontinuous growth and to exploit the opportunity to \nenhance a model and national project of social \ntranquillity and development. \n In the first year of his Government, President of \nthe Republic Alan Garc\u00eda has laid the foundations for \ngreater dynamic growth in the country. We must now \nconsolidate and give practical and positive content to \nthe democracy, governance and economic stabilization \nof the country in order to allow the growth indices to \ngenerate national confidence and participation that can \nbe converted into transparency, equity, justice and \nsocial peace. \n The struggle against poverty and inequity is the \nmost formidable current challenge to the national and \nforeign policies of Peru. In the conviction that the \ndignity of human beings and their welfare are at the \ncore of governmental management, and that economic \nindicators should be based on the well-being of our \npopulation without distinction, the Government of Peru \nhas redefined its social policy through a concept of \nproductive inclusion, access to education and \ntechnological innovations, territorial institutional \ndevelopment and support for the population. To that \nend, we have begun implementing a national strategy \nof rural development and a national strategy of food \nsecurity to address chronic child malnutrition. \nImportant road infrastructure works will complement \nthe incorporation of the Peruvian Andes and Amazonia \ninto the development of the country. \n Towards the fulfilment of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals, Peru has set itself the concrete \ngoal of reducing the current level of poverty from 50 \nper cent to 30 per cent by 2011. Chronic malnutrition \nwill be reduced from 25 per cent to 16 per cent, and the \nprovision of potable water and electricity will be \nextended to 90 per cent of citizens. Likewise, we plan \nto eradicate illiteracy, reduce employment in the \ninformal sector from 53 per cent to 35 per cent, create \n1.5 million jobs, and reduce the external debt from 24 \nper cent to 13 per cent of the gross domestic product.  \n The Government\u2019s new direction in State action \nis focused on decentralization. The strategic \ndecentralization plan goes beyond the mere transfer of \nresources or the execution of public works in the \ninterior of the country. The regions can now coordinate \ntheir own development plan, efficiently distribute more \nthan 80 per cent of the national budget, interlink and \ngradually integrate Peru as a whole, and promote the \nbetter distribution of the population and income \nthrough a process of national institutionalization that \nsupports optimal care of the environment. \n Peru has become one of the emerging countries of \nthe region thanks to the continuous growth of its \neconomy over the past eight years. Its strategic \nlocation in the South American Pacific, the full force of \na modern legal framework that encourages investment \nand exports, the diversity of its natural resources, its \ngrowing diversification in the global markets, and its \npolitical and macroeconomic stability are factors that \nensure a development process of genuine social \ninclusion. \n Much remains to do. In the face of the \nuncertainty of the Doha Round negotiations and a \ncautious evaluation of the effective possibilities of \nintegration in the Andean subregion and Latin America, \nPeru is striving to conclude free trade treaties with its \nmajor commercial partners that will complement \nregional and subregional integration schemes and \nmultilateral trade negotiations. In the Andean \nCommunity   comprised of Peru, Colombia, Ecuador \nand Bolivia   Peru has an up-to-date free-trade zone. \nLikewise, Peru has entered into free-trade treaties with \nChile and the United States, and is negotiating similar \ninstruments with Canada and Mexico. Negotiations \nwith the Central American countries are scheduled to \nbegin shortly. We have finished negotiating a free-trade \nagreement with Singapore, negotiations with Thailand \nhave reached an \u201cearly harvest\u201d agreement, and we \nhave begun to negotiate a free-trade agreement with the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China. Likewise, the negotiation \nof an agreement of association between the Andean \nCommunity and the European Union has begun. Our \npriorities are now to pursue negotiations with Korea, \nJapan, India, Russia, Australia and New Zealand. \nOur objectives are clear: to ensure access to the \nmarkets of our main commercial partners; to establish \nfair and predictable commercial rules and regulations \nthat complement the standards of the World Trade \nOrganization; to diversify the markets for our exports \nof goods and services; and to attract investment and \ntechnologies to modernize our productive structure, \nreduce the technology gap, and modernize Peru\u2019s \nphysical infrastructure in order to increase its \ncompetitiveness. \n Following on the results of a regressive utopian \nexperiment in Latin America, we are convinced that \nPeru\u2019s model of integration into the global economy, \nwhile consolidating regional economic expansion, will \nallow us to ensure the participation of the large \nmajority of our people in the system\u2019s benefits, with \nconcrete improvements in their daily lives. It will \nthereby contribute to the people\u2019s sense of belonging to \ntheir social institutions and of full citizenship, as well \nas to their perception of themselves as agents of social-\neconomic change and to the consolidation of the \ndemocratic system. \n In the framework of such integration, my country \nis also assuming growing international responsibilities. \nIn our efforts to foment dialogue, we are deeply \nhonoured to be able to organize a summit of heads of \nState and Government of Latin America and the \nCaribbean and the European Union, as well as the \nsummit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation \nForum, both of which will take place in Peru in 2008. \n Formidable technological advances, especially in \nthe information field; the emergence of new powers; \nenergy insecurity; climate change; growing inequity \nand poverty; and new challenges to international \nsecurity characterize a changing and ever-more \ncomplex international scene to which States and \ninternational institutions must adapt. Global society is \ninterlinked through productive processes, trade, \nfinancial flows, the digital telecommunications \nrevolution, and so on.  \n In this complicated scenario, Peru is participating \nin the Security Council and in peacekeeping \noperations. The Peruvian armed forces are present in \nthe Sudan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, \nEthiopia and Eritrea, Liberia, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire and Haiti. \n Peru attaches special importance to cooperation \nwith Haiti, having assumed in January the coordination \nof the Group of Friends of Haiti in the Security \nCouncil. In that regard, we support the renewal of the \nmandate of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in \nHaiti (MINUSTAH) for a year, as well as the gradual \nreorientation of its work to promote development, in \nsupport of its multidisciplinary and multidimensional \nwork. At present, we are contributing a contingent of \nPeruvian military officers, which we expect to be able \nto complement shortly with an engineering corps. \n Our permanent representation in New York has \npresented a draft resolution that, inter alia, reaffirms \nthe urgent call to fulfil the contribution pledges, \npursuant to the priorities presented by the Haitian \nGovernment, especially for cooperation projects to \neradicate poverty, improve basic health services and \nstrengthen national institutions. We expect the draft \nresolution to enjoy consensus in the Security Council \nso that the international contribution to Haiti can \ncontinue. \n Last May, Peru, with the cooperation of Norway \nand the United Nations Development Programme, \norganized the Lima Conference on Cluster Munitions, \nassuming a lead regional role in the endorsement of the \nOslo Process. At the Conference, Peru presented to the \n69 delegations of the participating countries a proposal \nto secure a declaration of the Latin-American region as \na zone free of cluster munitions, which have \nindiscriminate effects on civilians. Our initiative \nalready enjoys the support of many countries of our \nregion. \n Peru is also committed to effectively \nimplementing the Convention on the Prohibition of the \nUse, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-\npersonnel Mines and on Their Destruction. Peru is in \nthe final stages of preparing a national plan of action \nagainst anti-personnel mines with a view to completing \nthe demining process along our northern frontier, in \ncooperation with the brotherly country of Ecuador.  \n Moreover, Peru is firmly committed to efforts to \nattain complete disarmament and the non-proliferation \nof nuclear, chemical and biological weapons, as well as \ntheir delivery systems, which constitute a threat to \ninternational peace and security. In that respect, we \nsupport the strengthening and universalization of the \nrelevant binding multilateral agreements. In that \ncontext, Peru organized a regional seminar on the \nimplementation of Security Council resolution 1540 \n(2004) in November 2006, in which most countries of \nthe region participated. \n The General Assembly is the forum in which the \nmiddle-income countries can efficiently contribute to \nidentifying imaginative responses to conflicts and new \nthreats. That is why we resolutely support reform that \nwill strengthen the Assembly and ensure its ability to \nadapt to change and to the most urgent needs on the \ninternational agenda. In order to reinforce the \nAssembly\u2019s legitimacy, we need to sharpen procedures \nand reduce its agenda. An equal priority is to carry out \nmore effective action against violations of human \nrights. Security Council reform is needed urgently to \nmake the Council a more efficient, transparent, \nlegitimate and representative body with better working \nmethods. On the Other hand, we also want to highlight \nthe validity of the Economic and Social Council, an \nessential instrument for promoting greater \neffectiveness in the coordination of development \nstrategies, as well as assistance in emergencies. \n International reality presents many challenges to \nthe universal system for promoting and protecting \nhuman rights. There is still a dichotomy between \nsecurity and individual rights, with a backdrop marked \nby the poverty and the inequality in which the great \nmajority around the world live and which affect human \ndignity. The new Human Rights Council and the \nsystem integrated into it ought to help in the response \nto these challenges.  \n Discussion over the last few days in this \nOrganization shows that climate change is a world \nproblem that requires a collective response from the \ninternational community in a framework of a \nmultilateral and worldwide commitment. Through \nsustainable forest management, Peru has contributed to \nthe global commitment by reducing emissions caused \nby deforestation. We have also made headway in \nimplementing our National Strategy on Climate \nChange by strengthening national capacities to \nmaximize human and financial resources. The size of \nthe problem requires an agreement with goals for the \nemission of greenhouse gases more ambitious than \nthose agreed in the first stage. Peru has great \nexpectations for the next meeting in Bali, and we will \nwork to ensure a common platform that will allow us to \nvery soon begin negotiations to define the new \ninternational regime that we hope will be concluded in \n2009. \n The official launching of the International Year of \nthe Potato will take place at Headquarters on 19 \nOctober. This celebration is especially important for \nmy country because the potato has its origin in Peru, \nand it is the country with the greatest genetic diversity \nof this product. The cultivation of the potato was \ndeveloped in ancient times by civilizations that gave \nrise to the Peru of today and is one of the great \ncontributions to the world\u2019s diet. Peru has proclaimed \n2008 as the National Year of the Potato and has \ndeveloped a calendar of multisectoral activities for \noutreach and research that will be a positive \ncontribution to the work programme of the Food and \nAgriculture Organization. \n I shall conclude by noting that Peru participates \nactively to ensure and strengthen the United Nations \nCharter principles and objectives of peace, peaceful \ncoexistence and development, especially in the \nSecurity Council and the Human Rights Council. In \naccordance with this commitment, Peru will continue \nto promote dialogue and coordination among peoples \nof the world. It has put forward its candidature for the \nEconomic and Social Council and the Peacebuilding \nCommission, bodies within the United Nations system \nwhere we hope to achieve the support of all members \nof the Assembly in order to contribute to working \ntowards a safer, more equitable world where \ndevelopment can reach the large majority of \npopulations. \n"

        "file_text": "It is a  pleasure, Sir, to congratulate you on your election to \nthe presidency of the Assembly at this session. We \nhave every hope that your efforts will be successful. It \nis also a pleasure for me to convey our appreciation \nand pride to Her Excellency Sheikha Haya Rashed \nAl-Khalifa for the tremendous effort she undertook as \nPresident of the General Assembly at the sixty-first \nsession. \n I would like to take this opportunity to express \nour full confidence in the role of the United Nations \nand all of its specialized agencies with respect to their \nhistoric responsibilities regarding the Palestinian \nquestion, responsibilities they will continue to bear \nuntil this question is comprehensively settled. For \nmany decades, those institutions have continued to \nreaffirm the established national rights of the \nPalestinian people and to provide varied support for \nour people, in the political, economic and humanitarian \nrealms. Here, we must commend the exceptional \nongoing work of the United Nations Relief and Works \nAgency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East \n(UNRWA) and other institutions in safeguarding the \nfuture for generations of Palestinian refugees and \nproviding them with the basic services they need. Our \nappreciation goes also to those who have upheld the \nbasic human rights of the Palestinian people and who \nhave provided support in the areas of education and \nculture and in strengthening the role of the Palestinian \nAuthority since its inception, as well as in building and \nstrengthening our national institutions. \n I would like also to thank Secretary-General Ban \nKi-moon, who has given top priority to the Palestinian \nquestion, who has worked to reach a solution to the \nIsrael-Palestinian conflict and who has placed this \nmatter at the centre of his concerns. He has, in \naddition, creatively contributed to seeking the means to \nrelaunch the Middle East peace process. \n The confrontations, wars and conflicts in our \nregion and their tragic repercussions for the peoples of \nthe region constitute the primary threat to global peace. \nThey call all of mankind to awareness. They demand \nrapid intervention from the international community \nwith the aim of settling this situation boldly and \nwithout delay. Our experience over the years and \ndecades shows that the policy of delaying a settlement \nof the principal conflicts in the region, the policy of \nproviding partial solutions and the policy aimed at \ncontaining the conflict by limiting the damage only \nfurther complicate things, to the point where, today, \nthere is a clear threat of civil war or regional war. \nMoreover this climate has been conducive to terrorism, \nwhich unfortunately has spread to become a global \nphenomenon. \n However, this grim picture should not mask the \nfact that hope is still alive. Indeed, thanks to the \ndetermination of the vast majority of our people, and \nthanks to the support of the international community, \nour people are capable of overcoming the tragic \nsituation that we are being pushed into by the forces of \noccupation, extremism and aggression and, by those \nwho seek to provoke war and terrorism in our region. \n There are on the other hand responsible, active \nforces in the Middle East, representing the \nconsciousness of the people and possessing a true \ndesire for freedom, progress and democracy for the \npeople. Although these forces are working in extreme \ndifficulty, they are firmly committed to overcoming the \ncurrent situation in order to create a  new future for the \nMiddle East in which our peoples would enjoy freedom \nand equality. \n There can be no doubt that defending Islam   a \nreligion of moderation, of love and brotherhood; a \nhuman religion   is the responsibility of those active \nforces in our region who seek to counter any attempt to \nundermine that true religion or to portray it in an unfair \nmanner that is entirely out of keeping with its precepts. \nIslam is a religion of tolerance that opposes killing, \nterrorism and assassination. It is a religion of \nenlightenment, not ignorance or backwardness; a \nreligion of openness to the world. It is against \nextremism and close-mindedness. We need to work \nhand in hand to preserve our shared human values. \n Those values are today being violated, \nundermined and weakened. We need to work to \nstrengthen human understanding among religions and \ncultures because the attempt to foment conflict among \nreligions, cultures and civilizations is one of the most \ndangerous methods used by international terrorism \ntoday. \n That is why a dialogue among cultures, religions \nand civilizations is necessary today, particularly \nbecause we know that world wars have not been wars \nof religion or culture, but rather wars of interest. That \nreality is only one fragment of the overall picture. In \nfact, missing recurrent opportunities to address the \nissues of our region seriously so as to reach bold, \ncomprehensive solutions, in particular to the \nPalestinian question, moves our people to the precipice \nof despair and depression and makes them easy prey to \nthe forces of ignorance and fanaticism.  \n Is it not high time to take this opportunity, the \nbeginnings of which we see today, as the international \ncommunity is moving towards relaunching the peace \nprocess, which enjoys the support not only of Israelis \nand Palestinians, but also of the international \ncommunity and the world at large? Is it not time to \nmove seriously towards negotiating a complete end to \nthe 1967 Israeli occupation of Arab and Palestinian \nterritories, thereby achieving the vision of two States? \nIs it not time to create a Palestinian State, with East \nJerusalem as its capital, to settle the refugee issue and \nto put an end to six decades of suffering? Is it not time \nto reach a fair, agreed settlement under General \nAssembly resolution 194 (III) of 1948? Is it not time to \nend the policies of settlement expansionism, of taking \nland from Palestinians under various pretexts, of \nbuilding the apartheid separation wall, laying siege and \ncreating checkpoints around cities and towns and \nrefugee camps? Is it not time to end the policy of \ncollective punishment and of denying freedom to the \nmore than 11,300 Palestinians who are rotting in Israeli \nprisons, some for more than 25 years?  \n Is it not time to make Jerusalem a city of peace \nfor all faiths and religions? Is it not time for Israel, the \noccupying Power, to end any work that would change \nthe sacred nature of that city and all attempts to \ndisplace its inhabitants and to violate sites sacred to \nIslam and Christianity? Is it not time for Israel to end \nthe daily assassinations, displacements, destruction of \nhouses and seizure of land? Is it not time for our \npeople to be able to enjoy freedom and independence \non equal footing with all other peoples of the world so \nthat they can build a peaceful future together with all \nof their neighbours, including the State of Israel?  \n I hope that I will not have to come back to this \nrostrum next year to ask the same questions.  \n There is not the slightest obstacle to the \nsuccessful holding of the upcoming peace conference, \nbecause our brotherly, Arab countries have \ndemonstrated through the Arab Peace Initiative their \ntrue readiness to bring about a just, lasting and \ncomprehensive peace, from which all States of the \nregion would benefit. Those States would have normal \nrelations with Israel, once the Israeli occupation of \nPalestinian and other Arab territories had ended and an \nindependent, sovereign Palestinian State had been \ncreated within the 1967 borders. That is why we are \ncommitted to the substance of that proposed meeting, \nwhich should be held soon with the participation of all \nparties concerned. \n Let me say quite frankly that not a single \nresponsible political figure or leader who does not \nknow that the solution to the problem lies solely \nbetween us and our Israeli neighbours. Reaching such a \nlasting solution can only be a result of the many \nresolutions of the General Assembly, as well as of the \ninitiative of President Bush, who has urged a two-State \nsolution: a Palestinian State living side-by-side with \nthe State of Israel. It must also be based on the Road \nMap, endorsed in Security Council resolution 1515 \n(2003), the Arab Peace Initiative and the various \nnegotiations, projects and plans that have been \nproposed by many parties since 2000.  \n I therefore address myself to the Israeli \nGovernment, with whose head I have recently met. We \ndiscussed the important issues in depth, attempting to \nend the cycle of lost opportunities so that the \ninternational conference will become a substantial \nreality. We can move towards that conference together, \nwith clear, realistic, detailed plans with a view to \nsettling all of the final status issues, including \nJerusalem, borders, refugees, water security and other \nkey issues. I reaffirm here the full readiness of our \npeople to join a genuine peace process that will lead to \na comprehensive, full agreement on all final status \nissues. \n As we promised, we will put such an agreement \nto a popular referendum that will include all \nPalestinian factions and groups so that they can give \ntheir views and opinions on any decision that would \nlead to defending and safeguarding peace \ncomprehensively and strategically.  \n I also reaffirm that we will continue to deal with \nthe rebellion that took place in the Gaza Strip. We shall \ndo so in conformity with our basic laws and so that we \ncan preserve democracy in our country. Attempts from \nwhatever group or faction to impose their will and dark \nideas by force and armed revolt will not derail our \ndemocracy. It would be wrong for anyone to think that \nour people, which has for decades sacrificed martyrs, \nprisoners and the wounded in order to obtain freedom, \nindependence and democracy and to build a free and \nprosperous country, will follow such an armed group, a \nclosed regime and a closed, backward society.  \n Some have attempted in the past to play the \nPalestinian issue as a political card in the service of \nregional interests in order to achieve expansionist goals \nor to promote specific ideas or ideologies that would \nignore the true interests of the Palestinian people. But \nwe who have struggled all our lives for our national \ncause, for the protection of the rights and interests of \nour people and for rejection of hegemony and \noccupation will not allow such a tragedy to reoccur. We \nwill not allow those who tried to undermine our \nnational destiny to achieve their aims.  \n I came to this rostrum to convey a message from \nan exhausted people which has long suffered from \noccupation, displacement, prison and martyrdom. At \nthe same time, however, they are a people who, imbued \nwith dignity and faith, will build their own future, even \nthough their past has been the work of those who have \nplotted against them and against their rights.  \n I have come to reiterate the words of our \nimmortal leader Yasser Arafat, who was certain that the \ngreen branch of peace, which never withers or dies \nwould never fall from his hand. I have come to express \nthe pain and suffering of every Palestinian man and \nwoman, of all those who have lost loved ones or whose \nloved ones have been wounded, of all those who are \nwaiting for the release from prison of their brothers, \nfathers, mothers and sisters, of all those who remain \ntrapped on the Iraqi or Syrian borders and of the \nmillions of Palestinians who are living as refugees on \ntheir own land. I have come to affirm that the messages \nof peace of the prophets and the other divine \nmessengers who trod the paths of our land remain \nvibrant, like a tree that continues to grow and bloom. I \nhave come to affirm that the voice of peace remains \nstronger than any other voice in our country. That is \nwhy I urge that we move forward, hand in hand, on the \nshining path towards peace, leaving expediency and \nshort-term interests far behind.  \n In conclusion, and from this rostrum of the \nUnited Nations, I say to the Palestinian people, both \nthose in Palestine and those abroad, that an important \nhistoric opportunity is emerging. Therefore, let us be \nunited in order to make that opportunity a reality so \nthat our people, who have suffered so long, can recover \ntheir legitimate national rights and achieve the peace, \nstability and prosperity to which they aspire and which \nthey deserve. We also hope that peace will come to \nother peoples who are suffering daily, such as the \nbrotherly Iraqi people, and to those who deserve to live \nin security and stability within the framework of \ndemocracy, such as our dear friends the Lebanese \npeople. Together, let us build a stable world   a world \nof mutual assistance based on respect for life and for \nthe right to self-determination. I thank the Members of \nthe United Nations for their support. \n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, \nlet me first express my gratitude to your predecessor, \nHer Excellency Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa, for \nher leadership of the General Assembly. To you, Sir, on \nbehalf of Slovenia, I assure full support for your \nleadership. We also look forward to cooperating with \nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon. \n An important part of the sixty-second session of \nthe General Assembly will coincide with a period of \nincreased international responsibility for Slovenia. We \nwill do our best to make good use of this opportunity \nand to benefit not only Europe, but the international \ncommunity as a whole. The United Nations will be at \nthe heart of our efforts. This Organization still \nrepresents humankind in its best light. \n The discussions this week have proved that the \nglobal community has identified the challenges brought \nabout by the human impact on the environment. The \nwill to find solutions under United Nations auspices \nwas clearly expressed. The sheer dimension and \ncomplexity of the issue require that this Organization \nhave primacy. \n Today, environmental changes are occurring all \nover the world. Slovenia pins great hopes on a regional \napproach in the search for solutions. At the global \nlevel, we support the principle of common, but \ndifferent, responsibilities. A common approach is \nnecessary because of the considerable impact of \nclimate change, including on global security and \nstability. \n Country-specific solutions should allow space for \nrealizing development potential. Slovenia is very \nserious about its commitments within the European \nframework. The European Union has showed the will \nand ability to take initiative. We hope that such \nexamples will set the dominant tone of the overall \ndiscussion through the new framework for the period \nafter 2012. \n Slovenia welcomes the progress made so far in \nthe United Nations reform process and will continue to \nwork towards the more responsive, effective and \nrepresentative United Nations. \n The role of the United Nations in maintaining \npeace and security is indispensable. This year, more \nthan 10 per cent of the members of the Slovenian \narmed forces participated in missions abroad under the \nmandate of the Security Council. The majority of them \nhelped to strengthen peace and stability in South-\nEastern Europe, and also in Afghanistan, Lebanon and \nIraq. \n In the last decade and a half, the international \ncommunity has dedicated considerable human and \nfinancial resources to the region of the Balkans. The \ncontribution is great; therefore the dividends of peace \nfor the whole region should not be wasted at the end of \nthe stabilization process. We need to pursue solutions \nto secure these dividends; then they should be further \ninvested in the common European project. \n The international community must, within the \nframework of the United Nations, complete the \nestablishment of mechanisms aimed at meeting the \nchallenges of the twenty-first century. Finalizing a \ncomprehensive United Nations convention on \ninternational terrorism must continue to be a key \npriority. Another challenge remains concrete \napplication of the concept of the responsibility to \nprotect. \n Even the most determined efforts to achieve \nglobal security have little chance for lasting success \nunder conditions of inequality. Therefore, achieving the \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) is of \nparamount importance. Creating equal opportunities \nfor the disadvantaged and demonstrating solidarity \nwith them are sustainable investments in peace. It is \nonly when both developed and developing countries \nchoose to make such investments that the benefits of \nthe world\u2019s current economic growth will be more \nfairly distributed. \n Slovenia was very pleased to become a member \nof the Human Rights Council. The trust that has been \nplaced in us will be honoured through our active and \nopen efforts to achieve the implementation of human \nrights standards. We will continue to support the policy \nof global abolition of the death penalty. \n Slovenia attaches great importance to the concept \nof human security, which is in accordance with the \npillars of the United Nations: development, security \nand human rights. We accord special attention to \nchildren: the youngest victims of violence, poverty and \ndeadly pandemics are also the most powerless. \nTherefore, it remains true that a man never stands so \ntall as when he kneels to help a child. \n In that respect, Slovenia takes particular pride in \nits full cooperation with the non-governmental sector. \nThe Together Foundation, which is concerned with the \npsychosocial well-being of children in societies \naffected by armed conflict, and the Slovenian \nInternational Trust Fund for Demining and Mine \nVictims Assistance in Bosnia and Herzegovina were \nfounded as a result of Slovenia\u2019s initiatives aimed at \nthe wider region. \n Slovenia actively participates in initiatives on \nintercultural dialogue, devoting special attention to the \nMediterranean area. We hope to see the early \nestablishment of a Euro-Mediterranean university, \nwhich would be a Slovenian contribution to raising \nawareness about the need for peaceful coexistence \namong those with different cultures and world views. \n Franklin Delano Roosevelt, one of the chief \narchitects of the United Nations, predicted at the time \nof the establishment of the Organization that change \nwould be a regular feature of its development. Indeed, \nthe United Nations continues to be built today. The \ngreat hopes of humanity depend on our joint efforts, \nwhich will never be completed. Therefore, it is my \nhope that the sixty-second session of the General \nAssembly will be crowned with success.  \n"

        "file_text": "It is always inspiring to \ncome to this forum and, time and again, observe that \nthere are many more things that unite rather than divide \nnations around the globe. Indeed, we are united in our \nvision of a world free of violence, where every \nindividual has freedom of choice and where human \ndignity is respected. We are united in our aspirations to \nmeet the challenges of the twenty-first century, because \nwe know that in a globalized world a threat to one \nnation is a threat to all nations. \n Nowhere is this new reality more evident than in \nthe much-needed work of the United Nations. Poverty, \nimbalances in development, armaments, the spread of \nideologies of hatred, cybercrime: those are some of the \nthreats that we face today. The new, daunting \nchallenges are different in kind. Therefore, both \nindividual States and the international community have \nto find ways to deal with this new reality and how to \nrespond better to new challenges. \n Seven years ago, at this United Nations conclave, \nall nations made a historic step, pledging to eradicate \npoverty, illiteracy and environmental degradation, and \nto improve health and promote gender equality. That \nwas our response to the challenges of the time. This \nyear, we are halfway to the 2015 deadline for achieving \nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Over the \npast few years, an estimated 135 million people \nmanaged to get out of extreme poverty. Significant \npositive changes are taking place in the fields of \nprimary education for poor children, child vaccination \nand better access to retroviral treatment for persons \nwith HIV/AIDS, to name but a few. \n Yet overall progress in achieving the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals remains uneven and too slow. If \nwe want to live up to our commitments, we must \nincrease our efforts considerably and urgently. \n The twenty-first century has also confronted us \nwith such challenges as a deteriorating environment. \nGlobal warming affects all aspects of our lives from \nsocial and economic growth to changing habitats and \nmigration patterns. Time is clearly not on our side. We \nare taking measures to adapt our policies to counter \nclimate change, but our actions are obviously too slow \nand sometimes too reluctant. Therefore, Lithuania \nwelcomes the Secretary-General\u2019s focus on climate \nchange as a global challenge that requires global \nconcerted efforts. We believe that the United Nations \nclimate change process is the appropriate forum for \nnegotiating future global action in this effort. \n But that already may not be enough. I am \nconvinced that the world needs a more coherent and \ninclusive system of international environmental \ngovernance. This system needs to be strengthened by \nestablishing a United Nations Environment \nOrganization, based on the United Nations \nEnvironment Programme (UNEP) with a revised \nmandate. With December\u2019s Bali climate change \nconference in mind, I call on all countries to come to \nthe negotiating table later this year with the ambition \nof concluding by 2009 a global and comprehensive \npost-2012 agreement. Before such an agreement is \nreached, Lithuania is doing its best to fulfil the \ncommitment of the European Union to achieve at least \na 20 per cent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by \n2020 compared to 1990 levels. \n We have started to focus on a wider use of \nindigenous and renewable energy resources. The share \nof these resources in the primary energy balance in \nLithuania will increase up to 12 per cent by the year \n2010. Last year alone, we planted 21,000 hectares of \ntrees, an area that corresponds to 32,000 soccer fields. \nFor a country the size of Lithuania, that is no small \nmeasure. These are but a few of the concrete steps by \nwhich my country shows political will sufficient to \nfight new global challenges. \n The necessity to fit in and effectively integrate \ninto the international system has been the cornerstone \nof our policies since we regained our independence in \n1990. Membership in the European Union and NATO \nis the best example of success in that effort. Now we \nare taking on increasing responsibility in the fields of \nsecurity, stability and sustainability in our region and \nbeyond. We are active at the front of the war against \nterrorism, including our contribution to restoring \nstability and security in Iraq. We are leading a \nProvincial Reconstruction Team in Afghanistan\u2019s Ghor \nprovince. Over the past two years, Lithuania has \ndoubled its development aid budget and has committed \nto increasing it to 0.33 per cent of its gross national \nincome by 2015. Our contribution to global security \nand the vision of inclusiveness and of building a \n\u201cEurope whole and free\u201d motivated Lithuania to offer \nits candidacy for the chairmanship of the Organization \nfor Security and Cooperation in Europe in 2010. \n If Lithuania and the Baltic region in general are a \nsuccess story in terms of establishing themselves in a \nnew global environment, some countries in our region \nare not. We may only guess why those countries \nperceive the integration of democracies on their \nborders as a national threat. We feel sorry for a society \nat large when its Government chooses to spend the \ncountry\u2019s natural riches on guns and not on democratic \nreforms. Clearly, we should not tolerate attempts to \nfalsify historical facts about the Soviet occupation of \nthe Baltic States or the denial of the deliberately \ncaused Holodomor in Ukraine, which killed millions. \n Fitting in is never easy. Therefore, we consider \nthat the United Nations could help Member States to \nefficiently integrate into the international system, as \nthe European Union is already doing by engaging its \nneighbours in this process through various \nneighbourhood instruments and cooperation formats. \n However, our readiness to stand up and speak \nopenly to States if they cross the line is also an \nindispensable element of that effort. We should ask \nourselves: where did we fail, that the killings of \nhundreds of thousands of innocent people were \npermitted to take place in Darfur?  \n Today conflicts occur on every continent, with \nparticularly grave consequences in Africa and the \nMiddle East. Some conflicts in the world, however, are \nless visible. But that does not make them less \ndangerous. Frozen conflicts in Eastern Europe and the \nSouth Caucasus may become very hot one day unless \nwe act immediately. We consider it morally \nunacceptable for the international community to remain \nindifferent to the frozen conflicts in the GUAM area. \nLet us not forget that it is not only the conflicts that are \nfrozen; the lives and dreams of the people living in \nthose areas of artificial conflict are also frozen. That is \nwhere the United Nations should be more visible and \nmore outspoken. That also applies to Kosovo, where \nattempts to create another frozen conflict must be \nexcluded. \n It is not only States, but also the United Nations \nitself that must adapt to new, changing realities. We \nencourage the Secretary-General to continue the reform \nof the United Nations, in particular making the \nOrganization\u2019s operational system more consolidated, \ncoherent and effective, with the highest standards of \nconduct and ethics. We must proceed with real actions \nin carrying through the reform of the United Nations. \nThe Secretary-General has my full support in this \ncontext. He should be applauded for his bold and \nforward-thinking vision of the reform in United \nNations peacekeeping. We welcome all efforts by the \nUnited Nations to streamline and reform the \npeacekeeping procurement system. \n I encourage the United Nations to further \nstrengthen, develop and use its capabilities in the area \nof good offices and conflict prevention, as envisioned \nin the 2005 World Summit Outcome (resolution 60/1). \nThat would enable us to address many issues in a more \nefficient manner and, hopefully, to avoid costly \npeacekeeping operations. \n The prevention of nuclear proliferation and the \npursuit of nuclear disarmament in accordance with the \nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons \nare crucial for global peace and security. We need to \nstrengthen the authority of the Treaty. Lithuania will \nsupport the process leading to the elaboration of a \nbinding international arms trade treaty. Lithuania will \nalso continue to increase practical assistance and \nfunding to international mine action projects and the \nimplementation of the Programme of Action on Small \nArms and Light Weapons. \n Two years have passed since the adoption of the \nWorld Summit Outcome, which elaborated on the \nconcept of the responsibility to protect, and yet we \nhave been too slow in responding to massive violations \nof human rights and mass atrocities. The principle of \nthe responsibility to protect can no longer be confined \nto paper. We therefore encourage the Secretary-General \nto follow up on the World Summit document and take \nmeasures to operationalize that principle. \n Only a reformed and proactive United Nations \nwill be truly instrumental and effective. Only such a \nUnited Nations will have the required support and \nfinancing. Only such a United Nations will be trusted \nby the people. \n The ability to adapt is the quality of the strong. \nFitting in is the least we can do for future generations. \nIt is the responsibility of every nation and the \ninternational community as such.  \n"

        "file_text": "Allow me to first \nextend to all of you the fraternal greetings and best \nwishes of President Michel of the Republic of \nSeychelles, the Government and the people of \nSeychelles on the convening of the sixty-second \nsession of the General Assembly. Seychelles is proud \nto be here today, as a partner and an ally, to further our \ninternational efforts, to address the challenges that are \ncentral to the future of all humanity and that pose a \nthreat to global political and economic stability and \nsecurity. \n I join previous speakers in congratulating \nMr. Srgjan Kerim on his election to the presidency of \nthe General Assembly at its sixty-second session. His \nelection to the helm of this Assembly is a testimony to \nthe high esteem in which the international community \nholds him and his country, the former Yugoslav \nRepublic of Macedonia. I take this opportunity, too, to \nexpress my country\u2019s sincere appreciation to his \npredecessor, Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa of \nBahrain, for her outstanding stewardship of the work of \nthe General Assembly at its sixty-first session. \n Allow me to commend and to renew Seychelles\u2019 \nstrong support to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for \nthe determination and strong will he has shown since \nthe beginning of his tenure in office, in strengthening \nthe role of the United Nations. \n Seychelles remains unwavering in its support of \nthe United Nations. Our commitment has not changed \nsince we joined this Organization 31 years ago. More \nthan ever, we believe that the world needs strong and \neffective multilateralism. Indeed, we are convinced \nthat the most effective means of advancing our \ncollective interests is through the United Nations. \n Seychelles is pleased that the overarching theme \nof this year's session is responding to climate change, \nas the General Assembly of the United Nations is the \nforum for concerted and comprehensive action in \naddressing a defining issue of our time. \n Fifteen years ago, in 1992, Seychelles, a small \nisland developing State, was the second country to \naccede to the United Nations Framework Convention \non Climate Change (UNFCCC). We were convinced \nthen, as we are now, that the Convention\u2019s primary \nobjective of reducing the dangerous levels of carbon \ndioxide and other greenhouse gases in the earth\u2019s \natmosphere must be realized in order to protect the \nenvironment and avoid serious socio-economic \ndisruptions. Six years later, in 1998, Seychelles \nreiterated its commitment to the ideals of the UNFCCC \nby adopting the Kyoto Protocol. However, the attempts \nof the international community to act on those \ninternational agreements have been modest at best. \n The challenge of development has never been \nhigher on the international agenda. However, the \nadverse impacts of climate change are a major barrier \nfor the achievement of sustainable development goals \nin many countries, especially small island developing \nStates, which are recognized as being most vulnerable \nto climate change. \n We must emphasize again that for the majority of \nsmall island developing States, agriculture, fisheries \nand tourism have for a long time been the mainstay of \nsurvival and economic development. Let us not forget \nthat small island developing States are home to a \nsizeable proportion of the world\u2019s biodiversity and that \nthe majority of the species are endemic and \nincreasingly under threat because of climate change. \n In Seychelles, the fisheries sector is a key pillar \nof our economy. It is expected that changes in climate \nmay cause migratory shifts in tuna aggregations to \nother locations, thus depriving our country of one of its \nmain sources of income. Moreover, inshore and \ntraditional fishing, the mainstay of local fishermen and \na major source of food, is also highly threatened. Food \nsecurity on islands is at stake. \n The impacts of climate change on the tourism \nsector are also expected to be significant, and that is \nwhy we believe that support for economic \ndiversification towards other revenue-generating \nsectors in small island States is more than necessary. \n Climate change is also a security issue. But it is \nnot merely a matter of narrow national security   it \nhas a new dimension. It is a question of our collective \nsecurity and responsibility in a fragile and increasingly \ninterdependent world, where the notion of borders has \nundergone a powerful symbolic transformation. \n It is now up to politicians, businessmen and civil \nsociety to continue the work accomplished by \nscientists. The peoples of the world are increasingly \nlooking to their leaders to take action, and the time is \nnow. A week ago, at a meeting of the Global Island \nPartnership in Rome, our President, James Michel, \nlaunched the Sea Level Rise Foundation, as an attempt \nto ensure that island nations have the capacity to adapt \nto climate change. Together we are mobilizing \nleadership, gathering resources and sharing skills, \nknowledge, technologies and innovation in a cost-\neffective and sustainable way that will catalyse action \nfor conservation and sustainable livelihoods on islands \nand low-lying areas in the face of climate change. \n We count on the valuable support of the \ninternational community for ensuring the success of \nthis noble and important endeavour. We call on the \ndeveloped countries to take a strong lead and \ncommitment in combating climate change. Aspirational \nglobal emissions reduction goals are not sufficient. We \nbelieve that the Kyoto Protocol paves the way forward \nfor Annex I countries to fulfil their commitments under \nUNFCCC. We urge those parties to commit to their \nlegally binding targets and to translate them into \nconcrete actions for the reduction of their gas \nemissions. \n We believe that a United Nations-based \nmultilateral approach that builds on the Kyoto Protocol \nframework is the only decisive way of moving forward. \nThere cannot be any doubt as to the major importance \nof the first steps taken at Kyoto and of the quantum \nimprovements brought about by the provisions of the \nProtocol. The size and urgency of the problem requires \nthat we take bold initiatives and compromises. \n However, as the globe suffers because of climate \nchange, it is essential that the international community \nas a whole be formally and unequivocally reminded \nthat neither the efforts made thus far in implementing \nUNFCCC, nor the emissions reduction targets, set on \naverage at 5.2 per cent, adopted in Kyoto represent an \nadequate effort to stabilize greenhouse gas \nconcentrations in the atmosphere at safe levels. We \nknow that we need to do much more. In that regard, we \nwould like to take this opportunity to praise the recent \nwork accomplished by the Intergovernmental Panel on \nClimate Change in urging the need for deeper cuts in \ngreenhouse gasses of 25 per cent to 40 per cent below \n1990 levels by 2020. Moreover, we would like to \nextend our heartfelt appreciation for the determination \nshown by our Secretary-General in facilitating the \ninternational dialogue to address the problem. \n It is now up to us to build the political \nmomentum needed in order to ensure that a \ncomprehensive agreement is met at the world summit \non climate change in Bali, Indonesia. There is an \nurgent need to ensure that developing nations, \nincluding small island developing States, can continue \nto develop and prosper in an equitable manner. Small \nisland developing States need to be equipped \nfinancially, technically and technologically to adapt to \nglobal climate change and sea level rise without \nredirecting their limited resources from sustainable \ndevelopment. \n Allow me to now turn briefly to other issues that \nare of particular importance to Seychelles. \n First of all, Seychelles recognizes that \nglobalization has the potential to advance human \ndevelopment throughout the world. But it is not \nautomatic, for globalization has also increased our \nvulnerability, insecurity and the possibility of \nmarginalization. \n It is internationally recognized that trade can be \nan important source of financing for development. In \nthis particular context, Seychelles strongly believes \nthat more emphasis should be placed on the \ndevelopment dimension of small island developing \nStates in multilateral trade negotiations, in recognition \nof their specificities and structural handicaps. \nMoreover, in our view, ownership of development \norientations by recipient countries is the precondition \nfor the emergence of a true partnership in development \ncooperation. \n Furthermore, it is extremely important that the \nwhole issue of development policies and cooperation \nbe monitored closely within the international system. \nDecisions affecting development are being taken in \ndifferent arenas, forums and agencies. Increasingly, \nthere is the need to ensure coherence in policies and \nprogrammes. The international system currently does \nnot have an effective mechanism for conducting such \nan exercise. We reiterate our belief that one of the \nurgent tasks of the moment is to create a mechanism \nwithin the international architecture that will focus on \ntrade, finance, technology and development policy in \nan integrated manner. \n Seychelles remains determined to build its \neconomy based on our assertion of the principle of \nresponsibility for our own development. Our efforts at \neconomic re-engineering have been very dynamic. The \nSeychelles Strategy 2017 commits the Government of \nthe Republic of Seychelles to doubling the gross \ndomestic product in the next 10 years. The reforms \nbeing undertaken will not only ensure that our \neconomy continues to grow but also will facilitate the \nparticipation of every Seychellois in wealth creation. \nThat is the commitment of the Government of \nSeychelles. However, owing to our inherent \nvulnerabilities, we need the support of the international \ncommunity in guaranteeing that the considerable \nsuccesses achieved so far in the economic and social \nsectors are not lost. \n I have spoken thus far on climate and \ndevelopment issues, which are both closely related to \nother critical areas of the international agenda. One \nsuch area concerns peace and security. It is tragic and \npainful to witness the continued cycle of violence \naround the world. Peace accords and ceasefire \nagreements do not, unfortunately, entail a cessation of \nhostilities. \n We support the strong will shown by the United \nNations, working alongside the African Union, in \nensuring that peace and security are brought to the \npeople in the Darfur region of the Sudan. Seychelles \nassociates itself with all those calling and working for \npeace in Africa, the Middle East, Asia and elsewhere. \n Against the backdrop of increased violence from \nwar and terrorism, it is clear to us that violence and the \nuse of force cannot be the answer. We must embrace \nmultilateralism and insist that international relations be \nguided by the rule of law as the basis for our collective \nsecurity. \n The United Nations remains a significant partner \nand interlocutor of the modern development and \nprogress of Seychelles. It is with complete faith, as a \nsmall island developing State, that we renew our trust \nin the principles of the Charter. We cannot stop \nemphasizing the compelling urgency of altering the \ndesign and function of the Security Council, if it is to \nfulfil the mandate conferred by the Charter of 1945 in \nthe realities of the world today. \n With regard to the General Assembly, what is \nneeded is a resuscitation and use of the powers of the \nGeneral Assembly and the assertion of its role as the \nprincipal organ of the United Nations. The Assembly is \na forum of equals. Its pronouncements and policy \ndecisions must carry the stamp of legitimacy as the \nvoice of the international community. However, we \nmust emphasize that, irrespective of whatever \ninstitutional arrangements we may devise, in the final \nanalysis, it is the commitment and political will among \nMember States alone that can make the system work. \n(spoke in French) \n In the demanding context of globalization, \nregions are players with which the multilateral \norganizations, donors and international investors \ndevote increasingly sustained attention. The regional \napproach is also the best bastion when it comes to \nmounting defences against terrorism, insecurity, \nbanditry, trafficking, pandemics, or to providing an \nefficient response to disasters in real time. A region is, \nultimately, for the countries that comprise it, the \nstrongest legal space in which those countries can \nobtain the natural resources and raw materials that they \nshare.  \n That is, therefore, the aim of the Indian Ocean \nCommission, which strives to defend the interests of all \ncountries of the Indian Ocean in all areas. What it \nrepresents today and the place that it occupies in the \nlandscape of regional cooperation organizations is due, \nin large part, to the specialized agencies of the United \nNations. I would very much wish for that support to be \nstrengthened in the coming months, so that the \nCommission truly has the means to achieve its \nambitions. The observer status that the Commission \nobtained in the General Assembly on 4 December 2006 \nenabled our regional organization to acquire additional \nlegitimacy to work with the specialized agencies of the \nUnited Nations. We welcome those new prospects and \npaths of cooperation. \n The future of generations to come rests not so \nmuch on the vigour of our debate and the declarations \nwe make in this Assembly at its sixty-second session, \nbut on the action we take. Our people are demanding \nthat, collectively, we emerge with a clear vision, that \nwe display the courage and unrelenting commitment to \nbuild a world of peace, justice and equity that we can \ninhabit together in true harmony. Let us here resolve to \nbuild one world where every man, woman and child \ncan realize the true purpose and fulfilment of life. \n"

        "file_text": "At the outset, \nI offer my congratulations to Mr. Srgjan Kerim on his \nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly. Let \nme assure him of the Kingdom of Tonga\u2019s cooperation, \nand of every confidence that the sixty-second session \nof the General Assembly will be productive and \nsuccessful under his very able leadership. I also wish to \ncommend Her Excellency Sheikha Haya Rashed \nAl-Khalifa of the Kingdom of Bahrain for her \ndedication in guiding the work of the sixty-first session \nof the General Assembly. I also take this opportunity to \ncongratulate the new Secretary-General, Mr. Ban \nKi-moon, and to assure him of Tonga\u2019s support during \nhis tenure in office. \n As the United Nations advances well into its \nsixty-second year, we can ask ourselves how we have \nfared in the stewardship of our world. Have we passed \nthe test or have we been found wanting? The plethora \nof outstanding issues, unfulfilled commitments, and \nnew and evolving global challenges reaffirms the \nrelevance of the United Nations as the only multilateral \ninstitution that can appropriately deal with these \ncomplex global issues. \n The year 2007 marks the halfway point towards \nthe target date for accomplishment of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs), which were endorsed by \nworld leaders as a road map to a better world by the \nyear 2015. As the President rightly observed, \n\u201c[a]chieving the MDGs is not solely a test of our \nability to deliver on our promises; it is, above all, a test \nof our moral obligations and the values that are \nenshrined in the Charter\u201d (A/62/PV.1). \n The process of an annual ministerial review of \nprogress made in the implementation of development \ngoals and targets, which commenced this year, \nprovides us with a tool to gauge progress at the \nnational level and bring into focus outstanding issues \nto be addressed, as well as highlighting positive \nexperiences and best practices that can be replicated by \nMember States. In addition, the President\u2019s proposal to \nhold a MDG leaders meeting during the sixty-second \nsession is very welcome. \n Any meaningful discussion of the MDG cannot \nbe had without also referring to financing for \ndevelopment. Since the landmark agreement endorsed \nin Monterrey in 1992, the scorecard has been mixed. \nWhile considerable advances have been made in some \nareas, stagnation or retrogression has been experienced \nin others. One such area is in the fulfilment of \ncommitments by developed countries to achieve the \ntarget of 0.7 per cent of gross national product (GNP) \nfor overseas development assistance by 2015. Tonga \njoins others in calling on donor countries that have not \nfulfilled their obligations to recommit themselves to \nmeeting the targets by 2015. We also look forward to a \npositive outcome in the forthcoming High-level \nDialogue on Financing for Development to be held \nlater this month as a lead-up to the Follow-up \nInternational Conference in Doha, Qatar, in 2008. \n Tonga has emphasized in other forums that, in \norder to achieve the MDGs, it is also imperative that \naffordable, clean and efficient energy be available to \nall through improved access to reliable and affordable \nenergy services. Technical and financial support, \nhowever, is required to ensure that the poor derive \ntangible benefits from public investment in the energy \nsector. \n The central theme selected for the general debate, \nresponding to climate change, is of particular relevance \nto small island developing countries, including Tonga. \nClimate change is not regarded as just an \nenvironmental issue, since it has implications for \neconomic growth, sustainable development and the \nachievement of the MDGs. Tonga commends the \nSecretary-General for his laudable initiative to hold the \nrecent high-level dialogue, which infused political \nmomentum and set the stage for the Bali Conference of \nthe Parties to the United Nations Framework \nConvention on Climate Change, to be held in \nDecember 2007. Tonga supports the view that \nnegotiations must be advanced towards a global and \ncomprehensive agreement on a post-2010 framework to \nlimit global emissions to avoid dangerous climate \nchange. It is important, therefore, that this process be \ncompleted by 2009. \n Tonga further supports the position that the \nessential parameters of such a global framework should \ninclude the following items: enhanced leadership by \nthe industrialized countries on emission reductions; \nincentives for developing countries to act, but without \nsacrificing economic growth or poverty reduction, and \nin a manner fully consistent with the principle of \ncommon but differentiated responsibilities; \nsignificantly increased support for adaptation in \ndeveloping countries, especially the least developed \ncountries and small island developing States; and \nstrengthened technology development and \ndissemination, with new approaches to financing, \nincluding better use of market-based approaches. \n The threat of terrorism continues to be real, and it \nis a complex global issue. Following the adoption of \nthe United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy \n(resolution 60/288) in September 2006, success will be \nguaranteed only if the Strategy is fully implemented. \nTonga looks forward to positive progress leading to the \nfinalization of a comprehensive convention on \ninternational terrorism during the sixty-second session \nof the General Assembly. \n As regards peacekeeping operations, we are all \nwitnessing a surge in the demand for peace operations, \nwith over 100,000 personnel currently serving in the \nfield. It is also projected that there will be a further \nincrease in numbers as new and expanded missions are \napproved. This development will certainly provide a \nmajor operational challenge to the institution. Tonga \nremains committed to supporting international \npeacekeeping efforts where we are requested to provide \nsuch assistance and in keeping with the policy of my \nGovernment. We commend the contributions of United \nNations peacekeepers in fulfilling the role of helping \nparties to end hostilities. \n Tonga supports the ongoing work on the reform \nagenda of the United Nations and commends the \ncommitment by the Secretary-General to breathe new \nlife and inject renewed confidence into a strengthened \nUnited Nations firmly anchored in the twenty-first \ncentury, and effective, efficient, coherent and \naccountable. On the outstanding issue of Security \nCouncil reform, we need to remind ourselves of our \ncommitment in the 2005 World Summit Outcome \n(resolution 60/1) to early reform of the Council. Tonga \nlooks forward to the forthcoming intergovernmental \nnegotiations and anticipates that the process will \nprovide the necessary impetus for decisive action to \nbring closure to the issue. \n On the question of Taiwan, Tonga is of the view \nthat maintaining the sovereignty and territorial \nintegrity of Member States and non-interference in the \ninternal affairs of Member States are among the \ncardinal principles enshrined in the Charter of the \nUnited Nations. Thus, Tonga continues to adhere to the \none-China policy, recognizing Taiwan as an integral \npart of China. \n Regional integration and cooperation are vital for \nsmall island developing countries of the Pacific in view \nof their remoteness, small size and narrow economic \nbase. The Pacific Plan is currently in its second year of \nimplementation; it focuses on four overlapping pillars, \nincluding economic growth, sustainable development, \ngood governance and security. In this regard, Tonga \ncommends the Secretary-General for attaching \nimportance to strengthening United Nations \ncooperation with our regional organizations. Tonga \ncontinues to support the process of regional \ncooperation and looks forward to hosting the thirty-\neighth annual Pacific Islands Leaders Forum in \nNuku\u2019alofa later this month. \n After 10 years of negotiations, the World Trade \nOrganization (WTO) welcomed Tonga on 27 July 2007 \nas the 151st member of the organization. As a small \nisland developing nation, there are many challenges \nand obstacles to gaining full benefit from the global \ntrading system, including productive capacity and \ninfrastructure. It is, therefore, imperative that the Doha \ndevelopment Round negotiations be concluded \nexpeditiously, with a meaningful development package, \nincluding the elimination of all export subsidies, \nimproved market access and enhanced special and \ndifferentiated treatment. Last year, we urged the donor \ncommunity to move forward with the delivery of \u201caid \nfor trade\u201d independent of the Doha Round. In this \nregard, we wish to commend our donor partners for the \neffort to improve the delivery of aid for trade in Asia \nand the Pacific to ensure that countries take full \nadvantage of the open global market in the lead-up to \nthe WTO global aid for trade review that will be held \nlater this year. \n Tonga continues to advocate for labour mobility \nas a vehicle for achieving its pro-poor strategies. \nEarlier this year, the New Zealand Government \ninstituted a seasonal labour programme for agricultural \nworkers from five kick-start countries in the Pacific, \nincluding Tonga. We view this as an important and \npositive step towards wider acceptance of this type of \nmodel by developed countries as an option for \nresolving seasonal labour shortages. \n Our Legislative Assembly this year passed a law \nthat allows dual citizenship. The new law gives due \nrecognition to the large number of Tongans residing \noverseas, their significant contribution to the economy \nand their desire to still have links to their homeland. \n Last year at this rostrum, we provided a brief \nsynopsis of the state of play in the process leading to \nthe greater democratization of Tonga\u2019s political system. \nRegrettably, while the report of the National \nCommittee on Political Reform was being deliberated \nby the Legislative Assembly, the supporters of one of \nthe three models of reform rioted, burned and \ndestroyed 80 per cent of the central business district, \nwhich resulted in the loss of eight lives. In a matter of \na few hours, the tally of the damage incurred equated \nto a loss of 20 per cent of the gross domestic product. \nA state of emergency was subsequently declared by the \nGovernment, initially for a one-month period, but has \nby necessity and by demand been continuously \nextended to prevent any further civil disturbance. \nIn our hour of need, Tonga sought the support of \nits neighbours New Zealand and Australia to assist \nlocal police in establishing order. They responded \npromptly and appropriately with the deployment of \nmilitary and police personnel. Within a period of two \nweeks, the role played by our friendly neighbours, as \nwell as by the Tonga Defence Services and the Tonga \nPolice Force, provided security and law and order for \nthe country. \n A reconstruction committee under my \nchairmanship is coordinating the reconstruction of \nNuku\u2019alofa Township. Government, however, is fully \ncommitted to bringing all of the perpetrators of that \nhorrendous event to full accountability for their \nactions, and the court cases are ongoing. At the same \ntime, efforts are in progress on a process of national \nreconciliation. \n A tripartite select committee of the Legislative \nAssembly was also established to review the political \nreform agenda. The report of the tripartite committee \nwas recently tabled to the Legislative Assembly, where \na timetable was approved for the full implementation \nof political reform by 2010. \n We seek the understanding and support of the \ninternational community as we continue with the \nhealing of the wounds through the national \nreconciliation process, the rebuilding of the central \nbusiness district, as well as the transition into a more \ndemocratic political system that is relevant to the \neconomic, social and cultural architecture of the \nnation. \n It has been emphasized time and again that what \nis needed in the United Nations is to close the gap \nbetween rhetoric and actions. There has been much \nrhetoric and commitment, but the world will not judge \nus on rhetoric. The world will judge us on our outputs \nand on what we deliver. Let us face up to our \nresponsibility, fulfil our promises so as to equate \nrhetoric with action, and show the people whose lives \nwill be impacted by the decisions we make in this Hall \nthat we can be trusted to deal effectively with global \nissues that require global solutions. \n"

        "file_text": "I \nwould like to congratulate you, Sir, on your election to \npreside over the General Assembly. I would also like to \nreiterate Chile\u2019s support for the new Secretary-General. \nChile will participate in all the undertakings of the \nUnited Nations.  \n The international community knows about my \npeople\u2019s devotion to peace, justice, freedom and \nsolidarity. It knows that this country at the southern \nedge of the world   despite the size of its economy \nand population, as well as its remoteness   has \nespoused the great causes of humankind. It knows \nabout Chile\u2019s contributions in the areas of poverty, \nAIDS, hunger and social cohesion. It knows that we \nhave made substantial contributions to the promotion \nand observance of human rights. It knows that, even in \ndifficult times, we have always supported international \nlaw and world peace   with dignity and \ndetermination. \n Mine is a country that believes in progress and in \nthe ability of human beings to be the authors of their \nown destiny and to build a better future. The world is \nan uncertain place when we are not able to act together. \nGlobalization becomes unpredictable when we are not \nable to manage it. That is the reason we need to \npromote the greatest possible sustainable development \nwith greater justice and social equity for all \nhumankind. To that end, it is crucial that we craft \nagreements and strengthen multilateral institutions, all \nthe while making progress in the areas of disarmament \nand non-proliferation; that we begin negotiations on \nthe reform and expansion of the Security Council; and \nthat we make progress in the area of management \nreform   on the subject of which Chile, South Africa, \nSweden and Thailand have put forth a proposal for the \nconsideration of Member States. \n The major tasks facing us today will probably \nrequire more consensus-building than ever before \nknown. How can we ensure once and for all that human \nrights are respected throughout the entire world? How \ncan we halt climate change on all continents and \noceans? How can we make equity and social justice for \nall the men and women of the world a concern of all \ncountries? Those are the major challenges which we, as \nan international community, must today tackle urgently \nand with dedication. \n Chile will vigorously promote universal respect \nfor human rights. The establishment of a fairer and \nmore humane international order will be possible only \nif we place respect for the dignity of the human person \nat the heart of the debate. We in Chile will work not \nonly to improve our own practices and domestic \nlegislation, but also to promote the strengthening of \nhuman rights, economic and social development, peace \nand security. \n As the General Assembly is aware, human rights \nhave been at centre of Chile\u2019s recent history. For the \ncitizens of my country no place is too remote nor any \nsituation too foreign when it comes to protecting \nhuman lives and dignity. \n We are pleased with the progress made in the area \nof norms, both internationally and nationally. We \nwelcome the adoption and opening for signature of the \nInternational Convention for the Protection of All \nPersons from Enforced Disappearance, which fills a \ngap in the system for protecting human rights from a \ncrime against humanity. Chile signed that instrument \nand expects to ratify it in the near future. In addition, \nthe Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture \nand Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or \nPunishment is in the process of being approved by our \nNational Congress. \n The new United Nations Human Rights Council \nshould continue to promote a more effective \ninternational regime for protection, early warning and \npromotion in the area of human rights. We also \nstrongly support the United Nations Declaration on the \nRights of Indigenous Peoples, which is a very \nimportant step in the recognition of the rights of those \npeoples. \n We shall also work to ensure that democracy and \nfreedom are consolidated throughout the world. \nDemocracy is a universal value, but it is a process that \nmust be supported over time. That is why we will \nstrongly support the United Nations Democracy Fund, \nso that this aspiration becomes a reality. \n We are studying with concern the scientific \nevidence showing the devastating effects of climate \nchange on our planet. Yesterday we were discussing its \nsocial, human and economic effects. We are glad that \nthe world is beginning to take notice of this. It is clear \nthat there is a serious threat to our future, and we must \nact now. \n In Chile, for example, we have seen that the \nspeed with which the glaciers are melting has doubled \nin the past ten years. Our southern zones are, in turn, \nexperiencing a dangerous depletion of the ozone layer, \njeopardizing the health of our citizens. Although we are \nnot the ones mainly responsible for this deterioration, \nChile has begun to take the necessary steps to mitigate \nthe effects of global warming and to combine efforts so \nthat, as a matter of urgency, solutions may be found. \n As has been said here many times, there is no \ntime to lose. The consensus that we must reach, the \neffort to enlist the greatest possible support, is \ncomparable only to the international mobilization that \nled to the adoption of the San Francisco Charter six \ndecades ago. If we do not act now, the future of all \nhumanity will be endangered. \n Therefore we all have the obligation to construct \na new global political consensus to generate collective \naction capable of solving the problem in accordance \nwith the principle of shared but differentiated \nresponsibility and within the framework of the United \nNations. All of us must contribute, but especially those \nwho have already polluted and achieved development. \nWe ask the developed countries to pledge technical and \nfinancial assistance to the developing countries that \nmost need help with their efforts to combat climate \nchange. \n We strongly hope that at the meetings of the \nParties to the Framework Convention on Climate \nChange and the Kyoto Protocol to be held in December \nin Bali, progress will be made in defining the \nparameters of a post-2012 process. We also hope that \nthe developed countries will make greater \ncommitments regarding mitigation, adaptation, \ntechnology transfer and financing. \n We must, however, realize that the greatest efforts \nby the developed countries will not suffice to halt \nclimate change. It is also necessary that the developing \ncountries take additional emission reduction actions in \nthe framework of a global effort within the scope of the \nConvention. \n I am the bearer of a message of hope as well for \nall nations seeking to eradicate poverty and build fairer \nand more inclusive societies. We still have a lot to do. \nNonetheless, we can say that Chile has moved closer to \nbecoming the country that we so deeply desire, \nenjoying greater prosperity and greater social justice. \nWe are eradicating poverty. In 17 years of democracy, \nwe have reduced poverty from 40 to 13.7 per cent. We \nhave achieved practically all of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals. It is an ambitious objective, but \none that is justified by our achievements. We are \nconstructing a social welfare system that guarantees the \nsocial rights of Chilean men and women from the \ncradle to old age. We are protecting our children   \ngirls and boys, our young people, our mothers and \nfathers, grandfathers and grandmothers. \n We know that we are not alone in this effort. \nPoverty, hunger, extreme inequality and exclusion are \nrealities that exist all over the world. With regard to the \nfulfilment of the Millennium Goals, progress has been \nmade in some regions, but it is not enough. We, \ntherefore, join in the commitment to the forthcoming \nlaunch of the Global Business Plan for Millennium \nDevelopment Goals 4 and 5   that is, to greatly \nreduce maternal and child mortality. We do not need \nnew commitments; we simply need to fulfil the \ncommitments already made. \n My country supports the idea of holding an \ninternational conference to focus concerted worldwide \nefforts on attaining the Millennium Goals, proposed by \nthe Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, so that the \ndream of also globalizing the prosperity that some have \nalready achieved can come true in the not too distant \nfuture. \n We can also emphasize innovative development \nfinancing mechanisms for development in order to \ncombat inequality and promote social cohesion. \n We are on the right track. As the Assembly knows \nwell, the Presidents of Brazil, France, Chile, Spain and \nGermany, among others, organized an Initiative on \nAction Against Hunger and Poverty and their \nUNITAID Initiative, through which we have managed \nto collect hundreds of millions of dollars to finance the \npurchase of drugs to treat AIDS, tuberculosis and \nmalaria; these medicines have been given to hundreds \nof thousands of children, mainly in Africa. \n But we have to do more. Social equity and the \nconstruction of a world with a human face should \nbecome a central topic on our global agenda. \n The three major causes that I have mentioned can \nbe tackled only by common accord of the international \ncommunity. Hence, the importance of our commitment \nto effective and efficient multilateralism, with the \nUnited Nations as its centre of gravity. We are at a \ncomplex juncture, but one of great opportunity. What \nwe do or fail to do in the next few years will determine \nthe future of our descendants. It all depends on us. \nNow is the time to act. \n"

        "file_text": "As I address \nthis body, may I seize this opportunity to extend to \nMr. Kerim my sincere and warm congratulations on his \nwell-deserved election to preside over the sixty-second \nsession of the General Assembly. \n In view of the constraints of time and in \ndeference to all, I shall take no more than 10 minutes \nto share some facts and reflections on the situation in \nmy country, as well as on select issues of regional and \ninternational concern. \n Timor-Leste is encouraged by Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s organization of the high-level event on \nclimate change, to be followed by negotiations on the \nUnited Nations Framework Convention in Bali. The \nindustrialized countries of the North bear enormous \nresponsibility for the damage done to our fragile \necosystems. They, more than anyone else, must reverse \nthe course and lead the effort to save the Earth. \nHowever, we in the developing world cannot escape \nour own responsibilities. The demographic explosion \nand our own efforts to catch up with the rich North all \ncontribute to the pressures on our lands, forests, rivers, \nlakes and oceans. Let us therefore set rhetoric aside \nand work as one to redress the enormous damage we \nhave done to the common home of humankind. \n As to the political situation in Timor Leste, in \nApril and May 2006, less than five years after my \ncountry\u2019s accession to full independence, we were \nplunged into our first major crisis. The then President \nof the Republic, the Speaker of the National Parliament \nand the Prime Minister jointly agreed to seek the \nUnited Nations urgent assistance and the rapid \nintervention of friendly countries. I wish to reiterate \nhere our sincere gratitude to those who came to our \nassistance in that time of need. We are forever grateful \nto Malaysia, Australia and New Zealand, as well as to \nPortugal, which dispatched a fully equipped company \nof its elite force, the National Republican Guard. The \nSecurity Council approved the deployment of an \nintegrated mission, the United Nations Integrated \nMission in Timor-Leste (UNMIT), with a police \ncomponent of 1,740 police. The deployment of the \nUnited Nations police contingent was understandably \nextremely slow, and the projected force was complete \nonly in January 2007. \n We have made significant progress since the dark \nweeks of April and May 2006. Presidential and \nlegislative elections were held between April and June \n2007. The election campaign period was mostly free of \nviolence and there were few reported irregularities. \nThough we are proud that the two elections were \nmanaged by our own agencies, we also acknowledge \nthat the active support of UNMIT and other United \nNations agencies, including the United Nations \nDevelopment Programme, were indispensable and \ncrucial to enable us to undertake such a complex task. \n While the result of the presidential election was \nwarmly welcomed by all, including the defeated \ncandidate, the same did not happen when a new \nGovernment was announced following the 30 June \nlegislative election. FRETILIN, the former ruling \nparty, won most votes, but not enough to govern on its \nown; after several weeks of lobbying, it failed to forge \na coalition to govern. A post-election four-party \nparliamentary alliance opposed to FRETILIN secured \n37 seats in the new Parliament of 65 seats, was invited \nto form a Government. There was violence in a number \nof locations in which local law enforcement elements \nwere implicated, but the swift intervention of the \nUnited Nations police and the International \nStabilization Force (ISF) succeeded in quickly \ncontrolling the situation. Our own defence force played \na constructive role in helping to defuse the violence. I \nalso acknowledge the role played by the FRETILIN \nleadership in restraining its more passionate followers. \n Law and order have been restored. However, the \nrelative tranquillity prevailing in the country is \nprecarious and due in large measure to the effective \nrole played by United Nations police, ISF and our own \ndefence force. That will remain the case until such time \nas our police force has been reconstructed and turned \ninto a credible and effective force. That will take two \nto five years at a minimum. I wish to assure all that, in \nthe meantime, the East Timorese will pursue national \ndialogue so that we can reconcile and heal the wounds \nof the past. \n As to the social situation in Timor Leste, the 2006 \ncrisis caused widespread looting and destruction in the \ncapital. More than 30 people died, more than 100 were \nwounded, and tens of thousands were displaced. We are \nslowly recovering. However, tens of thousands of \npeople remain in precarious camps in the capital and \nelsewhere. I thank the international community, the \nUnited Nations and its agencies, the International \nOrganization for Migration, and international \nnon-governmental organizations for their generous and \nprompt assistance. The new Government has pledged \nto cooperate with all to address the situation of \ninternally displaced persons. \n Last year\u2019s late rains, floods and a locust plague \nhave caused significant damage to our subsistence \nagriculture sector. As a result, an acute food shortage is \nforeseen in the coming months. The Government is \nplanning to purchase significant amounts of food items \nin the regional markets to make up for the food \nshortage. \n Endowed with some oil and gas resources, Timor-\nLeste cannot complain of not having enough financial \nmeans to turn our economy around and lift the living \nstandards of our people. According to a recent report of \nthe Asian Development Bank, Timor-Leste\u2019s economy \nwill see a strong 22-per-cent growth this year due to \nour oil revenues. \n However, all this is not enough to improve the \nliving standards of the people. The vast majority of the \npeople who have been poor for centuries should not \nwait. I have pledged to be the President of the poor and \nI intend to be their best advocate. I am establishing a \nfast-track mechanism under my personal leadership to \nprovide direct assistance to individuals, groups or rural \ncommunities. The idea is that it should take no more \nthan 10 working days for a decision to be made on a \nproject and for the first instalment of a grant to be \ndisbursed. Coupled with public investments in \ninfrastructure   roads, bridges, port and airport   and \nin the agriculture sector, Timor-Leste should see, in the \nmedium term, a significant reduction of unemployment \nand a decrease in poverty levels. \n Regarding the presence of the United Nations, we \nare cognizant of the fact that the international \ncommunity faces a number of critical situations around \nthe world   in the Middle East, Somalia, the Sudan-\nDarfur, Iraq and Afghanistan, to mention but a few   \nthat are far more serious than the situation in my \ncountry and that may be of greater strategic importance \nand have greater implications for regional and world \npeace. We hope that as the situation progresses, the \nPeacebuilding Commission will consider placing \nTimor-Leste on its agenda as a follow-up to UNMIT. \n I now turn to the issues of human rights, the rule \nof law and justice. At the time that sovereignty was \ntransferred to the people of Timor-Leste, in May 2002, \nwhat existed was no more than the sketch   the \nidea   of a modern, democratic State. We had to build \nour country from scratch. While we failed in many \nareas, we succeeded in others. We have succeeded in \nnot abandoning our deep commitment to our human \nrights and the rule of law. Timor-Leste stands among \nthe very few that have ratified all seven core human \nrights treaties.  \n Timor-Leste seeks a seat on the Human Rights \nCouncil for the term 2008-2011, and we are \nparticularly pleased and grateful that many countries \nhave so far expressed support for our candidacy. I wish \nto assure everyone that as a member of the Council, \nTimor-Leste will favour dialogue on human rights \nsituations and will accord priority to strengthening \nthematic procedures, promoting the ratification of \nexisting human rights treaties and strengthening \nnational and regional human rights mechanisms. \n Next, I shall discuss the Truth and Friendship \nCommission. In August 2005, the Presidents of Timor-\nLeste and Indonesia inaugurated a forward-looking \npolicy and mechanism of truth-finding as a means to \naddress the violence of 1999, when the two countries \nparted ways. While there were some calls for the \nestablishment of an ad hoc international tribunal to try \nthose responsible for the 1999 violence, the leaders of \nthe two countries opted instead for a binational version \nof the South African truth and reconciliation process. \nThat was a novel and unique approach to redressing the \nwrongs of the past, although, being untested, it \nprovoked much criticism and opposition in certain \nquarters. \n With regard to international and regional \nrelations, we are expanding and consolidating our \nrelations with the region and the rest of the world. We \nare an active member of the Association of Southeast \nAsian Nations (ASEAN) Regional Forum and are \nworking towards full membership in ASEAN. We are \nan active observer in the Pacific Islands Forum and a \nmember of the Comunidade dos pa\u00edses de Lingua \nPortuguesa (CPLD). \n I shall now turn to some international issues of \nconcern to Timor-Leste. With regard to the situation in \nMyanmar, I wish to say that, as a country of the region, \nTimor-Leste is following the developments there with \ndeep concern and disappointment. As human beings \nand friends, we are distressed at the deteriorating \nsocial, humanitarian and political conditions in that \nneighbouring country. The leaders of Myanmar must \nnot continue to hold Nobel Peace Prize laureate Daw \nAung San Suu Kyi and the entire nation hostage to a \nmindset that belongs to the cold war and to policies \nthat have brought international opprobrium and \neconomic ruin to a country endowed with vast natural \nresources and a very proud people. \n With regard to nuclear proliferation, Timor-Leste \ncommends the six-party talks on North Korea, which \nhave achieved some modest positive results in inducing \nthat country to reverse its nuclear-weapons capability. \nThat modest success shows that patient diplomacy can \nmake progress on even the most intractable conflicts \nwhen the parties involved identify common concern \nand interest. \n On the other hand, Timor-Leste is deeply \nconcerned about the climate of mistrust and \nconfrontation regarding the situation in Iran. Iran is \nentitled to explore all peaceful means to acquire \ntechnology that would make it less reliant on \nnon-renewable sources of energy. No one denies that \nIran or any other nation has that right. However, Iran \nmust do more to cooperate fully with the International \nAtomic Energy Agency and to reassure its neighbours \nand the rest of the world that it is not seeking to \nacquire nuclear-weapons capability. \n Asia is the most nuclearized region of the world. \nI do not know that we should be proud of such a status. \nMutually assured destruction   MAD   is indeed \nmadness, as the acronym itself suggests. Our scientists \nhave developed Frankenstein\u2019s monsters that may well \ndestroy us all   either by design, if the weapons fall \ninto the hands of non-State actors, or by accident. \n Concerning the death penalty, Timor-Leste is part \nof a cross-regional initiative calling for a moratorium. \nWe note that the trend towards the worldwide abolition \nof the death penalty continues. \n As for the situation in Darfur, Timor-Leste \ncommends the African Union, the United Nations, all \nthose in Government and those individuals who have \ndone their very best to end the suffering of the people \nin that region   suffering that is now compounded by \nnatural calamity. In the midst of such a tragedy, we can \nfind some consolation and inspiration as we see \nmillions of people around the world crossing the \nboundaries of religions and cultures and joining \ntogether in solidarity with the victims of Darfur. \n I now turn to the situation in Palestine. As a small \nand newly independent nation and a friend of Israel, \nTimor-Leste cannot remain indifferent to the suffering \nof the Palestinian people, who have many times been \nvictims   victims of Israel\u2019s obstinate policies of \noccupation and discrimination, victims of manipulation \nby regional Powers and victims of their own sectarian \ndivision and violence. While Timor-Leste does not \nsubscribe to the many one-sided anti-Israel resolutions \nadopted over the years in various United Nations \nbodies, the facts on the ground show a whole people \nliving on the edge of desperation as a result of decades \nof humiliation, exclusion and violence. Timor-Leste \njoins the rest of the international community in calling \nfor the implementation of the Road Map, leading to the \nformal establishment of a viable Palestinian State. \n With regard to Western Sahara, Timor-Leste is \nencouraged and commends both Morocco and the \nFrente POLISARIO for the recent talks held on Long \nIsland under the good offices of the United Nations.  \n Concerning indigenous peoples\u2019 rights, more than \n500 years ago   long after Chinese navigators and \nexplorers had circumnavigated the globe   European \nkings, navigators, missionaries, adventurers and \nmercenaries began the great European conquest of the \nworld. In the process, tens of millions of people were \nsubjugated and colonized, fortunes and empires were \nmade at the expense of the peoples with whom they \ncame into contact and new diseases were brought into \nthe new colonies. Slavery uprooted at least 10 million \nfrom the African continent. Millions of indigenous \npeoples were decimated by wars and diseases. Their \ndemise and their lands gave birth to new nations that \nwere alien to their sacred birthplaces. This very island \nof Manhattan was once the sovereign home of Native \nAmericans.  \n That is all part of the history of the world: the \nhistory of European conquest, with its glory and \ntragedy. Timor-Leste commends the General Assembly \nfor finally adopting the United Nations Declaration on \nthe Rights of Indigenous Peoples (resolution 61/295, \nannex). That is the least we can do to redress the grave \ninjustices done to some of the earlier civilizations of \nthe world. \n I now turn to the issue of United Nations reform. \nNegotiations on reform of the United Nations system, \nin particular of the Security Council, should begin. \nRather than seeking dramatic reforms, we may want to \nadopt an incremental approach. The Council must be \nincrementally expanded to include major Powers such \nas India, Indonesia, Japan, Brazil, South Africa and \nGermany. On the other hand, it is an absurdity that \nAsia, which contains almost half of the world\u2019s \npopulation, should be so grossly underrepresented.\n"

        "file_text": "Please accept  my congratulations, Mr. President, on your election as \nPresident of the General Assembly at its sixty-second \nsession. I wish you every success. \n We are currently experiencing a period of \ndramatic changes. Great opportunities are accompanied \nby considerable risks. Global structures are changing. \nStates, economies and societies are becoming \nnetworked as never before. That is what we call \nglobalization. \n The good thing about that development is that \nprosperity is increasing, and more and more people are \nescaping from poverty. The challenge that that \ndevelopment poses is that not everyone has their fair \nshare of this prosperity. There are considerable \nimbalances. We thus need a global awareness, beyond \nnational boundaries, of our joint responsibility in order \nto master the major challenges facing our world. \n Climate change is undoubtedly one of the central \nchallenges facing humanity today. I therefore very \nmuch welcome your decision, Mr. President, to make \nclimate change the focus of this year\u2019s session of the \nGeneral Assembly. Never before have the facts been so \nclear, the consensus among scientists so great or the \nneed for action so indisputable. Each and every country \nis affected by the impact of climate change. No one \ncountry can tackle it alone. Not to take action would \nincur immense costs and cause new global conflicts. \n What does that mean for the way ahead? In quite \nconcrete terms, it means that any contribution from \nindividual States or groups of States is welcome. \nHowever, I would like to add most emphatically that \nsuch contributions can only complement a post-Kyoto \nagreement under the auspices of the United Nations. \nThey can never replace it. \n This session of the General Assembly therefore \nhas to set the course for the next vital step: the climate \nconference in Bali. Environment ministers will have to \nagree in Bali on a clear road map so that negotiations \ncan be successfully concluded by 2009. There are three \nkey elements: a common understanding on the scale of \nemissions reduction, a common understanding on fair \nnational contributions and a common understanding on \nthe instruments we should use both to protect the \nclimate and to foster economic growth. \n The scope of the need for action is becoming \nincreasingly clear. We must at least halve global \nemissions by the middle of the century. For this we \nhave a clear guiding principle: the principle of \ncommon but differentiated responsibility. \nIndustrialized countries must embrace ambitious \nabsolute reduction targets. During the German \npresidency the European Union adopted bold targets \nfor 2020. All industrialized countries will have to \ndrastically reduce their per capita emissions. \n Emerging economies will first of all have to \ndecouple their economic growth from emissions. In the \nlong term, per capita emissions in both industrialized \ncountries and emerging economies will have to \nconverge at a level compatible with our global climate \nprotection target. \n Such a process of long-term convergence offers \nall countries scope to develop. It does not demand too \nmuch of anyone. There is no doubt in my mind that \nonly a United Nations agreement can provide the \ndependability this will require.  \n Climate protection will therefore be a litmus test \nof the international community\u2019s ability to act \neffectively in the twenty-first century. For, on our own \ncontinent, we Europeans know from our daily \nexperience that   although any individual country is \ntoo small to make a real difference   together we can \nachieve much. \n In the light of our experience, I believe three \nprinciples are of crucial importance to our common \nfuture. First, economic strength and social \nresponsibility belong together. This principle applies \nboth to how States treat their citizens and to how States \ntreat each other. It emphasizes the right and freedom of \neach individual to achieve their full potential. At the \nsame time, it upholds cohesion and solidarity, while \ncategorically rejecting isolationism and protectionism. \n That is why we are seeking a balanced and \ncomprehensive agreement on multilateral trade. In \nconcrete terms, this means that we have to bring the \nDoha Round to an early and successful conclusion. Too \nmuch time has been wasted. We have to seize the last \nchance for negotiations this autumn. Our aim must be \ntransparent financial markets and effective protection \nof intellectual property, as well as minimum legal and \nsocial standards. For I am convinced that there can be \nno fair competition without common ground rules. \n We can only achieve cohesion and solidarity in a \nglobal development partnership. With the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals, the international community has \nlaid down binding quantifiable targets and deadlines \nfor the first time. Together with its EU partners, \nGermany has undertaken to reach the United Nations \n0.7 per cent target no later than 2015. We stand by \nthese pledges. \n There can be no doubt that genuine partnership \nplaces all sides under an obligation   an obligation to \nstep up the fight against corruption, to aim for better \ngovernance and to better protect human rights. We \nwant to support Africa in particular. There have been \nencouraging developments on the continent but \nunfortunately, also, serious setbacks, for example in \nZimbabwe. \n \u201cGrowth and responsibility in the world \neconomy\u201d is, therefore, also the motto guiding this \nyear\u2019s German presidency of the Group of Eight (G-8). \n The second principle is that we have to \nstrengthen the effectiveness of the United Nations. In \nmy view, there is absolutely no doubt   the United \nNations is the place where binding joint responses can \nbe found to global challenges. But the United Nations \nis in need of reform. This is true, above all, of the \nSecurity Council. In many crisis situations it needs to \nbe able to come up quickly with universally binding \nproposals. To do this, it must have international \nlegitimacy. However, the present composition of the \nSecurity Council no longer reflects the world today. \nThere is, therefore, no alternative to adapting it to \npolitical realities. \n My country has over the past years been actively \ninvolved in this debate. Germany is prepared to assume \nmore responsibility, and to take on a permanent seat on \nthe Security Council. What we need now are tangible \nresults. We are by no means only at the start of our \nendeavours. The United Nations reform process has \nalready produced some results, such as the report of the \nHigh-level Panel on United Nations system-wide \ncoherence and the establishment of the Peacebuilding \nCommission. \n But time is short. There are numerous crises we \nhave to deal with right now. And notwithstanding the \nmany differing factors that have led to these crises, \nthey all have one thing in common: they can only be \nsolved multilaterally. The key to ending them is unity \nof purpose. This is particularly true with respect to \nIran. Iran has continuously worked on its nuclear \nprogramme in clear contradiction of the demands of the \nInternational Atomic Energy Agency and the United \nNations. Nobody should be in the slightest doubt as to \nthe dangerous nature of this programme. Iran is \nignoring Security Council resolutions. Iran is blatantly \nthreatening Israel. \n Let us not fool ourselves. If Iran were to acquire \nthe nuclear bomb, the consequences would be \ndisastrous, first and foremost for the existence of \nIsrael; secondly, for the entire region; and ultimately \nfor all of us in Europe and the world who attach any \nimportance to the values of liberty, democracy and \nhuman dignity. That is why we have to prevent Iran \nfrom acquiring nuclear arms. \n The international community must not allow \nitself to be divided or have its decisive response to \nIran\u2019s provocations undermined in any way. The world \ndoes not have to prove to Iran that Iran is building a \nnuclear bomb. Iran has to convince the world that it is \nnot striving towards such a bomb. \n Each and every German Chancellor before me \nhas shouldered Germany\u2019s special responsibility for the \nexistence of Israel. I, too, pledge to live up to this \nresponsibility that our history has bequeathed us. It is \none of the fundamental principles that guides my \ncountry. In other words, Israel\u2019s security is \nnon-negotiable for me as German Chancellor. And that \nbeing the case, we have to do more than pay lip-service \nto it. Together with its partners, Germany will continue \nto seek a diplomatic solution. With this aim in mind, \nGermany will   if Iran does not come around   \nfirmly advocate additional and harsher sanctions. \n Unity of purpose is also the key in the fight \nagainst international terrorism, and especially in our \nefforts aimed at security and stability in Afghanistan. \nUnity of purpose is also vital for ensuring a peaceful \nfuture in Kosovo, where NATO and the European \nUnion play a particularly active role. We want a \nsolution under United Nations auspices. All parties are \nnow called upon to show a willingness to compromise. \n We also strongly support the efforts of the Middle \nEast Quartet for peace in that region. Germany is a \nstaunch advocate of the vision of two States, within \nsecure borders and in peace, for the Jewish people in \nIsrael and for the Palestinians in Palestine. We \nwelcome the fact that both parties are continuing their \ntalks with great vigour, above all with a view to the \nMiddle East conference scheduled for November. \n The third principle is that we have to strengthen \nour shared immutable values. In my opinion, one of the \ngreat dangers of the twenty-first century is that crises \nand conflicts could give rise to a clash of civilizations. \nThis must not happen. For this reason, I plead for \ntolerance   tolerance as properly understood, not \n\u201canything goes\u201d masquerading as tolerance. Everybody \nmust be able to follow his or her own path, but it must \nbe a path within the international community, not \noutside it. \n This path is clearly departed from wherever \nmassive human rights violations are committed, as in \nDarfur. A human tragedy is being played out there. Too \nmuch time has already been squandered. Now is the \ntime to act. The crimes perpetrated there must not go \nunpunished. This path has been departed from in \nMyanmar, where human rights have likewise been \ndisregarded for years. I urge the Government not to use \nforce against the peaceful demonstrators and finally to \nmake way for a democratic future for the country. This \npath is also departed from when political assassinations \nare carried out, as in the case of Rafik Hariri or the \nrecent cowardly attack just a few days ago in Lebanon. \nThe Hariri tribunal must commence its work with all \npossible speed. I call on Syria to grant Lebanon \ndiplomatic recognition at long last. \n It is my fundamental conviction that we must, \ntime and again, muster the strength to assert our shared \nvalues of freedom and democracy. In order to do that, \nwe need an unshakeable foundation.  \n We have such a foundation: the Charter of the \nUnited Nations. It was written when Europe and wide \nswathes of the rest of the world lay in ruins. At the \nmost basic level, it is a statement that, notwithstanding \nall the dark chapters and tortuous turns of our history, \nuniversal human rights do exist. In other words, what it \nall comes down to is respecting and protecting the \ndignity of each individual person. That is the \nunderlying reason why we assemble here each year and \nwork together for the future of our peoples. \n Germany will do its utmost to advance that work. \nWe look forward to fruitful cooperation with all \npartners in the United Nations. \n"

        "file_text": "Allow  me to congratulate Mr. Kerim on his election as \nPresident of the General Assembly and to wish him the \ngreatest success in his work. \n After five years in office, we come to the General \nAssembly once again to inform members on issues \ncrucial to Colombian democracy. \n We have rejected the dismantling of the State and \nrefuse to enter into a statism that would wither private \ninitiative. We have reformed 420 State entities and are \ndetermined to work to that end until the last day of our \nGovernment. We seek a more efficient State at the \nservice of the community and not owned by political \nmachinations, union excesses or interest groups. \n We are committed to the development of an \nentrepreneurial society, in opposition to State or private \nmonopolies, in a nation with a consensus centred on \nproductivity, discipline and equity. We provide every \nspace for private initiative with social responsibility, \nwhich must be expressed in the transparency of \nrelations between investors and the State, in \nentrepreneurial solidarity with the community beyond \nthe legal minimums, and in labour relations framed by \nfraternity, contrary to savage capitalism and class \nstruggle. \n In sectors such as electricity, metallurgy and \nhealth, we have encouraged participatory trade \nunionism, with simultaneous responsibility in the \nsocial field and entrepreneurial management, distinct \nfrom traditional entitlement organization. We have \nincreased by 40 per cent the affiliation of workers to \nsocial security through the improved performance of \nthe economy and our fight against evasion. In the past \nfive years, the minimum wage has grown by 8 per cent \nabove inflation. Our per capita income has gone from \n$1,851 to $3,517. After adjustment in terms of \npurchasing power, it has increased from $6,468 to \n$9,456. For the first time in decades, the Gini \ncoefficient of income distribution has started to \nimprove. \n From the first day of my Government, with our \ndemocratic security policy we made the decision not to \ntolerate the murder of any Colombian and to defeat \nimpunity. The security situation has improved \nsubstantially. In 2002, Colombia suffered 29,000 \nhomicides, of which 196 were perpetrated against trade \nunionists, and we closed 2006 with a 40 per cent \nreduction in general violence and a 70 per cent \nreduction in violence against trade unionists. This year, \nthere are 6,714 Colombians with individual protection \nfrom the State, of which almost 1,200 are workers \nbelonging to trade unions, at a budgetary cost of almost \n$39 million. \n In our struggle against impunity, between the \nbudgets for 2002 and 2008 we will have increased the \nresources for the judicial branch and for the Attorney \nGeneral\u2019s office by 76 per cent and 78 per cent, \nrespectively. The budget for the special unit of the \nAttorney General\u2019s office devoted to cases of the \nmurder of trade unionists has increased by 40 per cent. \nThe unit oversees more than 300 cases prioritized by \ntrade union movements. \n The fight against impunity for the murder of \nunionized workers is being carried out under the \nguidelines of the International Labour Organization \n(ILO), in agreement between Government, workers and \nemployers. Reports on the progress made, submitted by \nthe ILO office in Colombia, have been positive. \n Allow me to affirm before the United Nations \nthat murders and kidnappings have been the work of \nterrorists. First, it was the Marxist guerrillas who, in \nintroducing their perverse scheme of a so-called \ncombination of all forms of struggle, murdered, \nkidnapped and penetrated sectors of workers, students, \npoliticians and journalists. Then came the \nparamilitaries, and they did the same, murdering \nworkers and accusing them of collaborating with the \nguerrillas, which in reciprocity murdered those whom \nthey believed to be friends with the paramilitaries. In \ncertain parts of the country, the confrontation between \nthe two guerrilla factions that still exist leads to the \nmurder of workers. \n Overcoming that scourge once and for all is an \ninalienable objective of our democratic security policy. \nIn that regard, our three Government objectives are to \nconsolidate democratic security, strengthen investor \nconfidence, and achieve our social programme, which \nis more ambitious than the millennium social goals that \nwe hope to meet before the date set by the United \nNations. \n With regard to democratic security, we are \nwinning, but we have not won yet. With persistence \nand transparency, Colombia will overcome terrorism \nfinanced by illicit drugs. We have a long-lived, \nrespectable and ever-deepening democracy. We are \napproaching the fifth electoral contest presided over by \nmy Government, and the transparency and \neffectiveness of the guarantees offered to all \ncontenders are increasingly evident. There are 86,347 \nregistered candidates of 235 different political origins \nto fill 18,332 posts by direct election. This is \nhappening in a country that, five years ago, was facing \n60,000 terrorists, and where about 11,000 still remain. \nTo fight them, we deepen democracy instead of \nrestricting it, protect liberties instead of suppressing \nthem, and stimulate dissent instead of silencing it. Our \nfight against terrorism is being observed by national \nand international critics, who can be in the country and \nsay what they please without restriction. \n Our democratic practice gives us the political \nauthority to say that those who take up arms financed \nby illicit drugs are not insurgents against oppression \nbut terrorists against liberty. We will not refuse to \nnegotiate with them if they cease their violent actions, \nbut we will not allow for negotiation to become a trap \nthat enables the destruction of our democracy. We have \nachieved the demobilization of 46,000 members of \ndifferent factions and we are carrying out a costly and \ncomplex reintegration process with them that requires \ntruth, justice and redress for the victims. \n Thus, I now turn to the humanitarian agreement \nto free kidnapped people being held by terrorists of the \nFuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia   \nEj\u00e9rcito del Pueblo (FARC). Most of those were \nkidnapped before or during the time of the Caguan \ndemilitarized zone, which lasted 42 months. We do not \nunderstand why FARC should ask for a demilitarized \nzone to release the kidnapped when it had that option \nfor so long and did not free them. The country was \nwithout law and order for many years, and with no \nsecurity, which allowed its almost complete takeover \nby guerrillas and paramilitaries. Citizens do not want \nterrorists; they plead for the exclusive presence of the \nState in all regions. We are open to a humanitarian \nagreement, but we cannot allow demilitarized zones, \nwhich are ultimately concentration camps run by \nterrorists, nor can we permit those who are released \nfrom prison to return to crime, since it would be an \naffront to the sacrifice of the country\u2019s soldiers and \npolice. \n We have unilaterally freed 177 FARC members, \nas well as Rodrigo Granda, a high-ranking member of \nthat organization, who was freed at the request of the \nPresident of France, Nicolas Sarkozy. We have given \nour consent for many people and institutions to be \nfacilitators. The only answer from the terrorists has \nbeen the treacherous murder of 11 assemblymen from \nValle del Cauca, who were held hostage for more than \nfive years, and the ongoing assassinations of defenders \nof democracy, such as those perpetrated last Saturday, \nin which the victim was Julio C\u00e9sar Marentes and \nAlberto Mart\u00ednez Barbosa, two candidates for mayor in \nVillarrica and R\u00edo Blanco, Department of Tolima, and \nmembers of a political party from the Government\u2019s \ncoalition. \n The options open for the release of kidnapping \nvictims   including a French female citizen who is \nalso Colombian, and three American citizens   are not \noptions for the political positioning of terrorism. \nColombia will not permit the recovery of its legitimate \nand democratic sovereignty to be frustrated by \nrestoring national or international space to the \nmurdering power of terrorism. If terrorists want to be \ninvolved in politics, they have to renounce their bloody \nactivities and submit to the Constitution. \n Recently, the Government gave its permission to \nSenator Piedad C\u00f3rdoba, who is in the opposition to \nthe Government, to play a role as facilitator of the \nhumanitarian agreement. We also accepted the help of \nPresident Hugo Ch\u00e1vez of Venezuela, who will meet \nshortly with representatives of FARC. President \nCh\u00e1vez has invited some congressmen from the United \nStates to join him at that meeting, with my \nGovernment\u2019s support and suggestion that the \nAmerican delegation be bipartisan so as to preserve a \nbipartisan approach in its relations with Colombia. We \ncelebrate the positive willingness of the Government of \nthe United States. \n We have established certain reservations in order \nto defend our democracy\u2019s higher interests, and we \nencourage both President Ch\u00e1vez and Senator Piedad \nC\u00f3rdoba in their tasks because we are committed to the \nrelease of those being held hostage. The dismantling of \nparamilitarism, the weakening of the guerrillas, the \nrestoration of effective guarantees for democracy \nbeyond rhetoric, and the protection of a free press in a \ncountry where 15 journalists were once murdered in a \nyear   this year there has been one case   are results \nthat allow us to look the world in the eye and demand \nfull support for our democratic security policy. \n Today there is no paramilitarism. There are \nguerrillas and drug traffickers. The term \u201cparamilitary\u201d \nwas coined to refer to private criminal organizations \nwhose objective was to combat guerrillas. Today, the \nsole entity that combats guerrillas is the State, which \nhas recovered the monopoly it should never have lost. \n With the backing of the United Nations, we are \nstriving to assist displaced persons and to restore their \ndignity. We have multiplied by a factor of 10 the \nbudget to protect them. The phenomenon remains, but \nhas shown a significant reduction. \n Today, Colombians feel more confident. The \ninvestment rate has risen from 12 per cent of gross \ndomestic product to 26 per cent. Deficit and \nindebtedness are moving towards a net reduction. \nUnemployment, which stood at around 20 per cent, is \nnow at 11 per cent, and we are struggling to lower it to \n7 per cent. We are seeking to reduce poverty, which \nstood at close to 40 per cent, to a level no higher than \n35 per cent in 2010.  \n We are advancing towards the goal of achieving \nuniversal access to basic education. We have built an \nexcellent technical training system. We have gone from \n300,000 to 1.5 million families living in poverty that \nreceive a subsidy for their children\u2019s nutrition and \neducation. We aim in the next three years to meet the \ngoal of universal access to health services. We are \nworking hard to fulfil, during the current four-year \nperiod, the target of providing 5 million microcredits to \nan equal number of families with scarce resources, as a \nbasic strategy to overcome factors of exclusion. We \nhave gone from 3.7 million to 9 million children who \nhave benefited from our food programmes; we expect \nto reach 12 million in 2010. Our programme \n\u201cTogether\u201d, undertaken to eliminate extreme poverty, \ncombines a variety of social tools to cover 1.5 million \nfamilies. \n We reaffirm our commitment to fighting global \nwarming. We have gone from 37,000 natural gas \nvehicles to nearly 300,000. We have moved forward in \nthe construction of mass transportation systems in nine \ncities to reduce individual transportation. With \nindigenous communities, we have advanced in the \nconstruction of a series of villages that compose a \nbarrier for the complete recovery of the Sierra Nevada \nde Santa Marta. Our new forest law prohibits the \ndestruction of the rainforest and changes in land use. \nColombia has 578,000 square kilometres of tropical \nforest, which constitutes a lung of the planet. We will \nsoon have 80,000 forest-keeper families, who are \nremunerated by the State and are committed to \nabandoning illicit drug production and to supervising \nthe recovery of destroyed forests. One national \nobjective is the production of bio-fuels, for which we \nhave 44 million hectares of savannah, which will allow \ngreater development, initially in sugarcane and African \npalm, without jeopardizing food security or destroying \na single square millimetre of rainforest. \n I thank the United Nations system for all its \nsupport for Colombia, and I would like to highlight \nfour areas. The United Nations Office on Drugs and \nCrime has been the guarantor and supervisor of our \nforest-keeper families programme to protect the \nrainforest from the destructive threat of drug \ntrafficking. The International Labour Organization \ncarries out excellent work in our workers\u2019 protection \nprogramme. We have extended the mandate of the \nOffice of the High Commissioner for Human Rights to \nmaintain its presence in Colombia for the remainder of \nmy Government\u2019s term of office. Furthermore, various \nUnited Nations entities provide valuable support in the \ntask of assisting displaced people. \n We continue working for a society without \nexclusion and without class hatred, in permanent \nconstructive debate; one that looks for options, that \ndoes not stagnate in insurmountable antagonisms, that \nis respectful of the Democratic Constitution and guided \nby a long-term vision, and that sustains itself on an \ninclusive dialogue every day. \n I thank the international community for all its \nsupport. I invite everyone to visit Colombia, to talk to \nour fellow countrymen and women, and to experience \nthe collective spirit to fight for the greater happiness of \nfuture generations. Colombia should be known not \nthrough bad news, but rather through a great \nrelationship with Colombians themselves. I reiterate \nthe invitation to visit our country. \n"

        "file_text": "On  behalf of the people and Government of El Salvador, I \nwould like to extend the most sincere congratulations \nto Mr. Kerim on his being unanimously elected to \npreside over this session and to wish him every success \nin fulfilling his mandate. At the same time, I would like \nto express our appreciation of the dynamic work done \nby the Secretary-General and the Deputy Secretary-\nGeneral and call on them to continue to make every \neffort to strengthen the United Nations. \n Allow me to express once more our gratitude for \nthe important role played by the Organization, in \nparticular its contribution to conflict resolution and to \neconomic and social development, as so successfully \nexemplified in the peace process in Central America, \nbased on the 1987 Esquipulas II Agreement. Recently, \nCentral American countries celebrated the twentieth \nanniversary of the signing of that Agreement which set \nin motion the process of establishing a firm and lasting \npeace in Central America with a view to achieving, \nthrough dialogue, a peaceful solution to the Central \nAmerican crisis and promoting peacebuilding and \ndemocratization in the region.  \n Following a long process of transition from war \nto peace, from peace to democracy and to freedom, we \nare now focusing our efforts on the implementation of \nan economic and social development model that is just \nand equitable. In particular, we are promoting an \nintegration process that will allow us to strengthen our \ncapabilities and combine resources to more efficiently \ntackle and thus benefit from the process of opening up \nto world trade. \n In this context, I would like to mention, in \nparticular, a regional issue that has attracted the \nattention of the international community and that was \nreferred to yesterday in the media, namely, the Gulf of \nFonseca. As President of El Salvador, I wish to inform \nyou that I have submitted a formal initiative to the \nbrother States of Honduras and Nicaragua in order to \ndevelop a frank and sincere dialogue with a view to \nushering in a new era of cooperation in this area in \norder to truly establish a joint ownership regime and \nthereby facilitate the overall and sustainable \ndevelopment of the Gulf Zone for all its inhabitants. \nThat proposal, made yesterday, was well received by \nthe leaders of Honduras and Nicaragua. The three \nStates should begin a new era of collaboration and \ncooperation in order to tackle and fully resolve issues \nrelated to the Gulf. We should not leave any problem in \nthe Gulf of Fonseca unresolved, whether it be by a \nthree-nation or a two-nation approach. \n A topic of special interest for my country is \ninternational migration, in view of its positive impact \non countries of origin and destination alike, and, in \nparticular, because of the significant contributions \nimmigrants make to the economy. Our Government is \nmaking efforts for Salvadorians who have emigrated, \nsupporting them through our Embassies and \nConsulates. In this respect, we greatly appreciate the \nagreements and recommendations emanating from the \nUnited Nations High-level Dialogue on International \nMigration and Development, which reiterated the \nnecessity of fully respecting the human rights of \nmigrants and their families, who must be a central \nconcern of internal and external immigration policy of \nStates, including transit States.  \n I am pleased to confirm that the efforts I have \nmade in favour of Salvadorian immigrants, especially \nin the United States, have yielded positive results such \nas the extension of the Temporary Protected States \n(TPS) programme, which guarantees work permits and \nthe opportunity to reside in that country with no risk of \nbeing deported. Those efforts demonstrate my firm will \nto continue spearheading initiatives and efforts in order \nto stabilize migration for all of our fellow citizens. \n In the Central American region, we have made \nsignificant progress in different areas, but \nunfortunately, long-standing and emerging threats \ncould still affect the security of our citizens and the \nstability of our countries. It is therefore essential to \nunite our efforts to frame suitable national, regional \nand international policies.  \n Currently, in most of our countries, as well as in \nthe United States and Mexico, citizens are noting that \none of the greatest threats to democracy and economic \nand social development springs from the activities of \ngangs, generating a wave of violence and crime in an \nopen challenge to the established order. Those anti-\nsocial groups do not conform to the patterns of \ntraditional or ordinary crime, but gradually evolve into \nmore sophisticated forms of organized crime whose \nmanifestations can also be seen in countries outside the \ncontinent. Many countries represented here are not as \nyet faced with this threat. However, the criminal \nactivities of such groups are expanding, both \nsubstantively and quantitatively, as is actually apparent \nand thus the treatment of this issue requires action and \ncooperation of all States, especially in Latin America. \nAs for El Salvador, we are making efforts that have led \nto the reduction of crime and homicide perpetuated by \nsuch groups through joint actions involving our public \nsecurity authorities, the judicial system and the \nlegislative authority. At the same time, we are \ncoordinating efforts and adopting measures within the \nframework of security policies for Central America. \n We have to strengthen global cooperation in the \nfight against terrorism, which is one of the greatest \nthreats to peace and international security. The recent \nthwarted terrorist attacks in European countries and the \nrepeated threats by extremist groups to continue with \ntheir terrorist actions in different parts of the world are \na grave threat and danger looming over our society. \nConsequently, we welcome the efforts of Member \nStates of the United Nations to adopt a global counter-\nterrorism strategy, giving particular importance to \npreventing and combating terrorism on a unified, \ncoherent and coordinated basis. \n The Middle East is a region in which nations \nhave developed different missions and supported \ninitiatives for a just and lasting solution to the problem, \nwhile the United Nations itself has made undoubted \nefforts to that end, which, unfortunately, have not been \nsuccessful. \n We support any initiative or effort to redirect the \npeace process. In particular, we welcome the initiative \nto convene an international peace conference for the \nMiddle East in November. That initiative is a source of \nrenewed hope for achieving the long-awaited peace \nthat will allow all peoples of the region to live free \nfrom fear, violence and destruction. It would also \nestablish an environment conducive to political \ncooperation and to shared economic and social \ndevelopment. We recognize the Palestinian people\u2019s \nright to self-determination, as well as Israel\u2019s right to \nlive within secure and internationally recognized \nborders, so that both peoples can live in peace. \n Taiwan is a unique political reality in the \ninternational community. It has systematically \ndeveloped, in particular in recent years, under the \nleadership of President Chen Shui-bian. He has made \nhis country a modern, peaceful entity that is resolutely \ndetermined to promote peace and international \ncooperation. Given that reality, we acknowledge the \nlegitimate right of more than 23 million Taiwanese to \ndetermine their own future, just as other peoples have \ndone. That is why we support the initiative to have the \nGeneral Assembly review the case of Taiwan in the \nlight of current global realities, acknowledging the \nright of the Taiwanese to hold a referendum on joining \nthis international Organization. \n El Salvador will continue to play an active role in \nthe reform process of the United Nations, which, we \nreiterate, should be comprehensive. In that regard, \nsince States are responsible for complying with the \nobjectives of the Charter, we must strive not only to \nachieve consensus and move towards Security Council \nreform, but also to revitalize the General Assembly and \nthoroughly revise the mandate of the Economic and \nSocial Council. \n The current economic situation has improved for \nsome developing countries that have achieved \nacceptable rates of growth. However, international \ninstability in prices, commodities and raw materials   \nin particular the high prices for petroleum   is having \na negative impact on our development efforts. Indeed, \nglobal economic short- and mid-term imbalances must \nbe anticipated and prevented, and require the \ncoordination of international macroeconomic policy \ninvolving developed and underdeveloped countries. \n In an effort to review the criteria and conditions \nfor the extension of international cooperation, the first \nIntergovernmental Conference on Middle-Income \nCountries took place in Madrid on 1 and 2 March. At \nthe Conference, we identified several areas for \nstrategic action that could guide the efforts of \ninternational donors to contribute to the development \nof that group of countries. We thank the Government of \nSpain for its readiness to host the event and for the \nmeeting\u2019s success. We also express our gratitude to \nKing Abdullah II of Jordan and his Government for \nconvening the summit of the Group of Eleven in May, \nand in particular for the recommendation that resulted \nfrom that forum. \n Next October, my country, El Salvador, will host \nthe second International Conference on Development \nCooperation with Middle-Income Countries in order to \nfurther study international measures allowing us to \nmeet the Millennium Development Goals. We believe \nthat donor countries and international financial \norganizations should reassess their development \ncooperation policies with the principal aim of \nencouraging those countries which are responsibly \nimplementing transparent growth strategies that are \nadequately endowed in terms of finance management \nand of the quality and impact of projects. To the \nmiddle-income countries and the entire cooperating \ncommunity, including international financial \norganizations, I reiterate here our cordial invitation to \njoin us in the important event to take place in San \nSalvador in October. \n With respect to development, I would stress that, \nin the past 10 years, my country has reduced the level \nof overall poverty from 65 per cent to 30 per cent. One \nof my Government\u2019s priorities is and will continue to \nbe fighting extreme poverty, towards which we are \nimplementing a series of substantive social \nprogrammes. One of the most important of those is the \nSolidarity Network, through which we directly support \nfamilies living in extreme poverty, mainly in the rural \nareas, by granting health and education subsidies and \nby providing infrastructure, basic services and \nopportunities to enter the labour market through, inter \nalia, the provision of microcredit. We have also \nestablished a special health fund through which we \nhave increased basic health care for the most \nvulnerable sectors of the population, seeking to benefit \nmore than 4 million people through comprehensive \nprogrammes to include prevention and the promotion \nof health education campaigns. \n While we acknowledge that progress has been \nachieved and efforts made to improve the living \nstandards of the most vulnerable sectors of the country, \nwe must continue to enjoy international bilateral and \nmultilateral cooperation if we are to achieve higher \nlevels of well-being. Our Government is convinced that \nthe social sphere is not complementary to anything \nelse, but the basis of everything. \n One of the most disturbing challenges to the \npresent and future of the international community is \nglobal warming. In particular, as we learn in the \nimpressive report prepared by the United Nations \nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the \nharmful effects of climate change on all peoples have \ngrown alarming in their human, material, economic and \nenvironmental impacts, which are increasingly being \nfelt in countries and regions throughout the world. All \nStates must speedily and fully adopt corrective \nmeasures in order substantially to reduce greenhouse \ngas emissions so as to halt the trend towards \nirreversible and massive environmental degradation. To \nthat end, we urge developed countries to join in the \nefforts to curb that trend with responsibility and in a \ncommon but differentiated manner. \n Alongside international efforts for environmental \nprotection, the countries of Latin America, including \nthose of Central America, Mexico and Colombia, \nmembers of the Puebla-Panama Plan, are undertaking \nmeasures and coordinating regional and subregional \nactivities in the field of renewable and sustainable \nenergy as alternatives to fossil fuels. Concerned by the \ninstability of international hydrocarbon fuel prices, at \nthe previous session of the General Assembly we \nproposed that the topic be included on the agenda \nbecause of its impact on economic development, in \nparticular in developing countries. In the current \nsituation of ever-spiralling high prices, we reiterate \nthat proposal. We have been increasingly diverting \nprecious economic resources that could, in other \ncircumstances, be directed towards other programmes \nessential to our countries\u2019 human development.  \n That is why, at this global forum, we appeal to \nthe oil-producing countries to seek, on the basis of \ninternational cooperation and solidarity, to implement \nflexible mechanisms to prevent hydrocarbon fuel prices \nfrom drastically impacting developing countries. We in \nthe United Nations cannot ignore that issue, because \ncountries that depend on oil could be bankrupted in the \ncoming years. \n I must mention that, faced with high oil prices, \nwe are promoting several initiatives in El Salvador in \nthe area of alternative and renewable energy, such as \nbiofuels. One of those initiatives has led to the \nformulation of a bill on incentives for investing in \nrenewable energy. We also analysed the economic and \ntechnical feasibility of introducing a plan to produce \nethanol on a national scale. That is in addition to \nstepping up thermal energy, which in El Salvador \nalready represents 23 per cent of energy consumption \nwith the entry into operation of the new plant in the \neastern part of El Salvador. Similarly, we are beginning \ntechnical and financial feasibility studies to promote \nthe production of biodiesel through the establishment \nof a pilot plant and the use of different crops, which \nwill make it possible to promote reforestation and to \nreduce greenhouse gas emissions, relying for this on \nthe direct support of the United States, Brazil and \nColombia.  \n We believe that Latin American and other \ndeveloping countries could contribute substantively to \nglobal environmental conservation efforts. But efforts \nwill be limited if industrialized countries do not fully \nassume their responsibilities when it comes to the \nenvironment. \n Lastly, I would like to recall that we are all \nrepresentatives of our respective countries and they are \nthe ones that we must serve and protect from the \nthreats that we face. We are convinced that the future \nof humanity will depend on the decisions and actions \nthat we will adopt here and that we will implement in \nareas of common global interest. We have the \nresponsibility and obligation to act, and this we must \ndo in order to avert a problem of uncontrollable \nproportions.  \n We must understand that the future of humanity \nwill depend on the decisions and actions that we adopt \ntoday, but I would like to strongly emphasize that \npeople reach development as a result of perseverance, \norder, work, discipline and long-term vision. The \ntransformation process and the progress that has been \nachieved in economic and social policy in the \ndemocratic institutions of my country are the result of \nthe exercise of freedoms. Progress is built and gains \nmomentum when people work hard, persevere and \nhave full freedom, which makes it possible to move \ntowards the implementation of the greatest dream that \npeople have: to enjoy progress and social peace.  \n I invite the Assembly to combine their efforts to \nconsolidate freedoms in those countries that already \nenjoy them and to return freedoms to countries that do \nnot have them or have lost them. Let us remember that \nthe dearest freedom is the one that we do not have, that \nliberty is not missed until we lose it. Without freedom, \nthere is no economic and social progress. We must \nwork every day for freedoms that are threatened by \nextreme radicalism or populist demagoguery, the seeds \nthat destroy freedom. God bless the world. \n"

        "file_text": "Let me at the outset \ncongratulate the President on his election to the \npresidency of the General Assembly and to reassure \nhim of the Gambia\u2019s full support and cooperation \nduring his tenure in office. Let me also use this \nopportunity to express our appreciation of the excellent \nmanner in which the outgoing President of the General \nAssembly, Mrs. Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa managed the \naffairs of the Assembly at its sixty-first session. \n My delegation would also like to use this \nopportunity to once more congratulate our new \nSecretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, on his \nassumption of the leadership of the United Nations. \nThe Gambia is particularly delighted that Mr. Ban had \nthe opportunity to address the Summit of Heads of \nState and Government of the African Union during his \nmeeting in Banjul in July 2006. His subsequent \nelection, surely can only be a source of pride and \ndelight for us. \n We also wish to commend him for the initiative \nhe took to convene a high-level event several days ago \non a subject that is of great concern to all nations and \npeoples of the world, namely, climate change. All the \nsalient issues surrounding this phenomenon have been \nbrought to the fore. It is now our fervent hope that \naction will be taken to address them in a most timely \nmanner.  \n The mid-term review of the Millennium \nDeclaration two years ago indicated that the \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) are far from \nbeing attained in most of the developing world. This \nnotwithstanding, our commitment to the MDGs is \nunwavering. The overarching policy objective of the \nGovernment, under the leadership of the President of \nthe Republic of the Gambia Al Hadji Yahya A.J.J. \nJammeh, is to reduce poverty and achieve all the \nMDGs. We have just concluded a second Poverty \nReduction Strategy Paper, which clearly sets out our \npolicy framework for achieving growth and poverty \nreduction, despite our meagre resources and \nendowments and despite the failure of several partners \nto fulfil their pledges of aid, debt relief and market \naccess for African countries. The same mid-term \nreviews also showed that the commitments that were \nmade in many forums by the international community \nin support of the MDGs in poor countries have not \ntranslated into real resource flows into these countries.  \n We therefore call on the international community \nto rededicate itself to the provisions of the Monterrey \nConsensus and the Paris Declaration on Aid \nEffectiveness. In this regard, my delegation welcomes \nthe panel of eminent personalities established by the \nformer British Prime Minister, Mr. Tony Blair, to \nmonitor pledges made at summits of the Group of \nEight, including those made at Gleneagles. My \ndelegation considers it particularly critical to take \naction to reverse the downward trend in overseas \ndevelopment assistance. \n We also need to re-examine the framework of key \nrules that govern, inter alia, international trade and \nfinance, global competition, foreign direct investment \nand international migration. It is important that bodies \nmaking rules in those areas accommodate the views of \ndeveloping countries in general, and least developed \ncountries in particular. For Africa, where we must of \nnecessity move away from aid dependency, the \ndevelopment of the continent must be addressed from \nthe crucial vantage point of trade and market access, so \nas to enable our economies to be advantageously \npositioned in order for us to begin enjoying the fruits \nof globalization. \n My delegation would like to seize this \nopportunity to request the Assembly to pause for a \nmoment and reflect on the plight of the poor the world \nover. Poverty anywhere, we will all agree, is indeed a \nproblem everywhere. And it is worth remembering that \nthe plight of the poor can affect the comfort and \nsecurity of the more privileged and affluent members \nof human society. There is no doubt that poverty \nengenders many economic, social and political \nproblems. It negatively affects global health and is a \nthreat to international peace and security as well. \n Therefore, the need for greater international \nsolidarity to fight poverty in all its forms and \nramifications cannot be overemphasized. The \ndevelopment efforts of most Governments, particularly \nthose in Africa, continue to be undermined by the \nscourges of malaria, HIV/AIDS and other health \nrelated issues, such as hunger and malnutrition. I must \nthank our true friends and development partners for the \nexcellent support they are providing to the Gambian \npeople, particularly in the areas of health, education, \nand agriculture. It is my fervent hope that the \ninternational community will live up to its commitment \nto support the efforts of our Government as we strive \nto improve the well-being of our people. In order to \nachieve the Millennium Development Goals by 2015, \nwhich we should all consider to be a necessary \ncondition to affect people\u2019s living standards, Africa \nsorely needs significant investments in health, \neducation, agriculture and infrastructure. \n Allow me to turn to peace and security in the \nworld, especially on our continent of Africa. In recent \nyears, we have witnessed significant improvements in \nmost of the continent. In West Africa, for example, we \nhave been consolidating peace and deepening the \ndemocratization process as well.  \n The people of Sierra Leone have just gone \nthrough a peaceful, free and fair presidential election. \nMy delegation would like to congratulate them and to \nwish the new Government all the success in its efforts \nto follow the path of rapid socio-economic \ndevelopment for the Sierra Leonean people. The return \nof peace to C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire is a welcome and a vital \ndevelopment not only for the country and its people, \nbut also for the entire West Africa subregion. The \nGovernment of the Gambia fully welcomes the Ivorian \nGovernment\u2019s commitment to organize presidential \nelections shortly, and we wish the friendly people of \nthat great country every success. \n The situation in Somalia requires the urgent \nresponse of the international community. Lasting \npeace, stability, and reconciliation can return to that \ncountry only when the Transitional Federal \nGovernment is empowered to establish law and order. \nThe United Nations, as the overall guardian of \ninternational peace and security, should support the \nefforts of the African Union (AU) in that regard, and \nSomalia\u2019s neighbours as well, to rally the various \nfactions together and bring lasting peace to that \ncountry. \nAs we gather here, thousands of innocent \ncivilians, including women and children, continue to be \nvictimized by the fratricidal conflict in the Sudanese \nregion of Darfur. My Government therefore welcomes \nthe commitment of the international community to \nreplace the existing African Union Mission in Sudan \n(AMIS) with a hybrid United Nations-African Union \nmission, invested, of course, this time around, with a \nmore active mandate to keep and enforce peace in \nDarfur. We in the Gambia have been in the forefront in \nthe African Union\u2019s peace efforts in Darfur, and we \nwill certainly continue to support the international \neffort with a substantial contribution of Gambian \ntroops to serve in the new arrangement. At this \njuncture, let me salute the Sudanese Government for \ntheir cooperation and their manifest willingness to find \na lasting solution through a political process. \n The peace and security situation of the Great \nLakes region remains a major concern. While we \nwelcome the successful elections in the Democratic \nRepublic of the Congo last year, we recognize the \nfragility and precarious nature of peace in that country \nand the region as a whole. My delegation therefore \ncalls on the international community to continue to \nwork to search for ways of achieving durable peace. \nWe also urge the international community to assist in \nbringing all the parties to the negotiation table and to \nmove vigorously to address the humanitarian situation. \n Just as the security and peace situation in Africa \npreoccupies my delegation, so also do the conflicts and \nturmoil in the rest of the world, especially in Iraq, \nAfghanistan and Palestine. The conflict in Iraq remains \na major source of concern, not least because it now \nthreatens the peace and security of the entire Middle \nEastern region, if not the whole world. Within Iraq \nitself, the conflict has brought untold suffering to the \ncivilian population especially women and children. \nFurthermore, the alarming rate of civilian deaths \ncannot be justified.  \n Also, the resultant large volume of refugee \noutflows has now placed unbearable pressure on the \neconomies of, in particular, the neighbouring countries. \nWhile we recognize, of course, the potential of \nrefugees to make positive contributions to the \neconomies and societies of their host countries, refugee \noutflows of the magnitude that we are seeing in Iraq \ncan only pose a threat to social and political security. \nWe therefore strongly urge that as a matter of urgency, \nalternatives be found in order to resolve the conflict in \nthat country. \n A new approach to the situation in Afghanistan is \nalso long overdue. The country needs more political \ndialogue than military engagement. We also wish to see \nleaders in the region engage each other in meaningful \ndialogue and, of course, renew their commitment to \ngood-neighbourliness as well. \n The unresolved question of the self-determination \nof the Palestinian people remains the most important \npolitical and moral question of our time. A few years \nago, we all placed our faith in the so-called Road Map \nfor peace and hoped that the Quartet would bring about \nthe eagerly awaited two-state solution.  \n My delegation now very much welcomes the new \ninitiative being led by the United States of America and \nvery much looks forward to the convening of a \nconference that would once and for all settle this \nfestering imbroglio. We urge all concerned to come to \nthe table in good faith and with a strong will to make a \npositive contribution to the search for a lasting solution \nto the problems of peace and security in the Middle \nEast and, indeed, in the peace process throughout the \nworld. \n Allow me to highlight some issues relating to \ninternational justice. The illegal, outrageous and \nprotracted embargo imposed on the friendly Republic \nof Cuba has no basis. It is devoid of political and \ncommercial sense, and those who impose the embargo \nshould join our ranks in the international community in \nrejecting the embargo as a colossal error of judgement \nthat should never have happened in the first place. We \nhope to see a repeal of all laws, measures and policies \nin that direction. \n The Gambian delegation sincerely hopes as well \nthat the international community will reflect deeply on \nthe dangers posed by the increasing and unprovoked \nmilitarization of the Taiwan Strait. Regional and, \nultimately, international stability are under threat from \nthe build-up of thousands of military warheads for use \nin attacks on Taiwan. The problem of the Taiwan Strait \nis one that is very serious indeed, and which calls for \nurgent action by the international community. The \nUnited Nations should not wait until it is too late to \naddress the situation of the Strait and its growing \nmilitarization.  \nWe, the Members of the United Nations, have at \nthis juncture abdicated our responsibilities towards \nTaiwan by refusing it full membership in the \nOrganization. The legitimate aspirations of the people \nof that dynamic, technologically developed, advanced \neconomic powerhouse ought to be fulfilled by States \nMembers of the United Nations. Let me seize this \nopportunity to assure the Assembly that my delegation \nis not acting against the interest of any Member State. \nRather, we speak out in the interest of peace across the \nTaiwan Strait, peace throughout the Asia-Pacific region \nand, indeed, peace in the whole world. It is in that \nspirit that my delegation will continue to call on the \nGeneral Assembly to address this threat to international \npeace and security. \n  Mr. Beck (Palau), Vice-President, took the Chair. \n Let me conclude by putting on record the \nGambia\u2019s frustration with the stalled reform of the \nUnited Nations. As former Secretary-General Kofi \nAnnan said when the proposals were first made, two \nyears ago, no reform of the United Nations can be \ncomplete without reform of the Security Council. For \nus in Africa, it is just unacceptable that a body that \ndecides on life and death issues for millions of \nAfricans includes no African country at all as a \npermanent member. That is why the Gambia continues \nto strongly endorse the Ezulwini Consensus, which \nrepresents Africa\u2019s common position on reform of the \nSecurity Council. \n At a time when we are all committed to good \ngovernance at the national level, we surely cannot \nignore good governance at the international level. The \nproposed reform of the United Nations, especially as \nregards the Security Council, must be seen within that \ncontext. \n I wish us all a very successful session. \n"

        "file_text": "I am grateful for the \nopportunity today to address this sixty-second annual \ngathering of the General Assembly. \n On behalf of my nation, I would like to \ncongratulate the Secretary-General on his innovative \nleadership and on the exceptional progress he has made \nin his first nine months. His steadfast vision for peace \nin Darfur, his commitment to rallying the world to \ncombat climate change and his determination to \neradicate global poverty stand true to the founding \nprinciples of this institution. \n Let me also extend my congratulations to \nMr. Srgjan Kerim on his assumption of the presidency \nof the General Assembly and express our appreciation \nto his predecessor, Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa, \nfor her very effective leadership. \n Today, in this great Hall, we have an opportunity \nto reaffirm one of the core principles of the United \nNations \\\"the right of every individual to pursue a life \nof liberty in dignity\u201d by voicing our support for \nhundreds of thousands of peaceful protesters, monks \nand ordinary citizens, daring to seek freedom for the \npeople of Myanmar. We must stand fast with them. It is \nmy deepest hope that we will look back and remember \nthis saffron revolution of the Burmese monks as \nanother step in the inevitable march of liberty across \nthe planet. It echoes the rose and orange revolutions \nthat freed the peoples of Georgia and Ukraine from \nhopelessness and stagnation just a few years ago. \n When we returned Georgia to its rightful path of \npeace, democracy and transparency, we did so in the \nknowledge that our country was not an island. We \nknew that, in order for our freedom to endure, we \nwould have to help advance the peaceful aspirations of \nothers around the world, as a responsible member of \nthe international community of democratic nations. \nThat is why Georgia has lent its sons and daughters to \npeacekeeping efforts in Kosovo, Afghanistan and Iraq. \nAnd just this month, we committed a new battalion to \nserve under French command in Kabul. \n This is why we have reached out to our \nneighbours in Europe, Central Asia and beyond to \npromote peace through cooperation, trade and deeper \nengagement. Together, we are working to help ensure \nnew and diverse supplies of energy for European and \nglobal markets. We contribute to the integrated effort \nby building new roads, railways and pipelines that \nweave together the countries of our region, ensuring \nthat people and goods flow across our borders in a \nmanner that is safe, legal, predictable and fair. In short, \nour vision for the region is guided by the belief that \nmutual interdependence brings mutual benefit. \n I believe that the people of Georgia have served \nas a catalyst and a living example of how governing \ntransparently, through democratic principles, breeds \nlasting stability and shared prosperity. This is not, of \ncourse, a new path for Georgia, but rather a return to \nour European home and our European vocation, so \ndeeply enshrined in our national identity and history. \n And, while our most challenging relationship \ntoday remains with our neighbours in the Russian \nFederation, my Government is committed to addressing \nthis subject through diplomatic means, in partnership \nwith the international community. I can say this with \nconfidence, because Georgia is a nation that is rooted \nin justice, the rule of law and democracy. This is an \nirreversible choice made by the people of my country. \nFor evidence of that, one merely has to look at how \nGeorgia has responded to the many provocations it has \nfaced in the past year, which range from missile attacks \nto full-scale embargoes and even destructive pogroms. \nRather than lash out angrily, we have redoubled our \ncommitment to democratic development and \ncomprehensive reform. My Government and I have \ndone everything we can to show how much can be \nachieved when good governance opens the door to the \ndevelopment of human potential. \n Today Georgia's economy is growing at over 14 \nper cent. Our gross domestic product per capita has \nmore than doubled in four years.  Corruption is the \nlowest among transition economies around the world \nand one of the lowest in Europe, according to the \nEuropean Bank for Reconstruction and Development. \nAnd as of today, our country has taken its place \nalongside some of the most developed economies in \nthe world like Australia, New Zealand, the United \nKingdom, Singapore and Hong Kong, Iceland, when \nthe World Bank and the International Financial \nCorporation ranked Georgia as the 18th easiest and \nbest place to do business because of institutionalized \ntransparency and a lack of corruption. \n We were 140th in world, one of the worst \nrankings, and now we have one of the best rankings \nfor business and in terms of economic development \nand economic conditions. That is proof of what can be \nachieved when institutions function and when rhetoric \nis replaced with results. \n Four years ago, I spoke at this Assembly about \nGeorgia being a test case for the modern challenges of \ndemocratic transition. Today, it is clear that Georgia's \ntransition has led to real transformation. I could recite \na long list of other successes since the Rose Revolution \nand, equally, I could elaborate upon the many profound \nchallenges that remain. But let me focus on what is \nperhaps our most important duty; the imperative to \ncreate a better future for the next generation. \n We will not rest until every school in Georgia is \nfilled with empowered and confident students, who \nhave the benefit of new books, a modern curriculum, \nfull Internet access, many computers, until every \nstudent gets a computer, and motivated teachers. Just \nfour years ago our schools were barren and \ndesperate - many lacked desks, windows, heat and, \nabove all, hope. \n Today, reforms in education are sowing the seeds \nof lasting prosperity, and our students are leading the \nway. That is the Georgia we promised. And that is the \nGeorgia we have created. It is also the Georgia we will \nand we must defend.  \n For our democratic project is not yet complete - \nfar from it. Georgia today is not whole. The vast \nmajority of residents from the regions of Abkhazia and \nSouth Ossetia have been unable to reap the benefits of \nthe Rose Revolution that I have just shared with you.  \n Tens of thousands of children in these regions are \nraised amidst the sounds of gunfire instead of \nfireworks. Their homes are not their own, and their \ndreams are distant and frightening. They are prisoners \nof the morally repugnant politics of ethnic cleansing, \ndivision, violence and indifference. \n But we will not rest until justice is restored, until \nthe rule of law is accessible to everybody. \n Today, I regret to say that signs of hope are few \nand far between. The story of Abkhazia, where up to \n500,000 men, women, and children were forced to flee \nin the 1990s, is of particular relevance - one of the \nmore abhorrent, horrible and yet forgotten ethnic \ncleansings of the twentieth century. In the time since \nRussian peacekeepers were deployed there, more than \n2,000 Georgians have perished and a climate of fear \nhas persisted. \n It is worth pausing to remember that today's \nAbkhazia is populated by less than 20 per cent of its \npre-war population. It is an area with very fertile land, \nbeautiful beaches, lovely resort areas and wonderful \nlandscapes. Yet it is all deserted, houses have been \ndestroyed, and signs of hopelessness, desperation and \nannihilation abound. \n The brutal campaign of ethnic cleansing uprooted \nethnic Georgians, Armenians, Estonians, Greeks, Jews, \nRussians and others who had lived peacefully in that \nland for centuries, creating a depopulated and \ncriminalized wasteland.  \n President Ilves of Estonia spoke today of the \nparallels between Darfur and Abkhazia. Of course, we \nshould remember Darfur, but we should not forget \nAbkhazia. President Ilves knows of what he speaks \nbecause tens of thousands of ethnic Estonians were \nalso deported and their houses confiscated. In 1992, the \nEstonian Government had to evacuate some of these \npeople by air under the fire of the people that were \nattacking this peaceful middle-class population in \nAbkhazia. \n The United Nations has tried to bring peace to \nthis region, but it has not succeeded in making Georgia \nwhole again, despite its unwavering recognition of \nGeorgian sovereignty. Every day that passes without a \npeaceful resolution to the conflict, every day in which \nforcibly displaced persons are not allowed to return \nhome, marks a slow erosion of the credibility of this \nHouse and of its ability to fulfil its mission. We cannot \nallow this situation to continue. \n Fourteen years have passed without a single in-\ndepth analysis being carried out as to why peace has \nnot triumphed or why the legal framework has not been \nrestored and has therefore failed. For this reason and in \norder to inject a new and positive dynamic into the \nprocess, I am calling on the United Nations today to \nlaunch a comprehensive review of all aspects of the \nGeorgian peace process. The necessity of this review of \nthe peace process is self-evident, and it must result in \nfundamental changes. \n Changes are necessary in the negotiation format, \nwhich has stalled, and is stagnant and \ncounterproductive. That in turn must lead to real \nchanges in operations on the ground. Years of biased \nand unbalanced actions by supposed peacekeeping \nforces must be replaced with competent and neutral \nones that will be engaged in peacebuilding and \npeacemaking, rather than in trying to maintain the so-\ncalled status quo, while in fact being biased and \npreserving the injustices that have happened there. \n That is the only path forward. Out of this process, \nwe can expect genuine and relevant changes in the \nlegal framework. Although we need effective economic \nrehabilitation, the main thing we need is a meaningful \nand implementable plan to bring about the return of \ndisplaced persons, guaranteeing their property rights, \nthe establishment of lasting security and the \nresumption of direct dialogue on the ground without \nany preconditions and without any adverse movements \nfrom sides that are against dialogue. \n Because of the lack of political will, countless \nlives in that part of Georgia are being wasted. And \ninaction has its costs. \n One of the greatest voices for peace in the last \ncentury, Martin Luther King, captured the essence of \nthe problem when he said: \n \\\"Man's inhumanity to man is not only perpetrated \nby the vitriolic actions of those who are bad. It is \nalso perpetrated by the vitiating inaction of those \nwho are good\\\"\u009d. \n Let us fill the vacuum with new energy, new \ncommitments and a new common resolve. I want to \ntake this opportunity to elaborate on the foundations of \nour proposals for a lasting and peaceful settlement. \nFirst, we offer the alternative of security and prosperity \nto those who have been poisoned by the separatist \nillusion. We offer and recognize the right to full self-\ngovernance for all who live in Abkhazia and South \nOssetia, within our sovereign territorial borders under \ninternational guarantees. We offer constitutional \nchanges to enshrine the protection of minorities \nincluding language rights, the protection of culture and \neducation. And we are even willing to offer special \nproperty rights to all interested groups in order to \nenhance their identities and to guarantee and secure \nthat their long-term survival will be protected by the \nState and the international community. Finally, we \noffer and welcome a robust role for the European \nUnion and a greater role for its engagement on the \nground. \n In short, we offer a level of autonomy grounded \nin the very same principles that have guided the rest of \nEurope in promoting peace and prosperity throughout \nits multi-ethnic tapestry. \n The continued ignorance of the ethnic cleansing \nin Abkhazia, Georgia is a stain on the moral account \nbook of the international community. These disputes \nare no longer about ethnic grievances; they are about \nthe manipulation of greed by a tiny minority of \nactivists, militants, militias and their foreign backers, \nat the expense of the local population, the displaced \nand those who are deprived of their property and \nfundamental rights - even the right to speak and study \nin their own language.  \n The choice is between a Georgia that is willing to \nwelcome them back with every constitutional \nrecognition of their identity and their rights or a bleak \nfuture where they are the objects of propaganda, fear \nand poverty, and where they are pawns in a big \ngeopolitical game. \n I have faith that we will succeed.  Their masters \nand foreign manipulators will not succeed.  \n Where does the international community stand? \nMy dear friends, that is the essence of the issue.  \n But the violent hold of the armed separatists and \ntheir patrons is not unbreakable. In South Ossetia, the \ncourage of the people, of common men and women \nwho have chosen dialogue over division, and \nreconciliation over recriminations, is making a \ndifference. Unfortunately, those who do not share a \nvision of peace and reconciliation have chosen to \noppose peace in South Ossetia, fearful that the power \nof the people and the desire to live in freedom may \nundermine their cynical plans. \n As I speak before you today, elements from \nRussia are actively and illegally building a new, large \nmilitary base in the small town of Java, in South \nOssetia, in the middle of Georgia, on the other side the \nCaucasian ridge, very far from Russian territory, \nhoping that arms and violence will triumph over the \nwill of the people. And this dangerous escalation is \ntaking place under the very noses of international \nmonitors, whose job it is to demilitarize the territory. \n I have brought a very conclusive body of \nevidence with me today, to show our friends in the \ninternational community the truth that others conceal. I \nbring that disturbing fact to the Assembly's attention \nbecause reckless acts such as that must be highlighted \nand countered. Our collective job today is not to ask \nhow this is possible. Rather, it is to act with \ndetermination and unity. We have all the evidence, we \nhave video footage, documented facts and all the other \nevidence, and we will present it to the international \ncommunity, to anybody who has voiced interest in this \nissue. \n Sooner rather than later, the march of liberty will \nprevail. In the past year, the residents of South Ossetia \nhave started down a different path. They are seeking to \nparticipate in Georgia's economic growth, to benefit \nfrom our new hospitals and our revived schools and to \nshare in and contribute to our democracy. It is the \nordinary residents of South Ossetia engaged in \nextraordinary acts of heroism who are making a \ndifference. It is the children who took their summer \nholidays on Georgia's seacoast, only to return home \nand be barred from their schools or menaced by official \nauthorities, who will tear down the barriers of hate. It \nis the residents rebuilding their towns under gunfire. I \nhave specially met with the workers who continued to \nbuild schools, movie theatres and even discos under the \ngunfire of elements that wish to stop them. These are \nvery courageous people of different ethnicities who \nwant to live in peace and who are willing to take risks, \neven with their own lives for the sake of peace and a \nbetter future for their children.  \n It is the courage of local leaders such as Dmitry \nSanakoev, a former separatist leader of South Ossetia \nwho once bore arms against Georgia, who will lead the \nway. He was chosen by the people of South Ossetia in \ndemocratic elections to represent them. This vision will \nbe embraced. I believe we should respect the \ncourageous expression of the ethnic Ossetians who \nhave decided to take that path within Georgia. \nThe only obstacle to the integration of South \nOssetia is a separatist regime that basically consists of \nelements from security services from neighbouring \nRussia that have no historical ethnic or cultural links to \nthe territory whatsoever. I think that is a very \ntemporary development Now is the time to seize this \nhistoric opportunity to avoid the escalation of violence, \nwhich is a possibility and a major risk, especially in the \nterritory of South Ossetia. \n In closing, I would like to share the insights of a \nwoman whose name is on our minds and in our hearts \ntoday: Aung San Suu Kyi. Her courage, her resolve and \nher reflections on peace and democracy, cannot be \nimprisoned. They travel across every border and barrier \nto inspire us all. Her words are of profound relevance \nto the people of South Ossetia and Abkhazia. I believe \nthey also must be a beacon for all of us in this Hall. \n \\\"Even under the most crushing State machinery, \ncourage rises up again and again, for fear is not \nthe natural state of civilized man. It is man's \nvision of a world fit for rational, civilized \nhumanity which leads him to dare and suffer to \nbuild societies free from want and fear.\\\" \n Those words poignantly reflect what is taking \nplace today in the streets of Burma. \n In our own corner of the world, for the past four \nyears, the people of Georgia have invested their own \nsweat and treasure to build such a society - one free \nfrom want and fear. We now must ensure that Georgia \nwhole and free includes all the people of South Ossetia \nand Abkhazia.  \n I believe I have been clear in stating Georgia's \nintentions and equally clear as to where we are \nunshakeable in our principles - principles, I stress, \nthat are shared by all nations that seek legality and \nstability in the international system. \n We are committed to a peaceful and honest path. \nUnfortunately, our interlocutors do not seem to be. This \nmorning, a senior Russian official made the very \nunconstructive, unsubstantiated and untrue accusation \nthat Georgian forces killed two innocent people in \nUpper Abkhazia. What the senior Russian official \nfailed to say, however, is that one of the people was a \nlieutenant colonel of the Russian military and that he \nwas killed during a law enforcement operation against \narmed separatist insurgents. One has to wonder, what \nwas a lieutenant colonel in the Russian army doing on \nin the Georgian forests, organizing and leading a group \nof armed insurgents on a mission of subversion and \nviolence? I want to ask our Russian friends: is there not \nenough territory in Russia? Are there not enough \nforests in Russia for Russian officers not to die in \nGeorgian forests, on Georgian territory, for them not to \nfight on foreign territory for God knows what cause for \ntheir nation? Whatever the explanation, we regret any \nloss of life. That person was recruited from Russian \npeacekeepers and State and local militia. We do not \nwish anybody such an end to their life. \n Indeed, we will do everything possible to avoid \nviolence and further hostility and confrontation. This \nreckless and dangerous pattern of behaviour must not \ncontinue. \n In conclusion, I want to express the gratitude of \nGeorgia for the efforts of the United Nations and its \nstaff. I trust that I have demonstrated that we have the \nopportunity and, in Georgia, the desire to resolve our \ncommon challenges so that the international \ncommunity can commit its resources to resolving the \ngreat challenges of our age. Let us not lose any more \ntime. \n"

        "file_text": "I would like to congratulate \nyou, Mr. President, and express our support for your \nleadership of the General Assembly at this session. \nFinland aligns itself with the statement of the European \nUnion. \n The Millennium Declaration and the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals continue to serve as our common \npledge to create a better future for everyone. The \nUnited Nations is our world organization, and in \naddressing global challenges, the United Nations is the \nkey forum for our cooperation. \n In order to achieve comprehensive security, we \nmust strive not only for security, but also for \ndevelopment and human rights. In the World Summit \ntwo years ago, we decided that the United Nations \nsystem should be reformed to better ensure the \nimplementation of these three fundamental principles. \nWe should spare no efforts to continue the overall \nreform of the United Nations. \n A more just world is a safer world. Making the \nEconomic and Social Council more effective is an \nimportant part of the United Nations reform and of the \nconcept of broad security. \n Establishing a new United Nations institution is \ntruly a challenging task. We know that from our own \nexperience. Finland was a member of the Human \nRights Council during its first year. But we have to go \non. We must sustain our efforts to make the Council a \ncredible institution, capable of defending and \npromoting globally the human rights of women, men \nand children. Our good words and intentions must lead \nto strong action. \n The new Peacebuilding Commission must be \ndeveloped into a platform that can successfully assist \ncountries struggling in post-conflict situations. To \nsupport that work, Governments, parliaments,  \nnon-governmental organizations and the private sector \nmust also work together. The Peacebuilding Fund must \nbe used as an effective tool to respond to the \nimmediate needs of post-conflict countries. \n Achieving the Millennium Development Goals \ncalls for coherent action. Finland strongly supports the \nrecommendations of the Secretary-General\u2019s High-\nlevel Panel on System-wide Coherence. The objective \nof One United Nations at the country level is worth \nstriving for. \n We also must reinforce our efforts to address the \nchallenges in the fields of health and education, as so \nmany speakers have mentioned here. \n Finland warmly welcomes the Panel\u2019s \nrecommendations concerning gender. We do need to \ntake decisive measures to promote gender awareness \nacross the entire United Nations system. We support \nthe proposal to set up a new, consolidated gender \nagency with a new Under-Secretary-General position at \nits head. \n In this context, I would like to stress the \nimportance of engaging women in all phases of crisis \nmanagement: conflict prevention, peacekeeping and \npeacebuilding, without forgetting peace talks. Let me \ngive one example: the United Nations Development \nFund for Women (UNIFEM) Middle East Initiative. I \nbelieve that the cooperation between Israeli and \nPalestinian women under this initiative can help to \nrestart the peace negotiations. I also use this \nopportunity to state that Finland is preparing its \nnational action plan to advance the implementation of \nSecurity Council resolution 1325 (2000) on women, \npeace and security. \n A stronger United Nations also needs reform of \nthe Secretariat. In this regard, we welcome the \nadditional emphasis given to the rule of law. Support \nfor the rule of law is a necessity in the consolidation of \nglobal security. \n Sustainable development requires us to \nconsistently promote fairer globalization and the well-\nbeing of nature. Climate change affects the future of \nthe whole of mankind. Finland highlights the necessity \nto reach, as soon as possible, a globally inclusive \nagreement on the post-2012 climate regime. The \nUnited Nations has a central role to play in this \nprocess. \n Every nation has the right to develop and to aim \nfor growth and prosperity. Industrialized countries \nmust demonstrate solidarity with developing countries \nand take all possible steps to promote access to \nenvironmentally sound technologies for everyone. \n I believe that the tone of the climate change \ndebate is developing in a promising direction. Many \nMember States and various regions and social actors \nhave become active and have produced initiatives \nconcerning the development of climate policy. We have \nto take advantage of that as an asset in the run-up to \nthe Bali Climate Change Conference, to be held in \nDecember. \n The high-level event on climate change held on \n24 September was a success. I feel that it gave us the \npolitical support that we will need when we are \nheading towards Bali. Everyone\u2019s input will, of course, \nbe required. Finland appreciates the fact that the \nPresident of the General Assembly has made this topic \none of his priorities. \n We need effective international cooperation in the \nfield of disarmament and non-proliferation. For \nexample, given the number of victims in today\u2019s \nconflicts, small arms and light weapons are indeed \nweapons of mass destruction. Finland, together with \nmore than 150 other States, supports the process aimed \nat the adoption of an international arms trade treaty. \n The role of the United Nations is vital in \nresolving numerous crises around the world. This \nmorning, we heard news from Burma/Myanmar, where \nthe people\u2019s fight for freedom and human rights has \nbeen suppressed. We must react. United Nations \nactivities need political support and our resources. \n We value the determination of the Secretary-\nGeneral in searching for a solution to the crisis in the \nSudan. The new peacekeeping operation in Darfur will \nincrease the total number of United Nations troops to \nmore than 100,000. That remarkable figure proves that \nthe United Nations enjoys the trust of the international \ncommunity. We welcome Security Council resolution \n1778 (2007), adopted yesterday, on an international \npresence in Chad and the Central African Republic. \n In order to achieve success in crisis management, \nwe need partnerships and shared responsibilities. For \nexample, the African Union and the European Union \nhave been valuable partners of the United Nations. The \nsupport of local and regional actors is critical for \nsuccessful United Nations peacekeeping. \n We Europeans believe that resolving Kosovo\u2019s \nstatus is vitally important. In that process, the United \nNations Special Envoy has played a pivotal role. We \nencourage all parties to engage constructively in \nfinding a solution to that problem. \n Let me assure the Assembly that Finland supports \na stronger United Nations for a better world. It is up to \nus to deliver on our commitments to achieving better \nsecurity, sustainable development and respect for the \nhuman rights of all people. I wish to express our \nfirmest support to the Secretary-General, Mr. Ban \nKi-moon, in pursuing such efforts. \n"

        "file_name": "KAZ_62_2007.txt",
        "file_text": "I want  to invite us all to take a short journey down memory \nlane and recall that in 1946 the United Nations General \nAssembly, convened for the very first time, by its very \nfirst decision established a Committee to deal with the \nproblems raised by the discovery of atomic energy. \n Almost nothing has happened since that time to \nallay the fears of humankind. On the contrary, the race \nto possess nuclear weapons, which even terrorist \norganizations have now joined, has continued \nunabated. Even though the community of nations has \nlong recognized the need to reform the international \nsecurity system, there has been no real progress. \n The lack of an international consensus on the \nissue has led to a dramatic weakening of the collective \nsecurity system. Speaking in general terms, we are \ndealing with a systemic crisis of international \ngovernability, and the international community is \nrunning out of legitimate levers capable of stopping the \nspread of weapons of mass destruction. \n Quite apart from any ethical, economic or other \nsuch considerations, we need to erect legal barriers to \nstop proliferation. For this reason, Kazakhstan \nproposes that the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \nNuclear Weapons (NPT) should be adapted to \naccommodate the new realities. \n It should be acknowledged that the NPT has \nbecome an asymmetrical agreement under which \nsanctions are applicable only to non-nuclear States. \nYet, if nuclear Powers call for the development of \nnuclear weapons to be banned, they themselves should \nset an example by reducing and renouncing their \nnuclear arsenals. That is not the case. This unfairness is \nan inducement for those States that still aspire to \nacquire weapons of mass destruction. I would only add \nthat, to our way of thinking, this aspiration is irrational. \n The people of Kazakhstan have lived through all \nthe horrors of the effects of nuclear explosions. Four \nhundred and fifty-six such explosions were conducted \nat the Semipalatinsk nuclear testing ground. \n It was for this reason that the first milestone \ndecision taken by Kazakhstan after gaining its \nindependence was to shut down the Semipalatinsk \nnuclear testing site. That was followed by the \nrenunciation of its nuclear missile arsenal, the fourth \nlargest in the world, and the dismantling of its \ninfrastructure. I want to note here that at that time we \nhad not only the trained personnel but also practically \nall means for delivery of nuclear warheads. \n Those steps have shaped the strategy of our State \nin the area of global security. For the first time in \nhuman history, a nation possessing destructive force \nhas given it up voluntarily. \n I am sure that by taking that action Kazakhstan \nestablished trust in the world. Thanks to that step, the \ncountry has witnessed an inflow of considerable \ninvestment that has become the foundation for \nimpressive achievements in development known today \nthroughout the world. By taking that step, we \nconsolidated our independence, having received \nsecurity assurances from all nuclear-weapon States. I \nhave a question for others: why not follow our \nexample, instead of wasting astounding amounts on the \narms race? \n Over recent years, international terrorism has \nsignificantly undermined world security. International \ndrug trafficking serves as a financial pillar of terrorism. \nToday, the international drug industry accounts for a \nthird of the annual volume of the \u201ceconomy of \nterrorism\u201d. It is a well-established fact that terrorism \nfinds fertile ground in unstable and poor countries. We \nhave such a country in our region, Afghanistan. That \ncountry is driving an ever-growing trade in drugs. \n Poor countries need the assistance of developed \nnations. They need assistance that would give tangible \nresults. Thanks to a thriving economy, our country, \nuntil recently a foreign aid recipient, has joined the \ngroup of \u201cnew donors\u201d. Over the last few years, \nKazakhstan has seen its economy grow at an annual \nrate of some 10 per cent. And now we are in a position \nto help our neighbours.  \n We are concerned with the difficulties in the \nprocess of reconstruction of Iraq and the stabilization \nof the situation in Afghanistan. The peoples of our \nregion, like the entire international community, count \non a peaceful solution of the so-called crisis around \nIran. The best way to achieve that is for Iran, whose \npeople have a great history and culture, to prove the \npeaceful character of its nuclear programme. \n Today, the peacekeeping efforts of the United \nNations remain the most effective instrument for the \npeaceful settlement of regional crises. Fifteen years \nago, from this rostrum, Kazakhstan put forward an \ninitiative related to the enhancement of the \nOrganization\u2019s peacekeeping potential. We proposed \nthe establishment of a United Nations peacekeeping \nfund, with States voluntarily contributing 1 per cent of \ntheir military budgets. \n That idea has been supported by the Secretary-\nGeneral, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, who has proposed to \nredirect 1 per cent of global military spending to \ndevelopment. I believe that such a decision would \nconstitute an important step towards the \nimplementation of the United Nations strategy to \nachieve the Millennium Development Goals. \n Allow me now to draw the Assembly\u2019s attention \nto a number of issues that are important in the context \nof Kazakhstan\u2019s cooperation with the United Nations \nand its Member States. \n First, Kazakhstan welcomes the decision by the \nGeneral Assembly to identify problems involving \nclimate change as a priority theme of the current \nsession. \n In this context, I would like to draw attention to \nour initiative put forward at the Johannesburg Summit \non Sustainable Development, by reiterating our \nproposal to establish, within the framework of the \nUnited Nations, a register of global environmental \nproblems. Such an instrument would help us to develop \nmechanisms for addressing environmental disasters. \n By the 1990s, the Aral Sea, once a large inland \nsea, had lost three fourths of its water. That spelled \ndisaster for millions of people living around it. The salt \nfrom the exposed seabed is being sprinkled on the \nentire Eurasian continent, damaging its environment. \nThe countries of the Central Asian region have done \nmuch to rehabilitate the sea. However, without \nconsolidation of the efforts of the world community, \nthis problem cannot be solved. As I did at the 2002 \nEarth Summit, I again propose to give to the \ninternational fund to save the Aral Sea the status of a \nUnited Nations institution. \n Secondly, a deepening global energy crisis and \nthe growing threat of negative climate changes taking \nplace on our planet present acute problems for the \nworld community. We share the concern of the leaders \nof the Group of Eight (G-8) and Asia-Pacific Economic \nCooperation (APEC) countries over these problems. It \nis advisable that we develop, within the framework of \nthe United Nations, a global energy and environment \nstrategy and discuss it at the 2012 World Summit on \nSustainable Development. \n Thirdly, Kazakhstan forms part of the Caspian \nregion, which is playing a growing role in international \nenergy markets. As of today, Kazakhstan has the \nworld\u2019s seventh largest reserves of oil, the sixth largest \nreserves of gas and the second largest deposits of \nuranium. \n By 2017, Kazakhstan will be among the world\u2019s \n10 largest oil producers and exporters. Kazakhstan is \nalso increasing its gas production. Possessing large \ndeposits of uranium, we will be playing an important \nrole in the development of the nuclear energy sector. \nThat said, Kazakhstan is fully aware of its share of \nresponsibility for ensuring a global energy balance and \nsecurity. \n To promote further diversification of energy \ndelivery to consumers and also to provide assurances \nto energy producers, Kazakhstan proposes the adoption \nof a Eurasian pact on stability of energy delivery. \n Fourthly, the first-ever global United Nations \nconference on problems faced by landlocked \ndeveloping countries, hosted by Kazakhstan in 2003, \nadopted an international document, the Almaty \nProgramme of Action. We believe that it will facilitate \neffective assistance to that group of countries. \nDecisions on the development of regional cooperation \nand transport and transit infrastructure adopted at the \nlatest session of the Economic and Social Commission \nfor Asia and the Pacific, held in Kazakhstan last May, \nhave become an important and logical step in the same \ndirection. \n Fifthly, speaking of Asia, we must mention here \nthe issue of the establishment of a continental \narrangement for collective security. That has become \npossible through the implementation of Kazakhstan\u2019s \ninitiative to convene the Conference on Interaction and \nConfidence-Building Measures in Asia (CICA), \nannounced by me from this very podium, during the \nforty-seventh session of the General Assembly in 1992. \nToday, the CICA process brings together 18 States, \nwhich occupy 90 per cent of Asia\u2019s territory. Their \npopulation makes up half of the people living on our \nplanet. Time has proven the relevance of the CICA \nprocess, within which a political dialogue among Asian \nStates is gaining momentum. \n Sixthly, we support joint efforts to reform United \nNations activities. In our view, the Security Council \nshould be enlarged in the categories of both permanent \nand non-permanent members and on the basis of \nequitable geographical representation and respect for \nthe sovereign equality of States. The working methods \nof the Security Council should also be reformed in \norder to increase its transparency and accountability. \nThe General Assembly should play a central role as the \nmain deliberative, decision-making and representative \nbody of the United Nations. \n Most of the sensational predictions of an \ninevitable \u201cclash of civilizations,\u201d fortunately, have not \nyet been accurate. However, we should be clear that \ninterfaith tension feeds the social basis of international \nterrorism and religious extremism. I believe that \nseeking an accord between religions and the peaceful \ncoexistence of ethnic groups is a crucially important \nelement in the process of maintaining international \nsecurity. \n Kazakhstan, a home to 130 ethnic groups \nrepresenting 45 religions, has set an example of \ntolerance, which has become a decisive factor in efforts \nto ensure peace, stability and the economic progress of \nKazakhstan. \n Conscious of the critical importance of a dialogue \nbetween world religions on key issues of the modern \nworld order, Kazakhstan hosted, in 2003 and 2006, \nforums of leaders of world and traditional religions \nwhere religious opinion makers were trying to find not \nonly a language of mutual understanding but also \nmechanisms for easing interfaith tensions in the \nplanet\u2019s hot spots. \n I propose that the Third Congress of the Leaders \nof World and Traditional Religions, scheduled for \n2009, be convened under the auspices of the United \nNations. I also propose the proclamation of one of the \ncoming years as an international year of convergence \nof cultures and religions. \n Just days after the terrorist attacks on \n11 September 2001, Pope John Paul II visited our \ncountry. He said that that tragic event should not \nbecome a cause for confrontation between religions. I \nstrongly believe that there are no problems in the world \nthat cannot be solved if we set harmony, tolerance and \nspirituality against animosity, relying on mutual trust \nand cooperation. That understanding instils hope and \nenhances confidence in the future. \n The United Nations plays a special role in the \nstrengthening of those hopes. We are not sceptical \nabout the legitimacy of international law and have faith \nin the effectiveness of such multilateral mechanisms as \nthe United Nations in the promotion of security and \nfairness. We are against attempts to weaken our \nOrganization. Kazakhstan associates itself with those \nStates that are willing to strengthen the role and \nauthority of the United Nations because they view it as \nthe only international body capable of influencing, in \nan effective way, the issues of war and peace. \n"

        "file_text": "Today has a very special \nmeaning for us: twenty-nine years ago, under the \nblessings of this body, Tuvalu was granted its \nindependence. I am honoured, therefore, to speak on \nbehalf of the people and Government of Tuvalu and to \nconvey to this session of the United Nations General \nAssembly our warmest greetings.  \n At the outset, Tuvalu wishes to associate itself \nwith previous speakers in congratulating Mr. Kerim in \nhis election as President of the General Assembly at its \nsixty-second session. We also wish to take this \nopportunity to welcome and congratulate the Secretary-\nGeneral, Ban Ki-moon, on his appointment as head of \nthe United Nations. \n As we celebrate our twenty-ninth anniversary of \nindependence, let me convey our most sincere thanks \nand gratitude to the international community, \nespecially to our traditional development partners, \nclose friends and international and regional \norganizations for their support and cooperation over \nthe past years. We are confident that such gestures of \nunderstanding, friendship and cooperation will \ncontinue in the years ahead. Our endeavours to achieve \nexcellence have been guided by the United Nations \nprinciples of good governance, respect for the rule of \nlaw and for human rights, democracy and self-\ndetermination. Our future survival as a nation is \nfounded on these basic ideals of the United Nations.  \n Tuvalu welcomes the key priority issues of \nclimate change, financing for development, achieving \nthe Millennium Development Goals, countering \nterrorism, and the United Nations reform agenda, \nwhich the President has clearly identified and \nhighlighted in his opening address at the sixty-second \nsession. We would like, however, to focus on five main \nissues: the United Nations reforms, the United Nations \npresence in Pacific small island developing States, the \nquestion of Taiwan\u2019s membership in the United \nNations and its agencies, criteria for least developed \ncountries graduation, and responding to climate \nchange. \n On the United Nations reforms, we acknowledge \nwith sincerity the tremendous efforts that the \nOrganization has made in fulfilling its purpose, based \non its noble pillars of development: peace and security \nand human rights, as enshrined under its Charter. \nThrough such efforts, the United Nations has reached \nout to many countries of the world in providing the \nrequired services for those who need them most. \nHowever, these efforts always encounter many \nchallenges that can be resolved only if the United \nNations membership and all its subsidiary bodies \ncommit to work together in harmony and with respect \nfor each other. \n The need for the United Nations to ensure \nefficiency, effectiveness and transparency in carrying \nout its mandates and all its related programmes cannot \nbe overemphasized. In this connection, Tuvalu \nwelcomes and supports the ongoing work on United \nNations reform. In particular, Tuvalu supports the \nSecretary-General\u2019s report in response to the \nrecommendations of the High-level Panel on United \nNations System-wide Coherence and agrees that the \nUnited Nations system must be more results-oriented, \nefficient and accountable. \n Tuvalu fully supports the ongoing reform work of \nthe United Nations that promotes country-driven \nprogrammes. However, we are very disappointed with \nthe unjustifiably slow progress in establishing the \nUnited Nations presence in the remaining Pacific small \nisland developing States that do not have United \nNations offices. As a full Member of the United \nNations, we feel that Tuvalu and other small island \ndeveloping States from the Pacific each deserve to \nhave a United Nations office established in-country, \nwhich will be instrumental in the coordination and \nimplementation of United Nations projects and \nprogrammes on the ground. Our isolation and \ngeographical fragmentation in itself is justification for \nestablishing a joint United Nations office in Tuvalu. \nWe appeal to the United Nations for the earliest \nimplementation of this long overdue commitment.  \n Tuvalu highly commends the momentum of the \nwork on the reform of the Security Council, especially \nthe excellent work done by the Open-ended Working \nGroup on the Question of Equitable Representation on \nand Increase in the Membership of the Security \nCouncil and Other Matters Related to the Security \nCouncil. Tuvalu warmly welcomes the next step of \nsubmitting the issue for further intergovernmental \nnegotiations as a way forward. Tuvalu further supports \nthe draft resolution tabled by India for the same \npurpose in addressing this very important task. \n However, we are very disturbed with the \ncontinuance of finger-pointing and undiplomatic \nlanguage being directed at small island developing \nStates for their contributions to the Security Council \nreform process. As a small peace-loving nation and a \nfull Member of the United Nations, Tuvalu has the \nsovereign right to support any issue that will benefit \nthe achievement of the United Nations goals. We \nstrongly believe that open dialogue and working \ntogether in mutual understanding under the framework \nof the United Nations is the only way to reach our \nshared destiny in diversity and to respect one another.  \n Tuvalu firmly believes that the paramount \nmission of the United Nations must remain the \nmaintenance of peace and security while ensuring the \nuniversal participation of all nations of the world, as \nclearly articulated in the Preamble to the United \nNations Charter. \n However, the United Nations cannot be said to be \nuniversal nor can global peace and security be assured \nuntil the issue of Taiwan\u2019s membership and \nparticipation in the United Nations is properly \nresolved. It is disappointing to note that this body does \nnot even want to at least put Taiwan\u2019s membership \napplication on its agenda for proper consideration. \n Let me reaffirm Tuvalu\u2019s strong support for \nTaiwan\u2019s membership application to the United \nNations. We feel that this issue is long overdue and \nneeds to be considered more seriously and purely on its \nown merits.  \n Taiwan has shown international responsibility \nand has helped many countries in the world   \nincluding my own country, Tuvalu   with \ndevelopment assistance. It is our strong opinion that \nTaiwan is a country with a clearly defined territory and \nan established democratic system of government and is \na responsible international player in world trade, \ndevelopment and diplomatic relations. The rights and \nself-determination of the Taiwanese people to join the \nUnited Nations should be urgently addressed. Taiwan \nhas all of the capabilities needed to fulfil its \nobligations as a peace-loving State and become a full \nMember of the United Nations as required under the \nCharter of the United Nations.  \n Despite all this, it is sad to note that the United \nNations has continued to turn a blind eye to the wishes \nand needs of the people of Taiwan, who simply want to \nbe part of the international family and participate \nactively in the attainment of the noble pillars of \ndevelopment, security and human rights. More sadly, \nthe action taken by the Secretary-General of the United \nNations in not complying with the requirements of the \nCharter of the United Nations and the rules of \nprocedure of the Security Council is disappointing. \nTuvalu further appeals for the proper and urgent \nconsideration of Taiwan\u2019s membership application to \nthe United Nations.  \n The issue of graduating from the least developed \ncountries (LDC) category has caused great anxiety for \nTuvalu. As recognized in the Mauritius strategy for \nsmall island developing States, it is most alarming that \nall the potential candidates for graduation from the \nLDC list are Pacific small island developing States, \ndespite our special disadvantages and environmental \nvulnerabilities. We appeal to this Assembly, the \nEconomic and Social Council and our development \npartners to carefully reconsider the criteria for LDC \ngraduation and their application, taking into account \nthe special disadvantages of small island developing \nStates. \n The President\u2019s leadership in choosing \n\u201cResponding to Climate Change\u201d as the theme of this \nsession is highly commendable. Likewise, Tuvalu \napplauds the leadership of the Secretary-General on \nclimate change. We are pleased that world leaders at \nthe High-level Event on Climate Change have agreed \non the urgency of addressing climate change in a \ncomprehensive way. We believe we are now ready to \nmake a historic agreement in Bali to start negotiations \non a new climate change agreement.  \n As the Prime Minister of Tuvalu, Mr. Apisai \nIelemia, clearly stated in the June issue of the United \nNations Chronicle magazine, \u201cIf there is one issue that \nstrikes at the heart of my nation, Tuvalu, it is climate \nchange.\u201d Climate change is undoubtedly an issue of \nextreme importance to a small, atoll nation like Tuvalu. \nThe recent report of the Intergovernmental Panel on \nClimate Change highlights the extreme vulnerability of \nisland countries like Tuvalu to the impacts of climate \nchange and the urgent necessity for global action to \naddress this vulnerability. In this context the coming \nsession of the Conference of the Parties to the United \nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change in \nBali will be very important.  \n In our view, the Conference in Bali should have \nthe following components: First, it should reconfirm \nthe important role of the Kyoto Protocol and encourage \nparties to the Protocol to pledge new and substantial \nemissions reductions and encourage others to become a \nparty to it.  \n Secondly, we should agree to amend the Kyoto \nProtocol so that we open the door for newly \nindustrialized countries, countries with economies in \ntransition and any other interested countries, including \ndeveloping countries, to take on commitments to \nreduce their greenhouse gas emissions. \n Thirdly, we must commit to a new global \nframework on adaptation to the impacts of climate \nchange. For highly vulnerable countries like Tuvalu \nthis is an essential step in the process. \n Lastly, we must agree on a new negotiation \nprocess under the United Nations Framework \nConvention on Climate Change that will establish a \nnew legal agreement to allow developing countries to \nmake voluntary commitments to reduce their \nemissions. Under this agreement we envisage that \ndeveloping countries will be able to make voluntary \ncommitments to reduce emissions from the energy, \ntransport and forestry sectors. These commitments \nwould be linked to appropriate incentive mechanisms.  \n In the context of reducing emissions from \ndeforestation we believe that any agreed measures \nmust bring about real reductions in global emissions. \nActions to reduce emissions from deforestation should \nnot undermine or devalue efforts to reduce emissions \nfrom other sectors. Furthermore, these actions should \nnot infringe upon the rights of indigenous peoples and \nlocal communities. The causes of deforestation are \ncomplex, particularly as there are serious governance \nissues to resolve. Let us make sure to get a durable \nsolution to this issue that will achieve a lasting climate \nchange outcome.  \n There are a number of elements that we think are \nessential in a new global framework on adaptation. We \nelaborated some of these during the High-Level Event \non Climate Change. Let me highlight two: First, we \nmust establish a whole new source of funding for \nadaptation and a new approach on how adaptation \nfunding is managed. A potential new source of funding \nfor adaptation could come from a tax levied on \ninternational aviation and maritime transport. \nSecondly, we must establish a global insurance facility \nto help assist vulnerable countries recover from the \nimpacts of climate change.  \n We must seize the opportunity at Bali. We must \nset ourselves a short timeframe to create a new legally \nbinding agreement on climate change. This should not \nundermine the Kyoto Protocol but should build on its \nstrengths. Those countries that have turned their backs \non the Kyoto Protocol must now take part in the global \neffort and commit to reducing their emissions within a \ntight timeframe. Once this is done, then we will see the \nrest of the world move forward, for it is crucial that all \ncountries must make an effort to reduce their \nemissions. We must not waste the opportunity at Bali.  \n In conclusion, my Government encourages all \ncountries to support the reform agenda for the United \nNations including the serious consideration of self-\ndetermination and the universal participation of all \nnations. We strongly encourage all Governments to use \nthe next climate change Conference of the Parties in \nBali to be a starting point for new negotiations on \nclimate change. The future of Tuvalu and lives of many \nothers like us is at stake. \n"

        "file_text": "Allow me  at the outset to congratulate the Secretary-General, \nMr. Ban Ki-moon, on the quality of the intensive work \ndone in such a short period of time at the head of the \nUnited Nations. I would like to congratulate him \nsincerely and to encourage him on his correct \nassessment of the world\u2019s present problems. \n This is the first time that I am taking part in the \nGeneral Assembly in my seven years at the head of \n Cote d'Ivoire. As members know, I am fully committed \nto resolving the crisis gripping my country and which \nhas so mobilized the international community over the \npast five years. My presence, today, here in New York, \nat this rostrum, is the best proof of the climate of calm \nprevailing in  Cote d'Ivoire today, following the signing \nof the Ouagadougou political agreement, which was \nthe outcome of direct dialogue between the State and \nthe former rebels. \n That agreement was endorsed by the Security \nCouncil which unanimously adopted resolution 1765 \n(2007). On behalf of the people of  Cote d'Ivoire, I \nwish to thank and to greet all who were involved in \nthese positive developments: the countries members of \nthe Security Council, the countries members of the \nAfrican Union Peace and Security Council, all the \ncountries of the African Union and the countries \nmembers of the Economic Community of West African \nStates (ECOWAS). In particular, I thank the heads of \nState whose personal involvement was key in resolving \nthe crisis in  Cote d'Ivoire: President Thabo Mbeki, \nmediator in the Ivorian crisis appointed by the African \nUnion, and President Blaise Compaor\u00e9, facilitator for \nthe direct inter-Ivorian dialogue, as current Chairman \nof ECOWAS. \nWe have noted that despite the international \ncommunity\u2019s efforts over the previous four years, the \npeace process was blocked and the country was at a \nstandstill. That is why, on 19 December 2006, I \nsuggested to my compatriots a way out of the crisis, \nfocusing on five points: first, the establishment of \ndirect dialogue with the rebels, aimed at disarmament \nand the reunification of the country; secondly, the \nremoval of the Zone of Confidence; thirdly, the \nestablishment of a national service programme; \nfourthly, a general amnesty; and finally, the \nestablishment of an assistance programme for the \nreturn of persons displaced by the war. That plan was \nbased on the experience of solutions considered up \nuntil then, but with a completely different approach, in \norder to ensure complete ownership of the peace \nprocess by the Ivorians themselves. \n I thus took up direct dialogue with the rebels. Our \ndiscussions, through the facilitation of President Blaise \nCompaor\u00e9, took place in neighbouring Burkina Faso, \nthe West African country with the closest historical and \nsociological ties with  Cote d'Ivoire. Those discussions \nled to the signing on 4 March 2007 of the \nOuagadougou political agreement. \n In accordance with that agreement, a new \nGovernment was established. It is headed by the \nformer rebel leader, Mr. Guillaume Soro. With this \nGovernment, we have made considerable progress in a \nshort period of time. An integrated command centre, \nbringing together soldiers from the national armed \nforces and from the former rebel forces, was \nestablished on 16 March 2007. Its mission is to set up a \njoint force entrusted with ensuring security and the free \nmovement of individuals and goods throughout the \nnational territory. A general amnesty order was issued \non 11 April 2007. Disarmament effectively began with \nthe 30 July 2007 \u201cpeace bonfire\u201d in Bouak\u00e9. The \nredeployment of the administration and reinstatement \nof magistrates throughout the territory has now taken \nplace. A plan for the return of those displaced by the \nwar has been put in place. Mobile courts to identify \nmembers of the population and update electoral lists \nbegan yesterday, Tuesday, 25 September 2007. We \nhave made major strides towards peace since the \nOuagadougou peace agreement. \n The lesson I draw from this experience of direct \ndialogue between State authorities and the rebels has \nled me to invite the international community to favour \nlocal solutions in the settlement of conflicts. The \nUnited Nations in New York should make \narrangements to monitor the implementation of \nsolutions adopted by parties to a conflict. \n  Cote d'Ivoire will emerge from crisis. C\u00f4te \nd\u2019Ivoire is emerging from crisis. Today more than ever, \nit needs the support of the international community to \nbuild peace and stability within its borders and in the \nWest African subregion. \n In this context, and given the climate of calm \nprevailing in the country, I would like the United \nNations to revise downward the security rating. Phase \nIII no longer reflects reality.  \n In the same spirit, with the implementation of the \nOuagadougou agreement, today  Cote d'Ivoire is \nreunified and it is now up to the State to restore law \nand order throughout the territory. The agreement \nprovides explicitly that in the redeployment of \nadministrators, the forces of law and order are to take \npart in providing protection for administrative staff, as \nwell as for the citizen population. I appeal here for the \npartial lifting of the weapons embargo so that the \nIvorian State can carry out its task of protecting \npersons and goods. \n Moreover, and in the present context of national \nreconciliation, Ivorians remain concerned that \nindividual sanctions are still imposed on some of our \ncompatriots. Since the Ouagadougou Agreement, those \nyoung people have put heart and soul into the search \nfor peace. For that reason I am formally asking the \nUnited Nations, within the spirit and letter of the \nOuagadougou political Agreement (S/2007/144) \nendorsed by resolution 1765 (2007) to lift the sanctions \nimposed on Charles Bl\u00e9 Goud\u00e9, Eug\u00e8ne Dju\u00e9 and \nMartin Kouakou Fofie. \n  Cote d'Ivoire is a sound country and our \nmanagement of public finance has made it possible for \nthe Ivorian State to function and to ensure a minimum \nstandard of living for its people. But the ongoing crisis \nhas ultimately led to a reduction in the financial \nresources available to the State and has disrupted its \nfinancial stability.  \n Today I am asking for assistance to help finance \nthe actions related directly to resolving the crisis, \nnamely: the civil service, mobile courts, general \nelections, the return of those displaced by war and in \ngeneral, peacebuilding.  \nBut beyond the short and medium-term actions, \nCote d'Ivoire requires international aid to strengthen \nthe basis for a more robust economic recovery in the \nlong-term. We must rebuild and strengthen our \ncommunity infrastructures. Our schools and health \ncentres were damaged during the war. We must rebuild \nand strengthen our economic infrastructures   roads, \nrailways, electric and water supply stations were \nseverely strained by the crisis.  \n All observers and all actors in the crisis in C\u00f4te \nd\u2019Ivoire agree that elections are the goal of the crisis \nresolution process in  Cote d'Ivoire. The holding of \ntransparent, free elections that are open to all is not \nonly a requirement under my political culture, but is, \nabove all a democratic requirement. Elections are proof \nof good governance. I intend to make my country   \n Cote d'Ivoire   a modern State   that is, a State in \nwhich people appoint their leaders through just and \ntransparent elections. \n Democratic elections are a requirement for my \ncountry in order to modernize our political life. \nElections are also required for our economic recovery. \nWe absolutely must reorganize the coming elections in \n Cote d'Ivoire and hold them successfully in order to \nrestore confidence among economic actors in the \ncountry and abroad.  \n Elections are a requirement as well for stability in \nour country and in the subregion. We must organize \nelections quickly to confer political legitimacy on \nthose who are exercising State power in order to \nstabilize the society in  Cote d'Ivoire and ensure \neconomic recovery in West Africa. Finally, elections \nare a constitutional imperative. According to our \nconstitution, when exceptional circumstances make it \nimpossible to hold elections   as was the case before \nthe country was reunified   all institutions within the \nRepublic function solely with a view to holding \nelections. For that reason, the elections must be \nreorganized quickly so that we can move beyond this \nconstitutional, but exceptional situation. \n For all those reasons, from this rostrum at the \nUnited Nations I invite all friends of  Cote d'Ivoire \nthroughout the world, but also and above all the \npoliticians, both men and women, Ivorians and all \npeoples living in  Cote d'Ivoire to become involved in \nthe peace process. I invite them to become fully \ninvested in the electoral process underway and to \ncontribute, each person according to his or her ability, \nto national reconciliation and to peacebuilding. \n"

        "file_text": "Allow me to express our gratitude to the Secretary-\nGeneral, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, who has done a laudable \njob, thus enhancing the prestige of the United Nations. \n I am here on behalf of the people of Honduras, \nwho have entrusted to me the torch of Central \nAmerican peace so that I can hold high in the \nAssembly Hall this light that illuminates understanding \namong peoples and nations.  \n Honduras is filled with a spirit of hope. Today we \nhave the best social and economic indicators of recent \ndecades. We have an average economic growth of more \nthan 7 per cent. We have very good results in the area \nof job creation. We have begun to speed up poverty \nreduction by more than 6 per cent in 18 months. We \nhave reduced forest fires by 40 per cent, together with \nillegal logging and the advance of migratory \nagriculture and extensive ranching. We now have a \nclimate conducive to public and private enterprise. We \nare beginning to strictly implement the transparency \nlaw as a civic instrument to provide better access to \npublic information. \n We have already presented, during the recently \nconcluded sixty-first session of this very special forum, \nthe Assembly of the people, our demands, our \nproposals and a reaffirmation of our values. Most of \nthe people of Honduras believe in democracy and \nsocial liberalism, and in a free-market economy in its \ntrue meaning, as a useful instrument for the equitable \ntrade of commodities   the fruits of human labour.  \n However, in actual practice   the only possible \nmeans of testing our theories   international trade \noperates in an unequal and inequitable way, as do the \nrelations between powerful and economically weak \ncountries. Free trade, so highly touted in all our \nspeeches and international propaganda may, if we do \nnot redirect it properly, turn into yet another ruse \ndisguising unequal relations, the unjust distribution of \nadvantages and the undue, invisible code of unfair and \ndiscriminatory competition.  \n Let us just look at the figures of the World Trade \nOrganization, which acknowledge that barely 7 per \ncent of international trade goes through free channels \nand the free market of economic and transparent rules. \nThe rest, that is, more than 90 per cent of global trade, \ntakes place outside the scope of the illusory standards \nof liberty and justice that we all aspire to.  \n We must remedy this situation. Now is the time. \nWe must continue to establish the conditions to \nimprove international agreements. I acknowledge that \nwe are competing in imperfect markets with unequal \nrules of the game, which provide advantages and \ndisadvantages. Some receive all kinds of subsidies and \npreferential tariffs, which transform their products into \nprivileged goods. Speculative pricing, dumping, \nmonopolies, oligopolies and other discriminatory \npractices are promoted, and certain parties are able to \nadvance their interests and impose their will on those \nof us who are struggling just to reach the threshold of \ndevelopment.  \n We demand that the rules of true free trade and \ncompetition be respected. We do not want to be \nrelegated to the basement of history. Our peoples have \nthe right to reach the summits of prosperity. \n One of the most obvious and classic examples of \nthis problem, which is worth mentioning in this \nAssembly, is the excessive charges and increased \ntariffs imposed by the European market on the bananas \nfrom our region. A similar example is the recent \nrevision request from the United States that we impose \nnew tariffs on products and on the sale of textiles and \nfinished fabrics that Honduras exports to the United \nStates market. This weakens the spirit of the trade rules \nwe signed barely a year ago and would affect \nHonduras\u2019 sales to the United States market   a \nmarket that investors in our country have gained by \ndint of hard work, competing in order to sell at the best \nprice and to sell goods of better quality.  \n As the Assembly can see, we are not coming here \nto ask for the impossible or to demand what is not \nowed to us. We simply want to go on record in \nexpressing our just and necessary demand for equitable \ntreatment in trade relations in the international market. \nWe are not asking for sympathy or pious \ncondescension. We are asking for respect. We want \npeople to pay a proper price for our products and to \nvalue our effort and work with the same criterion that \nis used to rate the effort of other peoples and other \ncommunities that produce goods and services. We \ndemand equitable rules and standards. We require the \njust treatment that we deserve as authentic and real \nmembers of this planet that we all share.  \n Likewise, we would like to mention in the \nAssembly a problem that almost all of us are \nexperiencing. We are suffering the same fate because \nof speculative increases in the international markets in \nthe price of oil and its derivatives. Barely five years \nago, the price of a barrel of oil was about $13; today it \nis already above $80 a barrel. It has increased by a \ndramatic 600 per cent, thus subjecting our nations to a \nstate of greater dependence and international \ndestitution.  \n The economies of our countries cannot withstand \nthis economic blood-letting, which destroys any \nattempt for social protection. A large part of what we \ncan invest in order to combat illness, ignorance, hunger \nand age-old backwardness now drains to the large \ntransnational oil corporations. While we are fighting to \nreduce poverty and its ills   ills caused by those who \nclaim to be free of all blame and responsibility   the \nmasters of the world and of trade are increasing prices \nto indecent scales as instruments of pressure with the \nrise of oil.  \n We are appealing to the global conscience to \nshare urgent efforts to intervene in the extreme \nspeculation in oil prices. We need to establish mutual \ncooperation in order to produce forms of alternative \nenergy without it becoming a new opportunity to come \nup with low- or high-intensity wars that only threaten \nthe sovereign rights and the right to strengthen peace \nof the democracies of the world. \n These are the contrasts of the modern world. \nParadoxically, while borders are opening up to \nspeculation, abuse and free trade in commodities, they \nare closing to people, especially to emigrants. The lack \nof ethical limits of a society of unfettered consumption \nproduces false expectations among young people in \ndeveloping countries. Bombarded by alienating \npropaganda, illusions are created that later turn into \nurgent economic needs, producing diasporas compelled \nby the famous pursuit of the American dream. \n There is no better opportunity than this universal \nforum to expand on a theme that concerns all of us   \ncountries of origin as well as receiving countries. It is \nimpossible to measure the drama of the emigrant \nexperience, the modern self-exiles that go from place \nto place in search of better opportunities. \n Honduras, my country, is a multi-ethnic and \nmultiracial society and full of immigrants. My country \nthroughout its history has been a territory of passage \nand a refuge for foreign migrants and a centre which \nhas produced its own emigrants looking for a better life \nin far-off places. This triple status as a country of \norigin, a receiving country and a country of transit is \nwhat gives us the moral authority to talk about this \ntopic with the necessary correctness and firmness, but \nalso with indispensable feeling and solidarity.  \n To be an emigrant is not to commit a crime. \nMigration has not been and should never be considered \na crime or threat, but rather a human right. Migration \ndoes not belong to nor should it be included in the \nsecurity agenda of any country. That was done only in \nthe time of fascism. It should be included and \nconsidered within the framework where it really \nbelongs, that is, the development agenda of our \ncountries. In this way, we would no longer witness the \nmonstrous spectacle of inhuman persecution simply \nbecause people are migrants, undocumented aliens, \npursued and humiliated. Emigration is a right, a simple \nand basic human right.  \n Those who see the problem of migration simply \nfrom the point of view of family remittances or voting \nby emigrants abroad are committing a serious and \nshort-sighted error. They are wrong to look at the \nphenomenon of growing migratory flows in the world \nin this way. The problem is complex and difficult. It is \nrelated to the economic structure of the country that \nproduces emigrants   political problems, natural \ndisasters, war, violence, poverty, unemployment. \nMigration weakens the social cohesion of the country \nthat produces emigrants, facilitates outflows of share \ncapital and stimulates the fleeing of manpower at its \nmost productive and hard-working stage. It empties \ncommunities, impedes the processes of democracy and \ngenerates unfavourable conditions because of which \nthis wonderful working force is compelled to leave. \n Migration is a very complex and contradictory \nsocial phenomenon that deserves serious scientific \ntreatment, beyond simple emotions and feelings. \nImmigrants are people who are simply looking for \nbetter market opportunities in order to sell the only \nthing they have: their power to work, their energy, and \ntheir boundless desire to overcome their poverty and \nset out on the road to prosperity and well-being, which \nare basic elements of life. They are human beings who \ndeserve to be treated as such and to enjoy the basic \nrespect that humans should enjoy. They want us to \nrecognize their rights and to give them responsibilities, \nto value and consider them in what they represent, and \nto see them for what they are: a productive and mobile \nhuman force that is vital and beneficial both to the \neconomy that they serve and to the economy of their \ncountry of origin. \n I propose that we provide a legal basis, a fair and \nlegal international framework to ensure that \nimmigration becomes an ordered phenomenon \nbeneficial to all. I propose that we seek consensus, \nreach agreement and establish the necessary \ninternational cooperation. Our world needs immigrants \nand I implore its representatives, in the name of mercy \nand justice, to help stop the shameful persecution of \nimmigrants. We must apply the law of family \nreunification. It is God's will that the families of \nimmigrants be reunified.  \n All of us in Central America, Mexico and Latin \nAmerica deeply regret the fact that we have seen no \nprogress on the corresponding legislative initiative that \nthe President of the United States submitted to the \nUnited States Congress. We know that he did so with \nthe best of wills, and we therefore believe that \nPresident Bush should not falter in promoting that \nproposal. The construction of a wall can only separate \nus. We must find other mechanisms to resolve the \nproblem. Halting the mass deportations and reunifying \nfamilies would be a gesture highly appreciated in \nnational and international public opinion. We also \nrecognize the work of various Governments, in \nparticular the efforts of President Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero \nof Spain, who has reached immigration agreements and \nquotas with various countries. \n Just as the Kyoto Protocol protects biological life \non the planet, the Charter of the United Nations and the \nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights guarantee life \nand peace in our societies. Let us ensure that they are \nimplemented.  \n We express solidarity with peoples who are \nfighting for their identity, and reaffirm our support for \nthe Republic of Taiwan in its efforts to achieve \nrecognition in this forum of nations, in its fight for \nindependence, and in its constructive and faithful \ndedication to the many development processes under \nway in Central American countries.  \n Central America and Honduras, El Salvador, \nGuatemala, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama, Belize and \nthe Dominican Republic are united by the dreams of \nFrancisco Moraz\u00e1n, the champion of Central America, \na region of leaders in contemporary continental thought \nand artists of stature throughout Latin America and the \nworld, the belt of the Americas and a bridge to the \nworld, in the words of General Omar Torrijos. Through \nme, they offer a fraternal and united invitation to visit. \nWe have every facility. We have the most beautiful \nplaces on the planet, with great potential in such areas \nas tourism, bio-energy, telecommunications, \nagriculture and the environment. \n We cannot remain passive or inactive in the face \nof social despair. Our lives are replete with dreams. We \nmust, where necessary, overcome the neglect to which \nthe developing world is subject. Our great poet and \nthinker, Alfonso Guill\u00e9n Zelaya, said that we certainly \ncannot control fate. Prometheus always has to find \nsomeone to liberate him if civilization is to move \nforward. It is not possible for humankind to come to an \nend of its history without first giving the most \ndisadvantaged peoples of the world the opportunity to \nlive.  \n We trust in the future. Humankind knows that \nhope is not lost and has full confidence in the \nprinciples of the infinite god of love who guides us, \nand not in the god of violence, whom we reject. Before \nthis Assembly, we express the fervent wish for peace in \nthe world, a new dawn for humankind in which \neverything would be different and our energies would \nfocus on serving human beings and not on trade. \n"

        "file_text": "It is a privilege and an \nhonour for me to address this forum and to share the \nviews of the Republic of Macedonia regarding issues \nof utmost importance for the current session of the \nGeneral Assembly. However, allow me first of all to \navail myself of this opportunity to congratulate my \nfellow countryman, Mr. Srgjan Kerim, on his election \nas President of General Assembly at its sixty-second \nsession. His nomination to this prestigious position is \nyet another proof of the full dedication of the Republic \nof Macedonia to the promotion of the aims of this \nunique global Organization. \n I would also like to congratulate the previous \nGeneral Assembly President, Sheikha Haya Rashed \nAl Khalifa, for her successful presidency of the \nAssembly at its sixty-first session. Allow me as well to \ntake this opportunity to congratulate the Secretary-\nGeneral, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, on the energetic start of his \nmandate and his dedication in this time of great \nimportance for our Organization. \nThe issue of climate change was rightly proposed \nby the President of the General Assembly as a topic to \nbe discussed during this general debate. The alleviation \nof the impact of global warming and climate change, \nwhich has become one of the greatest challenges for \nindividual countries, but also for the entire \ninternational community, calls for the undertaking of \ncoordinated and serious measures. It is our obligation \nto preserve our planet for the generations to come. \nTherefore, one of our imperatives would be to provide \nclear political support in responding to the negative \nimpact of global warming, while not impeding \neconomic growth and the reduction of poverty. In this \ncontext, apart from recognizing the central role of the \nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate \nChange, we should also promote consultations within \nthe United Nations environmental institutions. \n People around the world expect the United \nNations to improve its performance and continue to \ndeliver. For many, this Organization remains a symbol \nof hope and of support in times of need, but also a \nhelping hand in times of crisis. The world has changed, \nand so have the challenges. The United Nations must \nalso continue to change in order to be ready to respond. \n The 2005 World Summit Outcome created a solid \nbasis for all necessary reforms. A lot has been \nachieved   perhaps not as much as was expected, but \nthe progress made so far is visible. We must continue \nworking on the reforms of the main bodies, in the \ninterest of transparency and effectiveness. \n The Republic of Macedonia strongly supports the \ncurrent management reform directed towards achieving \nefficiency and accountability in the United Nations \nsystem. The new bodies are already a reality and fully \noperational. What we expect in particular is the Human \nRights Council to strengthen its role in the global \npromotion and protection of human rights. Driven by \nour strong will to contribute to the work of this highly \nimportant body, we have put forward our application \nfor membership for the period from 2009 to 2012. \n The report of the United Nations High-level \nPanel on System-wide Coherence offered a number of \nvaluable recommendations for the reform of United \nNations operational activities. I hope that the \ndiscussions during the current session will help to \ncreate a consensus on measures to strengthen United \nNations capacities in the areas of development, \nhumanitarian assistance and environment. \n The issue of disarmament, arms control and \nnon-proliferation must remain high on our agenda. We \nmust therefore attach further importance to these \nissues, which are relevant for the achievement of \nglobal peace, security and development. \n Terrorism continues to threaten our world. The \nfight against terrorism is yet another area in which we \nmust stand united. The United Nations Global Counter-\nTerrorism Strategy and its Plan of Action, adopted last \nyear, provide an excellent framework for our individual \nand joint actions. We must promote their \nimplementation at the national and regional level and \nseek to achieve visible results. \n At the 2005 World Summit, we reaffirmed our \ncommitment to global partnership for development as \nstated in the Millennium Declaration, the Monterrey \nConsensus and the Johannesburg Plan of \nImplementation. We fully agree that every country \nbears the responsibility for its own development, which \ndepends mainly on national policies and strategies. We \nalso agree that global actions are necessary as a \nsupport to national efforts.  \n Some regions need more shared responsibility \nthan others in order to achieve the projected targets. \nAfrica, where the situation remains alarming, requires \nspecial attention. With this in mind, we endorse the call \nfor renewed commitment to the implementation of the \nMillennium Development Goals, and we await the \nforthcoming High-level Dialogue on Financing for \nDevelopment, which is expected to bring specific \nresults. \n United Nations involvement in Africa, including \nin the Sudan, remains of exceptional importance. The \nsituation in Darfur is extremely critical and alarming. \nMember States must reunite once again and provide \nsupport to United Nations activities in order to respond \nto the challenges on the ground. \n The Middle East situation continues to be an \nissue of utmost concern. People in the Middle East \ndeserve to live free from fear and threats. The Republic \nof Macedonia supports the efforts of the Quartet and \nthe Road Map. A renewed peace process is also of \nutmost urgency. The situation in Lebanon also remains \nhigh on the international agenda. Recently, the \nRepublic of Macedonia joined the United Nations \nforces in that area by sending military officers to the \nUnited Nations Interim Force in Lebanon.  \nSince the very beginning, the Republic of \nMacedonia has been part of the international anti-\nterrorist coalition in Iraq and Afghanistan. The \nRepublic of Macedonia fully supports the unity of Iraq. \nWe also support the recent Security Council resolution \n1770 (2007) regarding an extended role for the \nOrganization in Iraq. Building peace and democracy in \nthose two countries remains a key challenge both for \nthe international community and for the Iraqis and \nAfghans themselves. \n The Republic of Macedonia continues on its path \ntowards a functional multi-ethnic democracy. There are \nmany challenges on that path that we should tackle and \nobligations that we must fulfil. We are committed to \ncomprehensive reforms in all segments of Macedonian \nsociety in order to obtain a date for the beginning of \npre-accession negotiations for membership in the \nEuropean Union in 2008. At the same time, bearing in \nmind the successful reforms that we have been \nimplementing for years, we are deeply convinced that \nit would be realistic to obtain an invitation for \nmembership of the Republic of Macedonia in the North \nAtlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) at the next \nsummit of that organization, scheduled for April 2008 \nin Bucharest. \n The region of South-East Europe has come a long \nway in the past decade. We are all striving towards the \ncommon goal of European and Euro-Atlantic \nintegration, which is a strong driving force in terms of \nreforms and final stabilization of the region. The \nRepublic of Macedonia remains firmly committed to \ngood-neighbourly relations and regional cooperation, \nand we believe that dialogue is of key importance for \nall outstanding issues in the interest of everyone in the \nregion. \n We continue to support the efforts of the \ninternational community regarding the resolution of the \nstatus of Kosovo. At this stage, the Republic of \nMacedonia hopes that the next round of negotiations \nand consultations led by the Troika will bring the \npositions of both parties closer. We also endorse the \nposition that a resolution of the Kosovo issue should be \nformulated within a reasonable time frame, in the best \ninterest of stability in the region and the region\u2019s Euro-\nAtlantic perspective. \n In that context, I would like to underline in \nparticular that we do not agree with the recently \nmentioned idea of partition of Kosovo according to \nethnic lines, since that might have serious negative \nimplications for the entire region. The issue of the \ntechnical demarcation of our northern border with \nKosovo according to a predefined procedure and \nagenda remains a top priority for the Republic of \nMacedonia. \n Allow me to assure the Assembly that we will \nspare no efforts translating our words into actions, so \nthat people around the world may be convinced of our \ncommitment to respecting and implementing the \nprinciples and values enshrined in the United Nations \nCharter. \n Finally with or without any points of order \nthe name of my country is the Republic of Macedonia \nand will be the Republic of Macedonia. \n"

        "file_text": "The item at the top of our \nagenda is climate change. The upcoming Bali \nConference needs our full support. Climate change is a \nchallenge that can only be overcome by our collective \nefforts. If we fail, the future will be troubled. Small \nisland countries like Singapore will be in great danger. \nPeople living in the lowlands will have to move to \nhigher ground. The pressure of migration into spaces \nwhich become more habitable because of global \nwarming may well become unstoppable. There will be \nnew conflicts in the world. \n We are coming now to understand better the role \nof climate change in the conflict in Darfur. It does not \nexcuse the heinous crimes that have been committed \nthere, but understanding the water situation in that \nregion will help us find more durable solutions for the \nfuture. Many historians are now reassessing the role of \nclimate change in major political events in the past. \n We cannot be sure whether our best efforts can \nstop global warming. The Earth\u2019s climate has always \ngone through cycles. But, even if all we can do is to \nslow down the process that will buy us time: time to \naccumulate knowledge, to develop new technologies \nand to adapt. For example, the cost of recycling or \ndesalinating water has been steadily coming down and \nis becoming completely affordable for us in Singapore. \nImprovements in water technology can defuse political \ntensions in many parts of the world.  \n Many problems we face can only be overcome by \nthe nations of the world acting together. Climate \nchange is one. Another is the danger of global \npandemics, which must also be kept high on our \nagenda. The late Director-General of the World Health \nOrganization (WHO), Lee Jong-wook, once said that a \nnew global pandemic was not a question of \u201cwhether\u201d \nbut of \u201cwhen\u201d. With the mass movement of human \nbeings, much of it at jet speed, a new bug can spread \nquickly.  \n Only a few years ago, we had the scare of Severe \nAcute Respiratory Syndrome. We are still not sure why \nthat epidemic burned out so quickly, but luckily it did. \nDuring the few months it hit us in Singapore, our \neconomy was severely affected. Our tourism industry \nwas devastated. As our economy is so dependent on \nexternal trade, shutting our airport was not an option. \nInstead, we hurriedly converted military night-vision \ndevices into thermal scanners and used them at the \nairport so that arriving and departing passengers with \nfever could be pulled aside for medical examination. \nWe knew we could not overcome this problem on our \nown. The leaders of the Association of Southeast Asian \nNations (ASEAN) convened an emergency meeting to \nwhich the Premier of China, the Chief Executive of \nHong Kong and the Director-General of WHO were \nalso invited. \n Whether it is climate change, global pandemics, \nthe fight against terrorism, the multilateral trading \nsystem or international finance, we need better global \ngovernance. During the cold war, the world was \ndivided into two camps with each super-Power taking \nthe lead in its own sphere. That era is now behind us. A \nmultipolar world is crystallizing. On no major issue \ncan one country, however powerful, now act on its \nown, completely disregarding the views of others. The \nsituation in Iraq is a sad example of that. Russia, \nChina, India and Brazil are emergent or re-emergent \nPowers whose interests must increasingly be factored \nin. Smaller countries too have become more assertive, \nrefusing to let bigger countries ride roughshod over \nthem.  \n When major international institutions like the \nUnited Nations, the World Bank, and the International \nMonetary Fund (IMF) were established many years \nago, after the end of the Second World War, the world \nwas very different from what it is today. Because of \nthis, those institutions are not as effective as they ought \nto be. However, we have to work with those \ninstitutions as they are and not as we would want them \nto be if they were to be newly established today. Unless \nthere is another global conflagration, the improvement \nof global governance can only be achieved through \ngradual evolution, not revolution. \n We can do that at two levels: at the level of the \nmajor Powers and at the level of small and medium-\nsized countries. At the level of the major Powers, \ninternational institutions should increasingly reflect the \nmultipolar reality. For example, the reform of the \nUnited Nations, including the reform of the Security \nCouncil, should take into account the weight of India, \nJapan, Germany and Brazil and the growing \nimportance of regional organizations. Selection of \nheads of the IMF and the World Bank should be \nwidened. Membership of the Group of Eight (G-8) \nshould be enlarged to include countries such as China \nand India. It is also important that international \norganizations be held to the highest standards of \nmanagement. We must maintain their moral authority \nin the eyes of the world if they are to stay effective. \nThat Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon\u2019s recent visit to a \nrefugee camp in Darfur received so much applause was \nbecause of the prestige of the United Nations and the \nhope reposed in the Blue Helmets. \n On climate change, it is good that the United \nStates has convened a meeting in Washington of the \nworld\u2019s biggest emitters of greenhouse gases. As the \nworld\u2019s biggest economy, the United States has to \nexercise leadership. But it cannot do it on its own. \nWithout major emitters achieving a certain common \nunderstanding among themselves, we will not make \nmuch progress at the coming Climate Change \nConference in Bali.  \n The involvement of small and medium-sized \ncountries in international institutions has to be \nenhanced. It is unhealthy if the only way small and \nmedium-sized countries can ensure their interests are \ntaken into account is by threatening to block the \nprogress of others. Indeed, if every country in \ninternational organizations had the power of veto the \nresult would be paralysis. As a small country itself, \nSingapore takes the view that small and medium-sized \ncountries have both rights and responsibilities. We too \nmust have a sense of responsibility for the global \nsystem. A rules-based world gives us more freedom \nthan one where \u201cmight is right\u201d. \n Regional groupings can help small and medium-\nsized countries strike this balance between rights and \nresponsibilities. The African Union offers a good \nexample of how the discipline of a group gives each of \nits members a greater say in world affairs than it could \nhave on its own. Group solidarity enables regional \norganizations such as ASEAN to play a bigger role in \nthe world. ASEAN will soon be strengthened by the \nleaders\u2019 adoption of a formal charter next month.  \n Both formal and informal arrangements have \ntheir uses. For example, the Forum of Small States is a \nloose coalition of 100 countries that meet regularly to \nexchange views and to give support to one another. \nThey make up more than half the Members of the \nUnited Nations. Formal and informal groups can play a \nconstructive role by taking the middle ground and \nmoderating the excessive demands of radical members. \nLet us, through the groupings to which we belong, \nencourage each other towards compromise on the \nvarious issues. An example is the Doha Development \nAgenda. The positions are not so far apart now and it \nwould be a great pity to walk away from a Doha deal \nbecause of relatively small differences when the deal \ncould add hundreds of billions of dollars to global \nwelfare. \n However effective they are, international \ninstitutions cannot stop the natural rivalry among \nnation States. The major Powers will still throw their \nweight around, but rules can be established for \ncivilized behaviour and to prevent countries from \ntaking extreme actions that will endanger the planet we \nshare and our common heritage.  \n We are not a union of nations, but we are at the \nvery least a confederation of nations. There are limits \nto the sovereignty we exercise as independent nation-\nStates. For example, the countries of the world have \nnot only a legitimate right but also a responsibility to \ndecry the brutal suppression of demonstrators in \nMyanmar. Yesterday the Foreign Ministers of ASEAN \nexpressed our revulsion through a Chairman\u2019s \nstatement which also called on the Myanmar \nGovernment to abandon its old ways and take a fresh \napproach towards national reconciliation with all \ngroups in the country. We applauded the initiative of \nthe United Nations Secretary-General to dispatch \nSpecial Envoy Ibrahim Gambari to Myanmar and urged \nthe Myanmar Government to work with him for the \ngood of the people of the country. \n Six months before 11 September 2001, the people \nof the world watched with shock and horror the \ndeliberate destruction of the ancient Buddha statues in \nBamiyan by the Taliban. We must never allow such \nwanton acts to take place again, whether the injury is \nto world heritage sites, to the environment or to human \nbeings.  \n Behind such acts is an attitude of hatred and \nintolerance that must never be condoned. If this \ncentury is to be one of peace and development, all of \nus must internalize a spirit of interfaith understanding \nand common humanity. Recently, the Indian \nGovernment announced its intention to revive the \nancient Buddhist university at Nalanda and offered it to \nAsian countries as a project to promote cultural and \nreligious understanding and exchange. For hundreds of \nyears Nalanda was a great university drawing students \nfrom all over Asia to study not just Buddhism but also \nphilosophy, science, mathematics and other subjects. \nThat project deserves our support. \n We need many such endeavours in the world \ntoday so as to create a greater awareness of our \ncommon origins, our growing interdependence and our \ncommon future. Without that larger sense, the \nchallenge of global governance will be difficult to \novercome. Without all countries feeling a sense of \nshared responsibility for the Earth\u2019s environment, for \nexample, climate change will become much worse \nbefore effective measures are taken, by which time it \nmay be too late for many of us. \n"

        "file_text": "I  should like first to offer my warmest congratulations to \nyou, Mr. Kerim, on your assumption of the presidency \nof the General Assembly at its sixty-second session. I \nam confident that under your distinguished leadership \nwe will achieve great results during this important \nsession. I take this opportunity to assure you of the \nRepublic of Korea\u2019s full support for your noble \nendeavours.  \n I would also like to pay tribute to the Secretary-\nGeneral, His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for his \nexcellent service during his first year in office. Based \non long experience of working closely with him, His \nExcellency President Roh Moo-hyun of the Republic of \nKorea and I have every confidence that he will \ncontinue to fulfil his role with distinction. \n Today\u2019s global challenges require a collective \nresponse. Ever-widening globalization has brought \nwith it a growing role for the United Nations. By virtue \nof its universality, the United Nations is the right body \nto deal with these global issues. No other organization \ncan provide the legitimacy and authority that the \nUnited Nations offers. The United Nations has played \nan indispensable role in setting international norms and \nprinciples. It has pointed States and peoples in the right \ndirection. By enhancing predictability and rule-based \ninteraction between and among nations, the United \nNations is able to prevent conflicts of interest from \nerupting into crises. Those are the quiet successes of \nthe United Nations that often go unnoticed, precisely \nbecause the Organization helps to keep the \ninternational system running smoothly. This aspect of \nthe work of the United Nations deserves full \nrecognition and should be further strengthened.  \n At the same time, the United Nations can do \nbetter. We should persist in our efforts to strengthen the \nworld body through reform. This will be essential in \nenabling the United Nations to respond effectively to \nthe most daunting challenges of our era. As steps \ntowards achieving that end, the Government of the \nRepublic of Korea fully supports the important \ninitiatives that the Secretary-General has taken to \npromote the efficiency, effectiveness and \naccountability of the Secretariat. In particular, we \nappreciate his strenuous efforts to lead by example in \nchanging the Secretariat\u2019s working culture. \n Development, human rights and peace and \nsecurity are the three pillars of the United Nations. \nThey are all imperatives, and they are mutually \nreinforcing. Let me begin with development. The \nMillennium Development Goals agreed upon by our \nleaders in 2000 have a target year of 2015. We are \nalready at the midpoint. It is essential that we assess \nthe current situation and renew our commitment. But \nsuch actions will not be enough on their own. We need \nto identify more effective means to fulfil those \ncommitments.  \n The Republic of Korea has been redoubling its \nefforts to enhance its official development assistance \n(ODA). We have committed ourselves to a threefold \nincrease by 2015 from our current ODA level. To \nfurther support the international effort to eradicate \npoverty, we have joined the air-ticket solidarity levy \ninitiative, an innovative source of financing for \ndevelopment. At the same time, drawing lessons from \nour own history of development, we place emphasis \nnot only on increasing the scale of our aid but also on \neffectively sharing our experience with developing \ncountries. \n An issue closely related to development is \nclimate change. There is a growing consensus that \nclimate change is placing serious constraints on \nworldwide development capacity. It affects everyone \neverywhere. Therefore it must be urgently addressed. I \nhope that the political will shown by the leaders of \nmore than 150 nations at the gathering held here on \nMonday, 24 September, leads to the adoption of a road \nmap to a post-2012 regime of realistic, tangible \nsolutions to this pressing concern. They should be \ncomprehensive and flexible enough to ensure \nparticipation by as many countries as possible. \n Turning to human rights, it is vital that the \nHuman Rights Council live up to the high expectations \nthat surrounded its creation. We must do all we can to \nenable the Council to make real progress in the \npromotion of human rights. Let us renew our \ncommitment and strengthen our joint efforts to ensure \nits success. As an inaugural member of the Council, the \nRepublic of Korea is fully committed to the principle \nof all human rights for all.  \n In that regard my Government is deeply \nconcerned about the current situation in Myanmar and \nthe loss of civilian lives during the continuing protests. \nWe strongly hope that the Government and the people \nof Myanmar will work together peacefully towards \ndemocratization and national reconciliation.  \n My Government has substantially increased its \nefforts to eliminate discrimination against vulnerable \ngroups such as women, children and persons with \ndisabilities. We have vigorously pushed for necessary \nlegislation and the improvement of institutional \nframeworks to protect and promote the rights of such \nindividuals. Also, we adopted a national action plan for \nthe promotion and protection of human rights in May \nthis year. \n In the area of peace and security, United Nations \npeacekeeping missions are continuing to grow in \nimportance as well as in the size and scope of their \nactivities. The strengthened United Nations Interim \nForce in Lebanon (UNIFIL), operating in southern \nLebanon, and the deployment of the African Union-\nUnited Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur are two \nprominent examples. \n Indeed, the rising demand for peacekeeping and \nthe broad support of the international community are \nclear evidence of the crucial role of the United Nations \nin maintaining peace and security. For our part, the \nRepublic of Korea\u2019s recent participation in UNIFIL \ntestifies once again to our firm commitment to United \nNations peacekeeping activities. We will make every \neffort to enable our well-trained and disciplined \nKorean contingents to contribute further to \npeacekeeping activities.  \n Peace cannot be sustained without development. \nA comprehensive approach is required in order to make \nthe fragile peace of post-conflict situations durable and \nirreversible. With the establishment of the \nPeacebuilding Commission, the critical task of \nconsolidating peace and development has been \ninstitutionalized. In that regard, I believe that the \nexperience of the Republic of Korea over the past half \ncentury in rebuilding the nation from the ashes of war \nsince the 1950s could provide useful insights and \nencouragements that might help the post-conflict \npeacebuilding activities of the United Nations. \n Terrorism continues to be one of the gravest \nchallenges of our times. The Republic of Korea \nstrongly condemns terrorism in all forms, committed \nby whomever, wherever and for whatever purpose. We \nfully support the ongoing global anti-terrorism efforts. \nThe Republic of Korea is party to 12 existing anti-\nterrorism conventions, while being in the process of \nratifying the latest International Convention for the \nSuppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism. We are also \nof the view that the United Nations should lose no \nmore time in concluding a comprehensive convention \non terrorism. \n The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction \n(WMDs) and their delivery systems poses an \never-increasing threat to the international community. \nTo curb WMD proliferation, our highest priority must \nbe to restore the integrity and relevance of the global \nnuclear non-proliferation regime. In fact the Treaty on \nthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) \nregime is at a crossroads. It has faced unprecedented \nchallenges in recent years. In responding to those \nchallenges we need to pool our wisdom to strengthen \nthe current nuclear non-proliferation regime. The \ninherent deficiencies in the NPT should be remedied, \nand effective multilateral tools should be further \ndeveloped to better serve the purposes of both nuclear \nnon-proliferation and the peaceful use of nuclear \nenergy.  \n As home to the world\u2019s sixth-largest civil nuclear \nenergy industry, the Republic of Korea regards the \npeaceful use of nuclear energy as crucial to our \nsustainable energy supply and economic development. \nThat is all the more reason why we support \nstrengthened safeguards against possible proliferation \nas a guarantee of the expanded use of nuclear energy \nfor peaceful purposes. \n Among the proliferation challenges facing the \ninternational community, the nuclear issue of the \nDemocratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea requires our \nimmediate attention. That problem, if not resolved \nsoon, will seriously undermine the NPT regime. It also \nhas significant implications for peace and security in \nNorth-East Asia and beyond. The Six-Party Talks are \nthe main vehicle through which to resolve the nuclear \nissue of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea. \nThat process has made significant progress since its \nlaunch in 2003. In the Joint Statement of September \n2005, the six nations agreed on a blueprint for the \ndenuclearization of the Korean peninsula. The \nAgreement on Initial Actions, of February this year, \ntook that consensus another step forward, laying out \nspecific actions to implement the Joint Statement. We \nhope that another agreement will be reached during the \nnew round of the Six-Party Talks now under way in \nBeijing, leading to the disabling of the nuclear \nfacilities of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of \nKorea. \n On the Korean peninsula, inter-Korean relations \nwill be taken to a higher level with the summit meeting \nto be held in Pyongyang next week between President \nRoh Moo-hyun and Chairman Kim Jong-il. The summit \nwill first of all aim at consolidating peace on the \nKorean peninsula. The Democratic People\u2019s Republic \nof Korea will be encouraged to move forward on the \npath to denuclearization. In the same vein, the leaders \nwill explore ways to increase mutual trust through \npolitical and military confidence-building measures, as \nwell as ways to lay the groundwork for an eventual \ninter-Korean economic community. With progress in \nthe denuclearization process, a new peace regime will \nbe established on the Korean peninsula to replace the \nhalf-century-old armistice. The deepening of inter-\nKorean relations and the improvement of ties between \nthe Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea and other \ncountries concerned will warrant such a change.  \n The resolution of the nuclear issue of the \nDemocratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea will thus have \na ripple effect, extending its benefits well beyond the \nKorean peninsula. The denuclearization of the Korean \npeninsula will strengthen the NPT regime, serving as a \nuseful example of a negotiated solution for similar \nproblems in other parts of the world, including those in \nthe Middle East. A peace process on the Korean \npeninsula will open the path to a regional security \ndialogue, and the resultant improvement in North-East \nAsian security will further strengthen regional and \nglobal cooperation for peace and prosperity.  \n That may be an optimistic view. But it is \nimportant that we see not only the threats and \nchallenges in our world but also the opportunities. With \nthe ongoing Six-Party Talks and next week\u2019s inter-\nKorean summit, we see a real opportunity for change, \nand we hope that our partners in this process will help \nus to transform today\u2019s uncertainty into tomorrow\u2019s \nstability and prosperity. \n Our efforts in North-East Asia are a testament to \nthe importance of diplomacy and international \ncooperation, as exemplified by the United Nations. \nEven the most daunting challenges can be overcome \nwhen nations join forces to share the burden. For the \nRepublic of Korea, that is a lesson we have learned \nthrough hard experience. Ever mindful of the days \nwhen we gratefully received the assistance and support \nof the international community for our very survival, \nwe now try to help others, whether by working to \nstrengthen regional security, participating in \npeacekeeping missions far from home, or sharing our \nresources and knowledge. These will be our modest \ncontributions to the betterment of all humanity, the \nnoble purpose embodied in the United Nations. \n"

        "file_text": "Three thousand years ago, the \npeople of Israel journeyed from slavery in Egypt to \nindependence in the land of Israel. The Bible tells us \nthat on their voyage to liberty they made a crucial stop \nand received the Ten Commandments at Mount Sinai. \n As the General Assembly gathers this year, the \nJewish people recall that historic journey by marking \nthe festival of Sukkot. And every year, at this time, our \npeople remember that the long march to freedom \nrequires the acceptance of humanity\u2019s basic values. \n For 60 years, since the rebirth of our State in our \nancient homeland, with Jerusalem at its heart, we have \nnot lost sight of this principle. The core values of \ntolerance, coexistence and peace that lie at the heart of \nevery democracy must be protected within societies \nand promoted between them. This is the calling of our \ngeneration. \n The conflict in our region is driven by those who \nreject these core values   those who seek power \nwithout responsibility, those whose aim is not to \nrealize their own rights but to deny those rights for \nothers. At its heart, this is a conflict not about territory, \nbut about values. \n There is, of course, a territorial dimension to our \ndispute. We know this and, as we have proven in the \npast, we are prepared for the territorial compromise \nthat lasting peace entails. But we also know, especially \nafter withdrawing from Lebanon and Gaza, that \nterritorial withdrawal by itself will not bring peace \nunless we address the core clash of values that lies \nbeneath the conflict. \n Israel may be on the front lines of this battle, but \nit is not our fight alone. This is a global battle. The \nnotion that this battle is a local one, limited to isolated \nregions, collapsed in this city with the twin towers on a \nSeptember morning six years ago. Today, it is clear that \nthe extremists are engaged in a bloody war against \ncivilians and communities, against hearts and minds, in \nevery corner of the world. \n And it is clear, too, that the Middle East conflict \nis not the cause of this global extremist agenda, but a \nconsequence of it. Yes, it is up to the parties in the \nMiddle East to settle their political conflict, and Israel, \nfor its part, desires to do so. But for success to be \ngenuine and lasting, you, the nations of the world, need \nto be partners in a shared global struggle against the \nextremism and terror that feed conflict, for your sake, \nnot just for ours. \n It is in this spirit that I would like to speak today \nabout resolving our particular conflict, but also about  \nthe wider battle being waged today   the battle that \naffects us all. This battle is global, not just because it \ntargets civilians everywhere, but also because the \nextremists have taken aim at the fundamental pillars of \nevery modern society   namely, democracy, tolerance \nand education. These are the new battlefields of the \ntwenty-first century, and it is in these arenas, more than \nany other, that the future of our world will be decided. \n I believe in democracy. I believe in its \nextraordinary power to produce free and peaceful \nsocieties founded on respect for human rights. \nDemocracy is a profound ideal, but it is also a \nvulnerable one. \n Today, in different parts of the world, extremists, \nwho are opposed to the very ideals of democracy, are \nentering the democratic process, not to abandon their \nviolent agenda but to advance it. As a spokesman for \nAl-Qaida recently declared, \u201cWe will use your \ndemocracy to destroy your democracy\u201d. This should be \na wake-up call for all of us. \n It is time to reclaim democracy, and this begins \nby rejecting those who abuse it. Genuine democracy is \nabout values before it is about voting. No true \ndemocracy on Earth allows armed militia or groups \nwith racist or violent agendas to participate in \nelections. But some demonstrate a troubling double \nstandard. There are some who insist on high standards \nin their own country but forget them when they look \nabroad. Violent extremists who could never run for \noffice at home are treated as legitimate politicians \nwhen elected elsewhere. As a result, we empower those \nwho use democratic means to advance anti-democratic \nends. And we strengthen the forces of those who not \nonly undermine their societies but also threaten our \nown. \n Today, from this podium, I call on the \ninternational community to adopt at the global level \nwhat democracies apply at the national one: a universal \nset of standards for participation in genuine democratic \nelections. We need a universal democratic code that \nrequires that all those seeking the legitimacy of the \ndemocratic process earn it by respecting such \nprinciples as State monopoly over the lawful use of \nforce, the rejection of racism and violence and the \nprotection of the rights of others. \n The goal of such a universal code is not to dictate \nour values or to stifle legitimate voices with which we \nmay disagree. Its goal is to protect core democratic \nvalues from those determined to use the democratic \nsystem against itself; and to make clear that \nparticipation in the democratic process is not just a \nright   it is also a responsibility. \n I know that the temptation to engage with \nextremists can be strong. It may seem to promise \nstability and quiet. We may hope that by feeding the \nbeast we can gradually tame it. As free societies, we \npride ourselves, rightly, on our respect for difference \nand diversity. But we do a disservice to diversity when, \nin its name, we tolerate the intolerant. \n Bitter experience has shown that buying off \nextremists is a short-term fix for which we will pay \ndearly in the long run. Instead, groups such as Hamas \nand Hizbullah must be presented with a clear choice \nbetween the path of violence and the path of \nlegitimacy. They cannot have both. And it is this same \nstark choice that must be presented to the radical \nregime in Iran. \n No responsible State disagrees that Iran is the \nmost prominent sponsor of terrorism. It is a major \nsource of instability and conflict in Iraq, Lebanon, \nPalestine and across the entire Middle East; and it is \nthe enemy of Arab-Israeli coexistence. No one \ndisagrees that Iran denies the Holocaust and speaks \nopenly of its desire to wipe a Member State   mine   \noff the map. And no one disagrees that, in violation of \nSecurity Council resolutions, it is actively pursuing the \nmeans to achieve this end. \n But there are still those who, in the name of \nconsensus and engagement, continue to obstruct the \nurgent steps that are needed to bring Iran\u2019s sinister \nambitions to a halt. Too many see the danger, but they \nwalk idly by, hoping that someone else will take care \nof it. What is the value, we have to ask, of an \norganization which is unable to take effective action in \nthe face of a direct assault on the very principles it was \nfounded to protect? \n It is time for the United Nations, and the States of \nthe world, to live up to their promise of never again, to \nsay enough is enough, to act now and to defend their \nbasic values. It is also time to see this same kind of \nmoral conviction in the Human Rights Council, so that \nit can become a shield for the victims of human rights, \nnot a weapon for its abusers. \n Israel has never tried to avoid genuine discussion \nof its human rights record. But so long as the Council \nmaintains its wildly disproportionate focus on Israel, it \nweakens the moral voice of the United Nations, and the \nprice of this blindness is paid by the victims of human \nrights atrocities in Darfur and Myanmar and \nthroughout the world. \n There is no more accurate forecast for the future \nof a society than the lessons we teach our children. \nUnfortunately, in our region, we see children\u2019s \ntelevision programmes in which Mickey Mouse \npuppets teach the glory of being a suicide bomber and \na seven-year old girl sings of her dreams of blood and \nbattle. Religion, rather than being a source of hope and \nspiritual healing, is abused as a call to arms, as God is \ndragged once again onto the field of battle. \n It is time to reclaim religion from those who have \nmade it a weapon rather than a shelter. It is time to \nreclaim education from those who use it as a tool of \nhate rather than an opportunity. As always, the most \npowerful form of education, and the hardest, is to teach \nby example. We cannot expect our younger generation \nto value what we are not prepared ourselves to protect \nand pay a price for. And there is a price to pay. From \nthe leader who has to withstand public pressures. From \nthe businessman who has to forgo economic \nopportunity. From the teacher and spiritual guide who \nmust find the inner strength to teach truth and tolerance \nin a climate of extremism and hostility. At all levels of \nsociety, there is a price to be paid. But if we do not pay \nit today, we, and those who follow us, will face a far \ngreater bill tomorrow. \n These thoughts are in my mind as we seek, today, \nto advance the cause of Israeli-Palestinian \nreconciliation. Reconciliation is not about deciding \nwho was right or who was wrong in the past; it is about \nsharing a common vision and a common responsibility \nfor the future. In the last months, Prime Minister \nOlmert and President Abbas have been engaged in a \nsincere and genuine effort to reach the widest possible \ncommon ground on political understandings. There is \nno substitute for the bilateral process. Failure is not an \noption, but it is for the parties themselves to define \nsuccess. The foundation for true peace lies in the vision \nof two States, Israel and Palestine, living side by side \nin peace and security. The world shares this vision, but \nit is also important that it clearly embrace the two core \nprinciples that emerge from it. \n The first of these principles is: two States, two \nhomelands. Just as Israel is homeland to the Jewish \npeople, so Palestine will be established as the \nhomeland and the national answer for the Palestinian \npeople, including the refugees. \n The second is: living side by side in peace and \nsecurity. Just as a viable and prosperous Palestine in \nthe West Bank and Gaza is an Israeli interest, so must a \nsecure Israel be a Palestinian interest. The world \ncannot afford another terror State. \n Guided by these principles, the parties can define \na common border and turn the two-State vision from a \ndream into reality. To succeed, we must set our sights \non a brighter future, while responding to the challenges \nof the present and learning the lessons of the past. As \nwe make progress on concrete political understandings, \nit is just as important to change the reality on the \nground   to show Palestinians and Israelis that the \npromise of peace exists in practice, not just on paper. \n In recent months, Israel has taken tangible \nmeasures to create a better environment, and we are \nready to do more. We know that Palestinian life is full \nof day-to-day hardship. We know also, and only too \nwell, the burden of terror that Israelis bear and of our \nprimary obligation to their security. Together, we can \nchange this reality; we do not need to submit to it. \n We are not naive. We can see the difficulties \nahead and the enemies of peace that stand in our way. \nBut practical progress is possible in those areas where \nthere is an effective Palestinian Government that \naccepts the Quartet\u2019s principles and implements, \nalongside Israel, the existing Road Map obligations. \n As the parties take the risks for peace, we look to \nthe international community and the Arab and Muslim \nworld to offer support, not to stipulate conditions. This \nsupport comes in many forms. It comes through \neconomic and political assistance to the new \nPalestinian Government committed to coexistence and \nseeking to build the foundations of a peaceful and \nprosperous State. It comes through the clear \nendorsement of any political understandings reached \nbetween the parties. It comes through enhancing and \ndeepening regional ties and cooperation between the \nArab world and Israel, while in parallel we advance \ntowards Israeli-Palestinian peace. And, finally, it \ncomes by confronting those determined to prevent us \nfrom succeeding. \n We must stand up to those who have no respect \nfor human life or human liberty, those who hold \ncaptive soldiers - Gilad Shalit, Udi Goldwasser and \nEldad Regev - whose families are with us today and \nwhose pain remains always in our hearts. \n We must stand up to those who, after we \nwithdrew from Gaza to give peace a chance, chose not \nto build but to destroy and who choose, on a daily \nbasis, to target Israeli homes and kindergartens with \ntheir missiles. \n And we must stand up to those who see \ndemocracy as a tool to advance hate, who see tolerance \nas a one-way street and who see education as a means \nof poisoning the minds of the next generation. \n I believe that, despite all the obstacles, there is a \nnew moment of opportunity and an alliance of interest \nthat favours peace. Time is of the essence. We owe it to \nourselves and to our children to find both the courage \nand the wisdom to make the right choices in the right \nway. \n On this festival of Sukkot, Jews commemorate \nthe journey from slavery to freedom by leaving their \nhomes to live in fragile huts, like the shelters in which \nour ancestors lived on their way to the Promised Land. \nFor 3,000 years, these temporary huts, open to the \nelements, have been a reminder that stability and \nsecurity are ensured not only by the structures that we \nbuild but also by the values that we share. Perhaps it is \nfor this reason that the Sukkah, this fragile shelter, has \nbecome the Jewish symbol of peace. \n We turn to Jerusalem and say in our prayers every \nday: Spread over us the canopy of your peace. May it \nbe in our days, and for all nations. \n"

        "file_text": "I bring to this Assembly \nwarm greetings from the people of Vanuatu. \n Today is an important day in the histories of four \nof our Members of the United Nations family, and my \nGovernment and the people of Vanuatu congratulate \nthe people of Tuvalu, Nigeria and Cyprus on their \nindependence anniversaries, and the people of the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China on the anniversary of the \nfounding of that great nation. \n Let me also join others in extending our \nfelicitations to you, Sir. You take up your high position \nat a time when the United Nations is confronted by \nsome enormous challenges. The uncertainty shrouding \nthe horizon will severely test our common resolve to \naddress global problems.  \n The escalating tension and animosity in the world \ntoday are an affront to the principles and values of the \nOrganization and ultimately challenge international \norder. What the world needs right now is a hand of \nfriendship to rebuild trust and faith among and between \nMembers. The resounding war of words must not be \naccepted with complacency. \n As one of the smallest members of the United \nNations family of nations, Vanuatu would like to \nreaffirm its commitment to building global peace and \nsecurity. We will also continue to participate in United \nNations peacekeeping missions. \n May I also take this opportunity to acknowledge \nthe anniversary of the abolition of the slave trade some \n200 years ago. My country also suffered tremendously \nfrom those horrendous acts executed by the great \nchampions of deception and iniquity, who were \nresponsible for enslaving thousands of men, women \nand children and shipping them to foreign shores under \ninhumane conditions using malicious torture. The days \nof blackbirding are long gone, but the bitter memories \nand injurious social consequences are entrenched in the \nhistory of my country and people. I honour all the \ndescendants of slaves for their courage and their \ndetermination to live on. They deserve a special place \nin the countries in which their forefathers were forced \nto live. There also remains a huge debt owed to the \ncountries that suffered large human losses from those \nheinous crimes against humanity. We cannot exonerate \nthe past, but we can all hope for a just and better \nfuture. All countries must work together to prevent \nother insidious contemporary forms of slavery that \nhave established themselves in our societies. \n I welcome and support the decision to make \nclimate change the theme of this session of the General \nAssembly. In the same vein, my Government highly \ncommends the Secretary-General for convening last \nweek\u2019s high-level meeting, which should provide an \nimportant catalyst for the conference to be held later \nthis year in Bali. \n I should now like to take this opportunity to \nrecognize and commend the work done under the \nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate \nChange to address the effects of climate change and to \npromote mitigation and adaptation strategies. But the \npoint must be made that rapidly reducing the emission \nof greenhouse gases by all major emitters must be \nensured within the next 10 to 15 years.  \n We followed with great interest the recent debate \nabout the criteria and rules that the United Nations uses \nto decide whether a country should or should not be \nremoved from its list of least developed countries. \nGraduation is desirable and fair if, and only if, it is the \nculmination of a process of structural progress over \ntime   that is to say, progress based on irreversible \nimprovements in the structure of the economy or in the \nbasic indicators of development. It is only fair and \nlogical, therefore, that the criteria used as a basis for \nidentifying a country for graduation should be \nstructural criteria. \n The United Nations currently uses three criteria \nto identify cases for graduation. Admittedly, only two \nof the three are structural in nature. One relates to \nhuman capital   essentially as regards health and \neducation   and the other to economic vulnerability. \nThe proponents of reform of the graduation rule rightly \npostulate that those two criteria together should form \nthe basis for identifying a country for graduation. The \ncurrent graduation rule allows the United Nations to \ndeclare a country ready for graduation even if only one \nof those two paramount thresholds has been met. We \nconsider the current practice to be conceptually flawed \nand fraught with serious implications. We believe this \nanomaly can easily be remedied. \n My Government is of the view that the General \nAssembly should invite the Economic and Social \nCouncil to revisit the graduation rule in the light of the \nongoing debate, and that the experts who advise the \nCouncil should be mandated to explore reform of the \nrule with a view to making human assets and economic \nvulnerability paramount. Such a reform would do \njustice to countries that have not achieved the implied \nstructural progress. The Government of Vanuatu will \ndo its utmost to cooperate with the relevant United \nNations bodies and other like-minded nations and \nfriends in forging consensus on this matter. I am \nconvinced that such consensus implicitly exists, and \nneeds only to be formalized. \n Experts and members of the Committee for \nDevelopment Policy should also be encouraged to \nundertake in-country consultations and to experience \nfirst-hand the development conditions of countries that \nare on the verge of graduation. We are talking about the \nlivelihoods of peoples who may be seriously affected \nby decisions that are made at the United Nations. \n We must continue to work together in shaping the \narchitecture of the United Nations so that it is more \nresourceful and relevant to our times and to the peoples \nwhom we represent. \n I would like to commend the United Nations for \nincreasing its presence in the Pacific region though its \ncountry-based offices. We will encourage more \ndecentralization of functions to regional offices, which \nare better suited to responding to the needs of \nMembers.  \n The situation in the Middle East is of grave \nconcern to all peace-loving Members of the United \nNations. We earnestly pray and hope for an early end to \nthe conflict and to the suffering of all innocent \nchildren, women and men. Both Israel and Palestine \nhave the right to live in peaceful coexistence as \nindependent and sovereign States. The international \ncommunity must be realistic about the future. Let us \nallow justice, security and long-lasting peace to prevail \nfor both the Israeli and Palestinian peoples. \n My Government very much welcomes the \nadoption of the Declaration on the Rights of \nIndigenous Peoples. It is our hope that the Declaration \nwill provide a framework for addressing the grievances \nof indigenous peoples, who remain suppressed, \nalienated and disadvantaged in the land of their \nforefathers. We can only hope that this instrument will \nprovide an enabling mechanism to allow indigenous \npeoples the freedom to fully participate, without fear of \nreprisals, in the affairs and development of their \ncountries. The Declaration should also serve to restore \ndignity to those who have remained second-class \ncitizens in the land of their fathers. We cannot turn \nback the clock, but we can create a better future for \nthem. \nThe Charter of the United Nations espouses the \nprinciples that continue to guide the Organization\u2019s \nefforts in the process of self-determination. The \nCharter calls for recognition of, and respect for, the \nfundamental and inalienable rights of people and \nterritories still under colonial rule to determine their \nown future. We cannot champion democracy while \nturning a blind eye to those who have cried out for \npeace and freedom for many years, as have our \nbrothers in West Papua. It is the moral responsibility of \nthe Organization to act with diligence and to work \ntowards promoting better conditions in larger freedom. \n Finally, I would like to acknowledge the support \nof Vanuatu\u2019s major development partners   in \nparticular Australia, New Zealand, France, Japan, the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China, the United States of \nAmerica and the European Union. I would also like to \nexpress my Government\u2019s gratitude to India, Thailand, \nMalaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Turkey and various \nUnited Nations agencies for their ongoing \ncontributions to the development of Vanuatu. \n In conclusion, the world we live in today can \nonly become a better place if all countries   big and \nsmall, powerful and weak   recognize, understand, \nvalue and respect each other as equals. The pride of the \nhuman person is the essence of building equality \nbetween all persons. Respect also means accepting the \nnational sovereignty of each individual country and \nrefraining from interfering in the internal affairs of any \nState. If we are to work towards building a future that \nwill provide security, peace, hope and prosperity for all \nfuture generations, those important values must be \nupheld at all times. \n May I remind the Assembly that our personal \naims should not be paramount. We must work with all \nthe diligence and wisdom that God the Almighty has \ngiven us to serve His people.  \n"

        "file_text": "I have the  honour to address the General Assembly at its sixty-\nsecond session on behalf of the Government and \npeople of the Federation of Saint Kitts and Nevis. \n I extend heartfelt congratulations to Mr. Kerim \nand his country, the former Yugoslav Republic of \nMacedonia, on his assumption of the presidency of the \nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-second session. I assure \nhim of my delegation\u2019s full cooperation as he \nendeavours to chart the course of positive interaction \nand coordination in this international arena. \n I would also like to welcome the new Secretary-\nGeneral, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, who is assisting at his first \ngeneral debate of the General Assembly as Secretary-\nGeneral. My delegation supports him in his all-too-\nimportant task of managing the affairs of the United \nNations. \n Small island developing States such as Saint Kitts \nand Nevis rely on the United Nations to level the \nplaying field in international discourse so that we can \ninteract, contribute and benefit on an equal footing \nwith other members of the international community. \n Twenty-four years ago, Saint Kitts and Nevis \ntook the bold step of joining this body. We pledged \nthen to do all in our power to pursue peace, security, \nhuman rights and development. Twenty-four years \nlater, my beautiful country can boast that it has kept \nfaith with our people and the international community. \nIt has achieved much, and the pace and nature of its \ndevelopment set an example for other small island \ndeveloping States. \n Today, the human development index of the \nUnited Nations Development Programme ranks us \nfifty-first out of 177 countries evaluated in the world. \nSaint Kitts and Nevis has indices on per capita gross \ndomestic product, health and educational enrolment \ncomparable to those of many in the developed world. \nPleased as we are with our progress, we are all too \naware that the journey is not yet ended. Much work \nneeds to be done. Poverty in our Federation and in the \nCaribbean is still at an unacceptable level, and the \nturbulence of the global climate vitiates our continuing \ndevelopment. \n We are almost at the mid-point of the \nimplementation of the Millennium Development Goals \n(MDGs). If we were to evaluate ourselves as a whole, \nwe would have to acknowledge that many of the \ncommitments have not been met. Aid has fallen off, \nofficial development assistance has been limited, and \nwe have seen competing initiatives divert the drive of \nfulfilling the MDGs. Today, Saint Kitts and Nevis calls \nupon all States, be they in the North, South, East or \nWest, developed or developing, to do all in their power \nto ensure the realization of the fruits of our united \nvision that proposed the Millennium Development \nGoals. \n United Nations Member States are not all equal in \nendowments. Those that have more resources must \nallocate more to the global development agenda. The \ndeveloped world must meet its financing commitments, \nas agreed at the Monterrey International Conference on \nFinancing for Development. That Conference \nrepresents a landmark because, for the first time, the \ndeveloped world agreed that we were jointly \nresponsible for development and that it had a special \nrole in financing for development. That commitment, \nregrettably, has not been matched by real resources. \n The United Nations will hold a follow-up to the \nInternational Conference on Financing for \nDevelopment. The State of Qatar has generously \noffered to host that meeting. We applaud that country \nfor its commitment to the cause and we again call upon \nall countries to implement the commitments they made \nat Monterrey.  \n Saint Kitts and Nevis acknowledges that the \nHIV/AIDS pandemic constitutes a threat to our \ndevelopment and, indeed, our security. Prime Minister \nDenzil Douglas, in his capacity as Caribbean lead \nspokesman for health and human and social \ndevelopment has often stated that this matter requires \nserious and dedicated monitoring and action.  \n The fight to eradicate the scourge of HIV/AIDS \nmust continue, and we must dedicate ourselves to that \ntask. No matter the merits and demerits of the debate \nconcerning issues in relation to intellectual property \nrights, the evidence has shown that only with cheaper \nantiretroviral drugs can the HIV/AIDS pandemic at the \nminimum be managed and its threat to humankind \nreduced. Therefore, there is a need to address the issues \nrelated to the cost of these drugs so that they can be \navailable to all who need them. \n The book of Genesis reminds us that man was \nmade to coexist peacefully with his environment. The \nplanet Earth is not an inheritance; rather, it is a loan \nfrom our children and grandchildren, who hope that \none day we will return to them a clean and wholesome \nEarth. We must be careful, then, that our production \nand consumption patterns and behaviours do not \nsurpass the environment\u2019s capacity to sustain them. \n The matter of climate change is of continuing and \ngreat interest to my Government. Indeed, we view the \nassociated problems of the high frequency of abnormal \nweather, sea level rise, global warming and coastal \ndegradation as matters affecting the economic and \nenvironmental security of small States such as Saint \nKitts and Nevis. We are indeed heartened by the \npriority being accorded to this matter by the new \nSecretary-General. \n This year, Saint Kitts and Nevis signed the Kyoto \nProtocol, which signalled my country\u2019s commitment to \ndoing all that it can to reduce its carbon emissions. We \nurge other States to sign the United Nations \nFramework Convention on Climate Change and the \nKyoto Protocol. \n Indeed, Saint Kitts and Nevis will never shirk its \nresponsibilities as a global citizen. We believe that \nglobal environmental management and multinational \nefforts could resolve many issues   particularly at this \ntime, when all of us have experienced environmental \ndeterioration. We call on developed countries to \nprovide greater support to small island developing \nStates in combating the adverse effects of climate \nchange. In addition, we urge far greater South-South \ncooperation on the important matter of climate change. \n We live at a time when disasters are occurring \nwith a rapidity not previously felt. Within CARICOM, \nwe felt the impact of the passage of Hurricane Dean, \nduring which lives were lost, livelihoods were \nthreatened and, in the case of Jamaica, an election was \npostponed. That same hurricane moved on to wreak \nhavoc in Mexico and was followed very closely by \nother, equally destructive hurricanes. \n Over the past year, nearly every region of the \nworld has endured some form of natural or man-made \ndisaster. My delegation believes, therefore, that we \nneed an increase in humanitarian and disaster relief \nassistance. No country escapes the need for such \nassistance. In addition to supporting the existence and \nthe role of the Central Emergency Response Fund, we \nencourage Member States to commit to that and similar \ninitiatives. \n I now turn to United Nations reform. During the \ncourse of the sixty-first session of the General \nAssembly, the issue of reform of the United Nations \nand, in particular, system-wide coherence received \nextensive attention. Saint Kitts and Nevis believes that \nreform is necessary. My delegation\u2019s position, \ntherefore, is that the time has come for agreement on \nthe issue and on the way forward. We need continued \ndialogue, of course. But, most important, Member \nStates need to agree on a plan of action and its \nimplementation, as well as on the need to get on with \nthe job. If we do not agree, or if we remain inflexible \nregarding one another\u2019s concerns, we will all be at a \ndisadvantage. Therefore, the dialogue among \ncivilizations must continue, and implementation must \noccur, if true reform of all aspects of the United \nNations is to come to fruition. \n The United Nations must remain open to \nmembership for all States. In that regard, experience \nhas shown that United Nations membership is not a \ndeterrent to unification; consider, for example, the \nformer East Germany and West Germany. Nor is it a \npanacea for fragmentation, as some have argued, citing \nthe deconstruction of the former Soviet Union. What \nhas always been clear is that the United Nations has \nextended a warm welcome to all States and respected \nthe equality of all States. \n In the context of the principle of universality, my \ncountry renews its call for Taiwan to become a \nMember of the United Nations. It is of grave concern \nthat the 23 million people of Taiwan have been denied \nthe right to participate in the United Nations and its \nrelated bodies. During the sixty-first session, that \nexclusion and isolation were pursued even more \naggressively.  \n We, the friends of Taiwan, implore the United \nNations family to recognize that the people of Taiwan \nare a disenfranchised people. Many of us were once \nalso disenfranchised and unrepresented; but, through \ninternational recognition of our inalienable right to \nparticipate, we are here today. My delegation wishes to \nsee the same right enjoyed by the people of Taiwan. \n Taiwan has shown that it can be a true partner in \ndevelopment. In our view, the international community \nhas been deprived of the gift of that partnership at a \ntime when Taiwan\u2019s assistance could have been so \nuseful to many States in meeting the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals. \n In March of this year, the United Nations \nobserved the bicentenary of the abolition of the trans-\nAtlantic slave trade. My Prime Minister, the \nHonourable Mr. Denzil Douglas, had the distinct \nhonour of addressing this body on behalf of \nCARICOM. One of the significant results of the \ncommemoration exercise has been an \nacknowledgement that the injustice of slavery still \nexists in one form or another and that there is a need to \naddress that problem. Child slavery and economic \nslavery impact the societies of the international \ncommunity, and we need to mobilize our collective \nresources to combat those scourges. Only when that \nhas been accomplished will we be able to feel that the \nbattle waged more than 200 years ago to abolish the \ntrans-Atlantic slave trade and all elements associated \nwith it has been won. \n Finally, as we look ahead to the rest of the sixty-\nsecond session, I wish to reiterate my country\u2019s pledge \nof cooperation, commitment and dialogue to address \nthe many challenges that we will encounter in ensuring \nthat the United Nations remains the relevant forum for \ninternational relations. The United Nations must \ncontinue to be a beacon of hope for countries in search \nof peace, self-determination, respect for human rights, \nprogress, development and, very important, justice. It \nis not too late for this body to go and enchant the \nworld. \n"

        "file_text": " At the \noutset, Sir, I should like to congratulate you on your \nelection as President of the General Assembly, and to \nassure you of my country\u2019s full support during the \nsixty-second session.  \n All of us here share the hope for a more peaceful \nand harmonious world. At a time when civilian \npopulations are the targets of suicide attacks and \nsophisticated weapons, when children are forced to \nbecome soldiers, and climate change poses a threat to \nthe survival of our planet, how are we meeting our \nresponsibilities? Where does the responsibility lie \nwhen millions of men and women are suffering from \nmalnutrition and their most basic needs are not being \nmet, when injustice is everywhere, and when the \nenvironment is being destroyed? How can we \novercome those scourges assailing human beings \nthroughout the world? How can we translate our \nresponsibilities into action?  \n In attempting to answer those questions, we have \nto acknowledge two facts. The first is that respect for \nhuman rights, the rule of law and good governance are \nthe prerequisites both to achieving lasting peace and \nsecurity and to protecting the environment. We know \nnow that systematic violations of human rights and \nflagrant deficiencies in the rule of law are often the \nsource of conflicts. The second concerns the nature of \nconflicts. On the ground, battle lines are being blurred. \nState forces are confronting non-State armed groups. \nWarlords, terrorists and criminal gangs dictate the \nrules. Civilians rather than soldiers are the primary \ntargets. \n It is no longer possible to limit security policy to \nthe traditional State framework. The focus now must be \nfirst and foremost on the security of the individual. \nAccordingly, Governments and non-State armed groups \nalike are called on to respect certain basic rules \ncommon to all. \n If we are to achieve results, confrontation must \ngive way to dialogue and efforts to find solutions. \nNegotiation, dialogue and diplomacy are the tools for \nachieving success. We must overcome the barriers that \nexist between different sectors and disciplines in the \nfield of international relations. We must develop \nalliances based on shared values. That approach should \nenable us to find solutions by cutting across regional, \nideological and cultural boundaries. The recent past \nhas shown what can be achieved. The International \nCriminal Court, the Human Rights Council and the \nAnti-personnel Landmines Convention were all the \nresult of broad-based coalitions of countries in all \nregions of the world. \n However, dialogue alone will not be enough. \nExperience has shown that, without concrete \nobjectives, debates between players with very different \nviews of the world can sometimes serve to accentuate \ndifferences. In contrast, efforts to devise and \nimplement actions that are concrete and practical make \nfor cohabitation between different communities. It is \nfor that reason that Switzerland supports such \ninitiatives as the Alliance of Civilizations, along with \nthe implementation plan proposed by the secretariat of \nthe Alliance. \n Coherent overall solutions to the crises that are \ncurrently affecting the international order cannot be \nimplemented unless we take into account the interests \nof all the communities concerned. Switzerland does all \nit can to promote dialogue with all parties. That is \nparticularly the case in Lebanon, where we are offering \nthe political forces a forum in which to seek a way out \nof the current political crisis in the interest of long-\nterm stability. \n Recent developments in the occupied Palestinian \nterritories have reminded us once again, with tragic \nintensity, of the need to respect those principles. In that \nregard as well, the involvement of all parties is \nnecessary if there is to be a lasting solution. \n The same can be said for the situation in Darfur. \nMy country hopes that resolution 1769 (2007), which \nfor the first time envisages close cooperation between \nthe United Nations and the African Union, will provide \nthe inhabitants of that region with an opportunity to \nlive in peace and to achieve reconciliation after so \nmany years of suffering. \n The situation in Myanmar is alarming. \nSwitzerland calls on the Government of Myanmar to \nrenounce all forms of violence against demonstrators \nand civilians. Switzerland favours dialogue among all \nthe parties concerned, under the aegis of the Special \nAdviser of the Secretary-General. \n Lastly, there can be no peace or security without \ninternational justice. Switzerland supports in particular \nthe work of the International Criminal Court. Its \npermanent nature and the possibility of the Security \nCouncil referring situations to the Court   as it did in \nthe case of Darfur   gives that institution a preventive \neffect. For that effect to be achieved, the Court must \nhave the full support of the international community, \nwhich must ensure that all States cooperate fully with \nthe Court. \n Human security policy also applies to \nenvironmental threats. The actions of humankind have \nchanged the climate of the planet. Those changes are \ntaking place on a global scale and are resulting in \nrising temperatures, radical changes in precipitation \npatterns, rising sea levels and a disruption to the \nbalance of nature. Taken as a whole, those phenomena \npose a major threat to millions of people and the places \nwhere people live, their cultures and their living \nconditions. The risks to security, health and \ndevelopment are discussed in the Fourth Assessment \nReport of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate \nChange.  \n Today environmental problems are a threat to \nsecurity. At the political level, they require that we act \nresponsibly as human beings. They also require the \nforming of alliances to protect our natural resources. \nAlthough we have established institutions and \ninternational mechanisms to combat underdevelopment \nand promote peace and respect for human rights, we \nhave not done enough with regard to the environment. \nIt is true that we have a series of international \nconventions and national programmes and legislation. \nBut environmental governance is fragmented and lacks \nclear objectives. We therefore need to join together to \nidentify and implement commitments in order to better \nmanage resources and efforts and to protect the \nbiosphere. We also need to mobilize the United Nations \nsystem in order to respond to climate change \neffectively and coherently.  \n Switzerland therefore hopes that we will set \nambitious goals for ourselves in the second phase of \nthe Kyoto Protocol. We are ready to make a substantial \ncontribution to that collective effort, in which the \nentire international community must join. Switzerland \nbelieves that, in order to have legitimacy, any future \ninternational regime to address climate change will \nrequire the participation of all countries. In our view, \nthe United Nations Framework Convention on Climate \nChanges and the Kyoto Protocol provide the most \nappropriate starting points for all deliberations and \nnegotiations on climate change. \n Addressing the economic, social and \nenvironmental aspects of development based on respect \nfor human rights is both a challenge and a goal for all \nof us as we seek to build a world that is both freer and \nmore secure. The international community has adopted \nmany development goals in recent decades. However, \nadditional efforts must still be made to ensure greater \ncoherence in the operational system of the United \nNations. With its funds, programmes and specialized \nagencies, the system has at its disposal an excellent \nnetwork through which to ensure its presence on the \nground. It also has great moral and technical legitimacy \nand substantial operational capacity.  \n Unfortunately the system remains fragmented and \nits transaction costs are very high   costs which are to \na great extent borne by beneficiary countries \nthemselves. Major adjustments   some of which are \ndescribed in the report entitled \u201cDelivering as One\u201d   \nneed to be carried out promptly in the field so that \nUnited Nations operational bodies can meet the needs \nof partner countries more effectively. Negotiations on \nthe triennial comprehensive policy review of \noperational activities for development of the United \nNations system, which are due to begin in a few weeks, \nwill provide the appropriate framework to determine \nwhat measures are needed   especially on the basis of \nthe experiences of pilot countries that are applying the \nconcept of \u201cOne United Nations\u201d. \n We stand today at the midpoint of the timetable \nfor achieving the Millennium Development Goals. \nAlthough there is no denying that progress has been \nmade at various levels, there is still much to be done. \nAll of us - Governments, multilateral institutions, \nnon-governmental organizations and the private  \nsector   must combine our efforts across a wide front \nthat encompasses the national, regional and \ninternational spheres. Given the upcoming high-level \ndialogue on financing for development, I shall limit \nmyself merely to recalling that all of us have a \ncommon interest in improving the efficiency and the \nimpact of development assistance and in increasing the \nvolume of resources made available for it through \nofficial channels. We already know that results in this \narea can only be achieved through very considerable \njoint efforts by all partners concerned. \n The Organization has begun a process of reform \nin order to better respond to global challenges. So as to \nstrengthen the credibility and efficiency of the efforts \nof the United Nations, we must demonstrate our \ndetermination to fully carry out those reforms. There \nwas real progress in the past year, including the \nbeginning of the work of the Peacebuilding \nCommission and the Human Rights Council. That \nillustrates the ability of the United Nations to carry out \nambitious reforms in order to respond to the challenges \nof the twenty-first century. \n Switzerland is advocating for an overall \nimprovement in the working methods of the Security \nCouncil. My country will continue its efforts to \nimprove transparency in sanctions committees and to \nensure that the addition and removal of names of \npersons and entities on sanctions lists are in conformity \nwith the principles of the rule of law and human rights. \n Efficient management and a better targeted use of \navailable resources continue to pose a serious \nchallenge for the Organization. Switzerland welcomes \nthe determination of the Secretary-General to make the \nefficiency of the United Nations system one of his \npriorities. Given the progress made this year, but \nespecially because of the challenges that remain, \nSwitzerland believes that it is essential to continue the \nprocess of reform already under way. My country will \ntherefore continue to support the efforts of Secretary-\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon aimed at strengthening the \nUnited Nations and making the Organization more \nefficient.  \n If we want to move ahead, if we are determined \nto overcome the varied and interdependent challenges \nfacing the globalized world of today, and if we want to \nfree individual human beings from fear and want, we \nmust focus on concrete objectives. To that end, let us \nresolve to work tirelessly to overcome our differences \nin the interest of the nations and peoples we represent. \n"

        "file_text": "Never before have the real dangers awaiting the human \nspecies become so evident; never before have the \nviolations of international law become so evident, as \nthey increasingly jeopardize international peace and \nsecurity; never before have inequality and exclusion \nbecome so evident, as they impact over two thirds of \nthe population on our planet. \n Putting an end to wastefulness and to the \nunbridled consumerism fostered by the large \ncorporations and the power groups of a handful of \ndeveloped countries   which throw money away at the \ncost of poverty and the perpetuation of \nunderdevelopment in a vast periphery of poor countries \nwhere billions of people scramble to make a living   \nhas become a key factor for the survival of mankind. \nThe high-level meeting of this General Assembly held \nonly two days ago emphasized the danger posed by the \naccelerated global warming that is already affecting us \nand by its effect on climate change. Action must be \ntaken   and quickly. The developed countries have the \nmoral duty and the historic responsibility to set the \nexample and spearhead the effort. \n On the other hand, several of our countries, \nalways from the South, continue to fall prey to \nunacceptable acts of aggression by the ever-powerful, \nwhich are essentially driven by the insatiable hunger \nfor strategic resources. The wars of conquest and the \nproclamation and implementation of doctrines based on \npre-emptive wars   which do not exclude the use of \nnuclear weapons, even against non-nuclear States   \nand the repeated use of pretexts such as the alleged war \non terror, the supposed promotion of democracy or \nso-called regime change in countries that are \nunilaterally labelled as rogue States are today the \ngreatest and most serious threat to peace and security \nin the world. \n Aggression and illegal occupation of countries, \nmilitary intervention contrary to international law and \nthe purposes and principles enshrined in the United \nNations Charter, the bombing of civilians and torture \ncontinue to be daily practices. Under the false litany of \nfreedom and democracy, an attempt is made to justify \nthe pillaging of the natural resources in the third world \nand to control zones of increasing geo-strategic \nimportance. That and no other is the imperial \ndomination plan that the mightiest military superpower \never to exist intends to impose through blood and fire. \n Far from behaving in international relations \naccording to the principles of solidarity, social and \ninternational justice, equality and development for all, \nthere is no hesitation at all in employing the practices \nof certifying countries, of imposing unilateral \nblockades and of threatening through aggression, \nblackmail and coercion. If a small country defends its \nright to independence, it is accused of being a rogue \nState; if a Power launches an attack against a country, \nit is said that it liberates them; a fighter against foreign \naggression is a terrorist; an attacking soldier is a \nfreedom fighter. That is the media war, the twisting of \ntruths, the tyranny of monolithic thinking in a \nglobalized world. \n Instead of moving towards general and complete \ndisarmament   including nuclear disarmament, which \nhas been an ongoing demand of the Movement of \nNon-Aligned Countries for decades   what we see is \nthe promotion of the arms race and the squandering of \nwealth on new weapons and arms systems that deplete \nthe resources that the world needs to mitigate the \neffects of climate change and address the very serious \nproblems stemming from poverty and marginalization. \n An attempt is made to prevent, in a politicized \nand selective fashion, the implementation of the \nprinciple   already proclaimed in the \nNon-Proliferation Treaty   that nations have the right \nto the development of nuclear energy for peaceful \npurposes. Some countries are threatened with war and \ndestruction while the aggressive ally is permitted to \nhave hundreds of nuclear devices and is constantly \nhelped to modernize them. \n How much longer will it take and how many new \nvictims will have to die before the hawks of war \nunderstand that weapons are useless in resolving the \ncritical problems of humankind? On a day like today, it \nis worth recalling the words uttered by President Fidel \nCastro in this General Assembly in October 1979: \n  \u201cLet us say farewell to arms, and let us in a \ncivilized manner dedicate ourselves to the most \npressing problems of our times. This is the \nresponsibility, this is the most sacred duty of the \nstatesmen of all the world. Moreover, this is the \nbasic premise for human survival. \n There has been no progress to date towards \nfulfilling the Millennium Goals and the decisions of \nthe major United Nations conferences held over the \npast decade. Poverty has not decreased. Inequality \namong and within countries is on the rise. Drinking \nwater is not accessible to 1.1 billion people; 2.6 billion \nlack health services; over 800 million are illiterate and \n115 million children do not attend primary school; 850 \nmillion starve every day. One per cent of the world\u2019s \nrichest people own 40 per cent of the wealth, while 50 \nper cent of the world\u2019s population has barely \n1 per cent. All this is happening in a world that spends \na trillion dollars on weapons and another trillion on \nadvertising. \n The nearly 1 billion people living in developed \ncountries consume approximately half of all the energy, \nwhile 2 billion poor people are still not acquainted with \nelectricity. Is that the world that they want us to \naccept? Is that, by any chance, the future that we \nshould settle for? Are we entitled or not to fight to \nchange that state of things? Should we or should we \nnot fight to make a better world possible? \n Why are such colossal resources squandered on \nthe killing industry and not used to save lives? Why are \nschools not built instead of nuclear submarines, and \nhospitals instead of \u201csmart\u201d bombs? Why are vaccines \nnot produced instead of armoured vehicles, and more \nfood instead of more fighter jets? Why is there no \nmomentum given to research to fight AIDS, malaria \nand tuberculosis instead of promoting the manufacture \nof anti-missile shields? Why is there no war waged \nagainst poverty instead of against the poor? \n Despite the fact that only $150 billion is needed \nto meet the Millennium Goals, we hear the hypocritical \nassertion that there is no source from which to obtain \nthe necessary financial resources. That is a lie. There is \nmoney in abundance; what is lacking is the political \nwill, ethics and the real commitment of those who have \nto make a choice. \n If they really want money to appear, let the \ncommitment of setting aside 0.7 per cent of gross \nnational product as official development assistance be \nmet once and for all. That would require $141 billion \nover and above the current amounts. At the height of \ndeceit, the donor countries are now auditing the \ncancellations of a debt that they know they will not be \nable to collect in order to artificially inflate their \ncontributions. Let the foreign debt, which our countries \nhave already paid more than once, be cancelled. That \nwould make it possible to set aside for development the \nover $400 billion currently used to service a debt that \ndoes not cease to grow. \n Let the Doha Round for development come to an \nend and let the $300 billion in agricultural subsidies for \nthe developed countries be removed. That would make \nit possible to earmark that money to fight rural poverty \nand food insecurity and to ensure fair prices for the \nexport products of the underdeveloped countries. \n Let our right to development be recognized. Let \nour right to have access to markets, patents and \ntechnologies be guaranteed, for those are now the \nexclusive monopoly of the powerful. Let our countries \nbe helped in training professionals and scientists and \nlet the brain drain stop. \n The non-aligned countries need no alms; we need \nand demand justice. Let our rights to cultural diversity \nbe respected, as well as our right to the preservation of \nour heritage, our symbols and our idiosyncrasies. That \nwas the unanimous demand made in Tehran by the \nnon-aligned countries at our ministerial meeting on \nhuman rights and cultural diversity. \n The non-aligned countries want a more \ndemocratic and transparent United Nations in which \nthe General Assembly, its most representative and \ndemocratic body, can truly implement the powers \nvested in it. We need a United Nations with a reformed \nSecurity Council, acting in conformity with the \nmandate granted to it by the Organization\u2019s Charter \nwithout infringing on the functions and prerogatives of \nother organs of the system. There must be a Security \nCouncil with an expanded membership in line with the \ncurrent composition of the United Nations, where the \nunderdeveloped countries are the majority. There must \nbe a Security Council with a radical modification to its \nworking methods in order to allow transparency and \nthe access of all Member States to its deliberations. \n We need a Human Rights Council that prevents \nthe repetition of the serious mistakes made by the \nformer Commission on Human Rights. The Council \nshould enshrine in its practices the principle that \nhuman rights are universal, indivisible and \ninterdependent. It should put an end to selectivity and \ndouble standards. The non-aligned countries will \nfirmly oppose the devilish schemes of some mighty \nquarters that, frustrated as they are at failing to achieve \ntheir goals, are now attempting to reopen and call into \nquestion the agreement reached in the hard and \ndifficult process of institution-building in the Council. \n The non-aligned countries will not give up on \ndefence of the precepts that underlie our movement. \nAmong the nations, we will foster relations of \nfriendship based on respect for the principles of \nsovereignty, equality of rights and the self-\ndetermination of peoples. \n We will continue to defend the right of the grief-\nstricken and heroic people of Palestine to have their \nown State, with East Jerusalem as its capital. We will \ncontinue to condemn the genocide committed against \nit. We will continue to proclaim the right of the people \nof Puerto Rico to sovereignty and to independence. The \nnon-aligned countries account for nearly two thirds of \nthe membership of the United Nations. Our demands \nwill not be forgotten or our interests ignored.  \n This was supposed to be the end of my statement \nas Chair of the Non-Aligned Movement. However, the \nshameless and gross behaviour of the United States \nPresident in this Hall yesterday morning now forces me \nto utter a few remarks on Cuba\u2019s behalf. \n With foul language and an arrogant tone, \nPresident Bush insulted and threatened some 10 \ncountries. He gave orders in a firm and authoritarian \nfashion to the General Assembly, and with an \nofficiousness never before seen in this Hall he dished \nout terms and judgments on a score of countries. It was \nan embarrassing show   the delirium tremens of the \nworld\u2019s policeman, the intoxication of imperial power \nimbued with the mediocrity and cynicism of those who \nthreaten to launch wars in which they know their lives \nare not at stake. \n The President of the United States has no right to \npass judgment on any other sovereign nation on this \nplanet. Having powerful nuclear weapons offers no \nright whatsoever to tread upon the rights of the peoples \nof the other 191 countries that are represented here. \nAnd the determination and courage of peoples should \nnot be underestimated when it comes to defending their \nrights. After all, what prevails is not the power of \ncannons but the fairness of the ideas for which you are \nfighting. The warmongering and menacing President \nshould have already learned this by now: sovereign \nequality of States, not regime change; respect for \nsovereignty, not unilateral certifications of good \nbehaviour; respect for international law, not illegal \nblockades and wars. \n President Bush talked about democracy, but we \nall know that he is lying. He came into office through \nfraud and deceit. We would have been spared his \npresence yesterday and would have listened to \nPresident Albert Gore talking about climate change and \nthe risks to our species. We also recall how he brazenly \nsupported the coup d\u2019\u00e9tat against the President and the \nconstitution of Venezuela. \n He talked about peace, but we know that he is \nlying. We remember well when he threatened 60 or \nmore countries, which he called \u201cdark corners of the \nworld, saying that he would wipe them off the face of \nthe Earth with pre-emptive surprise attacks. Bush is a \nstrange warrior who, from the rearguard, sends the \nyoung people of his country to kill and to die \nthousands of kilometres away. \n He talked about human rights, but we know that \nhe is lying. He is responsible for the death of 600,000 \ncivilians in Iraq; he authorized tortures at the \nGuant\u00e1namo naval base and at Abu Ghraib; and he is \nan accessory to the kidnapping and disappearance of \npeople, as well as to the secret flights and the \nclandestine prisons. \n He talked about the fight against terrorism, but \nwe know that he is lying. He has ensured complete \nimpunity for the most abominable terrorist groups \nwhich, from Miami, have perpetrated horrendous \ncrimes against the Cuban people. President Bush \nattacked the new Human Rights Council. He is \nbleeding from his wound; he is grunting his \nhelplessness. He is haunted by the shamefulness that, \nduring his term in office, the United States cannot even \nlook forward to being a member because elections are \nthrough secret ballot. Cuba, on the other hand, was \nelected as a founding member of the Council with more \nthan two thirds of the votes. \n He talked about cooperation, development and \nprosperity for the rest of the world, but we all know \nthat he is lying. He has been the most selfish and \nreckless politician we have ever seen. In a world that \nthis year will bear witness to the death of 10 million \nchildren under the age of five through preventable \ndiseases, his self-seeking and empty proposals of \nyesterday are but a sick joke. \n President Bush has no moral authority or \ncredibility to judge anyone. He should be held \naccountable to the world for his crimes. There is a limit \nto both arrogance and hypocrisy. There is a limit to lies \nand blackmail. Cuba rejects and condemns every one \nof the mendacious words uttered yesterday by the \nPresident of the United States. \n Cuba appreciates the solidarity it has received \nfrom the General Assembly in its struggle against the \nblockade and the aggression that it has been forced to \nendure for nearly five decades. In particular, I thank \nthe President of Nicaragua, Comrade Daniel Ortega, \nwho is here in the Hall, for his kind words yesterday, \nand I thank all those who have spoken out for the rights \nand justice for the Cuban people. Cuba thanks all those \nwho have supported its tenacious fight against \nterrorism and have raised their voice in favour of the \nrelease of five Cuban anti-terrorism fighters unjustly \nimprisoned in the United States. \n Cuba will fight, along with all other members of \nthe Non-Aligned Movement, in order to achieve a more \njust and democratic international order, in which our \npeoples can exercise their right to peace and \ndevelopment. We may be accused of being dreamers, \nbut we are fighting with the conviction that today\u2019s \ndreams will be tomorrow\u2019s realities. We are fighting   \nand we will not stop fighting   with the conviction \nthat even when there are individuals without decorum, \nthere are always others who have in themselves the \ndecorum of many and who bear within themselves an \nentire nations, as well as human dignity. \n"

        "file_text": "Allow me to extend my  congratulations to Mr. Srgjan Kerim on his election to \nthe high office of President of the General Assembly at \nits sixty-second session. I would also like to recognize \nSheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa of Bahrain for her \ndistinguished service as President of the Assembly at \nits sixty-first session. \n Please allow me also to extend my appreciation to \nthe Secretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for his strong \ncommitment and unceasing efforts in addressing issues \nof peace and security in many parts of the world where \nmany conflicts and tensions remain unresolved. I wish \nto assure him of my Government\u2019s constructive support \nand its wholehearted commitment to peace and security \nin our region.  \n This session of the General Assembly provides \nMember States with the opportunity to address the \nchallenges and threats that continue to preoccupy us, \nincluding the lack of peace and security and the \npresence of extreme poverty, underdevelopment, \nenvironmental degradation and natural disasters.  \n In the interest of brevity, let me now revert to \nmore pressing problems closer to home. For the past \nfive years, it has, sadly, become almost a ritual for my \nGovernment to urge, from this rostrum, the \ninternational community, and especially the Security \nCouncil, to shoulder their fundamental responsibilities \nfor the maintenance of peace and security in our part of \nthe world. The legal principles at stake and the \nlooming threat to regional peace and stability have \nbeen and remain stark indeed. The hard facts are \nneither controversial nor ambiguous.  \n In flagrant breach of international law, the \nCharter of the United Nations and the Algiers Peace \nAgreement, Ethiopia continues to occupy sovereign \nEritrean territories through military force. Ethiopia \ncontinues to reject the final and binding decision of the \nEritrea-Ethiopia Boundary Commission (EEBC) and to \nobstruct the demarcation of the boundary, to which end \nthe international community has deployed the United \nNations Mission in Eritrea and Ethiopia (UNMEE) at \nan annual running cost about $200 million. Ethiopia \ncontinues to violate with impunity fundamental \nprinciples of international law, including full respect \nfor the sovereignty and territorial integrity of a fellow \nUnited Nations Member State, the integrity of \ninternational treaties and the norms of settling disputes \nthrough binding arbitration. Those are the indelible \nfacts on the ground that have been and are spawning a \nclimate of permanent and escalating tension in our part \nof the world. \n Throughout these years, the Boundary \nCommission has filed no less than 24 reports to the \nSecurity Council underlining the gravity of the \nsituation. The EEBC has no independent means or \npowers of enforcement. The legal authority and powers \nof enforcement reside, squarely and explicitly, with the \nSecurity Council, which is the guarantor of the Algiers \nPeace Agreement. As such, the United Nations Security \nCouncil should long have taken remedial action, both \nin accordance with Article 14 of the Algiers Peace \nAgreement as well as on the basis of Article 39 of the \nUnited Nations Charter. But that has not happened to \ndate. Ethiopia has managed to frustrate the EEBC \ndecision and the demarcation of the boundary   which \nshould have been completed by 2003   because of the \nunwarranted positions of some United Nations Security \nCouncil member States, and especially the United \nStates of America, which has regrettably chosen to \nplacate Ethiopia at the expense of international law and \nthe interests of regional peace and security. \n It was against the backdrop of Ethiopia\u2019s defiance \nand violation of international law that the Boundary \nCommission convened a meeting of the parties in The \nHague early last month. Ethiopia first sought to prevent \nthe meeting from taking place by raising spurious legal \nobjections to the original venue   New York. And \nwhen that bogus pretext was removed and the meeting \nwas convened in The Hague, Ethiopia failed to respond \nto the five conditions that the Commission had \nimposed so that it could proceed and embark on the \ntime-bound schedule of operations that had been \nworked out in order to complete pillar emplacements \nalong the 1000 kilometre border in the coming months. \nThe five conditions that Ethiopia was requested to \nfulfil were: first, to indicate its unqualified acceptance \nof the 2002 Delimitation Decision without requiring \nbroader ranging negotiations between the parties; \nsecondly, to lift restrictions on the movement of EEBC \npersonnel; thirdly, to provide security assurances; \nfourthly, to meet payment arrears and fifthly, to allow \nfree access to pillar locations. \n At the Commission\u2019s meeting, Eritrea committed \nitself once again to cooperate with the demarcation in \nall of the respects regarding which the Commission had \nexpressed concern. Eritrea\u2019s commitments were made \nboth in writing and verbally, in front of the \nCommission and other participants. \n Eritrea asks merely that Ethiopia make the same \ncommitment to support the demarcation in accordance \nwith the Commission\u2019s legitimate instructions. \nEthiopia, however, made it clear that it had no \nintention of complying with the Commission\u2019s \ndemarcation instructions and raised tangential issues, \nwhich my delegation has fully addressed in the full text \nof my statement.  \n After the recent Boundary Commission meeting in \nearly September in The Hague   which I mentioned   \nthe text of a letter came to Eritrea\u2019s attention. The letter \nhad been circulated to the public and the media without \ncommunicating it to the Eritrean Government through \nappropriate diplomatic or legal channel. In the letter \nthe Ethiopian Foreign Minister indicated Ethiopia\u2019s \nintention to attempt to renounce the two Algiers \nAgreements in accordance with which the Eritrea-\nEthiopia border war of 1998-2000 was brought to an \nend.  \n The substance of Ethiopia\u2019s letter and its timing \nunderscored the fact that the letter was intended simply \nas another effort to subvert the implementation of the \nfinal and binding award of the Eritrea-Ethiopia \nBoundary Commission. As such, that effort is clearly \nunlawful under the Vienna Convention on the Law of \nTreaties and other principles of international law, as \nwell as highly detrimental to regional peace and \nsecurity. \n The Vienna Convention does not support \nEthiopia\u2019s effort to deny legal force to the \nCommission\u2019s award. Even if Ethiopia\u2019s renunciation \nattempts were legally effective   which they are  \nnot   Article 70 of the Convention states that the \nboundary established under the Algiers Agreement \nremains binding on both parties. \n The Vienna Convention cannot simply be \ninterpreted to permit the dissatisfied party in a \nboundary arbitration to renounce the result \nretroactively. Indeed, Ethiopia seems to be planning to \nuse its unlawful attempt to renounce the Algiers \nAgreements in order to renew hostilities. The Algiers \nAgreements were designed to put an end once and for \nall to the two States\u2019 conflicting claims to territory and \nthus to leave the two States free to rebuild their \nrelationship for the good of both of their peoples.  \n In the five and one half years since the Boundary \nCommission\u2019s delimitation decision, however, Ethiopia \nhas repeatedly obstructed implementation of the \ndecision and threatened to walk out on the process \naltogether, if it was not given everything that it wanted. \nWhile tens of thousands of Eritreans indigenous to the \nEthiopian-occupied regions wait in internally displaced \npersons camps for the chance to peacefully enjoy the \nbenefits of the final and binding award, Ethiopia is \nmoving new settlers onto their land, attempting to \nmake its illegal occupation of Eritrean territory \npermanent. That is in breach of the Algiers \nAgreements, in particular the Agreement on Cessation \nof Hostilities, and Chapter VII of the United Nations \nCharter should have been invoked to end Ethiopia\u2019s \nflagrant violations with impunity of international law.  \n Eritrea sincerely hopes that the demarcation \nprocess can be restarted, in accordance with \ninternational law and consistent with the final and \nbinding delimitation award of 13 April 2002. This is \nthe central tenet of the Algiers Agreements and the key \nto reinstating regional harmony. It is important for \neffective action to be taken in the interest of legality \nand the maintenance of regional peace and security. \nThe United Nations and the Security Council have \nunequivocal legal and moral responsibilities to ensure \nthat this occurs without further delay and some Powers \nwith major interests in the region need to reassess their \npolicies so that the peoples in the region can live in \npeace and harmony. \n Ethiopia\u2019s invasion of Somalia has become a \nserious concern in our region, and the Security Council \nand members of the international community must \ninsist on the unconditional and immediate withdrawal \nof all Ethiopian troops from Somalia in order to end \nthe occupation. \n I do not wish to conclude my statement without \nbriefly touching on the progress and the challenges that \nlie ahead in the peace process in the Sudan. The Sudan \nhas come a long way in addressing its internal \nconflicts, both by concluding peace agreements and by \nengaging in the implementation process of the terms \nand conditions of the peace accords. Eritrea will \ncontinue to lend its support to the peace process in \nDarfur by working closely with all concerned parties \nand countries, including the United Nations and the \nAfrican Union, in order to achieve a robust peace \npackage that will bring a lasting solution. In that \nregard, Eritrea looks forward to the Tripoli meeting \nlater this month. \n"

        "file_text": "First of all, I wish to \nwarmly congratulate His Excellency Mr. Kerim of the \nRepublic of Macedonia for his election to the \npresidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-second \nsession. I am confident that, under his able guidance, \nthis year\u2019s session will be concluded with success. My \nappreciation also goes to Her Excellency Ms. Haya \nRashed Al-Khalifa of the Kingdom of Bahrain for her \nbrilliant leadership as the President of the sixty-first \nsession, which produced significant achievements \nduring the past year. \n I am also very delighted to express my most \ncordial felicitations to His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-\nmoon on his appointment as the United Nations \nSecretary-General. I have no doubt that under his wise \nleadership our world body will certainly become even \nmore relevant and effective in responding to the \nchallenges facing us in the twenty-first century. \n Today, the world continues to confront a myriad \nof problems, ranging from peace and security to \ndevelopment, such as terrorism, regional conflicts, \npoverty, global warming, pandemic diseases, and so \nforth. These old and new emerging crises are indeed of \nglobal proportion, which require greater collective \nefforts by the world community. Therefore, as United \nNations Member States, we have to share the common \nresponsibility to address these issues more effectively \nfor the sake of humanity. \n Concerning weapons of mass destruction \n(WMDs), it is imperative that all States fully comply \nwith the existing non-proliferation legal instruments in \norder to build a better and safer world for all, \nparticularly the Non-Proliferation Treaty and the \nComprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, which laid \ndown a long-term perspective toward achieving a non-\nproliferation regime for WMDs and preventing them \nfrom falling into terrorist hands, which could trigger \nthe gravest of dangers to the international community. \n Combating terrorism remains one of the top \npriorities for all Governments. No single country can \ndeal with this unconventional threat without \ncooperation and concerted efforts, which should be \nfurther strengthened, particularly in the areas of \neducation and information-sharing among law \nenforcement authorities and intelligence agencies. \n In terms of security, we certainly cannot \nunderestimate the illegal use and circulation of small \narms and light weapons, as they can be an equally \ndangerous source of terrorism, violence and regional \nconflicts. In this context, Cambodia believes that the \n2001 United Nations Programme of Action on Small \nArms should remain the cornerstone for us all to work \ntogether to address this issue. In Cambodia, the Royal \nGovernment has developed a number of programmes, \nranging from law enforcement on arms control to a \nprogramme of weapons for development, which has \nsuccessfully led to the seizure and destruction of more \nthan 200,000 small arms and light weapons. \n Likewise, landmines still remain a serious threat \nto many nations in the developing world, especially \nthose facing armed conflicts as well as those emerging \nfrom war. These \u201csilent killers\u201d have destroyed the \nlives of many innocent peoples and maimed countless \nothers. Landmines are not only a security problem, but \na humanitarian one, as the victims become permanently \ntraumatized and physically handicapped, while their \nfamilies suffer untold misery and spiritual and material \ndeprivation. Landmines also have great impact on the \neconomy and development, as the victims constitute a \nheavy economic and social burden for governments. \n In Cambodia, the Royal Government is \ncontinuing its campaign of mine clearance by placing \nthe demining operation in its national agenda, such as \nthe Cambodian Millennium Development Goals and its \n\u201cRectangular Strategy\u201d. By July this year, more than \n1.5 million landmines had been cleared. To share our \nown experiences with other countries that are also \nvictims of landmines, Cambodia has dispatched 135 \ndeminers of the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces to \nSudan for demining action under the umbrella of the \nUnited Nations peacekeeping operation. \n Everyone nowadays recognizes that climate \nchange has become one of the most serious threats to \nhumanity and affects the whole world in this new \ncentury. To reverse this negative megatrend, Cambodia \nis of the view that all countries should effectively \nimplement the relevant United Nations instruments, \nespecially the United Nations Framework Convention \non Climate Change and its Kyoto Protocol. We also \ncall on countries that produce more greenhouse gases \nto commit to gradually reducing their emissions as \nmuch as possible.  \n At the same time, we need to develop and share \nknow-how on bioenergy in order to take measures \nagainst global warming. In addition, we need to stop \nthe deforestation in the developing countries by \nassisting them with appropriate measures and \nresources. \n In the framework of the Association of South-\nEast Asian Nations (ASEAN), our leaders will sign \nthree important documents related to climate change, \nenergy and environment during the coming ASEAN \nSummit in November of this year in Singapore. The \nsigning of these declarations clearly reflects the \npolitical commitments that ASEAN, both collectively \nand individually, has attached to the issues of climate \nchange. \n Cambodia highly appreciates the United Nations \ninitiative of convening the High-level Event on \nClimate Change here in New York on 24 September \nthis year. We hope that that high-level meeting will \nlead to significant and concrete actions to address \nopportunely this very critical issue. However, I believe \nthat a world summit under the auspices of the United \nNations would keep climate change alive on the agenda \nof world\u2019s leaders. A global problem needs a global \nsolution. \n With regard to the regional situation, Cambodia \nwelcomes the agreement reached in February this year \nthrough the process of the six party talks leading to the \nclosing down of the nuclear facilities in the Democratic \nPeople\u2019s Republic of Korea. This is a very positive step \nfor peace, security and stability in the region. We hope \nthat it will serve as an effective tool to pave the way \nfor complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. \n Concerning the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, we \napplaud recent active diplomatic initiatives, in \nparticular the high-level talks between the Prime \nMinister of Israel and the President of the Palestinian \nAuthority. We hope that those meetings and activities \nwill lead to a definitive solution that establishes a State \nof Palestine, coexisting permanently and peacefully \nside by side with Israel, in order to end the killing and \nsuffering of their peoples and for the sake of peace and \nsecurity in the region. \n With regard to the current appalling situation in \nIraq, we applaud the recent decision of the United \nStates to sizeably reduce the number of its troops in the \ncountry. However, the final and decisive solution will \ndepend on how the Iraqi people reconcile among \nthemselves. That is a sine qua non for ending the civil \nwar in the country. Otherwise, I fear that chaos will \nensue after the withdrawal of United States troops. \n In the light of our own experience, I believe that \nthe only option that will bring peace and stability to \nIraq is national reconciliation, with a win-win policy \nfor Shiites and Sunnis. But the main question that we \nshould ponder is: who or which country can contribute \nto the initial process of confidence-building before any \ngenuine reconciliation can be achieved? \n This year marks the halfway point between the \nadoption of the Millennium Development Goals \n(MDGs) in September 2000 and the target date of \n2015. Notwithstanding some overall progress, \ndeveloping countries have been experiencing \ndifficulties in meeting the MDG targets. This is despite \nthe outcomes of the many high-level meetings that \nhave been taking place throughout the world aimed at \nimproving economic development and the livelihoods \nof peoples in developing countries, such as the \nMonterrey Consensus and the Johannesburg Plan of \nImplementation. In reality, however, the situation of \ndeveloping countries has not improved much. What we \nneed now is strong commitment and political will on \nthe part of all, in particular those in the developed \nworld, to ensure that globalization will be a \nglobalization of wealth for all peoples living on this \nplanet. I hope that that is not just a dream, but a goal \nfor all. \n The Royal Government of Cambodia has come up \nwith its own MDGs, in addition to the rectangular \nstrategy and the national strategic development plan \n2006-2010, to work to achieve sustainable \ndevelopment and poverty reduction. The carrying out \nof those national blueprints has yielded strong \neconomic growth that has averaged more than 11 per \ncent over the past three years.  \n Therefore, at the Annual Ministerial Review of \nthe Economic and Social Council, held in Geneva in \nJuly of this year, Cambodia was invited, together with \nfive other countries, to make a national presentation on \nactual progress made in achieving our MDGs.  \n Concerning our Organization, the United Nations, \nwe are more than ever convinced of the urgent need for \ncomprehensive reform   and not just of the Security \nCouncil   because we need to mobilize our collective \nefforts and wisdom to address, in a responsive and \ncomprehensive way, the problems we are facing in the \ntwenty-first century. \n There is no doubt that the status quo does not \ncorrespond with the challenges confronting the world \ntoday. Cambodia is of the view that United Nations \nreform must be comprehensive. Therefore, instead of \nfocusing primarily on reform of the Security Council, \nperhaps we can start with reform that can garner a \nconsensus. For example, we could begin by \nconsidering how to make the Economic and Social \nCouncil more effective and more relevant so that it can \ndeal with the problems of development in the context \nof the MDGs. Then, of course, we also need to \nempower the General Assembly so that it can play a \nprominent role in addressing today\u2019s global problems \nas a democratic, deliberative, policymaking and \nrepresentative organ of the United Nations. Next, \nhaving built up momentum and consensus by \nreforming both the Economic and Social Council and \nthe Assembly, we could move on to reform of the \nSecurity Council to ensure that it reflects today\u2019s \nrealities, with equitable representation for developed \nand developing countries. \n To conclude, I would like to say that our world is \ncurrently facing serious threats of great proportion and \nsevere regional crises. At the same time, development \nand poverty remain high on the agendas of countries in \nmany parts of the world. Therefore, the United Nations \nmust play a more leading role if it is to respond \neffectively to those challenges. \n"

        "file_text": "Allow me at the outset to \nextend to Mr. Kerim my delegation\u2019s warmest \ncongratulations on his election to preside over the \nsixty-second session of the General Assembly. His \nelection to that high office is a tribute to his wisdom \nand skill, as well as a true reflection of the important \nrole played by his country in the international arena. I \nassure him of my delegation\u2019s full cooperation in his \nwork. \n At the same time, allow me to place on record my \ndelegation\u2019s profound gratitude and appreciation to his \npredecessor, Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa, for the \ncommendable manner in which she guided the work of \nthe sixty-first session. \n Let me also take this opportunity to express my \ndelegation\u2019s deep appreciation to the Secretary-\nGeneral, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for his dedication and \nleadership. The Maldives pledges its full support for \nthe Secretary-General\u2019s untiring work in promoting the \nnoble principles of this Organization. \n It is indeed a privilege for me to address the \nGeneral Assembly on this historic day, when the \nUnited Nations is observing the International Day of \nNon-Violence. On this day, we pay special tribute to \nMahatma Gandhi, one of the greatest men of all times.  \n The Maldives has always been a country which \nhas promoted peace, non-violence, tolerance and \nhuman rights. However, the spectre of terrorism visited \nthe Maldives this past weekend. On Saturday \nafternoon, an improvised explosive device was \ndetonated in the commercial area of our capital, Mal\u00e9, \ninjuring 12 innocent bystanders. That unprovoked \nattack was the first of its kind in our history. I would \nlike to extend our sincere sympathies to those who \nwere injured and to their families.  \n The Maldives is a country renowned for its \ntranquillity and warm welcomes. Our people are united \nin shock and outrage that this happened on our soil. \nThat shock is matched by a determination that such \ncowardly acts of aggression will not be allowed to \nundermine or jeopardize the maintenance of our \npeaceful and harmonious society. On behalf of the \npeople of the Maldives, I would like to take this \nopportunity to thank our many friends in the \ninternational community for their expressions of \nsupport and solidarity. I would particularly like to \nthank those countries that have provided us with their \nexpertise, technical advice and assistance in the \nongoing investigations. Finally, I would like to \ncommend the work of our domestic law enforcement \nand other agencies that have reacted to the incident \nwith such speed and professionalism. The incident \nserves as a reminder that no State is immune from the \nscourge of terrorism. The Maldives utterly condemns \nall acts of terrorism, wherever they are perpetrated. \n The Maldives, as a low-lying small island State, \nis particularly vulnerable to the perils of global climate \nchange, a point brought sharply into focus by the \nrecent sea swells that submerged a large part of the \ncountry. For the past 20 years, the Maldives, along \nwith its partners in the Alliance of Small Island States, \nhas thus been at the forefront of efforts to bring the \nissue of climate change and its devastating impact on \nsmall island developing States to the world\u2019s attention. \n Addressing this Assembly in 1987 at the high-\nlevel debate on environment and development, the \nPresident of the Republic of Maldives, Mr. Maumoon \nAbdul Gayoom, said: \n \u201cThe profound dilemma of environmental \ntransition is a global one, and its implications are \nworldwide and long-term. Though the Maldives \nand other low-lying archipelagic nations may \nhave to suffer the most immediate and the most \nextreme effects of a global sea-level rise, there is \na potential danger to a significant portion of the \nworld\u2019s population in the near future \u2026 No one \nnation, or even a group of nations, can alone \ncombat the onset of a global change in \nenvironment.\u201d \n Since that ground-breaking debate, the \ninternational community has convened numerous \nconferences and summits at which it has agreed on a \nwide range of plans and programmes of action aimed at \naddressing global climate change. However, as a \ncommunity of nations we must regretfully concede \nthat, all too often, the reality of implementation has \nfailed to match the ambitions of rhetoric. \n Twenty years on, greenhouse gas emission levels \nare continuing to increase unabated and the \nconsequences of global warming are becoming ever \nmore  apparent. One can only therefore conclude that \nthe past 20 years have been an era of missed \nopportunities. \n Despite those stark facts, last week\u2019s high-level \ndebate on climate change has once again given us some \nhope and encouragement. As a result of a palpable \nchange in world opinion, there is now a real sense of \ninternational momentum leading towards December\u2019s \ncrucial Conference in Bali. We believe that the \nConference offers us a chance to overcome the failed \npromises and missed opportunities of the past, and to \nbuild a new global consensus on climate change. \n We must take collective responsibility and agree \nto an integrated and comprehensive approach to \nclimate change that recognizes and covers all four \npillars of climate change policy   mitigation, \nadaptation, technology transfer and funding. While the \nnecessary steps are clear, the crucial question, as \nalways, is whether the international community has the \npolitical will to undertake those steps; to build on the \ncommitments entered into in Rio, Kyoto, \nJohannesburg, New York and elsewhere; and to secure \na successful outcome from the Bali process. \n I can assure the Assembly that the Maldives will \nplay its part in this process. I am happy to announce \nhere today my Government\u2019s intention to host a \npreparatory meeting for the Alliance of Small Island \nStates in the Maldives in November. The purpose of \nthis meeting is to draft a collective stand on the \nindividual human dimension of climate change for \nsubmission to the Bali Conference.  \n The Asian tsunami of 2004 represented the worst \nnatural disaster in the history of the Maldives. The \neconomic damage and losses alone were equivalent to \nalmost two thirds of the country\u2019s gross domestic \nproduct. Although much remains to be done to \ncomplete the process of recovery, a considerable \namount has already been achieved. We need the \ncontinued support of our development partners and the \ninternational community to overcome the challenge of \ntsunami recovery. \n The devastating tsunami threatened to derail the \nMaldives in its attempts to attain the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) and our planned \ngraduation from the list of least developed countries \n(LDCs). \n Despite the tsunami, the Maldives continues to \nmake strong progress towards the attainment of the \nMDGs. The Maldives has already achieved Goal 1, the \neradication of extreme poverty and hunger, and Goal 2, \nthe achievement of universal primary education. We \nare also on course to meet Goals 4, 5 and 6 on reducing \nchild mortality, improving maternal health, and \ncombating communicable diseases, respectively. \nConsolidating and strengthening progress towards all \nthe MDGs is a key focus of the recently launched \nseventh national development plan. \n Buoyed by these successes, the Maldives will \nnext year begin its transition period for graduation \nfrom LDC status. For the Maldives, graduation \nrepresents a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it is \nrecognition of the startling economic and social \ndevelopment that the country has enjoyed over the past \n30 years. On the other hand, graduation will bring with \nit a range of new challenges. For example, we will \nenjoy less favourable trading conditions and reduced \nlevels of development assistance. Adapting to this new \nreality will not be easy. In that regard, I would like to \nuse my speech today to once again urge our \ninternational partners to assist us in making the \ntransition as smooth as possible. \n Next year marks the sixtieth anniversary of the \nadoption of the Universal Declaration of Human \nRights. The Maldives Government is determined to \nmark the occasion by completing the country\u2019s current \nreform agenda, an ambitious programme of reforms \ndesigned to strengthen individual rights and freedoms, \nahead of multiparty elections under a new Constitution. \n Since the start of the reform agenda in 2004, the \nMaldives has made remarkable strides in the field of \nhuman rights. An independent Paris Principles-\ncompliant Human Rights Commission has been \nestablished. The Maldives has acceded to the two \nmajor human rights covenants   on civil and political \nrights, and on economic, social and cultural rights. \nLater today I will sign, on behalf of the Government, \nthe International Convention on the Rights of Persons \nwith Disabilities, meaning that the Maldives will have \nsigned or ratified eight of the nine core human rights \ntreaties. Last year, the Maldives also became the first \ncountry in Asia to ratify the Optional Protocol to the \nConvention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman \nor Degrading Treatment or Punishment. \n However, the Government readily concedes that \nmuch more needs to be done. Therefore, the \nGovernment is proceeding in its work in close \ncooperation with international human rights bodies. \nFor example, last year, the Maldives became one of the \nfew countries to extend a standing invitation to visit \nthe country to all United Nations human rights special \nrapporteurs. In addition, earlier this year, the \nGovernment invited the Office of the High \nCommissioner for Human Rights to appoint a national \nhuman rights adviser to the Maldives. \n The Maldives reiterates its support for the right of \nthe Palestinian people to an independent homeland. We \ntherefore call on the international community, led by \nthe Quartet, to revive the peace process as a matter of \nurgency.  \n The Maldives also calls on the international \ncommunity to continue and intensify its efforts to bring \npeace and stability to Iraq and Afghanistan. \n The Maldives also reiterates its steadfast \nopposition to the development, proliferation or use of \nnuclear weapons and other weapons of mass \ndestruction. \n Strengthening and revitalizing the United Nations \nto take on the new and emerging challenges of the \ntwenty-first century remains an important task. We are \nencouraged by the progress that has been made in \nimplementing the wide-ranging United Nations reform \nprogramme over the past two years. We sincerely \nbelieve, however, that these reforms cannot fully \nsucceed without the much-needed and concurrent \nreform of the Security Council. Maldives firmly \nbelieves that an effective multilateral framework is \nfundamental for the security of small States and that \nsuch a framework should take into consideration \nmodern geopolitical realities. \n In this regard, the Maldives reiterates its support \nfor the Group of Four (G-4) draft resolution on \nSecurity Council reform. We hope, therefore, that we \nwill be able to make progress on Security Council \nreform during this session. \n Before I conclude, please allow me to reaffirm \nour commitment to the principles enshrined in the \nCharter of the United Nations and to offer our full \nsupport to its continuing work for the betterment of \nhumanity and for the maintenance of international \npeace and security. \n"

        "file_text": "It is my very great pleasure to \naddress the General Assembly. I join other speakers in \ncongratulating you, Sir, on your election to the \npresidency of the General Assembly. My delegation \nhas every confidence in your ability to discharge this \nchallenge. I assure you of our support.  \n I commend your predecessor, Sheikha Haya \nRashed Al-Khalifa, for ably steering the sixty-first \nsession of the General Assembly. I would also like to \ntake this opportunity to once again congratulate the \nSecretary-General on his appointment. My delegation \nwelcomes his commitment to strengthen the pillars of \nthe United Nations: security, development and human \nrights. \n Last year, when I had the privilege of addressing \nthe Assembly, I dwelt on the issue of Somalia and how \nthe dynamic in that country had an impact in our \ncapitals and cities around the world, such as Toronto, \nStockholm, Rome, Nairobi and Mogadishu. Even \ncountries that are thousands of miles away and whose \ninteraction with Somalia has been minimal have been \nforced to awaken to the reality that we have become a \nglobal village when their citizens plying international \nwaters have been hijacked or robbed by pirates in the \nIndian Ocean along the coast of Somalia. \n Let me thank the General Assembly and the \nSecurity Council for listening to our pleas from the \nregion. I appeal for closer collaboration by the \ninternational community in addressing the complex and \ndifficult problems of Somalia. Yet, within all these \nchallenges, there are several windows of opportunity \nthat we must take advantage of to prevent extreme \nhuman suffering, especially of women and children, in \nthat sister country. \n My delegation commends the African Union for \nits support for the African Union Mission in Somalia \n(AMISOM). We pay special tribute to the Ugandan \ntroops for the important role they are playing in \nSomalia under very trying circumstances. We appeal \nfor the deployment of the remaining peacekeeping \ntroops to strengthen AMISOM. Kenya also urges the \nUnited Nations to assume greater responsibility in \nSomalia in line with Security Council resolution 1772 \n(2007). A United Nations presence on the ground in \nSomalia would complement regional and international \nefforts to promote peace, stability and reconciliation in \nthat country. \n Kenya unequivocally supports national \nreconciliation in Somalia. We see it as a process, not a \nsingle event. We urge all the political actors that \nhitherto boycotted the talks to embrace the process, \nbecause, no matter how long it takes, the final \nresolution of the Somalia crisis will only come about \nwhen all Somalis agree to sit down and talk. The \nregion and the international community can only \nprovide support. Ultimately, it is the people of Somalia \nwho can resolve their difference through a spirit of \ngive and take. For our part, as the international \ncommunity, we must honour our pledges to provide the \nnecessary resources to Somalia. The problem with \nSomalia may be less visible today, probably because it \nhas been overshadowed by the conflict in Darfur, but \nthe Somalia crisis is far from over. \n According to the Human Security Report 2005, \nthe number of armed conflicts in the world has fallen \nby over 40 per cent during the past 13 years. The \nreport\u2019s overall conclusion that conflict is becoming \nless common in the world in general as well as in \nAfrica is very encouraging. Conflict is a major \ndisincentive to investment and poses an intolerable \nburden in terms of human suffering. The end of wars in \nSierra Leone, Liberia, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Burundi, the \nDemocratic Republic of the Congo and Southern Sudan \nis a welcome development in Africa. \n While we may celebrate the end of those wars, it \nis imperative that the international community make \nthe urgent and essential investments that will \ncontribute to the prevention of recurrence of such \nconflicts. The local populations should experience \npeace dividends so as to sustain peace. \n Kenya urges a strengthening of partnerships \nbetween the African Union and the United Nations \nDepartment of Peacekeeping Operations in the area of \npolitical and technical cooperation, as well as \npartnerships with the continent\u2019s subregional \norganizations. The African Union\u2019s peacekeeping \ncapabilities and capacity must be strengthened through \nprovision of financial, technical and logistical support. \nThe recent deaths of many African Union soldiers in \nDarfur underline the urgency of the need for logistical \nsupport by the United Nations to African Union \nmissions within the agreed-upon frameworks. In this \nregard, my delegation welcomes the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s initiative to provide assistance to the African \nUnion to enhance its military capabilities and \nmediation role in conflict resolution. \n The United Nations has deployed a lot of time \nand resources in the area of disarmament and \ndevelopment. The proliferation of illicit small arms and \nlight weapons in the Horn of Africa continues to \nundermine our security and development. It has \ncontributed to making our neighbourhood a very tough \none. \n In order to address this challenge, the States of \nthe region rallied together in 2000 to sign the Nairobi \nDeclaration on the Problem of the Proliferation of \nIllicit Small Arms and Light Weapons in the Great \nLakes Region and the Horn of Africa. The Declaration \nwas upgraded in 2004 to a legally binding Protocol, the \nfirst intergovernmental instrument of its kind to \naddress the proliferation of small arms. In 2005, the \nProtocol established the Regional Centre on Small \nArms and Light Weapons (RECSA), with the main \nobjective of providing a comprehensive framework to \ncombat the availability of illicit small arms and light \nweapons in the region. In view of the importance of the \nCentre, Kenya has requested the inclusion of an item in \nthe agenda of this session of the General Assembly to \ninvite RECSA to participate in the work of the \nAssembly as an observer. Addressing the problem of \nthe proliferation of small arms is important; we are up \nagainst the very powerful international vested interests \nof small arms manufacturers and traders. \n Kenya was among the six sponsors of the draft \nresolution on the arms trade treaty that was \noverwhelmingly adopted during the last session of the \nGeneral Assembly as resolution 61/89. In that \nresolution, the General Assembly requested that the \nSecretary-General, among other things, seek the views \nof Member States on the feasibility, scope and draft \nparameters for a legally binding arms trade treaty. We \ncommend the Secretary-General for the progress made \nso far in the implementation of that resolution. We look \nforward to the establishment of a group of \nGovernmental experts to begin work next year and to \nthe group\u2019s report to the General Assembly at its next \nsession.  \n I recently had occasion to address a group of my \nfellow Foreign Ministers from our close neighbour, \nEurope, on a couple of subjects that increasingly define \nour relationship with the rest of the world, among them \nillegal immigration. It is one of the ironies of history \nthat there was a time when my brothers and sisters who \nwere unlucky and could not run fast enough were \ncaught as slaves and shipped across the oceans in very \ninhuman conditions. A large number died during the \njourney as they were sent to different parts of the world \nto provide slave labour. \n Today, many of my brothers and sisters are often \nvoluntarily offering themselves and handing over their \nlife savings to be shipped across oceans in almost \nsimilar inhuman conditions. Many of them have lost \ntheir lives during the journey. They play cat and \nmouse, attempting to avoid border patrols equipped \nwith tracer dogs and electronic monitoring, so as to get \na chance to slave most of their lives in the minimum-\nwage bracket. \n The clock has ticked full circle. But a lot has \nchanged as well. And I come back to my assertion that \ndistances between us have shrunk and we must now \nrecognize that, in this global village, a phenomenon \nsuch as economic refugees is going to be a cause of \ntrauma in our communities. You can build great walls, \nintroduce and increase more menacing border patrols \nand make your immigration meaner, but the respite can \nonly be temporary. You can whip up xenophobic \nsentiment, especially around national election times. \nBut that amounts to an ineffectual Band-Aid and does \nnot address the fundamentals of the crisis we are facing \ntoday. \n Even in the most developed countries, unless a \nsociety addresses the problems and stress in the poor \nneighbourhoods and inner cities, any solution like \nmigration into the suburbs and the construction of \ngated communities will only provide some temporary \nrelief. Crime will continue unabated. Muggings, \ncarjackings, kidnappings and other violent crime will \ncontinue to prevail. We have to address the \nfundamental problems in our poor neighbourhoods not \njust for the sake of those living in those \nneighbourhoods but also for the sake of those who live \nin relatively affluent areas. \n What I am talking about is not really rocket \nscience or some very complex social engineering \nconcept. It should be clear to all of us that, in the \nglobal village that we have come to be, it is in the \ninterest of all of us to work together to address the \nconspiracy of factors that create so much stress and \ntension within and among our countries. We must be \nlevel-headed enough to recognize that angry \nunemployed young men in one country will spill over \nsooner or later into other countries\u2019 capitals and create \nproblems. \n If nothing else, the phenomenon of global climate \nchange should teach us the lesson that our destinies as \nhuman beings are inextricably intertwined. Vehicular \nemissions in New York do the same thing to our village \nEarth as our cutting of equatorial forests in Africa to \nmake charcoal. Both actions may introduce incidents of \nfloods due climate change all the way over in distant \nChina. \n As neighbours in the global village, it is certainly \na good thing if we both come to recognize that if \nwealthy countries\u2019 policies and actions confine us to \nabject poverty, then it is only a matter of time before \nthe stress in my country will spill over into their \nneighbourhood   maybe in the form of illegal \nimmigration, terrorism or whatever. However, sooner \nor later we all have to pay for the consequences of \nselfish and short-sighted policies of the World Trade \nOrganization (WTO), the International Monetary Fund \n(IMF) and the World Bank. \n It is therefore important that as we talk about \nreform and paradigm shifts in any of these \ninternational institutions we should adopt the right \nattitude: that nobody is doing the other a favour. We \nare in this small boat called Earth together. When the \npowerful think that they are playing their advantage in \nthe global scene and winning the battles, such victory \ncan only be temporary. The only real victory is when it \nis a win-win outcome. The other outcome, when a large \npart of the world emerges as losers, is unsustainable. It \nbreeds anger and vengeance. \n Most of the resources and capacity to change our \nworld for the better are domiciled in the developed \nworld. The resources needed are more than enough in \nthe more endowed countries. The knowledge of what \nwe must do to make a positive difference is simple and \nevident. Yet as world leaders we must bear the \ncollective guilt of failing to focus on providing the \nsolutions. \n I come from a country in a region, for example, \nwhere factors such as poverty and lack of education \nconspire to stress and destabilize our communities and \ncountries. There is an autocatalytic relationship \nbetween poverty and low education. Those who have \nlow education tend to become poorer. And those who \nare poorer tend to have low education. There is also a \ncorrelation between poverty and low formal education, \non one side, and inter-ethnic, clan, religious and even \nracial tension, on the other side. This invariably leads \nto unstable societies. \n When people are poor and less educated, their \nreference point tends to become only their ethnic, clan, \nreligious or racial identity. With a few exceptions, the \neducated and affluent are at least able to operate at a \nhigher level. A doctor, a lawyer, a teacher or an \nengineer is usually less xenophobic. \n In Kenya, we understand this, and therefore we \nunderstand the importance of education. We have \ninvested up to 30 per cent of our annual budget to \nprovide free primary education. Next year, we will \nhave free secondary education. That is the type of \nsocial and economic investment we all must make now \nif we expect to have a better, more prosperous and \nmore stable world 10 years from now. We may make \nfine speeches and express a commitment to creating a \nsafer, friendlier and more prosperous world. But as \nlong as we fail to make the right investment in \neducation and poverty alleviation, we are only engaged \nin empty talk. \n The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) are \nimportant medium- and long-term goals   10 years in \nscope, usually. However, our democracies operate on a \nshorter calendar of four or five years. In both the \ndeveloped and the less developed countries, many of \nthe leaders tend to do what they must to survive and \nsucceed in the next elections. Even with best of \nintentions, the nature and scope of the challenges of \ndevelopment that we must address cannot be \nadequately solved with official development assistance \n(ODA) programmes that are implemented and \ncompleted within the political calendar of changing \nregimes. We need more paradigm shifts and a longer-\nterm vision in that regard. \n In conclusion, many of our countries are now \ncrashing under the weight of international debt. Those \nwho have actually crashed are the ones that have been \nextended a parachute after they have crashed. I am \namazed by this undertaker mentality. \n I do not wish to blame the current generation of \nleaders in the developed countries for the status quo. I \nknow that there is some financial and economic \nprinciple here. Most of the current leaders in these \ncountries are innocent. The deals that were cut in the \npast, which put us in the kind of debt we are in today, \nare no longer in place. But I feel I must say that the \nload and the burden of our international debt is heavy \nand debilitating. A lot of it should not have been \nundertaken on in the first place; there is some \ncomplicity in the dishonesty on both sides that \nprevailed before we, today\u2019s leaders, came onto the \nscene. \n It is important that today we secure the future of \nall our children, who must share this increasingly \nintertwined world. We must put behind us those \nnegative things, such as the unjustified debts of the \npast, that can only breed anger and bitterness and affect \nfuture generations. We must make the sacrifices and \nthe investment today for the future of humanity. That \nwould be a favour to all of us, and not just to one \ngroup. \n"

We fully support the project aimed at \nerecting a permanent memorial at the United Nations in \ncommemoration of that shameful period in the history \nof our world. \n At a time when the international community is \nengaged in serious reflections regarding the history and \nconsequences of slavery and the slave trade, the \nBahamas wishes to recognize Haiti as the only country \nto liberate itself from slavery and for the inspiration \nthis provided to the international campaign against \nslavery. \n Since modern forms of slavery still exist and \nsince many people continue to be held in servitude, we \nmust not relent in our resolve until everyone is able to \nenjoy and exercise the freedoms which this \nOrganization has worked so diligently to recognize, \nuphold and defend. \n Despite Haiti\u2019s proud history, challenges have \nbeset our neighbour for generations. Haiti\u2019s return to \ndemocratic order last year was especially welcomed, \nand we celebrate the strides Haiti is making along the \ndifficult and arduous road to peace, security and \ndevelopment. We heartily commend President Pr\u00e9val \nand his Administration for their stewardship of this \ndemanding process. At the same time, we also \ncommend the Organization of American States for its \nunstinting support for the people of Haiti. \n The United Nations Mission in Haiti continues to \nplay a vital role in this process, and the Bahamas \nsupports the call for that mission to be maintained so as \nto consolidate the gains made to date and thus place \nour Caribbean Community (CARICOM) sister country \non a firm and lasting path to sustainable development, \npeace, security and democracy. We urge the \ninternational community to support the people of Haiti \nin that quest. \n As Haiti lies merely 90 miles from the southern \nshores of the Bahamas, its economic and political \nsituation can and does have very tangible repercussions \nfor us all. Each year, the Bahamas is challenged by the \narrival of thousands of illegal migrants from Haiti who, \nby perilous means, journey to our shores in search of a \nbetter way of life. Ensuring that justice and democracy \nprevail in Haiti, therefore, has a positive impact not \nonly on the people of Haiti, but also on the Bahamas \nand indeed the entire region. \n The role of the United Nations in matters of \nsustainable development is crucial, particularly with \nregard to challenges demanding a truly global \nresponse \u2014 challenges such as climate change. We \ncommend the Secretary-General for bringing greater \nfocus to the issue, with the convening of the high-level \nevent on climate change last week, and are hopeful that \nthe event will provide the necessary impetus for action \nwhen Member States meet in Bali later this year. The \nConference of the Parties to the United Nations \nFramework Convention on Climate Change is indeed \nthe appropriate forum for negotiations on a post-Kyoto \nagreement, and the political will demonstrated during \nthe Secretary-General\u2019s recent high-level event should \nonly bring closer focus to an agreed agenda in that \nregard. \n For small island developing States and \narchipelagos like the Bahamas, climate change is a \nmatter of critical importance. For many of us it is not \njust a matter of economics, but a matter of survival, as \n80 per cent of our landmass is within five feet of mean \nsea level; even a one-degree rise in atmospheric \ntemperature can have devastating ecological effects. \nClimate change is particularly challenging with respect \nto the potential effects on our tourism industry, which \nis our main industry and which generates some 60 per \ncent of the Bahamas\u2019s gross domestic product. We \ntherefore cannot overemphasize the need for an \nambitious mitigation agenda for the post-Kyoto \nregime. Recent studies have shown that there are many \nmitigation options available, and many of them are \nwin-win. We must therefore, with unwavering \ncommitment, explore these options in an open and \ninclusive environment. \n For countries like the Bahamas, resources for \nadaptation are also essential. However, even access to \nexisting funds can prove difficult given the country\u2019s \ngross national income. It is therefore vital that the \nrelevant financial instruments and mechanisms be fully \noperationalized and/or improved so that they become \nmore accessible and better address the peculiar \ncircumstances and special needs of different countries. \nFurther, there is a need for greater international \ncooperation with respect to the development of new \ntechnologies, as well as the transfer of such \ntechnologies in support of the sustainable development \nof small island developing States. \n We in the Caribbean region must prepare for the \npossibility of continued increases in the incidence of \nnatural hazards such as hurricanes, floods and \nearthquakes. Whether it is through assistance with \nhazard mapping and vulnerability assessment \nstandardization or through the implementation of early \nwarning systems, international cooperation has an \nimportant role to play in complementing national \nefforts to reduce vulnerability to natural disasters. \n One step taken by the Caribbean region was the \nestablishment of the Caribbean Catastrophic Risk \nInsurance Facility under the aegis of the World Bank. \nWe would like to thank those countries who have \ncontributed to the fund. The Bahamas continues to \npress for the execution of the Mauritius Strategy for the \nFurther Implementation of the Programme of Action \nfor the Sustainable Development of Small Island \nDeveloping States, as well as of complementary \nframeworks such as the Johannesburg Plan of \nImplementation and the Hyogo Framework for Action. \nThe time has come to reassess our collective response \nto these issues and to renew our efforts in support of \nsustainable development. \n Adequate financial resources are essential in the \nimplementation of the wider internationally agreed \ndevelopment goals. Consideration of issues \nsurrounding the follow-up to the International \nConference on Financing for Development is \nparticularly significant this year, as we prepare for the \nFollow-up International Conference on Financing for \nDevelopment to Review the Implementation of the \nMonterrey Consensus, to be held in Doha next year. \nThe Bahamas would wish for the deliberations of the \nupcoming High-level Dialogue, as well as the 2008 \nmeeting of the Economic and Social Council with the \nBretton Woods institutions, the World Trade \nOrganization (WTO) and the United Nations \nConference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), to \nprovide practical input into, and contribute to the \nsuccess of that most important review conference. \n The issue of strengthening the voice and \nparticipation of developing nations in international \neconomic decision- making and norm-setting is \nespecially important to the Bahamas. There is a \ndefinite need for concrete, realistic proposals to ensure \nthe effective, permanent representation of developing \ncountries, particularly small developing countries, not \nonly in the Bretton Woods institutions and the WTO \nbut also in the other international economic and \nfinancial institutions, such as the Financial Stability \nForum, the Financial Action Task Force and the Basel \nCommittee. \n The Bahamas welcomes the positive development \nin the area of international cooperation in tax matters, \nnamely, the establishment of the Committee of Experts \non International Cooperation in Tax Matters within the \nEconomic and Social Council. The establishment of \nthat Committee ensures that the interests of small \ndeveloping States Members of the United Nations with \ndifferent tax regimes will be factored into discussions \nand recommendations aimed at adopting mutually \nagreed standards that do not unduly favour the wealthy \nnations at the expense of meaningful development in \nStates and jurisdictions not members of the \nOrganization for Economic Cooperation and \nDevelopment. \n We have reached the halfway mark in the time \nframe we set ourselves in the Millennium Development \nGoals (MDGs) to undertake concrete steps by the year \n2015 to address not only the economic and \nenvironmental challenges plaguing the international \ncommunity and the Organization, but various social ills \nas well. In so doing, we gave those who are less \nfortunate hope for a better and more equitable world. \n The MDG Report 2007 demonstrates that \nprogress has been achieved in the reduction of the \nproportion of people living in poverty, the reduction of \nchild and maternal mortality rates and the increase of \nprimary school enrolment levels. However, nearly 20 \nmillion children worldwide continue to be severely \nmalnourished and suffer from various preventable \ndiseases that will undoubtedly affect their survival and \nrob them of their full potential. Overall progress in \nachieving equal rights and the empowerment of women \nis also too slow. My Government regards effective and \npractical measures to address poverty and the \nenhancement of educational partnerships to facilitate \nthe development of our human resources to impact \naccelerated change as critical issues. \n HIV/AIDS remains a global threat to the \ndevelopment, progress and stability of our societies. If \nthe goal of universal access to comprehensive \nprevention, treatment, care and support by 2010 is to \nbe achieved, commitments entered into in the 2001 \nDeclaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS and the \n2006 Political Declaration on HIV/AIDS must be \nimplemented. The necessary financial and technical \nsupport to developing countries must be provided to \nhelp bridge the gap and foster a more comprehensive \nand sustainable global response to this pandemic. \n Equally important is the fact that 63 per cent of \ndeaths worldwide are attributable to non-\ncommunicable diseases resulting from factors such as \nobesity, high cholesterol, high blood sugar, high blood \npressure, tobacco use, physical inactivity, unhealthy \ndiet and alcohol abuse. At a recent summit of \nCARICOM heads of Government, a number of action \nsteps were identified. The Governments have agreed to \nestablish, by mid-2008, comprehensive plans for the \nscreening and management of chronic diseases and risk \nfactors, so that, by 2012, 80 per cent of people in the \nCaribbean region with non-communicable diseases \nwould receive quality care and have access to \npreventive education based on regional guidelines. \n In spite of the efforts of various entities and the \nexistence of United Nations conventions to protect the \nrights of women and children, discrimination and \nviolence against women and children persist \nthroughout the world. In an effort to better address this \nproblem, the Bahamas has drafted a new Child \nProtective Act and a Domestic Violence Protection \nOrder to enhance and provide greater protection to \nthese vulnerable groups. \n Last year the United Nations Global Counter-\nTerrorism Strategy (resolution 60/288) was adopted, \nmarking an important step towards the elaboration of a \ncounter-terrorism convention. The Bahamas continues \nto condemn terrorism and recognizes that while there \nmay be instances when terrorism and criminal \nactivities converge, the methodologies used to combat \neach of them are very different. Based on its own risk \nassessment, therefore, each Government must \ndetermine the level of resources that can be adopted \nand applied to counter-terrorism measures, particularly \ngiven the emphasis that the Strategy also places on \naddressing and preventing the conditions conducive to \nthe spread of terrorism. \n In prescribing counter-terrorism measures, care \nmust be taken by the international community to \npreserve the tenet of due process. Care must also be \ntaken to guard against the creation of disincentives that \nnegatively impact countries with service-based \neconomies. With respect to counter-terrorism measures, \nthe Bahamas has adopted new legislation, ratified \nadditional anti-terrorism conventions, increased \nsecurity of large facilities, airports, docks and harbours \ndeveloped a counter-terrorism intelligence network and \nprovided anti-terrorism training for the police. \nNeedless to say, such initiatives present a challenge \nand divert resources from our economic development. \n The Bahamas reaffirms its commitment to fulfil \nits obligations to major international drug and counter-\nterrorism conventions and continues to support the \nconcept of the expansion of the membership of the \nSecurity Council. The Bahamas maintains, however, \nthat such expansion of the Security Council will not \ngreatly increase the chances for our particular \ncountries, such as the Bahamas. \n While it is incumbent on Member States to fulfil \ntheir obligations that come with membership, the \nOrganization must put in place effective management \ntools and create a system that would eliminate \noverspending and waste and create more fiscal \naccountability and proper oversight. \n The Bahamas values the role of the United \nNations as the custodian of the interests of the world\u2019s \npeople, in particular the poor and the vulnerable. The \nBahamas continues to believe that the United Nations \nCharter constitutes a viable and firm foundation on \nwhich the Organization can balance and achieve its \nobjectives: to maintain international peace and security \nand, equally important, to promote development and \neconomic and social progress. \n"

        "file_text": "I  should like at the outset to convey to all members \nfriendly greetings from Guinea, its people and its \nPresident, General Lansana Cont\u00e9. To the President of \nthe General Assembly at its sixty-second session and to \nthe Secretary-General of our Organization, I wish to \nconvey the same greetings and to express our heartfelt \nwishes for every success. \n The agenda of the sixty-second session of the \nGeneral Assembly places before us all the essential \nissues challenging the world: the maintenance of \ninternational peace and security, the development of \nAfrica, the promotion of human rights, climate change, \nthe promotion of justice and international law, \ndisarmament, the fight against illicit drugs and the \nfight against terrorism. Those subjects are timely today, \nbut they were also timely yesterday and will probably \nremain so tomorrow. They are part of man\u2019s long \nattempt to meet the principal challenge facing him \nsince the dawn of his existence nearly 3 million years \nago: his survival. \n Today more than ever before, that survival is \nthreatened by a serious lack of respect for the \nenvironment. Man emerged from a hostile natural \nenvironment, which he tamed in many ways before he \nbegan to dangerously threaten it through his appetite \nfor absolute power and his desire for comfort and well-\nbeing. Where will this tyranny end? Science has \nsounded the alarm, although the mobilization consists \nmore of words than of deeds, more of intention than of \nreality. In this very Hall, during the High-level Event \non Climate Change, we absorbed all the information \nprovided by scientists, who concluded that action was \nurgent. It is paradoxical to note that, after having \nsearched desperately for life on other planets without \nfinding it, man does not realize that, for the time being, \nhe is unique in the immensity of the cosmos. \n That unique existence in the Milky Way must \ncontinue at all costs, and that is within our reach. The \ndetermination that inspired the Organization\u2019s founding \nnations to put the world\u2019s affairs in order and forever \nbanish the spectre of war should be the same \ndetermination that leads all nations of the Earth to take \nconcrete and immediate measures to put an end to \nenvironmental degradation.  \n Every time human beings have wanted to do \nsomething, they have been able to do it. However, that \nresolve should not contain secret vices. For example, it \nshould not consist of imposing restrictions on poor \ncountries\u2019 use of their forest resources, as if such \nrestrictions were an angelic service to humanity. A \nbalance is possible between environmental protection \nand the essential will to achieve development. A \nnumber of great world leaders have advocated just \ncompensation to Africa for the exploitation of its \nnatural resources. Africa should be grateful for that. \n But the continent\u2019s needs go well beyond that. \nAfrica no longer wants to be confined to the simple \nrole of supplier of raw materials; it wishes to process \nthem in order to create more jobs and added value so as \nto create more wealth. The technologies that need to be \ntransferred today are those that guarantee better \nproductivity while respecting the ecosystem. \n The issues facing humanity today cannot be \naddressed by any one country in isolation. The United \nNations, because it embodies our common destiny, \nmust be the place where our fears, our anxieties, our \nvisions and our proposals, but also our hopes, come \ntogether. But if it is to play such a role, the United \nNations must be just and equitable both in its structures \nand in its decision-making mechanisms.  \n The Second World War, which was the tragic \nvehicle that fortunately led to the establishment of the \nUnited Nations, spared no nation, race or continent. \nReform of the Security Council in particular and of \nother United Nations organs in general must take \naccount not only of that historic reality, but also of the \ninevitably universal nature of the problems besetting \nus.  \n How can we put an end to terrorism unless we \ntake into account the ferment that would characterize \nthe dialogue among civilizations, cultures and religions \nand enhance mutual understanding and tolerance? How \ncan we overcome HIV/AIDS if profit remains the \ncriterion that guides the pharmaceutical laboratories? \nHow do we put an end to the inexorable degradation of \nthe environment when powerful corporations care little \nfor the future of the planet? How do we eradicate the \nscourge of drugs when drug traffickers are irresistibly \ndrawn to easy money? All of those questions call for \nsolidarity, vision and joint action. We cannot improve \non the brilliant and poignant analyses that have already \nbeen made here in this legendary Hall, but the \ndifference that we can make is to take action.  \n We should remember that many of the \ncommitments entered into on many fronts have not \nbeen respected by the United Nations, nor by the \ngroups of countries represented in specific \norganizations. Allow me to give you several examples. \n In 1974, the most highly industrialized countries \npromised to eliminate world poverty in the year 2000. \nThat was a mythical year, the year 2000. For that \npurpose, they undertook to allocate 0.7 per cent of their \ngross domestic product to official development \nassistance.  \n In 1989, 15 years later, amidst the euphoria \narising from the fall of the Berlin Wall, the same \nPowers foretold an era of universal peace by the end of \nthe twentieth century and the beginning of the twenty-\nfirst century. They foretold that the funds previously \ndedicated to the arms race would henceforth be \ndevoted to accelerating the eradication of poverty, \nwhich they said would become effective in 2000. \nUnfortunately, those predictions were disproved by \nreality.  \n Poverty in the world has certainly not been \neliminated, it has increased since the beginning of the \n1990s. Over 100 million people joined the ranks of the \npoor in 2003 alone. In September 2000, in this same \nHall that, at the time, applauded those aborted hopes, \nthe heads of State and Government of the world \nadopted the Millennium Declaration. The Declaration \nimplicitly recognized the inescapable nature of poverty, \nrejecting the goals set in 1974 and admitted that it \nwould only be possible to halve the number of poor \npeople in the world by 2015.  \n Today, midway towards the achievement of the \ngoals of that Declaration, which did, however, \ncrystallize so many dreams and hopes for the younger \ngenerations of the world, all the experts\u2019 reports agree \nthat the Millennium Development Goals will only be \nachieved if we change the strategies and rules that \nshape our world today.  \n Instead of a new dawn of global peace, localized \nwars that rip through the protective membrane of the \nentrenched and now-defunct bipolar global system now \nappear in successive waves in Europe, Africa and Asia. \nThe nuclear threat has not disappeared. Is nuclear \nenergy, whether put to civilian or military uses, \nactually essential to the life of mankind? Nuclear \npower certainly is useful when used for civilian \npurposes, but will always be a threat to humankind   \nboth for those who possess it and those who aspire to \npossess it   when used for military purposes. It is the \nlogic of rivalry between nations that has led to the \nlogic of the arms race and the theory of deterrence is \nonly a subset of that logic. The best deterrence is the \ntotal absence of nuclear weapons. \n The effort to combat terrorism is another \nchallenge, the challenge that is played out in a \nManichean manner, evil and good opposing each other. \nAlthough no attenuating circumstances can be granted \nto those who subscribe to the philosophy of terror, the \nrealities on which that philosophy seems to be based \nmust nevertheless be eradicated: injustice in the \nmanagement of world affairs, intolerance in the \nperception of differences between cultures and \ncynicism expressed in the theory of natural differences \namong races.  \n The success of human rights and worldwide \ndemocracy is to be won at that price. Indeed, the great \nWestern Powers, who have guaranteed so much to their \npeoples in terms of freedom, equality and respect for \nthe fundamental values of mankind must show greater \nrigor in peacefully promoting the same principles at the \nglobal level. They currently give us cause to believe \nthat they frequently choose their immediate interests \nabove the principles in which they believe, although \nthey have good reason to believe in those principles. \n All of the heads of State and Government of the \nAfrican continent and of many other countries that \nhave come before this rostrum have eloquently \naddressed the issues confronting poor countries. I \nwould like to only briefly touch upon them. Trapped in \na vicious circle resulting from the conjunction of bad \ngovernance, ever-growing poverty and the Gordian \nknot of irreducible external debt and unfair capital \nmarkets, poor countries are steadily deteriorating. \nOften transformed into sanctuaries for rebel armed \ngroups, they have become the site of civil wars, with \ntheir trails of refugees and massive population \ndisplacements. Those devastated societies feed \nmigratory flows and provide an ideal refuge for the \nmafia networks of organized crime. The traffic in small \narms and light weapons knows no borders and the \nweapons end up in the trained hands of child soldiers.  \n I do not believe in the inevitability of poverty nor \nin that of war. Failures in those areas can be clearly \nexplained. The dominant groups of the rich countries \nand the elites who are charged with governance in poor \ncountries are both responsible for the failure of the \nfight against poverty and for not having met the \ncommitments taken in 1974. What is worse, they have \ngiven preference to commercial, financial and \ntechnological policies and strategies that have \nreinforced the causes of the ongoing impoverishment \nof poor populations worldwide. With respect to the \nfailure of the pledge for universal peace, it is due to the \nconcepts and political strategies put in place by the \ndominant groups and leaders of the world who have \nopted for reaction over prevention. \n There are solutions to counter poverty and to \nbring the world out of this pattern of permanent war. \nInspired by the shared destiny of mankind, our dream \nof universal peace still has every chance of coming \ntrue. It would involve promoting a global economic \nsystem based on a series of common goods and global \npublic services that must be provided and overseen by \nthe global collective. That is certainly not out of reach.  \n To eradicate poverty, we must declare it illegal in \nprinciple and unacceptable as a phenomenon. \nDeclaring that poverty is illegal means specifically \nabolishing the legislative and administrative provisions \nthat sustain the mechanisms that create and maintain \npoverty around the world. It is that new momentum of \ncommitment and collective responsibility towards the \neradication of poverty and towards guaranteed peace \nthat will open the way to resolving the many other \nmajor challenges that face our time. Of course, the \nquestion remains; is our contemporary society, replete \nwith its unprecedented global capacities in the area of \nknow-how, technologies, finance and mobilization of \nhuman resources made up, in its essence, not of \nconquerors but of builders of peace and security who \nare sufficiently courageous and daring to be able to \nchange the current patterns that mould and forge our \nworld?  \n Let us take an example from the nineteenth \ncentury, which was a time when the world was \nsuccessful in initiating the process of completely \neradicating the age-old practice of slavery, which had \nuntil then been considered to be natural and immutable. \nThat required the courageous leaders of the time to \ndeclare the practice illegal, at the cost of their own \nlives at times. The heroic victory of the Allies during \nthe Second World War was due to a commitment of a \nsimilar nature. Similarly, was it not thanks to their firm \ncommitment that the major leaders of the world \nrecently succeeded in abolishing the shameful system \nof apartheid and replacing it with a democracy of \nexceptional vitality? \n If leaders of that calibre illuminated our past, I \nam confident that there still exist today those who are \ncapable of changing our world to make a happy legacy \nfor future generations. \n In January and February 2007, the Republic of \nGuinea was beset by an unprecedented socio-political \ncrisis that threatened its social stability and the \nfoundations of its institutions. The cause was the \nconvergence of a cumulative lack of good governance, \nrampant poverty and an overall economic situation in \nwhich all of the financial and monetary indicators were \nin the red. These tragic events, marked by considerable \nloss of human life, led to massive destruction of public \nbuildings and involved a great erosion of State \nauthority, creating, at the same time, profound rifts in \nthe social fabric.  \n Fortunately, the outcome, although it remains \nfragile, was a peaceful one and is under the auspices of \nthe Economic Community of West African States \n(ECOWAS) and the United Nations. It is owes its \nexistence to the combined efforts of the presidential \nauthority, the unions, civil society, eminent persons and \nfriends of Guinea worldwide. \n From this rostrum, I express the deep gratitude \nand great thanks of the people and the Government of \nGuinea to all those entities and individuals who were \ninvolved to ensure that civic peace would reign in our \ncountry.  \n The Government that came out of these events, a \nGovernment that it is my privilege to lead, is doing its \nutmost to try to meet the many expectations of a people \nthat has become impatient because it has waited far too \nlong. A minimum emergency plan was crafted for the \nshort and medium terms.  \n Let me conclude by saying that the initiatives \nplanned for by my Government, as promising as they \nare, continue to be dependent upon the interest that \nworld leaders give to all the subjects that I raised due \nto my deepest convictions. Beyond the commitment of \nour elites and civil society to good governance and \ndemocracy, the Republic of Guinea needs an effective \npartnership in keeping with its specific and pressing \nneeds. This partnership, for which the Guinean people \nwholeheartedly calls, will be more appropriate, \neffective and lasting if the dominant groups of the \nworld agree to commit to global solidarity in the \nservice of humankind\u2019s development. \n"

        "file_text": "At the Millennium Summit \nin 2000, an unprecedented number of world leaders \ncame together and committed themselves to an \nambitious global agenda for the years ahead. This \nagenda was further reinforced at the 2005 World \nSummit, where we also adopted the far-reaching \nprinciple of responsibility to protect. \n By the very nature of the commitments from the \nMillennium Declaration and the World Summit, it was \nglobally recognized that there can be no development \nwithout security and human rights   and vice versa. \nWe owe it to ourselves and to the world community to \ntake stock of our progress. How well, then, have we \nmet this challenge so far? \n At the institutional level, there can be no question \nthat important progress has been achieved, as \nwitnessed by the establishment of the Central \nEmergency Response Fund, the Peacebuilding \nCommission and the Human Rights Council. But \ninstitution-building alone will not do. We need to show \nthe necessary resolve to make these new institutions \neffective instruments in the service of the global \ncommunity. We have achieved little if we do not \nendeavour to ensure that they fulfil their stated \npurposes and that they realize their true potential. Our \nchallenge now is to address the substantive issues and \nto do so in earnest. \nAs we cross the halfway mark towards 2015, \nsubstantial progress has been made at the global level \ntowards achieving the Millennium Development Goals \n(MDGs). The results achieved through market-oriented \neconomic reform in Asia and Latin America over the \npast decade prove that eradication of poverty is not an \nelusive, unattainable goal. \n But, again, there is no room for complacency. A \nsubstantial increase in efforts is still needed, especially \nif sub-Saharan Africa is to meet the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals by 2015. The facts are quite \nsimple. If progress in Africa is not accelerated, we will \nnot live up to our responsibility. Denmark believes that \nthe time has come to arrange a United Nations summit \nfocusing on the progress towards the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals and on financing for development. \n Africa remains at the heart of Danish \ndevelopment assistance. The Danish Government \nfirmly believes that development assistance to Africa \nshould increase. We need to live up to the promise to \ndouble aid for Africa by 2010. Denmark is keeping its \npart of the bargain. We are committed to providing 0.8 \nper cent of our national income in development \nassistance. Two thirds of our bilateral assistance will \ngo to the African continent. \n But clearly, development assistance alone is not \nenough. Trade and good governance is key to \ndevelopment. There is no substitute for national \nownership and for national commitment to good \ngovernance or for transparent and liberal trade and \ninvestment regimes that allow developing countries to \nbenefit from globalization. \n It is a key goal for the Danish Government to \npromote good governance, democracy and human \nrights with no impunity for crimes against humanity \nand we will do this through an active foreign policy. \nDenmark will seriously do its best to contribute to a \nmore effective United Nations and to assist countries \nthat have a strong commitment to development but lack \nthe necessary resources. \n Climate change has undoubtedly become one of \nthe most urgent global challenges of our times, one \nthat, by its very definition, must be dealt with on a \ntruly global level. Climate change will affect the \npoorest and the weakest the most. And countries will \nhave a very different capacity to act. Therefore, we \nhave to base our joint efforts on the notion of common \nbut differentiated responsibilities. \n Denmark is pleased to host the fifteenth \nConference of the Parties to the Convention on Climate \nChange, to be held in December 2009. We have already \ncommenced the preparations for the conference. Our \nambitions are high. We must reach consensus on an \neffective and multilateral post-Kyoto agreement. The \nClimate Change Conference in Copenhagen is the last \ncall if the agreement is to enter into force by 2012. \n We commend the Secretary-General for his \nleadership on this issue. In our view, an inclusive \nUnited Nations-based multilateral approach is crucial if \nwe are to bring all parties together in responding to the \nglobal climate challenge. \n The High-level Event on Climate Change held \nhere in New York last week was an illustration of this \ncommitment. I want to echo two essential points made \nat the High-level Event that were also taken up by the \nSecretary-General in his conclusions. First, I would \nnote that the Conference of the Parties to take place in \nBali next December represents a crucial cut-off date. If \nwe are serious about fighting climate change, the \nthirteenth Conference of the Parties to the Convention \non Climate Change in Bali must define a clear \ntimetable for negotiations towards a comprehensive \npost-2012 framework. Secondly, I would note that the \nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate \nChange (UNFCCC) remains the only legitimate \nframework for truly global negotiations on climate \nchange. It is within the UNFCCC that an ambitious \nagreement must be reached to reduce global emissions \nand to counter climate change. \n Another major global challenge to which \nDenmark attaches great importance is to obtain equal \nopportunities for women. Here, we also see a crucial \nrole for an effective United Nations where gender \nequality is dealt with in a strengthened and systematic \nway, especially at the country level. In our view, no \none should be excluded from contributing to peace, \nfreedom and development. It is, therefore, of \nparamount importance   as a judicial, moral and \nethical responsibility   that women everywhere have \nthe same opportunities as men. In the fight against \npoverty, it is an absolute necessity. Women must have \nequal rights as well as full access to employment, land \nand financial resources. Only then can development \nassistance realize its true potential and poverty be \nalleviated. \n Donors must actively support partner countries in \nachieving gender equality. In the coming years, \nDenmark will have a strong focus on women and their \nrole in development and conflict resolution   setting \ngoals, earmarking funds and monitoring progress to \nensure that policies create results.  \n Making a difference in that respect will require \nleadership from all parties. Without addressing the role \nof women, we will never manage to halve extreme \npoverty by 2015. And our efforts to support the rights \nand empowerment of women must be complemented \nby a targeted effort to promote sexual and reproductive \nhealth and rights. \n As we stand here today, we face more global \nchallenges than ever before. The world faces many \nunresolved conflicts, not least in Africa. We need to \nstay focused and to enhance the Organization\u2019s \ncapacity in conflict prevention, conflict management \nand peacebuilding. \n A strong United Nations is required to cope with \nthe global challenges of today and tomorrow. Only a \nstrong and effective United Nations can show the \nnecessary political leadership with regard to \ndevelopment, humanitarian crisis and conflicts. \n In the Sudan, we have an obligation to help the \npeople of Darfur achieve peace through the restoration \nof stability. The killings, violence and atrocities must \nend. This has taken far too long. There is now finally \nsome progress in the attempts to find a solution to the \nconflict in Darfur, and we have a responsibility to \nensure that it is implemented. Denmark actively \nsupports the African Union-United Nations Hybrid \nOperation in Darfur as well as the resumed political \nprocess. It raises real hope for improvement in the \ndeplorable situation on the ground and in the prospects \nfor a long-term political solution. As part of this \nprocess, we must implement the arrest warrants of the \nInternational Criminal Court and bring perpetrators of \ncrime to justice. \n Afghanistan must be one of the top priorities of \nthe international community and of the United Nations. \nIt is important to maintain broad consensus among all \ninternational partners regarding the need to carry \nthrough what we have started. To that end, we need the \nUnited Nations to play a stronger role in Afghanistan. \nA coordinated engagement   civilian as well as \nmilitary   is a precondition for success. The United \nNations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) \nmust use its full potential to coordinate the \ninternational efforts and as a counterpart to the \nAfghans. And UNAMA should be present in each and \nevery province, including in the south. \n In Kosovo, only a solution to the final-status \nissue will ensure stability and prosperity in the region. \nWe share the opinion of the Secretary-General that the \nstatus quo is not sustainable. We hope for results in the \nnew negotiations. As stated by the presidency of the \nEuropean Union (EU), the EU will live up to its \nparticular responsibility and participate actively in the \ncollective effort to bring the parties closer together. \nThe goal is to obtain a comprehensive political solution \nthat will lead to a democratic and multi-ethnic Kosovo. \n We also believe that the United Nations continues \nto be an international focal point for our common \nefforts in the fight against terrorism. Last year\u2019s \nadoption by the General Assembly of the United \nNations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy was of \ncrucial importance. It underlined the firm commitment \nof the international community to stand united against \nthose who wish to threaten international peace and \nsecurity. The next step should be to finalize the \nnegotiations on a draft comprehensive convention on \ninternational terrorism. That would send another strong \npolitical signal of our unity. Adoption of the \nconvention would be a worthy achievement of the \nsixty-second session of the General Assembly. \n Finally, let me say a few words on United Nations \nreform and the institutional challenge for the \nOrganization. The starting point is clear: to ensure the \nnecessary reforms of the United Nations, there is no \nsubstitute for strong political will on the part of \nindividual Member States. \n Reforms of United Nations operational activities \nare taking shape. However, much work remains to be \ndone if the recommendations of the High-level Panel \nare to be followed and if the United Nations is truly to \ndeliver as one. It is of paramount importance to make \nthe United Nations more focused and effective at the \ncountry level. Experiences from the pilot countries are \nencouraging and should inspire further action. \n The Organization\u2019s governance structures also \nrequire further reform. The General Assembly should \nkeep its focus on decision-making regarding important \nmatters and leave detailed management to managers. \nThe Security Council would benefit from reform that \nmakes it more representative. Denmark is therefore \nencouraged by the new momentum in discussions on \nSecurity Council reform. \n But, first and foremost, strengthening the United \nNations requires an understanding that the United \nNations cannot do everything for everyone at the same \ntime. We need to agree on a common vision and on \npriorities for the Organization. We need to take a step \nback from the day-to-day agenda and focus on the role \nthat a strong United Nations could play in the future   \nwhich points towards strengthening the United Nations \nin relation to three of its unique features.  \n The first feature is conflict resolution and \nprevention as undertaken by the Security Council, the \nGeneral Assembly and the good offices of the \nSecretary-General, as well as through United Nations \npeacekeeping efforts.  \n The second feature is strengthening of the \ncapacity of the United Nations system to assist \ncountries in the early phases of recovery following \nconflicts, or countries with very weak institutions. \nHere, the United Nations has a key role to play. We \nshould help to build stronger bridges from \npeacekeeping and humanitarian assistance to \npeacebuilding, reconstruction and development. We \nshould help to build up States and to ensure that weak \nStates do not fall back into conflict or chaos. The \nPeacebuilding Commission will be essential in this \nregard.  \n Thirdly and finally, in the area of international \nnorm-setting, where the United Nations has already \nshaped the international agenda for action, one of the \ngoals should be to enhance the role played by the \nOrganization in ensuring respect for human rights. As \nMembers of the United Nations, we have taken on the \nshared responsibility of protecting those in the most \nvulnerable situations, not least children. \n What is needed now is to follow through and to \ncatalyse action. That is no small task, even for a strong \nUnited Nations. \n"

        "file_text": "I would like to congratulate Mr. Srgjan \nKerim on his election to the presidency of the General \nAssembly at its sixty-second session and to wish him \nevery success in his important task. Allow me also to \nsalute his predecessor, Sheikha Haya Rashed  \nAl-Khalifa of sisterly Bahrain and to express our \nappreciation of the efforts she deployed to bring the \nwork of that session to a successful conclusion. \n I also wish to express to the new Secretary-\nGeneral, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, our best wishes for success \nin his noble mission, namely, that of guiding our \ninternational Organization towards the realization of \nthe purposes and principles of its Charter. \n The Middle East region has been an arena of \ndaunting challenges and heightened tensions owing to \nthe Israeli occupation, since 1967, of Arab territories \nand to the denial of the legitimate national rights of the \nPalestinian people. Although this is not a new \ndevelopment, recent challenges and tensions have been \nescalating and, as such, they not only threaten security \nand stability throughout the region, but also \ninternational peace and security. The hopes of the \npeoples of the region of achieving a just and \ncomprehensive peace and living in a secure and stable \nenvironment have faded, if they have not totally died. \nMoreover, the current situation in Iraq and the \nattendant anger and apprehensions it has generated \nhave turned the region into an explosive hotbed of \ntensions and a theatre of confrontations, instead of \nallowing it to prosper, pursue its development goals \nand achieve progress. \n May I, therefore, ask what have we accomplished \nover the past year or during the previous session of the \nGeneral Assembly in terms of addressing the root \ncauses of tensions plaguing the Middle East region? \nThat situation does not serve the interests of any of the \nparties, inside or outside the region. The prevailing \ntrends have not changed: Israeli occupation of Arab \nlands continues, so does the denial of the legitimate \nrights of Palestinians. One can even say that the \nsupport, financing and arming of those policies have \ncontinued unabated and have even surpassed previous \nrecords. The recently reported figures on the increased \nUnited States arming of Israel speak for themselves. \n The latest act of aggression against Syria on \n6 September 2007 is proof of Israel\u2019s desire to escalate \ntensions. We reiterate that the failure of the \ninternational community, including the Security \nCouncil, to condemn that act of aggression will \nencourage Israel to persist in that hostile pursuit, and \nwill lead to the exacerbation of tensions in the region. \nSome sources in the United States have spread rumours \nand fabricated news in order to justify that act of \naggression. By distorting the facts they have become \nIsrael\u2019s accomplices in that act. \n Addressing and pursuing peace in the Middle \nEast require first and foremost evincing the will to \nmake peace on the basis of law and justice. \nRegrettably, that will does not factor into the priorities \nof some of the policies pursued nowadays. The \ncontemplated substance, approach and objectives of an \ninternational gathering that seeks to find a \ncomprehensive solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict \nremain vague. Furthermore, the proposed gathering \nfails to identify the purpose, basis, terms of reference \nand time frame of the process. \n Syria has repeatedly stressed and stresses again \ntoday that peace is its strategic choice. President \nBashar Al-Assad highlighted that fact in the statement \nhe made before the People\u2019s Assembly on 17 July \n2007. He stated that Syria is ready for a just and \ncomprehensive peace built on resolutions of \ninternational legitimacy, which he deemed to be the \nprelude to the realization of peace and security in the \nregion. The statement confirms that Syria has the will \nto make a genuine peace that would recover the rights \nand return the land to its rightful owners and that \nwould guarantee peace for all. We have repeatedly \ncalled for a resumption of the peace process on the \nbasis of the Madrid terms of reference and the principle \nof land for peace. Let me ask here: does the Israeli \nGovernment or the current American administration \nstill have that will, the will to make genuine peace? \nRegrettably, actions and realities on the ground suggest \notherwise. \n The current situation in Iraq presages great \ndangers for Iraq and the region. Addressing that \nsituation requires effective cooperation among all \nparties inside Iraq, in the region and the world at large. \nThe absence of a genuine political vision for a solution \nand the exclusive reliance on a military solution further \naggravate the situation. We have always stressed the \nneed to preserve the unity of the Iraqi people and the \nIraqi land, the non-interference in its internal affairs, \nthe preservation of its sovereignty and independence, \nits Arab and Islamic identity and the rejection of any \nclaims to divide it. We believe that the solution in Iraq \nmust begin with national reconciliation based on the \nprinciple of respect for the will of all segments of the \nIraqi people to determine their political future or to lay \nthe foundation for a new Iraq that is built on equal \ncitizenship. We therefore stress the need for the \nwithdrawal of all foreign forces from Iraq, in \nagreement with the Iraqi Government, because that \nmeasure will contribute to curbing the violence. We \nhave repeatedly stressed our condemnation of all \nterrorist acts committed in Iraq that claim the lives of \ninnocent civilians. Occasional allegations that \ncombatants are infiltrating into Iraq through the \nSyrian-Iraqi border cannot be farther from the truth. \nThey fail to acknowledge the strict measures that Syria \nhas put in place to control those borders. We believe \nthat the purpose of those unfounded accusations is to \nassign to others the responsibility for the failure of the \noccupying Power to achieve security and stability in \nIraq. \n The deteriorating security situation in Iraq has \nprompted many Iraqis to flee their country. There are \nover 1.6 million Iraqi refugees in Syria today. In \naddition to the security and social repercussions \nassociated with their presence, Syria is bearing an \nenormous financial burden to satisfy their economic \nneeds and to provide them with services. It is \nregrettable that the international community has failed \nto discharge its responsibility to assist Iraqi refugees \nuntil it becomes safe for them to return to their homes \nand country. The occupying Power spends hundreds of \nbillions of dollars on military operations inside Iraq, \nbut fails to allocate any resources to assist Iraqis who \nhave been forced out of Iraq as a result of the \noccupation and its repercussions. \n Official visits exchanged between fraternal Iraq \nand Syria have opened broad horizons for mutual \ncooperation and have identified the main areas of \ncooperation at all levels. Syria, for its part, plans to \nimplement all the measures agreed to during those \nvisits. \n The critical and sensitive situation in brotherly \nLebanon requires that the Lebanese act together in \norder to emerge from the current state of affairs and \narrive at solutions that will serve the interest of \nLebanon and its future. Syria has consistently \nsupported all initiatives aimed at activating Lebanese \ndialogue within the country with a view to arriving at a \nconsensus. We believe that the run-up to the coming \npresidential elections constitutes a good basis for \nconsensus-building among the Lebanese to elect a \npresident in accordance with constitutional rules, free \nfrom foreign intervention and in a manner that would \nsafeguard Lebanon\u2019s interests and its relations with \nArab countries. \n Syria reaffirms its position calling for the \nelimination of all weapons of mass destruction from \nthe Middle East region. Allow me to recall that in 2003 \nSyria tabled a draft resolution before the Security \nCouncil on behalf of the Arab Group, and we are still \nlooking forward to its adoption. \n I would like to affirm that Syria associates itself \nwith the declared positions of other developing \ncountries, which stress the freedom and the right of all \ncountries to acquire nuclear technologies to use them \nfor peaceful purposes. We believe that it is necessary to \ncompel Israel, the sole party in the region that \npossesses nuclear weapons, to submit its facilities to \nthe safeguards regime of the International Atomic \nEnergy Agency (IAEA) and to adhere to the Non-\nProliferation Treaty (NPT) and the Comprehensive \nSafeguards Agreement. \n Like many others, I wonder whether the world \nhas become safer many years after the beginning of the \nwar on terrorism. The answer is common knowledge. \nTerrorism has spread to areas that have never known \nthat phenomenon before. Syria believes that fighting \nterrorism by force alone is useless. We must address \nthe root causes of terrorism and firmly distinguish \nbetween combating terrorism and the legitimate right \nof people to resist foreign occupation. We call on all \nStates to cooperate in the fight against terrorism. At the \nsame time, we warn against using terrorism as a pretext \nto compromise peoples\u2019 rights and to instil hatred \namong religions and civilizations instead of promoting \nintercultural and interreligious dialogues in the interest \nof humanity at large. \n Earlier on in the debate we listened to calls \nadvocating interference in the internal affairs of States \nunder the pretext of defending human rights and \npromoting democracy. Syria questions the discrepancy \nbetween words and actions in Palestine, Iraq, Lebanon \nand other parts of the world. The inhumane practices \nwe learned of in Guantanamo and Abu Ghraib and the \ncondoning of Israeli aggression against Lebanon last \nyear and other Israeli practices in Palestine and the \nGolan constitute grave violations of human rights. That \nprompts us to question in turn, and rightly so: which \nhuman rights are they advocating? \n More than ever before our world needs a \nreaffirmation of our commitment to the principles and \npurposes of the United Nations, in order to avoid \napplying double standards and to free the Organization \nfrom those few who try to control its decisions and \ndictate their policies to its organs. The conflicts and \ncrises with which our world is plagued today must \nprompt us to seek solutions based on enhanced \nintercultural and interreligious dialogues, and to \npersevere in our pursuit of the political solutions to \ncurrent international problems in a manner that would \npreserve international peace and security. \n"

        "file_text": " On behalf of the Republic of Equatorial \nGuinea, I should like to join previous speakers in \nexpressing our support and congratulations to His \nExcellency Mr. Srgjan Kerim of the Republic of \nMacedonia on his election to preside over the debates \nof the sixty-second session of the General Assembly. \nWe congratulate him because his country is an example \nof freedom and democracy and because, for the United \nNations, the sovereign equality of States   whether \nlarge or small   is a principle of respect for dignity, \njustice, equality and peace throughout the world. We \nare convinced that under his far-sighted leadership the \nAssembly will ensure that those principles are \nobserved and respected by all. \n We also congratulate his predecessor, Her \nExcellency Ms. Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa of Bahrain, \nPresident of the General Assembly at its sixty-first \nsession, on her great political skill in serving the \ninterests of the international community at a time \ndominated by wars, conflicts of interest and natural \ndisasters. \n In addition, we commend the laudable work of \nthe Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-\nmoon, who deserves our full support so that United \nNations intervention can be effective in conflicts and \nsituations threatening peace, stability and the well-\nbeing of nations. \n Equatorial Guinea is participating in the present \nsession of the General Assembly with uncertainty \nregarding United Nations efforts, which are drowning \nin a vicious circle of good declarations of principle and \ntechnical and scientific definitions, which are ethically \nmotivated but which ultimately fail to attain the \nobjectives of the peace, security, development and \nwell-being of humanity, which inspired the \nestablishment of this world Organization. \n Indeed, the fact that, despite so many preventive \nresolutions, we are focusing this year\u2019s deliberations \non atmospheric degradation, which currently poses a \nthreat to humanity because of nuclear tests; the \nproliferation of chemical industries with military \npurposes, which are destroying vital elements of the \nenvironment; the use of chemical weapons and other \nweapons of mass destruction in armed conflicts; and \nthe irrational use of non-renewable natural resources, \nwhich is destroying ecosystems   activities that do \nnot seek the common good of humanity, but that have \ncaused the destruction of the ozone layer and the \nbreakdown of the components of the planet\u2019s \natmospheric equilibrium. This is an obvious sign that \nour resolutions are being ignored. The tsunami, if it \nwas not the result of a nuclear test, must be the \nconsequence of this atmospheric deterioration, which \nhas now increased the number of floods, hurricanes, \nfires, cyclones, earthquakes and volcanic eruptions \nthroughout the world. \n Nevertheless, for more than 20 years the United \nNations has undertaken praiseworthy initiatives to \nreduce spending on these activities and to use the \nsurplus on development in the poorest countries. \nDespite that, no favourable response has been made by \nthe countries owning these industries. Nor has the \nKyoto Protocol itself   which obliges States to reduce \ntheir emissions of harmful gases   been ratified by all \nthe States Members of the Organization. \n Equatorial Guinea believes that the phenomenon \nof climate change must be addressed by the United \nNations with the same intensity with which it is \ncurrently addressing issues that include, among others, \ndemocracy, human rights and the threat of terrorism.  \n It is correct to say that climate change is a \nchallenge for all States, because its effects are truly \nharmful to everyone. But we cannot ignore the fact that \nthe primary responsibility lies with those who \ndeveloped, for their own interests, the technologies that \nare destroying the ozone layer. The countries of the \ntropical forests of the Congo Basin in Africa and the \nAmazon Basin in South Africa cannot make use of \ntheir own forest resources, because they must \ncontribute to the maintenance of the ecosystems that \nhelp to maintain the ozone layer. However, there are no \ncompensatory policies to avert the economic resource \ncrisis occurring among the affected peoples.  \n My Government is now committed, in the spirit \nof the Kyoto Protocol, to processing the gas produced \nby the oilfields of my country and its neighbours into \nliquefied gas for the benefit of humanity. Nevertheless, \nEquatorial Guinea cannot manage to benefit from the \ncredits offered by the international financial \ninstitutions and bodies, because we qualify as a \nmiddle-income country, whereas it is known that we \nhave produced oil for only 10 years and have never had \nany development infrastructure.  \n Our uncertainty is even greater when we consider \nthe problem of development financing for the least \ndeveloped countries. In our view, no bilateral or \nmultilateral cooperation policy has shown itself to be \ncapable of meeting the basic development financing \nneeds of poor countries. Because of a lack of political \nwill, everything is reduced to political conditioning \nfactors and requirements that cannot be met by \ncountries seeking to develop. In that regard, Equatorial \nGuinea has not been informed of the fate of the 0.7 per \ncent   an insignificant amount   that developed \ncountries were to give from their gross domestic \nproduct for the financing of the least developed \ncountries.  \n Nor has the question of the cancellation of the \nexternal debt of least developed countries and their \ninterest been welcomed by creditors, despite their \nhistoric obligations. Our experience over many years \nhas shown us that Equatorial Guinea cannot develop if \nit does not have its own means and if it does not take \nprincipal responsibility for it.  \n Thus, once oil resources were discovered, the \nGovernment organized, in 1997, the first national \neconomic conference in order to plan better use of \nthese resources for the short, medium and long term. \nThe programme adopted has been implemented in a \nmanner satisfactory to the people and Government. \nNow we can organize the second such national \neconomic conference, in order to plan the development \nof the country for a sustainable economy. From this \nrostrum, we would like to invite bodies of the United \nNations system and friendly Governments and \ninternational economic institutions to participate in this \nconference in Equatorial Guinea in the first two weeks \nof November this year, in order to help us by sharing \ntheir experiences.  \n Humanity has never been threatened and \nfrightened as much by terrorism as over this last \ndecade. Terrorism used to be known as a process for \nthe settlement of accounts through violent means by \nthose who felt powerless to see their claims met \nthrough legal and democratic processes. It has now \nreached different dimensions, which do not uphold \nlegitimate claims, nor are their effects directed only \nagainst persons or institutions from which rights are \nbeing demanded. Any third-party country can be a \nvictim of terrorism today, as if it were a country \nagainst which the demand may be lodged.  \n The result is that today terrorism is a threat \nagainst humanity. It violates individual and collective \nfreedoms, impedes the exercise of democracy, violates \nthe peace and security of nations and stands in the way \nof the development of peoples. All countries of the \nworld that love peace, justice and freedom have the \nduty and the obligation to combat this phenomenon, \nwhich is a form of regression of the human species. \n However, there seems to be a tendency to ignore \nanother, similar phenomenon, namely, the use of \nmercenaries, that practice of resorting to force to \ndestabilize legitimate political regimes for whatever \nreason. In the case of Republic of Equatorial Guinea, it \nhas been clearly shown that the invasion operation \nagainst our country by mercenary groups in 2004 was \norganized to gain access to oil. The masterminds \nbehind that operation, clearly identified, were leaders \nof Governments of States Members of the United \nNations. Since these facts came to light and were \ndenounced by my Government, we have not had any \ncondemning reaction from specific Member States or \nfriendly countries in criticism of the barriers to \nbringing to justice the perpetrators of that operation, \nwhich means that they would probably be happier had \nthe invasion of my country been successful, with the \ninherent dramatic consequences. \n If we want to combat terrorism and the use of \nmercenaries, we need to rely on well-developed \ninternal security systems and to exchange information \namong States. We have to be faithful and show \nsolidarity with the principles of the equal sovereignty \nof States, non-interference in internal politics of other \nStates and the resolution of controversies by peaceful \nmeans, giving priority to dialogue, consultation and \ntolerance. We should adamantly condemn any terrorist \nact of intimidation and destabilization of States and \ntake actions of solidarity against such acts, because \nthey threaten State sovereignty and the free will of \npeople. \n Finally, if we are looking at reform of the United \nNations today, it is because the objectives that support \nthis world Organization, their very principles, have \nbeen and are being systematically violated. The United \nNations has gone through many changes: from an \norganization aspiring to a universal consensus to one \ncomprised of interest blocs; from an organization with \nuniversal goals for the well-being of humanity to an \norganization of the stronger against the weaker. Today, \nthe reason for a veto in the Security Council is not so \nmuch the necessity of preventing abuses of power by \nsome against humanity as it is an eagerness to defend \nthe partisan interests of groups or individuals. Thus, \nalthough a veto in the Security Council does not mean \nanything today because resolutions are not much \nobserved, Africa also has its own interests to defend. \nThus we want the right of a veto to be conferred on the \ncontinent and not a State, because that continent \nrepresents a third of humanity. \n The future of humanity is in our hands. Each one \nof us must feel committed to meeting the challenges of \nour time so that new challenges can become new hopes \nfor people. May God guide us in our deliberations. \n"

        "file_text": "I welcome the opportunity \nto address, on behalf of the Republic of Serbia, the \nGeneral Assembly of the United Nations, the highest \nbody of the world family of sovereign nations. \n I congratulate Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on \nhis election to his very responsible post. I also \ncongratulate the newly elected President of the General \nAssembly, Mr. Srdjan Kerim, who hails from our \nregion of South-East Europe. \n Serbia attaches exceptional importance to the role \nthat the world Organization, and the Security Council \nin particular, play in maintaining international peace \nand security and in safeguarding the sovereignty and \nterritorial integrity of the Member States. Proceeding \nfrom the Charter of the United Nations as the \ncornerstone of the current international legal order, \nSerbia calls for its consistent implementation. \n The sixty-second session of the General \nAssembly is taking place at a very important moment \nfor Serbia as the negotiation process on the future \nstatus of its province of Kosovo and Metohija is under \nway. Proceeding from the firm position that the \nindependence of Kosovo is unacceptable to Serbia, we \nhave offered special rights and competences to Kosovo \nAlbanians for the autonomous development of their \ncommunity within the Republic of Serbia. \n In defence of the State sovereignty and territorial \nintegrity of Serbia, our negotiating team has offered a \ndecentralization model based on European solutions \nthat would protect the interests of Kosovo Albanians, \nas well as the threatened interests of the Serbian and \nother non-Albanian ethnic communities in the \nprovince, in an effective way. Serbia offers solutions \nthat would definitively solve, through mutual \nagreement and with the implementation of European \nvalues and rules, an old inter-ethnic conflict and open \nthe prospects of reconciliation and coexistence within a \nmodern, democratic and European Serbia. My country \nis ready to compromise, yet we wish to point out that \nthe legitimate interests of democratic Serbia and the \nspecific needs of the threatened Serbian community in \nthe province, as well as of other communities that have \nfallen victim to expulsion, such as the Roma and \nGorani communities, must be respected. Let me recall \nthat more than 200,000 Serbs have left Kosovo since \n1999; to date, according to the official data of the \nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, only \n7,100 have returned. \n Today, negotiations are under way under the \nauspices of the Contact Group, but a legitimate \ndecision on the future status of Kosovo can be taken \nonly by the Security Council. Only a decision taken by \nthat institution can be based on international law. \n Persistent in our request that the territorial \nintegrity of the Republic of Serbia be respected, we \ncall for the attainment of a compromise solution \nthrough diplomatic, legal and peaceful means, and not \nthrough war and violence. It is precisely for those \nreasons that democratic Serbia does not accept that the \nthreat of violence made by the party we are negotiating \nwith is an argument for redrawing the borders of \nlegitimate democracies and for violating the norms of \ninternational law. My country is therefore steadfast in \nwarning of the unforeseeable consequences of that \nunprincipled and dangerous policy, and remains \ncommitted to the search for a peaceful and compromise \nsolution through dialogue and in full respect for the \nCharter of the United Nations. \n Serbia would also like to recall that threats have \nbeen bandied about of late that the Kosovo Provisional \nInstitutions will unilaterally declare independence on \n11 December. We point that out because of the fact that \nthe international legal order would never be the same \nfollowing a one-sided recognition of Kosovo\u2019s \nindependence, while many separatist movements the \nworld over would exploit the newly established \nprecedent. Many regions in the world would thereby be \ndestabilized. We therefore call on the legitimate \nrepresentatives of the Kosovo Albanians to proceed to \nthe resumed negotiations without prejudging the \noutcome, so that a compromise solution acceptable to \nboth parties can be achieved, leading to long-term \nSerbian/Albanian reconciliation. \n This year, Serbia is presiding over the Committee \nof Ministers of the Council of Europe. In that capacity, \nwe have made every effort to make a maximum \ncontribution to the strengthening of democracy, the \nprotection of human rights and the rule of law   the \nbasic values of the oldest pan-European organization. \nWe have also sought to strengthen synergy between the \nCouncil of Europe and the United Nations, especially \nin the field of human rights. \n It is in the strategic interest of Serbia to become a \nmember of the European Union. We are working hard \nto become a candidate member by the end of 2008. We \nare engaged in the process of Euro-Atlantic integration \nthrough the Partnership for Peace programme. We have \nthereby clearly evinced our acceptance of European \nvalues and our readiness to develop our country in \naccordance with the highest European standards. \n We are convinced that the European perspective \non the entire Western Balkans is the most effective way \nto stabilize the situation and accelerate the \ndevelopment of all countries in the region. Only thus \nshall we overcome the problems inherited from the past \nand encourage a spirit of tolerance and commitment to \nthe same goals and values, which will provide a basis \nfor building stable and lasting peace in our region. \n Unfortunately, the question of war crimes \ncontinues to burden relations among Balkan countries. \nFor its part, Serbia has done everything within its \npower to track down, arrest and transfer to The Hague \nthose accused of war crimes, thereby demonstrating its \ncommitment to cooperating with the International \nCriminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia to a \nsuccessful end. That is not only Serbia\u2019s international \nobligation; above all, it is our debt to ourselves and to \nour neighbours. By punishing criminals and building a \nstable and prosperous region, a common space \nintegrated into the European Union, we can ensure a \nbetter future for all citizens. \n It is with pleasure and optimism that we note that, \nstep by step, South-East Europe is becoming a region \nof good-neighbourliness and cooperation. There are \nnumerous examples of very successful initiatives and \nconcrete forms of cooperation, the contribution of \nwhich to the promotion of peace and mutual trust is \nexceptionally important. There is hardly any field in \nwhich we have not yet established a mechanism of \nmutual cooperation. That proves unequivocally that \nthis is a lasting, strategic orientation of all countries in \nthe Balkans and a reflection of their common \naspiration to the full inclusion of our region into \nEuropean integration. \n(spoke in English) \n Global problems call for global answers, and all \nMember States are therefore required to participate \nactively in their solution. Today, as we face completely \nnew and specific challenges that threaten international \npeace and security and pose a threat to overall \ndevelopment and prosperity, we are becoming \nincreasingly aware of the great need   perhaps greater \nthan ever before   for the United Nations. \n Terrorism is one of the greatest scourges of the \npresent-day world. In order to fight and eradicate it \neffectively, we must take a global, coordinated \napproach, as well as vigorous action at the regional and \ncountry levels. Last year, Serbia hosted the regional \nsummit meeting on terrorism, organized crime and \ncorruption. \n As can be seen, we cooperate very closely with \nour neighbours in order to forestall threats. An \nexcellent example of that cooperation was the recent \njoint exercise of the armies of Serbia, Romania and \nBulgaria, which provided abundant evidence of our \nthree countries\u2019 collective readiness to combat \nterrorism and any other threat to the security of our \ncitizens. Serbia also initiated the signing of an \nagreement with neighbouring countries on cooperation \nin the protection against natural disasters. The recent \ncatastrophic fires that engulfed Greece and the manner \nin which we reacted provided eloquent proof of the \nvital importance of mutual dependence and solidarity \nin the Balkan region. \n Numerous crises continue to plague the world. \nSome are dormant, some are escalating, while others \nthreaten to provoke conflicts that could engender \ndangerous consequences, destruction and humanitarian \ncatastrophes. Our experience to date makes us believe \neven more firmly that lasting, just and stable peace and \nsecurity can be achieved only peacefully, through \ndialogue, mutual respect and cooperation. \n Serbia believes that the United Nations continues \nto be an irreplaceable international authority and \nmechanism for the prevention of crises and the \nresolution of conflicts. Successful and timely \ndeployment of United Nations peacekeeping forces is \nan important aspect of the maintenance of international \npeace and security. We support the efforts of the \nOrganization to further strengthen the efficiency of its \npeacekeeping capacities. Serbia therefore considers \nthat only gathered together around common goals and \nobjectives and united in action can we make a vigorous \nstand against such global threats to international peace \nand security as terrorism, bellicose extremism, mass \npoverty, organized crime, pandemic diseases and the \nharmful consequences of climate change. \n Global warming is surely a major problem of our \nage and rightly figures as one of the central topics on \nthe agenda of the sixty-second session of the General \nAssembly. That phenomenon   which, arguably, may \naffect all humankind   knows no national borders and \ncircumvents no part of the world. To solve it, therefore, \nwe must address it very seriously, as it brooks no delay \nand all Member States must get on board. Within the \nBelgrade Initiative, Serbia has proposed that activities \nto stop global warming be carried out also at the \nregional level and that a regional centre for South-East \nEurope be set up in Belgrade to that end. We also \nemphasize that plans to reduce harmful emissions must \ntake into consideration the level of the economic \ndevelopment of various countries as well. \n The complex of relations among different \ncultures, civilizations and religions is also a question \nthat deserves to be at the focus of the attention of the \nUnited Nations. A truly multi-ethnic, multi-\nconfessional and multi-cultural country, Serbia fully \nunderstands all the sensitivity of those questions and \ntreats them with due attention. We are well aware that \nthe world of the twenty-first century must not be based \non intolerance on any ground. We, the leaders of the \nUnited Nations Member States, are entrusted with a \ngreat responsibility to make every effort to ensure that \nall the diversity of this world be comprehended and \naccepted as the wealth of all, rather than as the cause \nof new divisions. Indeed, dialogue and mutual \ntolerance must prevail as the basic principles of our \nmutual relations, both within States and internationally. \nAs a responsible member of the world community \nand international organizations, Serbia fully respects \nthe Charter of the United Nations and the international \nlegal order established by the Charter. Building a truly \ndemocratic society in our own country, we call for the \ndemocratization of international relations on the basis \nof the strict implementation of the Charter and other \ngenerally accepted norms and standards. \n We firmly believe that only equitable cooperation \namong countries and peoples, respect for basic human \nrights and fundamental freedoms, and mutual trust can \nguarantee stable international peace and security. At \nthe same time, short of the political stability and \neconomic prosperity of States, there is no successful \ncooperation at the bilateral, regional and global levels. \nThe precondition for stability and dynamic economic \ndevelopment is equal access to new technologies and \nmodern scientific achievements. \n(spoke in French) \n The Republic Serbia is willing and ready, \nalongside other countries, to be actively involved in the \nprocess of United Nations reform and revitalization in \norder to make the world Organization capable of \neffectively facing the challenges of our times. Our \nhistoric responsibility is to ensure future generations a \nmuch better environment than that in which we live \ntoday. The Republic of Serbia remains devoted to \nachieving the goals of the United Nations and, along \nwith other countries, is ready to work on further \nstrengthening the integrity of the world Organization \nunder its Charter. \n"

        "file_text": "This is the second time I have addressed the Assembly \nin my 20 months as President. I come here to share our \nexperiences with the Presidents of the many countries \nof our world. I wish to take this opportunity to say how \npleased I am at the election of a new Secretary-\nGeneral, who will be leading the international \nOrganization for the good of humankind, and above all, \nfor the good of the abandoned and the dispossessed. \nFor that reason, I wish to briefly comment on my own \ncountry.  \n For the first time in Bolivian history, the groups \nmost forgotten, despised, hated and reviled throughout \nthe history of Bolivia \u2014 we indigenous peoples \u2014 \nhave assumed the leadership of our country to change \nour beloved Bolivia \u2014 to make political and economic \nchanges, to reshape and re-establish our country, \norienting it towards searching for unity, respecting our \ndifferences and respecting our identity so that we can \nwork together to resolve our economic and social \nproblems.  \n In this brief period, I have felt and seen that it \nwill be difficult and will mean fighting for the equality \nand justice of peoples, of all of us who live in the \nhomeland. But at the same time, we shall do so with a \ngreat deal of strength, because the popular movement, \nthe indigenous movement and the intellectuals and \neven the business and professional communities, have \ntaken a chance on their land and their people, and are \nstriving peacefully for democratization, ensuring a \ncultural revolution in my country.  \n But sometimes it is more important to regain our \nnatural resources. I very much regret to say that in my \ncountry, during the neoliberal regimes, natural \nresources and State-owned enterprises were privatized \nunder the pretext of capitalization. In fact, they \ndecapitalized the country, claiming that private \nenterprise would be the solution for unemployment and \ncorruption. We actually saw an increase in \nunemployment and in corruption. Just a few years ago, \nBolivia was considered to be the world's runner-up of \ncorruption, but now I am delighted to see that \ninternational organizations have said that there has \nbeen a great decrease in corruption in Bolivia. We want \nto eradicate it.  \n I want members to know that in 2005, before I \nbecame President of the Republic, Bolivia received \nonly $300 million in revenue from hydrocarbons. That \nwas a time when hydrocarbons, oil and natural gas \nwere privatized, when they were given to the \ntransnationals. Now that we have changed the oil laws \nand nationalized and recovered these very important \nnatural resources, Bolivia will receive more than \n$2 billion in revenue this year.  \n For that reason, Bolivia wants to share its \nexperience with all leaders and with all nations where \nnatural resources have been privatized. It is important, \nwith the strength of the people, to recover these natural \nresources so that they can benefit the people and the \nnation. Of course, I completely understand that \ncompanies have the right to recover the economic \nresources that they have invested. They have a right to \nprofit, but not like in the past when all they were \nconcerned with was plundering our natural resources.  \n The most important thing in all of this is that we \nhave begun to decolonize Bolivia, both internally and \nexternally. I say internally because my country \npreviously had masters. If we look back at our history, \nthere were masters that were descended from the \nviceroys, religious groups and the oligarchy. They \nruled and the people were powerless. Now we are \nbuilding up the power of the people so that the people \nare sovereign, not groups of families, and so that we, \nthe peoples, have the right to decide on our future.  \n That is the best kind of democracy we can \nimplement, because it does not mean merely accepting \ncertain policies or being subjugated by masters or \nbosses in my country. When I say that we are \ndecolonizing externally as well, I mean that right now, \nthere are no ambassadors in my country who change or \nappoint ministers. Before, unfortunately, United States \nambassadors changed and appointed ministers. That is \nover. Thus, we have begun to decolonize our country.  \n Once, policies were imposed on us by the World \nBank and the International Monetary Fund. That is \nover too. I would like to share a little story about our \ncountry that I remember clearly. In 2003, the World \nBank and the International Monetary Fund told our \nleadership to choose between a gasoline tax and an \nincome tax to avoid a deficit. The Government decided \nto put a tax on workers' wages. In two days more than \n15 people died in Bolivia because of clashes among \nBolivians. \n Now let me say that last year, without income \ntaxes, without gasoline taxes, Bolivia had a surplus \nthanks to the return of a natural resource, \nhydrocarbons, that is so important for my country.  \n That is why I say that we have begun external \ndecolonization. We are gathering the proposals and \ninitiatives of our peoples organized in civic and trade \nunion forums, in particular people who have economic \nproblems. They have the wisdom to propose initiatives \nand solutions from their own neighbourhoods and from \ntheir own trade unions. That is my experience, and so I \nthink it is important to create people's power. Let \nsocial forces take the decisions, and let the leaders \nfollow the wishes of the people. In that way we can \nresolve our problems.  \n Over the past few days I have listened to some \nvery encouraging statements, but also some that were \nrather disappointing. They spoke, for example, of \nglobal warming and of climate change, and I know that \nmany countries are victims of these natural \nphenomena. But I cannot understand why so many \nlives are lost to floods, interventionism, war and \nhunger? It seems that economic models are not going \nto solve the problems of humankind. I am all the more \nconvinced of that after having heard many of those \nstatements and the experiences that have been shared \nby world leaders. Concentrating capital in the hands of \nthe few is not a solution to the problems of humankind. \nHaving the wealth of the world in the hands of the few \ndoes not solve the problems of human existence. \nIndeed, it exacerbates problems of the poor who \ninhabit planet Earth.  \n We talk of global warming and the melting of the \nice, but we do not say where it comes from. I am \nconvinced that it comes from that ill-termed \nglobalization \u2014 or selective globalization: a \nglobalization that does not respect plurality and that \ndoes not respect differences.  \n If we are to talk about globalization, first of all \nwe must globalize the human being. I do not know how \neveryone here got to New York - or to the United \nStates - but my delegation had many visa problems. \nOur parliamentarians could not obtain United States \nvisas. When I arrived at the airport, I was blocked, and \nmy ministers - my indigenous compatriots - were \nsubjected to hours and hours of controls at the airport. \nSome of us, the representatives of countries, were \npractically threatened by our hosts, by President Bush. \nIf that continues, perhaps we should seriously consider, \nas Presidents and nations, changing the site of the \nUnited Nations. I personally am not willing to come \nhere to be the subject of investigation. I feel that the \ndecolonization of the United Nations too should begin \nand that everyone should respect us, whether we are \nsmall or large, whether we have or do not have \nproblems.  \n I listen to statements about glaciers melting, and \nthey are made without addressing the underlying \ncauses of melting and global warming. It is capitalism \nand the exaggerated, unrestricted form of \nindustrialization in some countries which are creating \nso many problems on our continent and on planet Earth \nas a whole. When we organize alongside social \nmovements to protest and condemn these unsustainable \npolicies, these economic models that do not solve \neconomic problems, then what we get is military bases \nand interventions, wars, demonization, accusations of \nterrorism, as though peoples had no right to speak out \nabout their needs, their rights, or to formulate new \napproaches to saving lives and humankind.  \n I therefore believe that it is important for us, as \nPresidents, nations or delegates, to tell the truth in all \nsincerity about these economic problems, which are not \nexclusive to Bolivia, North America or South America. \nWhen the democratic change is under way in South \nAmerica - i.e. the kind of democracy that liberates \nand does not submit to imperialism - there are further \naccusations and misrepresentations. There are \naccusations of people being cruel dictators, such as \nthose I heard from the lips of President Bush yesterday \nwith respect to the President of Cuba. I wish to greet \nall revolutionaries, especially President Fidel, for \nwhom I have a great deal of respect. Fidel also sends \ntroops to many countries, but they are sent to save \nlives, whereas the President of the United States sends \ntroops to end human lives. Therefore, since we here \ntoday are presidents, let us think about life, \nhumankind, how to save planet Earth and the question \nof climate change, which is a subject of ongoing debate \nthroughout the world. \n I am convinced that it is not possible for basic \nservices to remain private enterprises. Fortunately, \nthanks to the foreign ministries of the Americas, water \nhas been recognized as a human right. If water is a \nhuman right, it is important that it should become a \npublic utility, instead of a private business. It is \nimportant that energy should now also be a human \nright. I hope that we can all ensure that energy is a \nhuman right. If energy is a human right, then it will \nnever again be a private business. It must be a public \nutility so as to meet the needs of our people.  \n I cannot understand how we can continue, under \nthe guise of hegemony or of concentrating capital in a \nfew hands, to do damage to humankind, to affect the \npoor and to marginalize other needy sectors. I feel we \nare making statements here in order to change these \neconomic policies that have done, and continue to do, \nso much damage and that are leading humankind down \nthe path to genocide.  \n I still fail to understand why some countries are \ninvolved in an arms race. I cannot accept war. In \nBolivia we are discussing, as a social and political \nendeavour, how a new political constitution could lead \nus to renounce war. I am convinced that war is the \nindustry of death and that the arms race is one more \nindustry that complements the industry of death. In this \nnew millennium, how can countries and presidents \nkeep thinking in terms of interventionism, \nauthoritarianism and arrogance on the part of some \ncountries towards other countries, and not think about \nhumankind?  \nI believe that we must work together to save \nplanet Earth. That is the most important thing, if we \nwant to save life and humankind.  \n Yesterday, too, I heard, and tried to comprehend, \nstatements about biofuels and agrofuels. I do not \nunderstand how we can make use of agricultural \nproducts or food when it comes to cars. I cannot accept \nthat that is what the products of the earth should be for. \nI believe that food should be for human beings and that \nsoil should be for life. Are we really going to divert our \nland and food resources to provide for automobiles \nbecause of a gasoline or diesel shortage? Two days \nago, I said that if we are really talking about life, then \nlet us give up luxury. It is important to give up luxury. \nWe cannot continue to accumulate garbage, we cannot \ncontinue to think about just a few families instead of \nthinking about all of humankind. I think we have \nprofound differences, when we talk about these matters \nof life and about our national majorities.  \n I want to take this opportunity to express thanks \nfor the support received from everyone, with the \nexception of four Governments, for the adoption of the \nDeclaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. We \nfeel very gratified. The peoples of the Americas have \nwaited for over 500 years for their rights to be \nrecognized. We are part of a culture of patience. I wish \nto say that the fact that we now have this Declaration \ndoes not mean that we will act vindictively towards \nothers. Indigenous people are not vengeful. We are part \nof the culture of dialogue and, most fundamentally, \npart of the culture of life.  \n I want to ask the United Nations to convene very \nsoon a United Nations world summit of indigenous \npeoples to compile data on different cultural \nexperiences. We are compiling data on our experiences \nin Bolivia through a programme called \u201cLiving Well\u201d. \nTo live better, one must sometimes exploit. To live \nbetter, one must sometimes rob. To live better, one \nmust sometimes discriminate. To live better, one must \nsometimes plunder. But to live well means to live in \ncommunity, collectively. This does not just apply to \nliving among human beings. It also means living well \nin harmony with Mother Earth. The earth, for the \nindigenous movement, is something sacred. Mother \nEarth is our very life, it is Pacha Mama, as we say in \nour languages. Mother Earth cannot be turned into \nmerchandise. Mother Earth cannot be turned into a \nbusiness. If we talk about global warming, if we protest \nand fight global warming, let us remember that we are \ntalking about Mother Earth. Since Mother Earth gives \nus life, we need to review our policies, but we also \nneed to pay attention to what has been stated by our \nindigenous movement.  \n We have lived in communities, collectively. What \nis being debated is collectivism and community against \ncapitalism. Let us continue to debate, to reclaim these \nways of life in order to defend life and to save \nhumankind. \n I also want to take a moment to say that this new \nmillennium must be the millennium of life, equality \nand justice, of respecting our identities and upholding \nhuman dignity. That is why we are talking about \nchanging economic models, those systems that do harm \nto mankind. But if we want to make changes, then it is \nimportant for us to change ourselves first. Let us not be \nselfish, individualistic, greedy, ambitious or sectarian \nin our attitudes, concerning ourselves with just a few \nfamilies instead of with the entire family on Mother \nEarth. So as presidents, as representatives of our \ndifferent nations, we are talking about changing \nourselves first, with a view to also changing economic \nmodels in a quest for equality and justice. During my \n20 months as President, I have learned that I must work \nwith the people and listen to their needs. There will \nalways be groups who do not wish to lose their \nprivileges, but those are ill-gotten privileges or \nprivileges that enable them to use the State for family \nbusiness rather than thinking of the families of others.  \n I have learned, during my 20 months as President, \nhow wonderful it would have been to work for the \nhomeland and not for money, how wonderful it would \nhave been to work for those abandoned by the peoples, \nhow wonderful it would have been to work together \nwith people who do not have many economic problems \nbut who cherish their homeland and want to work for it \nin solidarity and with a sense of complementarity.  \n I would also like to say that, as members know, \nwe have a historic problem with our sister republic of \nChile on the subject of the sea. We have now \nsucceeded in laying the foundations of a certain trust \nbetween us: trust between our peoples, our \nGovernments and our Presidents, through peoples' \ndiplomacy. It is our hope that these historic claims can \nbe worked on and resolved, within the framework of \ncomplementarity, because neighbouring countries, \nLatin American countries and the countries of the \nworld need to work in a complementary way if we  \nwant to resolve the problems of our peoples and \nnations. Complementarity is very important, and that is \nwhy we want to continue to work for humankind.  \n In conclusion, as sometimes the red light on the \nrostrum makes one nervous, but never mind - I would \nlike to say that I hope we can keep learning from \nevents of this kind, in which so many participate. \nThese are the best universities we have. But let us \nspeak clearly and sincerely. Let us not falsify the truth, \nwhen we talk only about the effects of humankind's \nproblems and not their causes. In that context, I want to \nsay that it is important to change our economic models \nand eradicate capitalism.  \n"

        "file_text": "Let me begin by stating \nhow much I welcome and support the theme of this \nyear\u2019s sixty-second session of the General Assembly, \nwhich is \u201cResponding to climate change\u201d. \n I stand here representing the good people of \nIndonesia, who are very eager to welcome \nrepresentatives to the Bali conference in December this \nyear. When they come to our country, they will see a \ngreat nation whose multi-ethnic and multi-religious \npeople live in harmony with one another and in \nharmony with mother Earth, the way they have for \nthousands of years. \n Indonesia is a country that has felt and suffered \nthe effects of climate change. In recent years, we have \nbeen hit by a series of natural disasters in the form of \nfloods, drought, forest fires, El Ni\u00f1o, tsunamis and \nearthquakes. The issue of climate change has made us \nsee interdependence in a completely new light. When it \ncomes to global warming, we are much more \ninterdependent than we thought in terms of the causes, \nsymptoms and solutions. \n We must uphold the principle of common and \ndifferentiated responsibilities and respective \ncapabilities, but there is always room for every \ncountry, every community and every individual to be \nmore flexible, more innovative and more inclusive. \n A persistent theme in our discussions on climate \nchange yesterday was the need for urgency, which \nmeans the need for action and the need to think outside \nthe box. I count myself as an optimist who sees today a \nlarger window of opportunity to strike a global \nconsensus to tackle global warming. \n We will have that chance in Bali. The Bali \nconference must yield a new road map on climate \nchange, and that new road map must spell out what \nmust be done by both the developed and the developing \nworlds to save humankind and its planet from the \nlooming tragedy of climate change. It must link the \nsolution to the problem of climate change with \nsustainable development   the conquest of poverty. It \nmust produce an outcome and timeline that will be \nmore comprehensive and more ambitious in achieving \nits practical objective of reducing greenhouse gas \nemissions. \n We developing countries must protect our natural \nresources while using them wisely for development. \nAmong the most valuable of our natural resources are \nour forests. From them, we extract economic wealth; \nthrough them, we store an immense volume of carbon \nthat would otherwise pollute the atmosphere. \n On that basis, yesterday Indonesia took the \ninitiative of launching a special leaders\u2019 meeting of \ntropical rainforest countries. At that meeting, we \nleaders of the countries having custody of a great \nportion of the world\u2019s rainforests decided to intensify \nour cooperation in forest conservation and \nreforestation. \n We also believe that countries that seek to \nenhance their carbon sinks   through forestation, \nafforestation and avoided deforestation   should be \ngiven incentives and rewarded fairly for doing so. \n Throughout our deliberations on climate change, \nlet us always keep an eye on the requirements of \ndevelopment. That means we must not lose sight of the \nimperative to conquer poverty as a basic problem of \nthe human condition.  \n In Indonesia we have a national dream, which is \nreflected in our 1945 Constitution. We dream that we \nand our future generations can enjoy the blessings of \npeace, freedom, justice and prosperity. And we dream \nof seeing to it that the same blessings are enjoyed by \nthe rest of humankind. Poverty can kill that dream.  \n That is why the new Indonesia of today is fully \ndedicated to the fight against poverty. For that purpose, \nour national economic policy is focused on the \ndevelopment of rural areas, where the vast majority of \nour people live and where they wage a daily struggle \nagainst the ravages of poverty. That is why we are so \nintent on making the national business climate friendly \nand attractive to foreign direct investment, so that jobs \nwill be created for our millions of unemployed people. \nThat is why we are so intent on eradicating the taint of \ncorruption from our society. And that is why our \nforeign policy addresses the need for a truly \nfunctioning global partnership for development, \nbecause only such a partnership can ultimately conquer \nthe basic problem of poverty. \n Peace in the Middle East is crucial to long-term \nglobal stability. But there can be no peace in the \nMiddle East unless there is justice, especially justice \nfor the Palestinian people. A divided Palestinian nation \ncannot secure justice. Hamas and Fatah must therefore \nengage in dialogue and reconcile their agendas. The \nArab initiative must catalyse political change in the \nregion. \n Indonesia has a long history of participating in \nUnited Nations peacekeeping operations that dates \nback to the Suez conflict, in 1956. We are taking part \nin the operation in Lebanon today. We are determined \nto maintain that proud tradition of involvement in \nglobal concerns. That, I believe, is what humankind \nneeds most today, namely, the involvement of \neveryone. There must be a global partnership at work. \nDeveloped and developing countries must work \ntogether with a greater sense of partnership and of \nurgency. \n Therefore, to solve the problem of climate change \nthe Bali Conference must set the stage for a genuine \npartnership between developed and developing \ncountries and all other stakeholders. Developed \ncountries must extend support while developing \ncountries strive to protect and enhance their \nenvironment and its biodiversity. They must lighten the \nburden of developing countries in carrying out that \nimmense task   through incentives and the transfer of \nenvironmentally sound technology. \n While developing countries are in hot pursuit of \ntheir Millennium Development Goals, the developed \nworld can greatly help ensure the success of the Doha \nDevelopment Round. Developed countries must ensure \nsufficient flows of financing for development through \nforeign direct investment and official development \nassistance. They must facilitate the transfer of \ntechnology for development. \n We in the developing world, on the other hand, \nmust prudently manage our natural and human \nresources. We must practise good governance. We must \nfight corruption at all levels so that our resources will \nnot be wasted. We must see to it that the human rights \nof our citizens are promoted and protected. \n No partnership works without teamwork, and no \nteamwork is possible without constant effective \ncommunication. That means dialogue. After all, \ndialogue is the best way to exercise soft power. \nDialogue and soft power can greatly advance the cause \nof disarmament and non-proliferation. Dialogue and \nsoft power have helped resolve various intra-State \nconflicts   including in Aceh, where two years ago we \nreached a peaceful political settlement that \npermanently ended the conflict. Dialogue and soft \npower can also be a major instrument in addressing the \nroot causes of terrorism.  \n That is why I am a firm advocate of dialogue \namong faiths, cultures and civilizations. I urge that the \ndialogue in the Alliance of Civilizations be fully \nintegrated into the work of the United Nations. Sincere \ndialogue can lead to the formation of an effective \nglobal partnership on climate change, which is also a \npartnership for sustainable development. I look \nforward to such a dialogue taking place at the Bali \nConference this coming December. That will be a \nvitally important dialogue, for it can set off a chain of \nevents that will lead to the fulfilment of the dream of \nbillions for a safer, better life. It will certainly add \nsheen to the national dream of Indonesia   our \ncommon dream   for a better world of peace, social \njustice and equitably shared prosperity. \n"

        "file_text": "Traditionally, the General Assembly sums up \nthe results of the ending political year. This requires \nserious and joint consideration. It is essential to \nidentify agreed solutions for today\u2019s global problems \nbased on the collective analysis of current international \naffairs. It appears that no one is challenging that \nsecurity and prosperity are inseparable in an \nincreasingly globalized world. Our approach should be \nsimilarly comprehensive, taking into account the \ninseparable link between the issues of peace and \ndevelopment, which has been amply proven by our \nrecent experience.  \n The expanding range of conflicts in international \npolitics through the exacerbation of regional crises, the \nincreasing threat of terrorism, the risk of the spread of \nweapons of mass destruction and stagnation on \ndisarmament jeopardize international stability, divert \nresources from constructive uses and undermines the \npotential for sustainable worldwide economic growth. \nAnd it is such growth that is our common fundamental \ngoal. Poverty and economic backwardness expand the \nbreeding ground for extremism.  \n On the other hand, developments over the past \nyear provide convincing proof that an essentially new \ngeopolitical situation has been developing in the world, \none that is defined primarily by emerging multipolarity. \nWe need to agree on what inferences we can draw from \nthis. In his Munich speech in February, President \nVladimir Putin of the Russian Federation called for an \nopen and sincere dialogue that would enable us to work \nout a common understanding of the current historical \nepoch and of the modus operandi it obliges our nations \nto adopt.  \n The international landscape is changing, due to \nnewly emerging centres of global growth. Today, \nnobody can cope with global challenges single-\nhandedly. Neither diktat nor bipolar dominance can \nfulfil the task of world governance. What is needed is \ncollective leadership by major States; this should be \nrepresentative both geographically and in terms of \ncivilizations. The basis for such an informal \nmechanism can be provided only by the United Nations \nwith its unique legitimacy.  \n Multilateral diplomacy based on international law \nhas come to the fore. Like any society of free people, a \nworld of free nations needs universal regulatory \nprinciples to ensure predictability and confidence in \ninternational affairs. The way to achieve this goal lies \nthrough strengthening the United Nations system by \nfurther adapting it to modern global realities. Decisions \nhere should be based on the broadest possible \nconsensus among Member States and on the universal \nintergovernmental nature of the United Nations. It is \nfrom that perspective that we view the reform \ninitiatives proposed by Secretary-General Ban \nKi-moon.  \n It will be in our common interest to make more \nactive use of United Nations peacekeeping capabilities. \nThese could be improved by more effective use of a \nbody such as the Military Staff Committee. The \ninitiative put forward by the President of Russia in \n2000 to enhance the work of the Military Staff \nCommittee remains relevant. Naturally, a renewed \nCommittee should operate with the participation of all \nmembers of the Security Council, as provided for in \nthe United Nations Charter.  \n Much remains to be done also in improving the \ninteraction of the United Nations with regional \norganizations that have proven their ability to \neffectively participate in resolving security and \ndevelopment issues. A positive interrelationship \nbetween the principles of multilateralism and \nregionalism is obviously very important. At present, \nmore than 50 per cent of international trade is carried \nout under regional trade agreements. Global trade \nregulation mechanisms cannot be effective without \nregional integration, which is key to the economic \nwell-being of all the regions of the world.  \n Russia is actively signing and using regional \ntrade agreements to achieve mutual liberalization of \ntrade. Russia intends to use its current chairmanship of \nthe Eurasian Economic Community to give a more \npractical focus to the organization, which since 2003 \nhas had observer status in the General Assembly. \nRussia, along with other sponsors, will submit to the \nGeneral Assembly a draft resolution on cooperation \nbetween the United Nations and the Eurasian \nEconomic Community, aimed at providing a more \nsystemic basis and facilitating the timely realization of \nthe Millennium Development Goals. We also hope that \nUnited Nations Member States would honour the \nEurasian Development Bank the status of observer in \nthe General Assembly. We shall actively promote the \nattainment of these objectives, including in the \nframework of the process to reinvigorate the \nCommonwealth of Independent States and build up \nstrategic offensive capabilities.  \n The international community\u2019s efforts should \nremain focused on reaching the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals. We are concerned that today, \nseven years since the Millennium Summit, many \ndeveloping countries, especially the least developed \ncountries, are still significantly behind schedule in \nachieving the Millennium Development Goals. \nParticular attention should be paid to the specific needs \nof the African continent.  \n Russia fully shares the principles of global \npartnership in the interest of development, as approved \nat the Monterrey International Conference on \nFinancing for Development and intends to increase its \ninput to our common efforts in that area. We shall \nconsistently strengthen our position as a donor country \nin accordance with the approach to Russian \nparticipation in international development assistance \napproved by President Putin in June 2007.  \n We are confident that concrete steps to ensure \nsustainable socio-economic development in all regions \nare a sure remedy against threats to peace and security.  \n There is a pressing need to use any means \navailable to strengthen the leading role of the United \nNations in fighting terrorism. Here, the Organization\u2019s \nactivities should be based on a comprehensive \nframework, including the United Nations Global \nCounter-Terrorism Strategy adopted last year as \nresolution 60/288, and on a comprehensive convention \non international terrorism. The Collective Security \nTreaty Organization is contributing to these efforts and \nhas established useful interaction with the United \nNations.  \nOur efforts to resolve regional conflicts and \nurgent social and economic problems should form part \nof our counter-terrorism efforts.  \n Iraq has become a source of destabilization for \nthe whole region. Ensuring security, not to mention \neconomic development, in that country requires a new \nstrategy focused on reaching genuine national \nreconciliation with the participation of all of Iraq\u2019s \nneighbours and with the support of the international \ncommunity. We call upon the Secretary-General to take \nan active role in this issue, given the additional power \nthe United Nations can wield towards an Iraqi \nsettlement. The participants in recent multilateral \nmeetings on Iraq have upheld that approach, and we \nsupport the decision endorsed at those meetings.  \n The indivisibility of security is to be seen clearly \nin the Middle East. Early solution of the Palestine \nproblem based on the two-State concept and the \nachievement of a comprehensive Middle East \nsettlement underpinned by the international legal \nplatform developed by the United Nations are next on \nthe agenda. We are convinced that this goal could be \nadvanced by holding a representative international \nconference preceded by thorough preparation. We \nconsider the United States initiative to convene in \nNovember a multiparty meeting on a Middle East \nsettlement as a step in that direction. We appreciate the \npreliminary considerations voiced by the United States \nside regarding the agenda and composition of that \nevent. We reaffirm the importance of involving the \nQuartet of international mediators and the Arab League \nin the preparations.  \n Settlement of the Kosovo problem is only \npossible within the framework of international and law \nbased on negotiations. Unilateral steps will not lead to \na lasting peace and will create the risk of \ndestabilization in the Balkans and other regions.  \n Complex problems require an integrated \napproach. This is particularly true for the situation \naround Iran. The goal of nuclear non-proliferation is an \nabsolute priority. At the same time, we should not \nignore the task of engaging Iran in constructive efforts \nto resolve regional and international issues.  \n Urgent steps are needed to strengthen the \nnon-proliferation regime while providing all States \nwith legitimate access to the benefits of the peaceful \nuses of nuclear energy. The joint initiative of the \nPresidents of Russia and the United States, put forward \nat their Kennebunkport meeting, is aimed at starting \njoint practical work in this field.  \n We are confident that today peace should be \nbased on willingness to cooperate, especially on \nmatters directly affecting strategic stability. In this \ncontext, we cannot neglect the unilateral plans in the \narea of missile defence. President Putin has proposed a \nconstructive alternative: collaborative work with the \nparticipation of Russia, the United States and Europe, \nand subsequently with that of other countries. Such \nwork could lead to a genuinely global strategic alliance \nencompassing the entire Euro-Atlantic region, which \nwould allow us to move forward in establishing an \nopen system of collective security. Our proposals are \nunder discussion, and we hope that the collective \napproach will prevail. \n The principle of the indivisibility of security \nshould form the basis for resolving the situation around \nthe Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe. \nRussia stands ready to engage in that process, and \nproposals are well known. We expect that these \nproposals will be seriously discussed during the \nupcoming consultations. \n The possibility of deploying weapons in outer \nspace poses a serious threat. The magnitude of that \nthreat is determined by the global coverage of the \ndeployment, which can endanger all States without \nexception. We consistently oppose the deployment in \nspace of weapons of any type, and we call upon the \ninternational community to conclude an agreement to \nthat effect. \n Another outstanding global issue is the effective \nprevention of climate change, which requires agreed \nand scientifically based solutions that are realistic and \nbalanced and that do not undercut countries\u2019 right to \ndevelopment. Russia has always stood for a \nconstructive dialogue with a view to giving a genuinely \nuniversal character to the international climate \nprotection regime. We hope that the important meetings \nthat took place this week in New York and Washington \nwill facilitate thorough preparations for a successful \nlaunch in December in Bali of negotiations on joint \npost-2012 efforts. \n The spiritual and moral foundations of human \nsolidarity are of increasingly vital importance. The \nspiritual values of all world religions demand that we \nachieve intercivilizational accord and fight \nmanifestations of xenophobia and racism, as well as \nthe resurgence of neo-Nazi trends. Those are the tasks \nto be tackled within the framework of the Alliance of \nCivilizations, which we support.  The World Summit of \nReligious Leaders held in Moscow last year added a \nnew dimension to this endeavour. We propose to build \nupon the results of the Summit and to think about \nestablishing, under United Nations auspices, a special \nforum   a kind of consultative council of religions   \nfor exchanges of views among representatives of major \nworld faiths. \n Russia will spare no effort to strengthen \nmultilateral cooperation within the framework of the \nUnited Nations. I am convinced that with a continued \ncommitment to the principles of the United Nations \nCharter, we can make progress in the creation of an \neffective system of collective security, as was the will \nof the founding fathers of the world Organization.\n"

        "file_text": "Each and every one \nof us knows that there is an urgent need for the \nglobalization of responsibility. Each of us knows that \nthis responsibility demands more than just goodwill. \nEach of us knows that the globalization of \nresponsibility demands the creation of the right \nenvironment to reach these objectives. Every year, \nthese objectives and measures are repeated at this \nGeneral Assembly. Every year, the actions to fulfil \nthem remain weak. \n This is the fifth time I have taken part in the \nGeneral Assembly, and I must honestly tell you that I \nam very concerned about two things. First, I am very \nconcerned because national interests prevail over \nemergencies that affect us all. These emergencies are \nclosely linked to common interests. It is in the interest \nof all of us to address them together. Second, I am very \nconcerned about the lack of seriousness. A lot of \npromises are made, but not a lot of promises are kept. \n Today, we are confronted with two major \nchallenges that could entail major disasters should we \nnot take them seriously and act quickly. Those \nchallenges must be the priority of priorities. The first \nconcerns climate change. The second is the \ndevelopment of Africa.  \nImagine the impact on all the nations and all the \npeople represented here if the situation worsens. All of \nour national efforts will be ruined by earthquakes, \necological disasters and social disasters. Climate \nchange creates and aggravates conflicts. The refugees \nand victims of climate change will be the refugees and \nvictims of wars and poverty. We must act today to save \nthe earth, or this earth will not be ours anymore. \n On the other hand, imagine the impact on all \nnations and all people if the current situation improves. \nIt will strengthen the confidence of nations and \ninvestors. If the world were in ecological balance, and \nif it were without poverty, there would be a \nconsiderable impact on political and social conflicts. \n The two challenges are bound together. Africa \nwill have either a positive or a negative impact on the \nworld climate, with enormous repercussions. Our \nactions and our decisions will decide. The world \nclimate will have either a positive or a negative impact, \nwith enormous repercussions for the development of \nAfrica. Again, our decisions and our actions will \ndecide. \n Africa only produces one per cent of the world's \nsolar energy. In Africa, the possibilities for new and \nclean forms of energy and for the reduction of carbon \ndioxide are enormous. \n Madagascar could provide some of its energy \nneeds through the development of hydropower. \nAdditionally, half of the island could be reforested. Our \nisland, called the Red Island, could once again become \nknown as the Green Island. \n There is a strong link between the quality of the \nenvironment and poverty. Many bushfires are the result \nof poverty; the destruction of natural resources \nincreases poverty. It is necessary to quickly step out of \nthis vicious cycle. Increased international help will \nlimit the exploitation of natural resources by poor \nfarmers. \n In Madagascar, we have been planning our \ndevelopment strategies around the concept of \nsustainability for some time now. Our vision is called \n\u201cMadagascar, Naturally!\u201d It means that our natural \nresources and our people are our wealth. We will \npreserve our environment and increase its value by \nusing it responsibly. \n We are actively looking for international \ninvestment, but believe that in the long run this will not \namount to much unless we have domestic investors as \nwell. We can create added value through our successes \nin processing our natural products. \n We are convinced that economic growth from the \nbottom up is the key to success. The most important \nmessage I gave to the Malagasy people at the \nbeginning of my second term was the necessity of \ndecentralization right down to the level of the \nfokontany. Originally, the fokontany was the traditional \nMalagasy village. We are trying our best to restore the \nbalance between humans and nature. \n This is a different approach; this is a Malagasy \napproach; this is an approach that encourages the \nMalagasy people to take their future into their own \nhands; this is not the approach of the donors. With this \napproach we strive to forge a partnership with the \ninternational community.  \n We have described all of this in detail in the \nMadagascar Action Plan. Read it, and you will see that \nwe are already contributing to meeting the challenges \nthat I have mentioned. We are committing ourselves to \nprotecting and cherishing the environment, to healing \nthe injuries of the past and to ending rampant climate \nchange.  \n In the Action Plan we came up with a set of very \nambitious goals. We do what we can, despite our \nlimited resources; we could do so much more if the \ninternational community helped us more. \n We are thankful to the donors who have increased \ntheir financial assistance; however, as a whole, these \nefforts have fallen far short of our expectations, \nespecially if we are to achieve the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals. The amount of financial \nassistance is not even close to the promise of doubled \naid to Africa. The donors are still far from honouring \nthe numerous promises made here at the United \nNations. They are far from addressing global \nchallenges. The international approach to Africa lacks \nseriousness. \n Aid to Africa is still not a success story for many \nmembers of the international community. On average, \nresults are poor, but Africa is advancing as a continent \u2014 \nnot everywhere, but in an increasing number of \ncountries. \n Once, Madagascar rated amongst the least \neffective countries. Today, we are an effective country. \nOur economy has benefited from continuous economic \ngrowth: we had 5 per cent economic growth 5 years \nago, 6 per cent over the last few years and 7 per cent in \n2007. Poverty rates are dropping dramatically; in 2002, \n80 per cent of our population lived in poverty and last \nyear this rate stood at 67 per cent. \n Aid to Africa is as weak as ever. Africa can \nabsorb so much more and all countries would benefit \nfrom this. The European Union is a good example of a \nlot of aid leading to great benefits for many countries. I \nam convinced that Africa could advance much quicker \nif the international community and the African \ncountries could come up with a new plan.  \n A \u201cMarshall Plan\u201d for Africa \u2014 I have suggested \nthis repeatedly over the years and I am saying it again: \nWe need a \u201cMarshall Plan\u201d for Africa. A crucial \nelement to this plan should be a new partnership. I \npropose to you an ecological partnership between the \nindustrialized countries and Africa. Such a partnership \ncould contribute substantially to finding real solutions \nto some of the climate problems through a programme \nof investment. Other important features would include \nnature conservation and the preservation of our \nbiodiversity. \n I am convinced that Africa could supply clean \nenergy, medicinal and industrial plants and other \nnatural products in the future. The world will \neventually need more and more of these. \n We feel that sustainable policies that emphasize \nprotection and added value should be high on our \nagenda, and should represent our commitment to the \nworld. Remember though that such policies will also \nbenefit our country. \n In Madagascar, cyclones destroy a large part of \nour harvests every year; they destroy houses; they kill \npeople. The increase in the number and strength of \nthose cyclones is hindering the whole process of \ndevelopment. Higher temperatures are reducing \nharvests and our unique biodiversity. They also lead to \nmore and more harmful inserts and illnesses.  \n All over Africa, we are already seeing the \nconsequences of climate change. Droughts and floods \nare the causes of increased migration and serious \nconflicts. An aggravation of climate change will not \nonly bring fluxes of devastating waters on all \ncontinents, but also fluxes of refugees and waves of \nsocial conflicts. \n In short, the world needs Africa to solve the \nproblem of climate change, and Africa needs a stable \nclimate for lasting, sustainable development. To \nachieve this globalization of responsibility will require \ndedicated leadership. We need leaders who can \nmobilize their people and get results \u2014 fast results and \nbig results. \n At this time I want to congratulate the new \nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon. I wish him the best of \nsuccess in this very important task. We in Africa look \nto the United Nations for dynamic leadership \u2014 it is \nour hope. May his leadership help us to get results \u2014 \nthe kind of results that bring peace and prosperity to \nAfrica and to the world. \n"

        "file_text": "I shall speak today on four \nfundamental topics: climate change, cybersecurity, \nconflict resolution and cooperation among international \norganizations. \n In accordance with the United Nations \nFramework Convention on Climate Change, as well as \nthe Kyoto Protocol, industrialized countries are \nobligated to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases. \nEstonia has already achieved the basic target of the \nKyoto Protocol: our emissions of greenhouse gases \nhave been cut back by over 50 per cent. Fully \nsubscribing to the European Union statement on the \npost-2012 vision for international climate, released by \nthe Portuguese presidency, we hope that the \nnegotiations concerning a new global climate deal will \nreach a new comprehensive and global political \nagreement by as early as December 2009.  \n Yes, we recognize that developing countries have \nspecial needs in the areas of sustainable economic \ngrowth and eradication of poverty. But we also need to \ndecouple economic growth from energy consumption \nand carbon dioxide emissions. Investing in energy \nefficiency will have a huge impact on our future. \nDiversification of the energy supply and greater use of \nrenewable energies are the way forward.  \n The resources and the technology for \ndecarbonisation come primarily from industrial \nnations. Therefore, we need to continue the dialogue \nbetween industrialized and developing nations \nconcerning the adoption of a \u201cgreen\u201d economy, \nreducing carbon-fuel dependency and counterbalancing \nclimate change caused by human activities. We need to \npromote technology transfer, which is necessary for \ndeveloping environment-friendly energy production. \nEstonia believes that the best way forward is to tie \ndevelopment assistance to investment in clean \ntechnologies. \n If in the past people were connected by sea lanes \nand trade routes, today we are ever more connected by \nthe Internet, along with the threats that loom in \ncyberspace. Cyberattacks are a clear example of \ncontemporary asymmetrical threats to security. They \nmake it possible, with limited means and from a \ndistance, to paralyse a society.  \n In the future, cyberattacks may, in the hands of \ncriminals or terrorists or terrorist States, become a \nconsiderably more widespread and dangerous weapon \nthan they are at present. Cyberattacks are a threat not \nonly to sophisticated information technology systems, \nbut also to communities as a whole. For example, they \ncould be used to paralyse a city\u2019s emergency medical \nservices. The threats posed by cyberwarfare have often \nbeen underestimated, since, fortunately, they have not \nas yet resulted in the loss of any lives. Also, for \nsecurity reasons, the details of cyberattacks are often \nnot publicized.  \n In addition to taking concrete technical and legal \nmeasures to counter cyberattacks, Governments must \nmorally define cyberviolence and cybercrime, which \ndeserve to be generally condemned in the same way as \nterrorism and the trafficking in human beings are \ncondemned. Fighting against cyberwarfare is in the \ninterests of us all. It requires both appropriate domestic \nmeasures and international efforts. \n In April and May of this year, my country, \nEstonia, coped successfully with an extensive \ncyberattack, and we are prepared to share with other \ncountries the know-how that we have acquired. We call \nupon the international community to cooperate in legal \nmatters in questions concerning cybersecurity. But, \nsince this whole subject is in a relatively new field, it is \nessential to establish an appropriate legal space. As a \nfirst step, we call upon all countries to accede to the \nConvention on Cybercrime of the Council of Europe. \nThe Convention is also open for accession by  \nnon-members of the Council. \n We should move ahead and create a truly \ninternational framework for combating these vicious \nacts. The Global Cybersecurity Agenda of the \nInternational Telecommunications Union, launched by \nthe Secretary-General in May, is an important initiative \nfor building international cooperation in this field. \nEstonia also agrees with the assessment of the \nspecialists of the United Nations Institute for Training \nand Research that a globally negotiated and \ncomprehensive cyberspace law is essential and that the \nUnited Nations can provide the neutral and legitimate \nforum necessary for that task. \n The United Nations is determined to resolve \nconflicts. Understandably, conflict prevention and \nresolution, particularly in Africa, is a top priority. We \nwelcome the creation of a United Nations-African \nUnion peacekeeping force to quell the violence and \ninstability plaguing the Darfur region of the Sudan. \n It is important to settle conflicts in other places as \nwell, such as Afghanistan. We need to increase the \npresence and visibility of the United Nations there, \nwhich would be an encouraging sign for the local \npopulation and would also send a signal to other \ninternational aid organizations and non-governmental \norganizations that they should increase their activities. \nThe United Nations should also assume a greater role \nin coordinating the reconstruction effort in \nAfghanistan. \n I would like to highlight one conflict in Europe in \nwhich the United Nations has a significant role to play: \nthe conflict in Abkhazia, Georgia. Along with the other \n\u201cfrozen\u201d conflicts in the neighbouring region, it \nremains among the last unresolved conflicts in Europe. \nIt is my hope that the Group of Friends of the \nSecretary-General will have the determination to find \nsolutions that honour Georgia\u2019s territorial integrity. We \ncannot be satisfied with the current situation. It is \nimportant to build confidence between the parties and \nto resume the meetings between the representatives of \nGeorgia\u2019s Government and those of Abkhazia. There is \nno place for military provocations, internal or external.  \n A major task for the United Nations remains the \nfacilitation of the return of refugees to Abkhazia, \nwhich, unfortunately, has been greatly hampered. \nProgress regarding the conflict is possible if all \ninterested parties act in a constructive way. We must \ngenerate the political will necessary to resolve the \nconflict. In that context, I welcome the increased \ncontribution of the European Union (EU). \n The international community should also secure \nthe best and most rational use of available resources, \nincluding in emergency and crisis response situations. \nFor example, both the United Nations and the EU were \ninvolved in managing the response to the Asian \ntsunami in 2004 and the Lebanese crisis in 2006. That \nonce again brought to the fore the necessity of \ndeveloping common needs assessments   to further \ndiscuss the roles and mandates of the relevant actors, \nsuch as the United Nations Office for the Coordination \nof Humanitarian Affairs, the European Commission\u2019s \nDirectorate-General for Humanitarian Aid and the \nCommunity Mechanism for Civil Protection of the EU. \n Poverty, armed conflicts and natural disasters \nsuch as floods, tsunamis and forest fires are all causes \nof another global problem   forced migration, which \nshould also be tackled in a more concerted manner by \nthe whole international community. Being forced to \nleave one\u2019s home is always a tragedy. I know: my \nfamily was forced to leave my country, fleeing brutal \nSoviet occupation forces. Trying to integrate into a new \nsociety is always a significant challenge. Only through \nwell-coordinated common efforts can we ensure that \npeople never again have to leave their homes because \nthey have no other option. Thus, a global approach to \nhuman migration should remain a vital issue on the \nUnited Nations agenda. \n"

        "file_text": "Please allow me, Sir, to \ncongratulate you on your election as President of the \nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-second session and to \nwish you great success in that very important job. I \nwould also like to thank the outgoing President, \nSheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa, for her valuable \ncontribution to the General Assembly. I also wish to \ncongratulate Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on his \nleadership, his great efforts in support of peace and \ncooperation in the world and his contribution to \nstrengthening the United Nations and its institutions. \n As a representative of a country that suffered one \nof the most totalitarian of post-Second World War \ndictatorships, it is my deep conviction that defending \nand promoting freedom and its values and supporting \noppressed peoples in order that they may free \nthemselves from tyrannical regimes that continue to \nproduce human suffering, poverty, violence and \nterrorism should be the main priority of the \nOrganization. In that context, I would like to say that \nCentral Asia, the Middle East, the Balkans and the \nentire world are now freer and safer without the likes \nof Mullah Omar, Saddam Hussein and Slobodan \nMilosevic. I would like to take this opportunity to \nwelcome the message of hope that President George W. \nBush and other leaders have sent from this rostrum to \nall the peoples of the world still living under tyrannical \nregimes. \n Albania is a small country, but one with a clear \nvocation and determination to strengthen freedom and \ndemocracy for its citizens. Albania is also deeply \ncommitted to making its modest contribution to peace \nand security in the world. We have established close \ncooperation with friendly countries and international \norganizations in the fight against terrorism. In that \nregard, our peacekeeping units have served or are \nserving in Bosnia, Georgia, Afghanistan and Iraq. I am \ndelighted to inform the Assembly that, in that same \nspirit, my Government has decided to contribute \nanother platoon to United Nations peacekeeping \noperations. \n Albania has also been a staunch supporter of \ninternational efforts to limit the proliferation of \nweapons of mass destruction and the unlawful use of \nsmall arms and light weapons, which pose a serious \nthreat to peace, security and stability. In that context, \namong other measures, we committed ourselves to the \nfull destruction of our stockpile of chemical weapons. \nIn July 2007, Albania became the first country in the \nworld free of chemical materials and armaments of any \nkind. I would like to take this opportunity to thank the \nGovernments of the United States, Germany, Italy, \nGreece and Switzerland, which provided valuable \nfinancial and technical assistance to achieve that \nimportant objective. \n We are successfully implementing a number of \nvery important programmes in cooperation with the \nUnited Nations Development Programme (UNDP), \nUNICEF and many other United Nations agencies. \nAlbania became part of the effort to reform the United \nNations by voluntarily joining the One United Nations \nprogramme as a pilot country. We are currently \nworking with United Nations agencies in order to test \nthe One United Nations concept and to develop new \napproaches and models for partnership in the areas of \ndevelopment, humanitarian assistance and the \nenvironment. The first results of the project are truly \nvery encouraging. We are fully committed to making \nevery effort in order to ensure that the initiative can \nbecome a success story. \n European integration and membership in NATO \nare two main objectives for Albania. We are committed \nto undertake any reform and take any step to achieve \nthose goals. A year ago, we signed a Stabilization and \nAssociation Agreement with the European Union (EU). \nWe are working seriously in every way to fulfil its \nstandards and obligations. At the same time, we have \nundertaken thorough reforms of our armed forces, with \nthe assistance of many NATO member countries. We \nare also working to strengthen the rule of law and \ndemocracy in our country. We are hopeful that by the \ntime of the next NATO summit, in Bucharest, we will \nbe in a position to deserve an invitation to join the \nalliance. \n It was not long ago that the Balkans was the stage \nfor human tragedies, brutal wars and ethnic cleansing \nbased on the concept of a \u201cgreater country\u201d and fuelled \nby the extreme nationalism and racism of a nation that \nwas consumed by the idea of its own hegemony over \nothers. But in a few years, the Balkan countries have \nmanaged to transit from the age of dictatorships, hatred \nand conflicts into an age of peace, cooperation, \nfriendship and integration. \n I would like to take this opportunity to thank all \nthe Governments and taxpayers of the countries \nmembers of NATO, the EU and the United Nations, as \nwell as the other organizations whose support and \nassistance was so important in bringing about that \nhistoric change. However, I believe that a final solution \nto the issue of Kosova\u2019s status that fully respects the \nexpressed will of its citizens for independence is a \nfundamental precondition for durable peace and \nstability, not only in Kosova but in the entire region as \nwell. Albania fully supported President Ahtisaari\u2019s \nproject and the efforts of the Troika for the solution for \nthe final status. \n Due to the lack of realism and the ghost of a \ngreater Serbia, Belgrade turned down President \nAhtisaari\u2019s project, which sets forth and guarantees the \nhighest, by far, European standards for the Serb \nminorities in Kosova, standards that, in truth, are much \nmore advanced than those enjoyed by the Albanians \nliving in southern Serbia. \n Rejection of the Ahtisaari package is unhelpful \nand proves that what matters first for Belgrade is not \nthe freedom and rights of Serbs in Kosova, but rather \nthe idea of a greater Serbia. Such a stance by Belgrade \nhas been encouraged by the Russian position in the \nSecurity Council with regard to Ahtisaari\u2019s project, a \nposition that, despite its motivation, does not \ncontribute to peace and stability in the region. \n Claims that Kosova\u2019s independence sets an \ninternational precedent or lays conditions for the \ncreation of a greater Albania, as well as the fear of two \nAlbanian states in the Balkans, are unfounded. Those \nwho are interested in the truth and in reality can easily \nrealize that Kosova is a unique case, from both the \nhistorical and current perspectives. \n For more than five centuries, from the end of the \nthirteenth century to the beginning of the twentieth, \nKosova was a part of the Ottoman Empire, inhabited \nmainly by native Albanians whose roots and shelter \nhad been there since the very beginning. Only at the \nstart of the last century, in one of the greatest historic \ninjustices, Kosova was separated from the Albanian \nterritory and given in tribute to Serbia \u2014 for the sole \nreason that it was part of an empire that lost the war. \n Kosova is also a unique case in her sufferings. \nDuring the past century, the implementation of the \nCubrilovic doctrine of extreme racism and \nextermination against Albanians turned them into third-\nclass citizens and turned Kosova into an arena of ethnic \ncleansing and real apartheid. \n It is also a unique case because the last Serbian \ngenocide against Albanians, in 1999, which caused \nthousands of atrocities among innocent populations, \nmultiple massive graves and the destruction and \nburning of more than 130 thousand homes, schools and \nhospitals, obliged the North Atlantic alliance to \nundertake its greatest offensive to protect human rights \nand freedom there. \n Kosova is also a unique case from a legal \nstandpoint, because during Josip Broz Tito\u2019s regime it \nwas a constitutional entity of the Yugoslav federation, \nenjoying its veto rights in the federal Government. \nDuring this time, Kosova chaired the Yugoslav \nfederation for several terms, based on the leadership \nrotation principle within Yugoslavia. \n The claim that the independence of Kosova could \nlead to the creation of a greater Albania cannot be \nfarther from the truth. In reality, Kosova\u2019s \nindependence will only end the fluidity of Albanians in \nthe Balkans, along with the idea of the creation of a \nsingle Albanian State in the territories where they are a \ndominant majority. The simple truth is that Kosova \nAlbanians have decided in their great project for the \nfuture to join Brussels and not to join Tirana. \n On the other hand, I would like to guarantee that \nAlbania remains determined to fully respect the \ninternational borders of its neighbours, including those \nof Kosova. Albania is closely collaborating and will \ncontinue to cooperate bilaterally with all countries in \nthe region, including Serbia, in the process of regional, \nEuropean and Euro-Atlantic integration. I believe that \nthe concern about two independent Albanian States in \nthe Balkans is xenophobic. Two democratic States with \nan Albanian majority will be two more countries \nfriendly to their neighbours. \n I would like to urge the political leadership of \nKosova to refrain from taking unilateral actions. They \nshould continue, as they have done so far, to cooperate \nwith the Contact Group and the international \ncommunity in seeking a solution for the final status of \nKosova, with full respect for its will and the dignity it \ndeserves. \n I would also like to take this opportunity to \ncongratulate the political leadership of Kosova for \nsubmitting a treaty of reconciliation, friendship and \ncooperation with Serbia \u2014 a treaty inspired by the \nhighest European values and the best of European \nheritage. I hope and wish that Serbia would take up this \nimportant opportunity, because I believe that peace and \ncoexistence between Albanians and Serbs in the \nBalkans will best benefit both of these nations.\n"

        "file_text": "It is a great pleasure for me to \naddress the General Assembly at its sixty-second \nsession. \n Let me begin by extending warm greetings from \nthe Kingdom of Swaziland to the entire United Nations \nfamily.  \n It befits this moment that I extend our \ncongratulations to the Secretary-General, Mr. Ban \nKi-moon, upon his appointment. We trust that he will \ncontinue in the footsteps of his predecessors in \ncarrying out the important mission of the United \nNations. The Kingdom of Swaziland pledges its \nsupport to him as he continues to promote and protect \nthe noble goals of multilateralism. \n The role of the United Nations is to promote \npeace and security, sustainable development, human \nrights and fundamental freedoms. The United Nations \nshould continue to shape situations for the betterment \nof the lives of all the peoples of the world. If it is to \nsucceed, there is a need for the United Nations to \nreform its main bodies. We have met regionally as \ncountries; consensus decisions have been reached and \nrecommendations made, and we look forward to their \nimplementation. As the United Nations achieves \nreform, it is likely to undertake meaningful action so \nthat when decisions are taken, the Organization will be \nrespected by all. \n Many of our countries the world over are facing \ncountless challenges, and we look to this Organization \nto come up with lasting solutions. My country, \nSwaziland, is still undertaking development \nprogrammes to implement the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals that were set by the United \nNations for individual countries to achieve. We have \nprogrammes for building a very sound economy so that \nour people will have good jobs that will make their \nliving standards better. \n As part of our human capital development and \ncapacity-building programme, we are educating and \ntraining our people in every aspect to acquire more \nknowledge and information, and we look to the well-\ndeveloped countries to share their experiences and \nideas. \n One area of great concern is that, as we continue \nto implement our development programmes, we are \nfaced with the challenges of globalization that will \naffect our preferential markets. That will be \ndetrimental to us, the developing countries, since \ncompanies have big loans to repay that were taken out \non the basis of better markets. We hope that, as the \nWorld Trade Organization (WTO) rules come into \nforce, there shall be considerations to ensure that all \ndeveloping countries meet WTO standards. In that way, \nwe shall be able to implement the rules equitably and \neffectively. \n HIV/AIDS and other health problems remain \nsome of the major challenges that we face as \ndeveloping nations. We have programmes in place that \nwe are trying to follow in dealing with the situation, \nbut we are unable to meet our targets because of our \nlimited resources. We have heard of many foundations \nthat have been announced worldwide and we hope to \nbe able to access them. We look forward to those \nresponsible for such foundations sharing the \ninformation on how to reach the funds, as well as \ntechnical support. \n We acknowledge the contribution made by the \nGlobal Fund in the fight against the scourge. My \ncountry is one of the beneficiaries of such funding, and \nwe have been able to offer a lot of comfort to many of \nour people. We encourage the United Nations to \ncontinue to appeal on our behalf for continued support \nin eradicating the problem of HIV/AIDS, malaria and \ntuberculosis, to name just a few. \n We also recognize the role of various United \nNations agencies working with our communities in the \nprovision of shelter, nutritional support and education \nto mitigate the effects of the pandemic. I am pleased to \nstate that our fight is showing some signs of success, as \nrecent statistics have shown a decline in the prevalence \nrate. \n We are faced with persistent droughts that have \nset us back as we continue to develop our country, and \nthat has been worsened by the wildfires that have \nrecently occurred, destroying properties, crops, \nlivestock and our forest industry. My country is doing \neverything it can to help those that have been affected \nby this unfortunate situation. We would like to thank \nthe countries and organizations that have come forward \nto help us during this period of hardship and we do \nmake an appeal to others for support; which is still \nneeded. \n Some of the problems I have mentioned that are \naffecting my country are the result of climate changes. \nThat is why we believe that the summit we had is very \nimportant, and we would like to commend the \nSecretary-General for convening the high-level summit \non climate change held earlier this week. A political \nmomentum has been generated, and it is our hope that \nthe necessary negotiations on the matter will \ncommence in Bali later this year during the meeting of \nthe parties to the United Nations Framework \nConvention on Climate Change. \n The Kingdom of Swaziland has developed some \nsector policies that are climate-change friendly, such as \nour pro-green energy policy and water resources \npolicy, to mention a couple. However, there is a need to \nenhance education, training and public awareness with \nregard to the adaptation and promotion of individual \nand institutional capacity-building in order to manage \nappropriate technology development and transfer. \n We note that there is a general need for \nfavourable access to and transfer of environmentally \nsound technologies, in particular from developed \ncountries to developing countries, through supportive \nmeasures that promote technology cooperation. This \nwill enable the necessary technological know-how to \nbe transferred and economic, technical and managerial \ncapabilities to be built for the efficient use and further \ndevelopment of transferred skills. \n We would like to encourage the private sector, \nand in particular the multinational corporations, to be \nresponsible enough to practise the same environmental \nand waste management principles in the developing \nworld. We would also like to discourage the \nirresponsible dumping of harmful waste materials in \ndeveloping countries. \n The Kingdom of Swaziland is deeply committed \nto the United Nations Charter. Moreover, recent events \nin the world have been living proof that the United \nNations is needed now more than ever before. Sadly, \nthe realities of wars and violence still continue in \ndifferent parts of the world. Conflicts, tensions and \nterrorism continue to destroy the social and economic \nfabric of the era that we are living in. \n We welcome the report of the Secretary-General \non the relationship between disarmament and \ndevelopment (A/62/112), in particular its recognition \nthat armed violence and conflict impede the realization \nof the Millennium Development Goals. \nIn this regard we applaud the United Nations \nDevelopment Programme for its efforts to prevent \narmed violence through its contribution to the \ndisarmament and development agenda by promoting \nand participating in a number of policy-oriented \ninitiatives. \n We further commend the efforts of the United \nNations Regional Centre for Peace and Disarmament in \nAfrica both for its continuation of the operation of the \nsmall arms and light weapons register for Africa for \nparticipating States, with a view to promoting \ntransparency in the flows of small arms and light \nweapons, and for its programme entitled \u201cAfrican \nSecurity Sector Reform Programme\u201d, which carries the \nobjective of transforming governance within the \nAfrican security sector. \n However, we are concerned about the situation in \nSomalia and Darfur and its far-reaching consequences \nfor regional security. The continued human suffering in \nthis region is unacceptable, and we hope that current \nefforts aimed at improving the situation will not be \ndeprived of the opportunity to succeed. On a more \npositive note, we welcome the Security Council \ndecision to deploy the joint African Union-United \nNations hybrid peacekeeping force. \n The Middle East continues to face challenges and \nthe accumulation of crises and tensions in the region. It \nis therefore imperative that all parties concerned make \nan effort to achieve comprehensive, fair, just and \ndurable settlements. \n I would like to take this time to applaud the \nUnited Nations for its role in promoting its Charter, \nespecially the principle of universality. There is one \ncountry, however, that is not benefiting from this \nprinciple, as it has been excluded from the family of \nnations. \n I am talking about Taiwan: the Kingdom of \nSwaziland wishes to reiterate its appeal to the United \nNations with respect to the question of Taiwan. We \nnote that Taiwan exercised a well-founded right in \ninternational law to apply for membership in the \nUnited Nations. Regrettably, the application was \nrejected without due process. \n The Government and people of Taiwan have \nshown their willingness and capacity to contribute \nactively to global development and peace, through \ndisaster relief and health and development support to \nmany regions. We continue to support the cause of the \nover 23 million people of Taiwan who are not \nrepresented in the one organization that should be truly \nglobal. I would like to challenge all nations to take my \nappeal seriously. \n While our world experiences ever-accelerating \npolitical, economic and social changes, it is vital that \nwe cooperate with each other in order to tackle and \nmanage these issues. Cordial, balanced and respectful \nrelations between nations based on the principles of the \nUnited Nations Charter will enable us all to meet and \novercome future challenges of our time, and make this \nworld a safer place for future generations.  \n"

        "file_text": "I would like to express my \nsincere congratulations to Mr. Srgjan Kerim on his \nelection as President of the General Assembly at its \nsixty-second session. My delegation also wishes to \ncommend his predecessor, Sheikha Haya Rashed \nAl-Khalifa, for her leadership of the General Assembly \nat its sixty-first session, particularly in addressing the \ndifficult issues that continue to prevent revitalization of \nthe General Assembly and reform of the Security \nCouncil. My delegation offers its full cooperation and \nsupport towards the President\u2019s commitment to \ncontinuing with the Organization\u2019s overall reform \nagenda and addressing the many challenges ahead. \n As this is the first General Assembly session to \nbe convened since the appointment of His Excellency \nMr. Ban Ki-moon as Secretary-General, my delegation \ntakes this opportunity to assure him of Nauru\u2019s firm \nsupport and full cooperation in his leadership of the \nUnited Nations. \n I am deeply honoured to be addressing this body \nfor the third consecutive year, this time as the recently \nreturned leader of our small island State of Nauru. As \nmembers are no doubt aware, when I first took up \noffice, three years ago, my country was on the brink of \ncollapse. While Nauru was once a small donor country \nwith a high income, our wealth was squandered in a \nsingle generation through gross mismanagement and \ncorruption on the part of previous Governments. Our \npast record of poor governance and the need to rebuild \nNauru were the main reasons that our national \nsustainable development strategy was initiated by our \nGovernment and given one of its fundamental goals: \nthe establishment and operation of a transparent and \naccountable Government. \n My Government is slowly but diligently working \nto improve Nauru. Over our three-year term, we will \ncontinue to do so, on a platform of both economic and \npolitical reform, together with good governance. We \nbelieve that we are improving our situation, and the \nAugust election results tell us that we have our \npeople\u2019s confidence. But it is a slow and painful \nrecovery, and we appreciate all the help that we can \nget. \n We appreciate the fact that the United Nations is \nstrongly aware of the development challenges in the \nPacific region and that it is also cognizant that \nassistance has not translated into uniform human \ndevelopment gains in many places, with the result that \nthe Pacific is in danger of missing many targets of the \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs). In that \nrespect, my delegation welcomes and supports the \nPresident\u2019s intention to hold a leaders\u2019 meeting on the \nMDGs during the present session. \n During the general debate at the sixty-first \nsession (see A/61/PV.16), we noted in this historic Hall \nthat the offices and agencies of the United Nations had \nno permanent presence in many of the small island \ndeveloping States of the Pacific. In June 2006, it was \nannounced that a coalition comprising the United \nNations Development Programme, UNICEF and the \nUnited Nations Population Fund would open a total of \neight new offices in Pacific island countries, including \nmy own country, Nauru. We welcomed that historic \nannouncement, the progress that it marked towards \nharmonization with the United Nations and the \nassistance and support that the new offices would \nprovide in developing national capacity and meeting \nthe MDGs. \n As Member States that pay our dues, deploy \npeacekeepers and discharge our responsibilities in the \ninternational community, we deserve offices that \nenhance the relevance of the United Nations and the \nimplementation of its policies. We have therefore been \nseverely disappointed by the lack of progress in \nestablishing acceptable offices in our countries since \nthe announcement. The delaying of that initiative, and \nthe assumptions on the part of the United Nations \nconcerning the capabilities of our small island States to \nrecruit staff for such offices, are also short-sighted. \nMoreover, the Organization\u2019s definition of \n\u201cpartnership\u201d for the initiative places a significant \nburden on our national Governments. It fails to respond \nto our national priorities and our lack of resources, and \ntherefore weakens the cohesion between the \nOrganization and our countries. \n Despite the lack of visible progress, we are of the \nview that the project can be salvaged with its original \nintentions and goals intact if there is a will and a \nsincere desire to respond to our needs. So we ask the \nGeneral Assembly and the Secretariat to ensure that \noffices befitting the ideals and the reputation of the \nUnited Nations are opened in our countries. We want to \nsee the United Nations on the ground in Nauru and \nthroughout the Pacific region, providing a helping hand \nin our pursuit of sustainable development. \n There can be no doubt that our Pacific region is \ndoing its best to implement the commitments made \nunder the Mauritius Strategy and other international \nagreements regarding small island developing States. \nThe relevant report of the Secretary-General \n(A/62/279) makes that very clear, showing that under \nits Pacific Plan, the Pacific region has agreed to and is \nvigorously pursuing its own sustainable development \npriorities, which reflect and acknowledge our \ninternational commitments under the Strategy. The \nSecretary-General\u2019s report and the Pacific Plan updates \nshow progress in some key areas and identify \nimportant initiatives for follow-up action. \n However, it is also quite clear that we and the \nUnited Nations need to do much more. That fact is \nglaringly obvious in the recent report of the \nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), \nwhich warns of a narrowing window of opportunity \navailable for slowing down global warming and \nclimate change. This is an issue that reveals some of \nthe inequities in the current world development \nparadigm: the small island countries contribute very \nlittle to the problem but are likely to be the worst \naffected. \n The need to do more also stares us in the face \nfrom recent reports on the progress, or lack thereof, in \nachieving MDGs. Our region is struggling in many \nareas of the MDGs, and it is fair to say, as the \nSecretary-General\u2019s report notes, that persistent \ncapacity constraints are a key obstacle to the \nimplementation of sustainable development in the \nPacific region   this includes Nauru. \n Therefore, I take this opportunity to express my \npeople\u2019s warmest appreciation to our development \npartners, led by Australia, Taiwan, New Zealand, \nJapan, the European Union and others, for their support \nin this and other areas, without which we would have \ncompletely collapsed as a nation and as a people. \nHowever, I hope the Assembly can appreciate that our \nregion, although vast, suffers both from isolation and \nthe relatively small size of its countries and \npopulations.  \n Even with the best practices in management and \ngovernance, our economies\u2019 sustainable development is \nimpeded by high transportation costs and diseconomies \nof scale. In Nauru, freight adds at least 15 to 20 per \ncent to the cost of all imports. Likewise, affordable and \nsustainable alternative energy forms are a high priority \nfor my country and region because, with the ever \nincreasing cost of fossil fuel, we are having to pay a \nhigh premium for something that contributes both to \nglobal warming and to our potential demise as Pacific \nislands.  \n Professor Jeffrey Sachs has rightly said that, \nwhile we all need to work together to solve world \npoverty, the opportunity is there for the developed \ncountries with their resources and technology to do \nsomething about ending it once and for all. The agreed \nofficial development assistance (ODA) target of 0.7 per \ncent of a gross national product is far from being \nachieved. This highlights the opportunity for the world \nto do much more to both alleviate poverty and remove \nthe constraints that frustrate the progress of many \ndeveloping countries. \n Like other highly indebted countries, mine is \ndoubly burdened by a massive debt left to us by \nprevious Governments. After careful assessment of \nNauru\u2019s development potential for the next thirty years, \nwe have come to the sad conclusion that Nauru will \nonly be able to service a very small portion of that \ndebt. We will need to seek the forgiveness of those \ncountries and institutions to which we owe most of the \nmoney.  \n This Organization prides itself on being inclusive \nand on being a champion to everyone; yet my \ndelegation is extremely disappointed that, despite the \nefforts of Nauru and other allies of this cause, the \nUnited Nations continues to ignore the expressed wish \nof Taiwan and its 23 million people to become a \nmember of this Organization. \n On the 19 July this year, an application for \nmembership to the United Nations was delivered to the \nOffice of the Secretary-General, signed by the \ndemocratically elected President of Taiwan, His \nExcellency Chen Shui-bian. Unfortunately, the United \nNations Charter and the rules of procedure of the \nSecurity Council were then contravened. Owing to \npoor legal advice, the Office of the Secretary-General \nfailed to forward Taiwan\u2019s application for membership \nto the Security Council, citing General Assembly \nresolution 2758 (XXVI) for its failure. Even though \nmany Member States continue to hide behind \nresolution 2758 (XXVI), it should be realized that this \nresolution does not declare that Taiwan is a part of the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China, nor does it preclude \nTaiwan from future membership of this body. It \ncertainly does not support the so-called one China \nprinciple. \n Ever since the establishment of the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China on 1 October 1949, the two sides of \nthe Taiwan Strait have been governed separately, with \nneither side exercising any control or jurisdiction over \nthe other. Let me be absolutely clear: Taiwan has no \nintention of representing the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina. Taiwan is a free and peace-loving sovereign \nState, and its democratically elected Government is the \nsole legitimate Government of their island State.  \n Apart from the legal and moral rights of Taiwan \nto be part of the United Nations, there is another \ndimension that needs to be taken into account. Taiwan \nis one of the largest economies in the world, including \nbeing one of the larger trading partners of other \nMembers of the United Nations. It is also one of the \ntop twenty sources of world foreign investment and is \nwell positioned to assist many of the members of this \nbody in their development, which it has already \ndemonstrated. Taiwan is a very important investor and \ntrading partner for my country and others in my  \nregion   even for those that do not recognize it \nformally.  \n My delegation calls on the Office of the \nSecretary-General to uphold the integrity of this pre-\neminent Organization and conform to the United \nNations Charter and the rules of procedure of the \nSecurity Council. It must immediately accept and \nsubmit to the Security Council Taiwan\u2019s application for \nmembership.  \n Peoples of the world look to the United Nations \nand to their leaders to identify and act on major global \nchallenges that confront the world today. Earlier this \nweek, we concluded a High-Level Event on Climate \nChange. Our discussions encompassed a variety of \nviews and proposals that we all hope will lead to global \nresolve to achieve significant changes. Nauru takes the \nview that the international community, particularly \nthose countries with the capacity that comes with their \nstatus as developed nations, has a responsibility to \nprovide financial, humanitarian and other assistance to \nsmall island developing States that stand to suffer the \nmost dire consequences of global climate change.  \n Of course, we must acknowledge and express \ngratitude for those aid policies that have been proposed \nand established, but more is needed to avert a potential \ndisaster, especially to the vulnerable small island \nnations. Therefore, we ask that ongoing efforts be \ncontinued and urge Member States to consider \nincreasing their financial support, including easier \naccess to the Adaptation Fund. \n However, capital investments alone are not \nsufficient. Technology, skills and knowledge are \nrequired to guide us in our response to the present \nchallenge. Furthermore, civil society and non-\ngovernmental organizations must cooperate with each \nother in acquiring and building the capacity we need to \naddress this problem.  \n The world situation demands a renewed, \nrevitalized and more responsive United Nations now \nmore than ever. We need to see the strengthening of \nthis multilateral institution through the revitalization of \nthe General Assembly and comprehensive reform of \nthe Security Council through intergovernmental \nnegotiations. All of that must move forward with a \ncommon vision for a more coherent United Nations \nsystem capable of delivering as one, sparing no efforts \nto continue strengthening the three pillars of peace and \nsecurity, development and human rights.  \n Nauru is of the view that the comprehensive \nreform of the Security Council will not be complete \nwithout Japan, India, Brazil and Germany as permanent \nmembers. \n In closing, I wish to remind this Assembly of the \nSecretary-General\u2019s recent observation of the United \nNations, whereupon he stated: \n\u201cThe true measure of success for the United \nNations is not how much we promise, but how \nmuch we deliver for those who need us most.\u201d \n(A/61/PV.31) \nAs we move forward our discussions on the many \nchallenging and complex issues before us, let us do so \nwith the best of intentions, and more importantly, let us \nmake good our promise to deliver.  \n Finally, while I stand in this great country of the \nUnited States of America, the land of the free, I cannot \nhelp but remember that its people have put their trust in \nGod. On my island country of Nauru, also a land of the \nfree, we have placed our belief in God\u2019s will first. \nTherefore, to every human being on our planet Earth, I \nbeseech each and every one of us to dedicate ourselves \nto hold true to our God\u2019s will. \n"

        "file_text": "At the  outset, I would like to express to His Excellency \nMr. Srgjan Kerim and to his friendly country our most \nsincere congratulations on his election as President of \nthe General Assembly at its sixty-second session. We \nare confident that under his skilful and effective \nleadership, our deliberations will be successful.  \n I wish also to extend to our sister, Her Excellency \nMs. Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa, our deep thanks \nand appreciation for her valuable efforts as President of \nthe Assembly at its previous session towards the \nrealization of the Millennium Development Goals and \ntowards enhancing dialogue among all members of the \ninternational community and reviving the Security \nCouncil reform process.  \n I wish also to express our appreciation to \nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his endeavours and \nhis determination to reform the functioning of the \nOrganization. We wish him every success.  \n Signs of new dynamism in the United Nations \nreform process reflect a true desire to improve the \nOrganization\u2019s work so as to bring it in line with the \nrequirements of the new world realities and with new \nconcepts arising from the profound and speedy \ntransformations the world has experienced in recent \ndecades.  \n In our view, giving effect to that desire requires \nnew working frameworks and mechanisms to reinforce \nthe underpinnings of international peace and security \nand enable us to achieve collective solutions to the \ncommon challenges facing the international \ncommunity. We should be inspired in that endeavour by \na new vision that lays the foundation for a \ncomprehensive, effective and solidarity-based global \npartnership among the members of the international \ncommunity, on the basis of constructive dialogue \namong peoples, cultures, civilizations and religions.  \n On the basis of that conviction, Tunisia has \nlaunched international initiatives with political, \nhumanitarian and social dimensions. Some of these \ninitiatives were adopted by the United Nations, such as \nthe establishment of the World Solidarity Fund. We \nlook forward to increased efforts by the international \ncommunity to operationalize the Fund.  \n Since the early 1990s, Tunisia has been in the \nforefront of countries drawing attention to the dangers \nof terrorism and its negative impact on world security \nand stability. Today, Tunisia renews its call for an \ninternational conference, under United Nations \nauspices, in order to formulate an international code of \nconduct for combating terrorism, by which all parties \nwould abide.  \n Convinced of the significant role that dialogue \namong civilizations plays in obviating the dangers of \nextremism and intolerance, Tunisia has consistently \nendeavoured to be the world capital of dialogue among \ncivilizations, by hosting several regional and \ninternational conferences and seminars. It has also \ntaken initiatives in this field, such as the publication of \nthe Carthage Charter for Tolerance in 1995, the appeal \nby President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali for a pedagogy of \ntolerance, the 2001 Tunis Declaration on Dialogue \namong Civilizations, and the establishment, in the \nUniversity of Tunis, of the Ben Ali Chair for Dialogue \namong Civilizations and Religions.  \n We take note with satisfaction of the focus on the \ntheme of climate change during the current session\u2019s \ngeneral debate, in view of the fact that environmental \nissues are a basic pillar of sustainable development and \none of the major elements of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals   one that has an impact on \ninternational peace and security.  \n Tunisia believes that climate change poses a \ncommon threat to all States of the world without \nexception. This has prompted Tunisia to host, next \nNovember, an international ministerial workshop to \ndiscuss climate change in Africa and the Mediterranean \nregion, as a contribution to increasing and deepening \nawareness of the importance of this issue and to \nenriching regional dialogue on it.  \n The international community and all its members \nmust devote more attention to the environment and to \nfinding urgent and effective collective solutions to \nenvironmental issues in certain regions of the world   \nnotably in Africa, which suffers most from the climate \nchange that is threatening the continent\u2019s aspirations to \ndevelopment and to the achievement of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals.  \n The fact that several important international \npolitical problems remain unsolved continues to be a \nsource of concern for us. Today, Tunisia reaffirms that \nit upholds the values of peace and justice and the \nprinciples of international legitimacy, and that it is \nprepared to contribute to the dissemination and \npromotion of the values of tolerance, moderation and \nmutual respect among nations and peoples. In our view, \nthat should help consolidate a constructive dialogue \namong civilizations and establish international \ncooperation and a solidarity-based development \npartnership that will help eliminate the causes of \ntension and conflict worldwide.  \n On this occasion, we reaffirm our principled and \nconstant support for the Palestinian people in their \nstruggle for their just cause. We urge the international \ncommunity, in particular the influential parties and the \nQuartet, to intensify their efforts aimed at reviving the \npeace process, on the basis of United Nations \nresolutions and the relevant Arab and international \nterms of reference, inter alia, the Arab Peace Initiative, \nwith a view to finding a just and comprehensive \nsolution that would guarantee the restoration of the \nPalestinians\u2019 legitimate rights, foremost among which \nis the establishment of their own independent State.  \n We welcome the initiative taken by President \nBush and certain international influential parties to \nrevive the peace process. In this context, we wish to \nstress the importance of convening an international \npeace conference that should yield concrete proposals \nfor achieving a lasting and comprehensive peace in the \nMiddle East and lead to the restitution of all occupied \nArab territories and guarantee security and stability to \nall the countries and peoples of the region.  \n By the same token, we call for concerted regional \nand international efforts to help the brotherly Iraqi \npeople to restore the deteriorating security, economic \nand humanitarian situation in their country, through the \nachievement of a consensual political settlement \namong all its segments and factions that preserves the \nunity and sovereignty of Iraq. As far as the situation in \nLebanon is concerned, we urge all Lebanese parties to \nfavour dialogue as the sole way to prevent the scourge \nof dissension among the Lebanese people and to \nrestore confidence and reconciliation among them.  \n Since 7 November 1987, Tunisia, under the \nleadership of President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, has \nsucceeded in making pioneer achievements and gains \nin different fields. This has been made possible thanks \nto comprehensive reforms that allowed Tunisia to \nconsolidate the rule of law and institutions, as well as \npublic freedoms, and to disseminate, in theory and \npractice, the culture of human rights, thus enhancing \nthe democratic structure of the country and paving the \nway for contributions by all components of civil \nsociety to define national orientations and choices for \nthe future.  \n The reform process implemented in Tunisia has \nallowed the achievement of numerous Millennium \nDevelopment Goals, which has translated into better \nliving standards for Tunisians and well-being for all \nsegments of Tunisian society. This reflects the \ncorrectness of development choices made by Tunisia, \nwhich has also allowed it to hold an advanced position \namong countries with the highest level of human \ndevelopment.  \n On many occasions, Tunisia has stated its \nconviction of the need for building international \ncooperation and partnerships based on a \ncomprehensive approach aimed at achieving \ndevelopment for all and laying the foundations for \nconstructive relations among countries of the North \nand the South. In this context, President Zine \nEl Abidine Ben Ali called from this rostrum in 1989 for \nthe adoption of a charter of peace and progress \nbetween the countries of the North and the South.  \n The international community is called upon to \nexert more efforts to enable all the peoples of the \nworld, particularly the least developed countries, to \nbenefit from the digital revolution and to acquire \nknowledge. This will require operationalizing and \nimplementing the recommendations and resolutions \nmade by international conferences in our country in \nNovember 2005 to contribute to the building of a \nglobal, more equitable and solidarity-based \ninformation society.  \n The integration of Tunisia in its regional and \ninternational environment is one of the priorities of its \nforeign policy, which endeavours to enhance political \nrelations with brotherly and friendly nations as well \nwith regional and international organizations. Tunisia \nlooks forward to the broadening and diversification of \nthe scope of its cooperation with all its partners in \norder to bring it to the level of an efficient partnership \nbased on mutual respect and common interest. Hence, \nTunisia is constantly striving, with its brotherly \nMaghrebian countries, to complete the formation of the \nMaghreb Arab Union and to consolidate its structures \nand institutions in order to reinforce integration and \ncomplementarity among the peoples of the region.  \nTunisia has equally sought to enhance the \neffectiveness of Arab common action. It seeks to \nupgrade its interaction with the changes and challenges \nconfronting the region and to further the process of \nreform and modernization in this field, in conformity \nwith the decisions and recommendations of the Tunis \nSummit, the Algiers Summit and the Riyadh Summit.  \n On the other hand, Tunisia, being a member of \nArab committees entrusted with Palestinian, Lebanese \nand other issues, is participating effectively in the work \nof those committees for the benefit of Arab causes.  \n As far as Africa is concerned, Tunisia has \nenhanced its relations with African countries and has \nstrengthened cooperation with them. It has made active \nefforts to contribute effectively to the process of \nbuilding the structures and institutions of the African \nUnion and to the consolidation of the fundamentals of \npeace, security and stability in the continent and \nopening promising new horizons for development in \norder to further enhance integration among its peoples.  \n In view of the strategic importance of its relations \nwith the European Union, Tunisia has been constantly \nseeking to advance those ties and to broaden their \nscope, so as to cover all fields of cooperation with the \naim of building a solidarity-based partnership with \nEuropean Union countries based on mutual respect and \ncommon interest.  \n Tunisia also endeavours to strengthen the \nEuro-Mediterranean cooperation process. In this \nconnection, Tunisia has welcomed the initiative \nlaunched by President Nicolas Sarkozy of France for \nestablishing a Mediterranean Union. Tunisia has \nfurther expressed its readiness to contribute to and \nparticipate in shaping the content of such a union and \nin defining its objectives.  \n Since the establishment of the United Nations, \nTunisia has expressed constant faith in the noble \nprinciples and purposes of the Organization. It has \nalways been committed to lending its support to efforts \naimed at creating favourable conditions for appropriate \ncollective responses to global common challenges and \nfor solving the various problems that are a source of \nconcern to the world, as well as establishing solidarity-\nbased cooperation and partnership among all \ncomponents of the international community.  \n From this perspective, Tunisia, which will assume \nchairmanship of the next session of the Conference on \nDisarmament, is determined to work, in coordination \nwith Member States, for the achievement of tangible \nprogress regarding issues on the agenda of the \nConference. In so doing, Tunisia will seek to enhance \nconstructive and positive dialogue on those issues in \norder to achieve the objectives of the Conference and \nto contribute to the consolidation of peace and security \nin the world and to the dissemination of a global \nculture of peace, thus consecrating the noble values \nand principles for which our Organization has been \ncreated.  \n"

        "file_text": "Two days ago, world \nleaders met here in this Hall and made strong \nstatements on the urgent need to address climate \nchange. We heard the Chairman of the \nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, \nMr. Pachauri, present compelling evidence on the state \nof the world climate. He outlined a dire picture of the \nfuture state of the planet if strong and joint action is \nnot taken. We have no time to lose. \n It is imperative that we reach a comprehensive \npost-Kyoto agreement. The new agreement must be \nfirmly anchored in the United Nations, and it must \ninclude all major emitting countries and all major \nsectors. When we meet in Bali in December we should \nagree on the roadmap for the coming negotiations. \n The industrialized countries bear a special \nresponsibility for the current state of our atmosphere. \nTherefore, they must also take special responsibility \nfor bringing the global emissions of greenhouse gases \nback to a sustainable level. Our long-term goal should \nbe to avoid temperature increases above two degrees \nCelsius compared to the pre-industrial level. \n Meeting the challenge of climate change is within \nour reach. However, it requires that our response be \nstrong and coherent. We need to provide the worldwide \nprivate sector with strong incentives for cutting \nemissions. That is why it is essential to put a price on \ncarbon emissions and to expand the carbon market. \n Seven years ago, I was one of the 189 heads of \nState or Government who signed the Millennium \nDeclaration. We undertook a commitment to deliver on \nthe United Nations Millennium Development Goals \n(MDGs). However, unless we make an extra effort, we \nwill not fulfil the promises we made to the people of \nthe world. In particular, we are lagging behind in \nfulfilling the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) \non child and maternal health. Every year almost ten \nmillion children die before the age of five. Many lives \ncan be saved using inexpensive and effective vaccines. \n Norway has contributed to the Global Alliance \nfor Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI) since its \ninception in the year 2000. We have already managed \nto save more than two million lives through this \nalliance. But we need to move beyond vaccination.  \n Each year two million babies die before the sun \nsets on their first day of life. The four million \nnewborns who die in their first month might survive if \nthey were breastfed and had access to antibiotics and \nhealth workers. And not only newborns, but their \nmothers as well. Each year 500,000 women die in \nconnection with childbirth. Simple, affordable \nmeasures can save millions. \n Today Norway, together with other Governments, \nagencies and civil society, launched a global campaign \nto do precisely that: save millions of lives. The \ncampaign's main thrusts are organizing and financing \nsurvival; ensuring that health personnel treat more \npatients and file fewer reports; and changing the \nfinancing mechanism so that treating patients becomes \na source of income rather than a cost for health \nsystems. Today we are launching an advocacy \ncampaign for women and children to ensure that our \nmessage will reach every corner of the world. I am also \npleased to announce that we are building a network of \nglobal leaders to oversee and ensure that the women \nand children will indeed be given priority. Today, let \nme also announce that Norway is pledging $1 billion \nover 10 years to support the Millennium Development \nGoals on child and maternal health.  \n The global campaign that we launched today, \nbuilds directly on the recommendations from the High-\nlevel Panel on System-wide Coherence, which I had \nthe privilege of chairing together with my colleagues \nfrom Pakistan and Mozambique. \n We need a strong and efficient United Nations; \nwe need a United Nations that delivers results; we need \na United Nations that delivers on the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals. Addressing these challenges was \nthe mandate of the Panel. The Panel held meetings in \nmany parts of the world and listened to countries, \nregional groups, citizens groups, voluntary \norganizations and many individuals. In November last \nyear we presented our report (A/61/583) and \nrecommendations to the Secretary-General. They are \nan honest attempt to boost the Organization's ability to \nlive up to its potential. At the heart of our report, we \nrecommend establishing \\\"One United Nations\\\"\u009d in each \ncountry: one leader, one programme, one budget and \none office, wherever feasible. Also - equally \nimportant for a better functioning United Nations: we \nneed a better focused management system at \nHeadquarters level. The Sustainable Development \nBoard aims at precisely that. \n The Panel set out with ambitions driven by a \nsense of responsibility, knowing that our most \nimportant constituency is not the United Nations itself, \nbut those millions of people who do not enjoy the \nprosperity and freedom that many of us take for \ngranted. Yet those people, whose life situation gave \nrise to the Millennium Development Goals, who right \nnow wonder how they will make it through the day - \nit is for the sake of those poor and destitute people that \nwe must have an efficient United Nations, one that is \nwell governed and well funded and that will remain a \nglobal repository of hope. \n That is why we are under an obligation to take a \nfresh look at the way in which we have come to build a \nfragmented United Nations, one that risks being \nweakened, marginalized and less relevant. We have \nworked with the United Nations system to abolish \ndiseases, such as smallpox, and repressive regimes, \nsuch as apartheid. And we continue our struggle to \nabolish poverty, child mortality, torture and inhuman \nand degrading treatment - and to achieve the \nMillennium Development Goals. \n Today more and more people are breaking out of \npoverty. We have never had greater capacities to bridge \nthe gaps between us, but we cannot allow the \ninternational community to waste resources or to work \ntowards the Millennium Development Goals in \nanything but the most effective and rewarding ways. \nWe must focus our work, measure our results and show \nthat development, as organized by the United Nations, \npays high rewards. \n That is why we need to be open-minded, \nrecognizing that the most radical step we can take is to \ndo nothing. I am pleased to see the progress being \nmade in the eight pilot countries, where the \\\"One \nUnited Nations' model is being implemented in \npractice. I am also pleased to see that these countries \nhave adopted different \\\"One United Nations' processes \nand models that are tailored to each country's specific \nsituation. This shows that there is no blueprint. \n United Nations funds and programmes operating \nin the field are already responding. Increasingly, we \nsee better coordination and stronger leadership. I \ncommend the United Nations bodies that have adopted \nthe new guiding principles, and I appeal to the others \nto follow suit.  \n The Panel's report sets out a way forward. The \nUnited Nations has not broken down, but it requires \nmaintenance; therefore, the Panel did not propose \nrevolutionary changes. Rather, we put forward some \npractical, achievable and effective measures, building \non the thrust of decisions already made by Member \nStates. New gender architecture is urgently needed. I \nurge Member States to demonstrate the required vision \nand leadership. This will be an important task for this \nGeneral Assembly.  \n Norway prides itself on being a friend of the \nUnited Nations. We support multilateral solutions to \ncommon problems, but a true friend does not refrain \nfrom speaking out when change and improvement are \nrequired. We believe in international development \ncooperation; we believe in a strong and efficient \nUnited Nations; therefore, we would like to reform the \nUnited Nations.  \n"

        "file_text": "I offer my delegation\u2019s \ncongratulations to the President for his election as the \nPresident of the General Assembly at its sixty-second \nsession and assure him of our support and cooperation. \nMy delegation would also like to convey our \nappreciation to his predecessor, Sheikha Haya Rashed \nAl-Khalifa, for the able manner in which she guided \nthe work of the Assembly at the sixty-first session. We \nalso convey our appreciation to the Secretary-General, \nMr. Ban Ki-moon, for the excellent leadership he \nprovides to our Organization.  \n We are gratified that climate change and the \nMillennium Development Goals are among the top \npriorities of this session\u2019s presidency. The irony of \nclimate change is that its worst impact will be on the \ndeveloping world, particularly small and island \ndeveloping countries, who are least responsible for the \nproblem. As complex as the issue is, climate change is \ninextricably linked to development and the debate \nengenders issues of equity, fairness and the right of \ncountries to grow economically. The challenges of \nclimate change must, therefore, be addressed within the \nframework of sustainable development bearing in mind \nthe principle of common but differentiated \nresponsibilities. \n Bhutan has two major concerns about climate \nchange. First is the potential adverse impact on \nagriculture, which is the mainstay of 79 per cent of our \npopulation. Second, more serious and immediate, is the \nrate at which Himalayan glaciers are receding. Bhutan \nhas approximately 3,000 glacial lakes, of which 24 \nhave been identified as potentially dangerous. Floods \ncaused by glacial lake outbursts have caused \ndevastation in the past, and future outbursts will be far \nworse. Our capacity to carry out research, monitor \ndevelopments, forecast outbursts and take mitigation \nmeasures is severely constrained by a lack of scientific, \ntechnical and financial resources. \n In the Millennium Declaration of 2000, world \nleaders undertook to channel the fruits of globalization \nto benefit all people and lift one sixth of humanity \nfrom extreme poverty. At the midpoint between the \nadoption of the Millennium Development Goals \n(MDGs) and the target date of 2015, reports, including \nthe 2007 Millennium Development Goals Report, \nprovide a mixed picture at best. The Secretary-General \nhas rightly said that the world does not need new \npromises to achieve the MDGs. What is needed is \nurgent and concerted action by political leaders and \nstakeholders to meet, in their entirety, the commitments \nmade in the Millennium Declaration and in the \nMonterrey Consensus adopted at the 2002 International \nConference on Financing for Development and at the \n2005 World Summit. \n The 2006 midterm comprehensive global review \nof the implementation of the Programme of Action for \nthe Least Developed Countries for the Decade 2001-\n2010 revealed that the least developed countries were \nunlikely to achieve all the goals and objectives of the \nProgramme of Action, and therefore the MDGs, if \ntrends continued. It is the moral and political \nimperative of the international community to help the \nleast developed countries through strong supportive \nglobal programmes, measures and policies. However, \none year later, the situation remains largely unchanged. \n Geographical constraints present enormous \nchallenges to landlocked developing countries. Bhutan \nis working closely with the group of landlocked \ndeveloping countries to address those challenges \nthrough the cooperation of transit countries and the \ninternational community. The needs of the landlocked \ncountries are well-documented and there is a road map \nfor global partnership set out in the Almaty Programme \nof Action. \n Bhutan has made tremendous socio-economic \nprogress during the past 45 years. However, there are \nmany hurdles to overcome before we can stand on our \nown feet and be self-reliant. We are determined to \nachieve the cherished goal of self-reliance at the \nearliest time possible. Until then, we will have to rely \non external assistance and support. Here, I would like \nto record my country\u2019s appreciation to bilateral and \nmultilateral donors. \n We hope that under the leadership of the \nPresident the Assembly will undertake results-oriented \nintergovernmental negotiations on Security Council \nreform in order to bring that issue to its logical \nconclusion. As we have stated before, Bhutan supports \nIndia, Japan and their G4 group partners for permanent \nmembership. We also support Africa\u2019s claim for \npermanent seats. \n My country has as much interest in the work of \nthe Security Council as others and would like to see it \nadapt to current demands and realities. Since becoming \na Member in 1971, my country has served in a number \nof important bodies of the United Nations, but not in \nthe Security Council. We are confident of our capacity \nto contribute directly to the work of the Council. \nBhutan therefore announced in 1999 its candidature for \na non-permanent seat for the period 2013-2014. If \nrealized, Bhutan would gain entry into the Council \nafter four decades in the United Nations. It is our \nsincere hope that the General Assembly will support \nBhutan\u2019s candidacy during the elections in 2012. \n Terrorism strikes at the very foundation of \nhumanism and cannot be justified under any \ncircumstances. This evil must be countered through \ncooperation at the bilateral, regional and global levels. \nAt the global level, greater efforts must be made to \nimplement the United Nations Global Counter-\nTerrorism Strategy and conclude a comprehensive \nconvention on international terrorism. Within our \nregion, the leaders of the South Asian Association for \nRegional Cooperation, at their 14th summit meeting, \nheld in New Delhi in April 2007, reaffirmed their \ncommitment to collectively fight terrorism. That is a \npositive development, but more needs to be done to rid \nthe region of this menace. \n Allow me to briefly apprise this body of \ndevelopments in my country. The development model \npursued by Bhutan is based on the philosophy of \n\u201cGross National Happiness\u201d, a concept conceived by \nour fourth King, His Majesty Jigme Singye \nWangchuck, in the early 1970s. Gross National \nHappiness is premised on the belief that, if happiness is \nthe ultimate desire of every individual, then it is the \nresponsibility and purpose of the State to create \nconditions that enable citizens to realize this desire. We \nare glad that the concept of Gross National Happiness \nis drawing increasing global attention and we stand \nready to share our experiences in this regard. \n Bhutan is now set on the irreversible path to a \nfull-fledged democratic constitutional monarchy. The \npeople of Bhutan are looking forward to 2008, when \nparliamentary democracy will be introduced. Next \nyear, Bhutan will also celebrate the formal coronation \nof His Majesty Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck and \nthe centenary of the Wangchuck dynasty. As we stand \nat the threshold of these momentous developments, the \npeople of Bhutan look to our friends and well-wishers \nand the global community for support and inspiration. \n Before I conclude, allow me to refer to the \ncomments made yesterday by the honourable Foreign \nMinister of Nepal regarding the problem of the people \nin camps in Nepal. As her comments were less than \nobjective, it is important that misperceptions be \nclarified. It is disingenuous on her part to blame \nBhutan for the lack of progress in our bilateral talks \nwhen it is widely known that disruptions to the \nbilateral process resulted from the political instability \nin her country, which were accompanied by frequent \nchanges of Government and positions on the issue. \nBhutan for its part has always been committed to the \nbilateral process and has not deviated from the \nunderstandings and agreements reached between the \ntwo countries. \n The issue is a highly complex one that does not \nlend itself to conventional solutions. The genesis of the \nproblem lies in illegal immigration. The camps were \nestablished without any screening procedures when \nonly 304 people, claiming to be refugees from Bhutan, \narrived in eastern Nepal. Screening procedures were \nput in place by the Office of the United Nations High \nCommissioner for Refugees only after two and a half \nyears, and by then the number had reached its present \nproportion. In view of the complexity of the issue, the \ntwo Governments had agreed that the bilateral process \nwas the only way to find a solution. In this regard, we \nappreciate the offer of the United States of America \nand other countries for third country resettlement, as it \nwould help address that humanitarian problem. \n While the Royal Government remains committed \nto the bilateral process, it has serious security concerns \nwith Maoist infiltration of the camps and the formation \nof several radical groups, who have publicly stated \ntheir objective of destabilizing Bhutan and disrupting \nthe country\u2019s first parliamentary elections next year. \n In conclusion, I would like to once again convey \nmy delegation\u2019s full support to the President and wish \nthe General Assembly every success at it sixty-second \nsession.

        "file_text": "It is my pleasure to join \nwith the preceding speakers in congratulating you on \nyour election to preside over the sixty-second session \nof the United Nations General Assembly. The Barbados \ndelegation extends its appreciation to your predecessor, \nHer Excellency Ms. Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa, for her \nleadership of the sixty-first session and also takes the \nopportunity to offer its formal welcome to Secretary-\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon. \n Since its independence in 1966, Barbados has \nbeen actively participating in the formulation of \ninternational policy on a number of issues of universal \nconcern and promoting the centrality of the United \nNations in the global development debate. We are \nproud to have made our contribution to the critical \nnegotiating processes on the development agenda. \nMuch work, however, needs to be done. \n Permit me to use this occasion to identify those \noutstanding areas to which Barbados accords \noutstanding importance and where we consider that \nurgent results-oriented action must be taken by the \ninternational community. I refer specifically to the \neffective and comprehensive implementation of the \nglobal partnership for development as set out in the \nMillennium Declaration, the Monterrey Consensus, the \nJohannesburg Plan of Implementation, the Barbados \nProgramme of Action and the Mauritius International \nStrategy; the provision of stable, predictable and \nadequate financial resources for the implementation of \ndevelopment commitments; the creation of a more \nenabling international environment that would \nfacilitate the achievement of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) by a majority of \ndeveloping countries, particularly the most vulnerable \namong them; the recognition by the international \ncommunity of the importance of providing continued \nsupport for the needs of middle-income developing \ncountries; the implementation of existing global \nagreements on climate change as well as the early \nadoption of an ambitious and comprehensive post-\nKyoto agreement; the protection and sustainable \nmanagement of the Caribbean Sea; the successful \nconclusion of the Doha round of trade negotiations, \nwith development as a central component of its \noutcome; the promotion of international cooperation on \ntax matters; the need for United Nations reinforcement \nof its commitment to assist all Member States in their \nefforts to combat the problems associated with the \ntrafficking in and trans-shipment of illegal drugs, as \nwell as the consequent increase in violent crime; and, \nfinally, the need for progress on Security Council \nreform and for sustained emphasis on revitalizing the \nEconomic and Social Council. \n The gap between promises and implementation \ncontinues to frustrate our achievement of the full range \nof internationally agreed development goals. The level \nof international cooperation and resources committed \nby development partners has been woefully inadequate. \nSmall island developing States, for example, have had, \nto date, to assume the majority portion of the \nimplementation burden of the Barbados Programme of \nAction and the Mauritius Strategy, despite the fact that \nthese goals were determined by the consensus of the \nentire international community. Similarly, the needs of \nmiddle-income developing countries were not \nadequately addressed through the Monterrey \nConsensus on Financing for Development, and they \ncontinue to be deprived of the vital development \nsupport they require to complete the transition. Next \nyear\u2019s Follow-up International Conference on \nFinancing for Development must seek to redress this \nsituation. \n There remain only eight years before we reach \nour target date of 2015 for the achievement of the \nMDGs. We must identify effective strategies to \ntransform Member States\u2019 political commitment to the \nMDGs into results-oriented, concrete action. We must \nforge strategic partnerships, not only within and across \nnational borders that encompass varying levels of \ndevelopment and economic prosperity, but also among \nthe private sector, the public sector and civil society. \n It can no longer be denied that climate change is \nan alarming phenomenon that requires focused \nattention and urgent and decisive global action by the \ninternational community. I warmly commend the \nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his initiative to \nconvene the high-level event on climate change on  \n24 September. The presence of so large a number of \nheads of State and Government at that important \nsession is a clear indication that the grave dimensions \nof the problem have been recognized and the need for \nbold political leadership fully understood. \n If we continue to delay action, we will be judged \nharshly, and deservedly so, for callously placing the \ninheritance of future generations in greater jeopardy. \nFor today, we may have choices; tomorrow, they will \nnot. \n Barbados is a small, low-lying island State, \nhighly dependent on its coastal and marine \nenvironment for its economic activity. For its people, \nthe stakes could not be higher. Climate change not only \nrepresents the most serious challenge to our sustainable \ndevelopment, it also threatens our very survival. Prime \nMinister Arthur of Barbados said at the 24 September \nmeeting that there exists no reason   scientific nor \npolitical   for delaying an immediate response to this \nglobal crisis. \n Barbados and other members of the Caribbean \nCommunity have taken steps, at the national and \nregional levels, to develop and implement climate \nchange mitigation and adaptation strategies and plans, \nlargely from our own resources. However, the most \neffective unilateral adaptation strategies will be futile \nin the absence of decisive global action to reduce \nharmful greenhouse gases emissions and to address \nclimate change in a comprehensive manner. Our \nleaders have underscored the imperative of collective \naction to address climate change, with the United \nNations at the centre of the search for lasting solutions \nto that problem. In December, our negotiators in Bali \nmust seize this moment in time. \n The international community has yet to complete \nthe Doha Round of multilateral trade negotiations, with \nan outcome that has development at its core. While \ntrade liberalization can assist in that process, much \nmore is required if sustainable economic development \nis to be achieved in the developing world. We firmly \nbelieve in a multilateral process, which will not only \ncater to the aspirations of the more developed \ncountries, but will also address the needs of developing \ncountries, especially those with small, vulnerable \neconomies such as ours. I urge the international \ncommunity to proceed with the multilateral trade \nnegotiations with a view to reaching a successful and \nmutually beneficial outcome. \n Barbados and the other countries of the \nCaribbean Community (CARICOM) are neither major \nsuppliers of nor demand markets for illicit drugs. Yet, \nbecause of our geographical position and external \nfactors that are largely beyond our control, we find \nourselves affected by the illicit trafficking in drugs, \nsmall arms and light weapons and their constant \ncompanion, transnational organized crime. As small \ncountries with limited resources and severe \nvulnerabilities, we depend on international cooperation \nto counter those threats. The presence of the Caribbean \nRegional Office of the United Nations Office on Drugs \nand Crime (UNODC) in Barbados, which served a total \nof 29 States and territories and provided significant \ntechnical assistance, was extremely important to the \nCaribbean region. \n We are deeply concerned about the decision taken \nunilaterally in Vienna to close that Office, and we are \nnot at all convinced that it will make our region safer \nfrom these very real threats. On the contrary, the \nstudies published earlier this year by the UNODC and \nthe World Bank, on drugs, crime and development in \nCentral America and the Caribbean, clearly \ndemonstrate the need for an enhanced international \neffort in the region. It is our sincere hope that this \nunfortunate decision will be reversed as a matter of \nurgency and that the United Nations will once again \nengage the Caribbean region, through the reopening of \nthe Regional Office in Barbados. \n The issue of reform of the Security Council has \nbeen under consideration by the General Assembly for \nseveral years. Member States have expressed their \nviews, and group positions have been formulated, but \nfirm decisions have eluded us. It is now time for \npolitical compromise in the negotiation of an \nacceptable solution. Barbados will continue to \nparticipate actively in this process. \n Gender equity and the empowerment of women \nare critical to development at both the national and \ninternational levels. There is a need to improve the way \nin which gender is treated within the context of the \nUnited Nations. It is crucial that the proposal to \nestablish a new gender architecture be further \ndiscussed at the intergovernmental level and that all \nconcerns be addressed and taken into consideration \nbefore a final decision is made. Any new structure \nmust give due prominence not only to normative and \nadvocacy issues, but also to issues of development, \noperational activities and adequate resources. \n The deepening of the regional integration process \nis critical to the ability of CARICOM countries to \nrespond to the challenges and opportunities presented \nby changes in the global community. Having \nestablished the Single Market in 2006, our efforts are \nnow focused on mechanisms to bring the Single \nEconomy into effect through a process of phased \nimplementation. The Single Economy will facilitate \nfurther integration of our production and financial \nsectors, the coordination of our economic sectoral \npolicies, the convergence of macroeconomic policies, \nthe building of a regional capital market and the \nharmonization of monetary and fiscal policies. \n Functional cooperation has been a central theme \nof the Caribbean Community since its inception. We \nbelieve that, as small nations with so much in common, \nour best means of advancement lies in sharing our \nresources, experience and expertise to address mutual \nconcerns. Health, education and, more recently, \nsecurity are our foremost areas of resource pooling and \nresearch. Our region has the distinction of being one of \nthe first to have eradicated polio and smallpox. A \nfortnight ago, the region convened its first summit to \nspecifically address chronic non-communicable \ndiseases, which have become the major causes of \nmorbidity and mortality. \n A stable, peaceful and prosperous Haiti is \nessential for the effective functioning of the Caribbean \nCommunity to which it belongs. There is a continuing \nurgent need for substantial support from the \ninternational community to assist Haiti in consolidating \nand strengthening the commendable progress that it has \nmade to date. A prime requirement is the further \nextension by the Security Council of the mandate of \nthe United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti to \ninclude a focus on peacebuilding, judicial reform, \ninstitutional support for the provision of basic services, \nand border management. We must directly address the \nhumanitarian and socio-economic needs of Haiti if the \nmajority of the population is to be lifted out of poverty \nand if the underlying preconditions for threats to peace \nand security in the country are to be removed. \n This year, many countries around the world, \nincluding Barbados, commemorated the two-hundredth \nanniversary of the abolition of the trans-Atlantic slave \ntrade. The horrors of the slave trade   particularly the \nnotorious middle passage   were of such huge scale \nand intensity that it can truly be considered one of the \nearliest crimes against humanity. That experience must \nnever be repeated. \n To bring closure to the criminal activity that was \nracial slavery, we also need to bring equity to the \nemancipation process. Addressing the controversial \nissue of reparations is essential to the attainment of \nthose objectives. This is not the first time that a \ndiscussion on reparations has taken place and that \ndecisions have been made. During the nineteenth \ncentury, Europeans accepted and enforced multiple \nforms of reparations. \n Delivering the Wilberforce Lecture in the United \nKingdom earlier this year, Prime Minister Arthur \nproposed the establishment of a William Wilberforce \neducational fund. Barbados encourages all those \ncountries that participated in and benefited from this \niniquitous practice to support that important initiative. \nIn so doing, they will be paying tribute to the courage \nand the moral convictions of all those who campaigned \ntirelessly for the end of the slave trade and of slavery, \nand at the same time they will be supporting the \ncontinuous evolutionary experiment in human relations \nrepresented by the ethnic pluralism of Caribbean \nsocieties. \n In international affairs, a multilateral approach is \nthe best means for countries to fully and effectively \naddress the world\u2019s most pressing problems. It is our \ncollective responsibility to make sure that this \nOrganization, the epicentre of multilateralism, is \nreformed and revitalized to make it more accountable   \na transparent and effective instrument in the service of \nthe development efforts of all its Members. \n Development is the key to sustainable \ninternational peace and security. In our quest to \nguarantee the primacy of development on the global \nagenda, we must make certain that the United Nations \nis sufficiently well funded to meet the needs of the \npoorest and most vulnerable among us, to support the \naspirations of middle-income developing countries and \nto facilitate the transition to developed-country status \nof those who are poised to make that transition. The \ndisproportionate allocation of regular budget resources \naway from the development agenda must be reversed \nwithout further delay. \n There can no longer be a deficit in the world\u2019s \ndevelopment performance. We must all demonstrate the \npolitical will necessary to ensure that. It is a task from \nwhich we are not at liberty to abstain. \n"

        "file_text": "Let me take this \nopportunity to express our strong support for the \npeople of Burma in their struggle for a democratic \nfuture. We strongly urge the Burmese Government to \ninitiate a peaceful dialogue, resist all violence and \nrespect the human rights of the Burmese people, not \nleast their freedom of expression and assembly. \n There is little doubt   and this has been \nhighlighted by all speakers during the last few days   \nthat we, the international community, the United \nNations, face major challenges in the years ahead. \nWhen addressing them, we should also be aware of the \nprogress that has been achieved in the world in recent \ndecades. \n The accelerated globalization process has brought \nenormous benefits to many hundreds of millions of \npeople, not least in the emerging economies. Today, \nnearly a third of the world\u2019s population live in \ncountries where economic growth is about 10 per cent \na year, and we seem to be well on our way towards \nmeeting that important part of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals that will reduce by half the number \nof people living in absolute poverty around the world. \nFrom a historical perspective, that is amazing \nprogress. Never before in human history have so many \nbeen lifted out of absolute poverty in such a short \nspace of time. There is no room for complacency, \nhowever. We must make globalization a force for good, \nfor open societies, open economies and an open world \nfor everyone on our planet. We must redouble our \nefforts to bring the Doha Development Round to a \nsuccessful conclusion. Sustainable economic growth, a \nvibrant private sector and a more open international \ntrading system are needed if we are to achieve the \ngoals we have set for eradicating poverty in the world. \n Aid for trade is a crucial complement to the \nopening up of markets for many countries. The \ndeveloping countries of the world represent far too \nsmall a share of world trade. We must live up to the \ninternational commitments on development assistance \nand ensure that development cooperation becomes \nmore efficient. That is the joint responsibility of all \ndonors and all partner countries. The Swedish \nGovernment has initiated extensive reforms aimed at \ncreating a new Swedish development assistance policy \ncharacterized by quality, efficiency and results in terms \nof reduced poverty and more democratic societies. We \nmust now   as was highlighted last week   \naccelerate our efforts to address the challenge of \nclimate change. The Swedish Government has \nlaunched a Commission on Climate Change and \nDevelopment to address risk reduction, adaptation and \nclimate-proofing development. We must make a \ndedicated mutual effort to meet the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals. The fact that we are making \nsubstantial progress on all of them globally \ndemonstrates that progress is indeed possible. \n Human rights, security and development go hand \nin hand. Respect for human rights is necessary to \nachieve security and development, and those three \nelements are mutually reinforcing. Our protection of \nany individual anywhere is the protection of all \nindividuals everywhere. \n The death penalty must be abolished all over the \nworld. It contravenes the very notion of human rights. \nEven in that area, the world is making progress, but 25 \ncountries still sentence people to death. Six countries \nare responsible for more than 90 per cent of all \nexecutions worldwide. We all know who they are and \nexpect them to take steps to abolish the death penalty. \n The links between security and development, \nincluding the need to combine State-building efforts \nand peace-support operations for long-lasting results, \nplace new demands on the international community. \nThe United Nations must learn from and build on the \nrecent experiences of a number of challenging but \nsuccessful large-scale missions that integrate military \nand civilian components. We need to improve \ncoordination of international efforts in the field, for \ninstance in Afghanistan. \n There are many challenges that remain to be \ntackled if we are to make the world a better place. \nPerhaps the most important is how we should best \naddress the present threats to the existing non-\nproliferation regime. Were there to be one new State \nwith nuclear weapons, the danger is that another would \nsoon follow. Shortly, those weapons might well be out \nof any State\u2019s control. The risk of nuclear terrorism \nwould be a very real one. That must be prevented. Our \nchildren deserve to live in a world safe from the threat \nof nuclear war and of weapons of mass destruction \nfalling into the hands of terrorists. Those weapons \nthreaten the very existence of mankind. \n To prevent that, the nuclear Powers have a duty to \nlive up to their responsibilities. To neglect is to invite \nfailure. They need to demonstrate their readiness to \nsubstantially reduce their nuclear arsenals. Those \nweapons are of no use in deterring the adversaries we \nmight face if the non-proliferation regime is eroded or \ncollapses. It is a question of self-interest and far-\nsighted statesmanship. \n But we must also address the urgent political \nissues that we are confronted with. Although the \nnumbers of wars and conflicts have continued to \ndecline, we should be acutely aware of the dangers of \nconflicts rapidly exploding, fusing together and \nunravelling the progress we have seen. Let me address \ntwo of those: the situation in the Middle East and the \nconflicts in Africa. \n The Israeli-Palestinian conflict has to end with a \npeaceful settlement negotiated by the parties, resulting \nin the emergence of an independent, democratic and \nviable Palestinian State living side by side in peace and \nsecurity with Israel and other neighbours. Restoring \npeace and economic growth in the Middle East requires \nparallel action by the Israelis and the Palestinians. \nNothing is more important for the long-term security of \nIsrael than the creation of a truly viable Palestinian \nState. That will require freedom of movement and \naccess to be significantly improved in the West Bank \nand Gaza. Prime Minister Olmert and President Abbas \nrecognize each other as partners for peace. That \nprovides an opening that we should all do our utmost \nto support. \n It is therefore now time for a true peace process, \nand not of the incremental sort that has been tried so \nmany times before. It is now time to achieve the peace \nthat is the common aspiration of the vast majority of \nIsraelis and Palestinians alike, as well as of the \ninternational community. \n We urge the leaders of Israel and Palestine to \nmove forward towards a comprehensive settlement. \nThe international meeting this autumn is of crucial \nimportance. But the challenges of the Middle East are \nnot limited to that conflict.  \n We are convinced that we must do more to \nencourage reconciliation and reconstruction in Iraq \nafter the horrible brutalities of the last few decades. We \nmust do much more to assist and protect the more than \n4 million Iraqis who have left their homes.  \n Iran still refuses to accept the obligations laid \ndown by the Security Council. Iran has to convince us \nof the peaceful nature of its nuclear programme. \n The conflicts on the Horn of Africa, stretching \nfrom Ethiopia and Eritrea to Somalia, the Sudan, Chad \nand the Central African Republic, cause thousands \nupon thousands of deaths as well as untold human \nsuffering for the survivors. National leaders on the \nHorn should rise to the challenge and demonstrate their \ncommitment to peace and reconciliation. The failure of \nEthiopia and Eritrea to resolve the quite \nstraightforward demarcation of their common border, \neight years after their commitment to do so, is a \nworrying signal, not only for these two countries, but \nalso for the region as a whole. \n In the Sudan, a process of democratization is of \nparamount importance to tackle the core problems and \nto achieve reconciliation. We must focus on support for \nthe implementation of the Comprehensive Peace \nAgreement as well as the renewed peace effort for \nDarfur that will take place in Tripoli at the end of the \nmonth. \n The situation in eastern Chad is worrying. We are \nimpressed by the important humanitarian work carried \nout by local and international non-governmental \norganizations. It is apparent that we must do more to \nprotect and assist refugees, internally displaced persons \nand other civilians affected by the conflicts of the \nregion, as well as support the United Nations-led \nhumanitarian efforts on both sides of the border. \n How can we ever achieve true progress if \nwomen\u2019s crucial role in peacebuilding and \ndevelopment is not recognized? Gender equality and \nwomen\u2019s rights, participation, influence and \nempowerment are key goals in themselves, and are also \ncrucial for sustainable poverty reduction. \n Challenges like these show the urgent need for \nworld leaders to accept shared responsibility for our \ncommon future. Sweden addresses these challenges in \nclose cooperation with its European Union partners. \nWe need a strong   and reformed   United Nations \nto bring us all together. A better world is within our \nreach. \n"

        "file_text": "Allow  me to congratulate the President on his assumption of \nthe presidency of this session of the General Assembly \nand wish him every success in leading its deliberations. \nI should also like to extend my thanks to his \npredecessor Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa for her \ngood management of the deliberations of the previous \nsession. I would also like to express my sincere thanks \nto the Secretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for his \nunrelenting efforts since he assumed his office to \nadvance the work of the Organization and activate its \nrole in the service of international peace and security. \n The President returned to the Chair. \n The Middle East region, of which Jordan is an \nintegral part, continues to face formidable challenges \nstemming from the failure to make any progress \ntowards solving its main regional issues. Jordan, \nhowever, has realized that these challenges should not \nbecome a justification for abandoning its national \npriorities regarding political and economic reform and \nfor achieving the highest degree of openness and \nparticipation. Therefore, Jordan has adopted a national \nstrategy that strikes a balance between continuing to \neffect reform and protecting its national security. \n Jordan has also continued to deal with regional \nissues on the basis of its belief that it is necessary to \nreach just solutions by peaceful means and in a way \nthat protects the rights of all concerned and that \nachieves regional stability. Jordan is firmly convinced \nthat the use of military force and the imposition of \nunilateral solutions lead only to the aggravation of \nproblems, increase the suffering of the people and \nthreaten regional and international stability. \n The Palestinian question, which is at the core of \nthe Middle East conflict, is now at a decisive \ncrossroads: either the regional parties and the \ninternational community succeed in making real and \ntangible progress and reach a just and lasting solution \nwithin a reasonable and agreed-upon time frame, or the \nentire region will be swept into extremism and anarchy, \nwhich will be a grave threat to world peace and \nsecurity. Therefore, the international meeting \nscheduled to be held before the end of this year may be \nthe last chance to make that progress. This makes it \nimperative for the United States, which called for that \nconference, the members of the International Quartet \nand the regional parties to prepare for it well, ensuring \nthat final status issues between Palestine and Israel are \nseriously discussed and in a way that will allow real \nprogress to be made on those issues and a lasting \nagreement to be reached and implemented quickly \nwithin a time frame agreed upon by the two parties. \n The situation in the region cannot withstand the \ncontinuation of developments that do not allow for real \nprogress. The holding of international and regional \nmeetings and negotiations should not be an end in itself \nbut rather a means to an end, namely reaching a real \npeace, accepted and preserved by the peoples of the \nregion. Palestinian-Israeli negotiations have been going \non for a long time. The whole world knows that records \nof those negotiations contain alternatives that provide \nsolutions for final status issues. What is needed now is \nthe political will to reach an agreement instead of \nlooking for pretexts and prolonging the negotiations.  \n Israel will never enjoy the security it seeks and \nthe Middle East region will not enjoy stability unless \nthe Palestinian people recover their national rights \nthrough the establishment of an independent, \ncontiguous and viable Palestinian state in the \nPalestinian territories occupied in 1967, including East \nJerusalem, and unless other Arab occupied territories \nare returned. The current situation in the Palestinian \nterritories is not at all in harmony with the wish to \nachieve peace. In order to give the impression of \nhonest movement towards peace, settlement activities \nmust stop immediately, as must tampering with the \nstatus of East Jerusalem, including stopping all \nexcavations in the Jerusalem holy sanctuary at Haram \nal-Sharif and putting an end to all practices that violate \ninternational law, in particular the Fourth Geneva \nConvention. \n Achievement of the desired progress requires a \nvast change to the tragic situation experienced by the \nPalestinians living in the occupied territories. There is \nan immediate need to revive the Palestinian economy \nin a manner that would lead to launching investment, \ncreating vital projects and providing work \nopportunities. That revival will not materialize unless \nthe Palestinians enjoy freedom of movement, which \nrequires ending the closures, removing security \nroadblocks and stopping military operations. It is also \nimperative to enable the Palestinian National Authority, \nled by President Mahmoud Abbas and his legitimate \nGovernment, to rebuild its institutions so as to succeed \nin executing its national programmes, which deserve \nfinancial support from the international community. \n A united and stable Iraq constitutes an essential \ncomponent of balance and stability in the region. While \nJordan welcomes the adoption of Security Council \nresolution 1770 (2007), it supports the United Nations \nplaying a central role in ensuring reconciliation and \nstability in that country. The preservation of any \nachievements on the security front will be \naccomplished only within an appropriate political \nenvironment, and this will necessitate real national \nreconciliation that will guarantee the participation of \nall segments of the Iraqi people in a political process \nbased on reviving Iraqi nationalism rather than \nsectarianism and ethnicity. It must be founded on the \nbasis of the unity of the State and the sole right of the \nState to maintain security and ban militias from \nencroaching on that exclusive right. Moreover, we \nmust prevent any interference in Iraq\u2019s internal affairs, \nwhilst implementing what has been agreed upon, \nincluding a review of the Constitution and other laws \nand the building of national security and government \ninstitutions. \n The fact that huge numbers of Iraqis have been \nforced to leave their country puts a tremendous burden \non neighbouring countries, including Jordan. Jordan \ncontinues to host hundreds of thousands of Iraqis, with \nall the pressures that this imposes on Jordan\u2019s \neconomy, resources and infrastructure, with little help \nfrom the international community. While we call on the \ninternational community to stand by us in dealing with \nthis huge burden, we believe that a lasting solution to \nthis problem lies in restoring stability to Iraq, so that \nits citizens can return to their country and contribute to \nits reconstruction.  \n Jordan and the Arab Group condemn the \nassassinations that have taken place in Lebanon, the \nlatest of which being the assassination of member of \nParliament Antoine Ghanem, a few days ago. These \nassassinations reflect the dangerous situation in that \ncountry and highlight the need for the international \ncommunity to take a firm stand in putting an end to \nthese grave violations of Lebanese sovereignty and to \ntake all measures to stop any foreign interference in its \ninternal affairs. This will ensure that the Lebanese \npeople will find appropriate solutions through their \nconstitutional institutions so as to ensure internal \nlegitimacy, including the holding of presidential \nelections in accordance with the Constitution and \nwithin the time frame provided therein. \n Jordan is working today within the Group of \nEleven, which was launched at the initiative of His \nMajesty King Abdullah II to establish economic \ncooperation and support the development process of \nlower-middle income countries. We look forward to \nworking with other States and groups of States, \nincluding, in particular, the Group of Eight (G-8), in \norder to establish cooperation that will enable the \nGroup of Eleven members to preserve their economic \naccomplishments and achieve a breakthrough that will \nlead to success in attaining sustainable development. \n Confronting extremism and terrorism requires \nmore effective international cooperation as well as \nactivating channels of cultural and religious dialogue, \nespecially within the United Nations system. At the \nsame time, there is an urgent need to refrain from \nIslamophobia and from inciting animosity against this \ntolerant divine religion. Today\u2019s world requires a more \neffective United Nations role in addressing \ninternational challenges, such as human rights, \narmaments, climate change, terrorism, international \ncrime, poverty, hunger, infectious diseases, and \nincreasing factional, sectarian and ethnic conflicts. In \nthis context, we emphasize the importance of building \nupon what has been achieved, and we call for \nadvancing the process of reform of the United Nations \nand its agencies in order to enable them to enhance \ntheir performance. We view the reform process as vital \nand of the highest priority. Jordan will continue to play \na constructive role in this area and will continue to \noffer reasonable and applicable visions, especially \nwithin the context of reforming the work mechanisms \nof the Security Council. \n Finally, I assure the Assembly that Jordan will \nkeep its commitments to the achievement of \ninternational peace and security. The size of the \nJordanian forces participating in peacekeeping \noperations and their geographically wide deployment \nreflect the actual role of Jordan in the United Nations \nsystem and reflect also its political will to help \naccomplish the mission of the Organization. We take \nthis commitment very seriously and place the \nresources, professionalism and discipline of our armed \nforces at the service of international peace and security. \n"

        "file_text": "Allow \nme at the outset to express my sincerest \ncongratulations to Mr. Srgjan Kerim on his assumption \nof the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-\nsecond session. Argentina welcomes the new \nSecretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, and expresses its \nsupport for his efforts at the head of the United \nNations.  \n As in previous years, we have come to the \nGeneral Assembly with the aim of revitalizing this \nworld body and with the firm belief that this will \nensure the effectiveness of international law in settling \ndisputes, thus successfully dealing with any threats to \npeace.  \n The world is facing problems. The only hope we \nhave of resolving them lies in respect for \nmultilateralism, support for local customs, observance \nof international norms and conventions by all \ncountries, and, of course, the full realization of human \nrights. \n For each individual country, and for the world as \na whole, peace will be possible only if we promote \nequality and work to combat poverty and \nmarginalization. The world cannot and must not be a \nplace where violations of human rights are everywhere. \nPeaceful coexistence is strengthened and maintained \nthrough true solidarity between nations based upon a \nconcept of humanity that goes beyond the purely \nmilitary or the predominantly unilateral. \n Our international policy is based on the values of \nrepresentative democracy, sovereignty of the people, \nrespect for fundamental human rights, and the active \nupholding of international peace and security. Those \nprinciples are shared by the vast majority of the \nArgentine people. They help to focus the Government\u2019s \nactivities and are reflected in the decisions taken by the \nArgentine Republic at the international level.  \n We firmly support the construction of more just \nand equitable societies that distribute more equitably \nthe benefits of economic growth. We know that each \ncountry must have the right to seek out its own \ndevelopment model, without external pressure. \n The past few years have been very testing for us. \nConsiderable efforts have been made to rescue a nation \nthat barely five years ago was in the throes of an \nunprecedented social and economic crisis. At the time, \nmany people thought that recovery might be \nimpossible. But day by day, with a great deal of effort \nand humility, we revived production in a country \nburdened by a foreign debt that threatened our future \nwith its conditions and constraints. \n Argentina \u2014 a developing country which once \ndemonstrated that it is truly possible to climb the social \nladder; a country of immigrants where workers once \nsucceeded in sending their children to university; a \ncountry once without illiteracy and having almost \nbanished child mortality \u2014 had been reduced to a \ncountry of workers demoralized by unemployment, \nchildren begging in the streets instead of going to \nschool, and the elderly living off miniscule pensions \nand becoming dependent on their children and \ngrandchildren. \n Our country\u2019s coffers had been emptied owing to \nthe rigid application of the rules of the International \nMonetary Fund (IMF). As a corollary, there was \nviolence in the streets, and Argentina experienced an \ninstitutional crisis, with presidents lasting only days. \nFor the first time, Argentina sent off its own children \ninto an unprecedented economic exile.  \n Today the Argentine State has won its autonomy \nand itself administers the variables of its \nmacroeconomy as best it can in the current \ninternational environment. It pursues a sound, \ndisciplined and predictable economic policy within a \nstable and democratic framework.  \n Our capacity for revitalization has allowed us, \neven without receiving funding, to begin cancelling our \nnet debt with international organizations. We have even \npaid off in advance all of our debt with the IMF \u2014 an \nIMF that supported and promoted Governments that \nwere self-supporting, adjusting and patching up their \nbudgets, but at the cost of increasing the poverty of \ntheir people, promoting deindustrialization and \nirresponsibly plunging the country into debt.  \n Faced with the incredulous criticism of the \npromoters of orthodox prescriptions, Argentina, thanks \nto cautious monetary policies, disciplined public \nexpenditures and a healthy budget surplus that enabled \nit to face or mitigate potential foreign crises, has \nreduced the debt and registered an annual growth rate \nof 9 per cent during the past five years. This was the \nstrongest uninterrupted economic expansion of any in \nthe past 100 years.  \n Today we represent the empirical proof that there \nis life after the Fund and also the certitude that other \npaths can lead to development and integration. We \nserve as a reminder of the unreliability of models that \nclaim to be universally valid and the revindication of \nthe right of countries to choose their own path, \nbenefiting from international experience while \nprioritizing their national interests and circumstances \nabove any other interest. Our case provides proof that \nthe international economic architecture must be \nreformed, in particular that of IMF. The Fund is an \nexponent of an old world order that is no longer valid. \nOur case demonstrates the need for change in the \nmultilateral financial institutions so that they can \ncooperate in the development of the less-well-endowed \nnations and help to fight poverty and generate true \noptions for progress. \n We are thinking, not of economic growth as \ndefined by economic experts or historians, but of \ngrowth that has a strong social component and an \nemphasis on equity, where citizens are the focus of the \nresults. Whereas one fourth of the labour force \nexperienced the humiliation of being unemployed, \nunemployment has been reduced to 7.8 per cent since \nwe have taken office. We are speaking, not about just \nany sort of work, but about appropriate and decent \nwork of the kind we advocated at the most recent \nsummit meeting of the Americas, which was held in \nour country.  \n Thanks to a productive policy that generates \nadded value and, in addition, appeals to private \nenterprises to show social responsibility, we are \nreindustrializing Argentina. The economic indicators \nposted by our country today would have been \nimpossible were it not for the complementarity of \naction between the State and the private sector. \n Our sales to all destinations have doubled over \nthe past four years, with a 16 per cent annual growth \nrate. Investments have improved substantially: gross \ndomestic fixed investment has increased for the past 17 \nconsecutive quarters; the ratio of investment to GDP is \nbetween 20 and 23 per cent \u2014 in stark contrast to the \nlevel of 2002 when it was hardly more than 11 per \ncent.  \n When faced with that crisis almost five years ago, \nwe felt compelled to maintain essential assistance \npolicies for the most vulnerable segments of our \npopulation. We do not regret those policies, and today \nwe can state that the true solution to the serious social \nproblems affecting our country, and many others \naround the world, lies in providing jobs, health care \nand education.  \n In the area of health, Argentina has launched a \nnational policy that includes prescriptions for generic \ndrugs and the provision of essential medications free of \ncharge. It also strengthens maternity and child \nprogrammes and everything that relates to primary \nhealth care, in line with the goals of equity and \nprotection. This has enabled us to compensate in part \nfor the disastrous state of the public health sector a \nshort time ago.  \n Of course, education is an essential element for \nrenewing the social and moral fabric of the nation, \neven though the time horizon for its effects to be felt is \nlonger than those of other public policies. In order to \nremedy the tragic situation that signalled the \nbreakdown of society and the failure on the part of the \nState to protect those who were most vulnerable, a new \nlaw on national education was passed. It will again \nfocus on ensuring equality of opportunity through \nguaranteed access to a quality education throughout the \nterritory that is linked to the labour market and \nincludes excellent training for teachers. Under the new \nlaw, a deadline of 2010 has been set, by which time \n6 per cent of the gross national product will be used to \nfinance education. \n In this context of steady recovery, Argentina\u2019s \nforeign policy is being strengthened and expanded, \nwith a clear and decisive commitment to the national \ninterest. Regional integration is a priority. Over the \npast two decades, through the Common Market of the \nSouth (MERCOSUR), Argentina has strengthened its \ncommercial ties with the countries of the region. But \nits trade relations go far beyond the region. In that \nsense, multilateral negotiations within the World Trade \nOrganization are of particular importance because the \nliberalization of our agricultural sector \u2014 in which our \ncountry has clear competitive advantages \u2014 depends \non them, as does the adequate flexibility we need to \ncarry out our industrial policies.  \n More equitable and fairer rules in international \ntrade are of great importance to Argentina. We \ntherefore participate actively in multilateral economic \nnegotiations with the firm goal of achieving equity in \nthe norms that govern world trade and of reversing the \ndiscrimination erected against our main products \nthrough tariff barriers and other trade-distorting \ninstruments imposed by the developed countries. \n Argentina will be present in all multilateral \nforums, where we will participate to ensure more \nequitable and democratic rules. Multilateralism is the \nmost effective instrument for winning the battle against \nhunger, poverty, exclusion and environmental \ndegradation.  \n Everything I have said here is both cause and \nconsequence of institutional stability and respect for \nthe rule of law. The three pillars of the Argentine State \nare making decisions to combat impunity and preserve \nmemory, truth, and justice. We have begun bringing to \njustice those guilty of serious human rights violators. \nThose who imagined themselves having escaped with \nimpunity are fiercely resisting justice and, in an \nattempt to intimidate witnesses, have caused the \ndisappearance of one witness, Julio Lopez. They have \nthereby sent a dark message to a society that is seeking \nthe truth about the crimes against humanity which they \ncommitted, and that condemns such acts. \n Unconditional respect for human rights is our \nnew national paradigm. In the past, we were known \nthroughout the world for violations of those rights; \ntoday, as we strive to find the truth and to punish the \nguilty, we also seek to defend those rights worldwide.  \n Argentina, the Mothers and Grandmothers of the \nPlaza de Mayo in the monumental dignity of their \nstruggle, and the Argentine people have personally \nsuffered under the inefficiency of a broken multilateral \nhuman rights system. Their sole comfort were the very \nprecious humanitarian gestures of individuals, \norganizations and countries. While people were being \nkidnapped, tortured and killed in my country, the \nmechanisms established precisely to condemn and \nprevent such horrors remained silent. It is in their \nmemory, so that this will never happen again, that we \nsupport the new Human Rights Council and hope that it \nwill live up to the expectations of the international \ncommunity. \n My Government has endorsed instruments of \ngreat importance, including the International \nConvention for the Protection of All Persons from \nEnforced Disappearance, adopted by this Assembly on \n20 December 2006, which we signed in Paris on \n6 February. That instrument, along with the Convention \non the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the \nOptional Protocol of the Convention on the \nElimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against \nWomen, gives continuity and concrete form to a policy \nthat ascribes a central role to the promotion of human \nrights.  \n In our public policy, we now focus on \nenvironmental protection, but we know that there will \nbe no viable solution without cooperation among all \nthe countries of the world, the industrialized countries \nin particular, because the nature of the problem is of a \nglobal scale.  \n The issue of climate change should be of concern \nto all Governments, because no corner of the planet is \nunaffected by changes that have been identified as due \nto human activity. The Secretary-General\u2019s convening \nof yesterday\u2019s High-level Meeting was a timely \nmanifestation of the urgent need to strengthen \ninternational cooperation as an effective and adequate \nresponse to protect the environment and prevent the \nunacceptable exportation of pollutants to the \ndeveloping countries. \n One after the other, various diplomatic efforts to \nhalt the violence in the Middle East once and for all \nhave failed, but we cannot merely throw up our hands. \nNo military solution will lead to peace and the \ntranquillity that all the peoples of the region so \ndesperately call for. The invasion of Iraq, which we \nrejected at the time it occurred, is the tragic and painful \nproof of the truth of our position. The Security Council \nand the nations of the Quartet have the heavy \nresponsibility of accompanying and, if possible, \nguiding a peace process that can succeed with courage \nand great perseverance. \n The Argentine Republic continues, year after \nyear, tirelessly to condemn the serious threat of \nterrorism throughout the world. We believe that all acts \nof terror are criminal and unjustifiable and that no \nargument can justify them. Just as no nation of the \nworld is beyond their reach, the response must be a \njoint effort of all nations, and especially this \nOrganization, to stop and eliminate this scourge. We \ncannot tolerate the actions of those responsible for \nterrorism or of those who defend, finance or protect \nterrorists, be they individuals or countries. \n Argentina has twice suffered terrorist attacks. The \nIsraeli embassy was attacked in 1992 and the AMIA \nheadquarters in 1994. Some 102 members of our \ncommunity, some of whose relatives are here with us \ntoday, lost their lives. Those victims, united by terror to \nthose of this city, those of Madrid, those of London, \nthose of Bali, those of Istanbul and those of many other \nplaces, impose upon us the moral mandate to respect \ntheir memories and to commit all our energies to \nhunting down, finding and prosecuting those \nresponsible. \n Despite the difficulties that have arisen through \nthe passage of time, given that those attacks took place \n13 and 15 years ago, respectively, and the subsequent \ncover-ups, our interest and the justice system continue \nto seek the truth, and we keep our memory of the \nhorror alive so that it will not recur. \n In November last year, the Argentine justice \nsystem called for international cooperation in the \napprehension of nine people suspected of having \ninitiated and planned the 18 July 1994 attack on AMIA, \nand the Executive Committee of INTERPOL \nunanimously recommended the apprehension of six \nIranian citizens and one Lebanese involved in the \naffair. We call here for that recommendation to be \nratified during the November session of the \nINTERPOL General Assembly. \n In that context, we hope that the Islamic Republic \nof Iran, in the context of applicable international law, \nwill accept and respect Argentina\u2019s legal jurisdiction \nand cooperate effectively with Argentine judges to \nbring to justice those involved in these events. In that \nrespect, I wish to say here, at United Nations \nHeadquarters and before all the countries of the world, \nthat, unfortunately, the Islamic Republic of Iran has to \ndate failed to offer the required cooperation with the \nArgentine justice system to resolve those issues.  \n We call on the Secretary-General and on all the \nnations of the world to persuade the Islamic Republic \nof Iran to allow the judicial process to move forward. \nWe do so with the sole aim of clarifying the facts and \nbringing those responsible to justice. Respect for the \nmemory of our 102 victims requires justice to be \ncarried out. We request the Islamic Republic of Iran to \ncooperate in the implementation of the norms of \ninternational law to allow us to come to nothing more, \nbut nothing less than the truth. \n Nations big and small, rich and poor, all \nthroughout the world will be highly vulnerable if we \nfail to grasp that action against terrorism requires \nurgent multilateral, intelligent and sustained action \nfirmly anchored in legitimacy, respect for individual \nrights, proportional response and respect for \ninternational public opinion. \n Efforts to counter the proliferation of weapons of \nmass destruction can count on the firm support and full \nparticipation of the Argentine Republic.  \n My country is known for the active role it plays \nin the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. Argentina \ndevelops, consumes and exports nuclear energy for \npeaceful purposes in the framework of the strictest \nrespect for the norms enshrined in the Treaty on the \nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and the \nnon-proliferation regime in its broadest sense.  \n Efforts to prevent proliferation are ethically and \nlegally correlated to progress on disarmament. Indeed, \nthe legal instruments on which the prohibition of \nweapons of mass destruction is based specifically on \nthe firm commitment not to develop new weapons of \nterror and destruction in the understanding that those \nwho possess such weapons will proceed to their \ngradual and effective elimination.  \n In recent years, we have seen disarmament \ncommitments permanently eroded. Nuclear arsenals \nremain disproportionately large and nuclear \ndisarmament agreements are in stasis. It should come \nas no surprise, then, that, given the situation, there are \nthose who question the legitimacy of pursuing \nunilateral advocacy for non-proliferation while solemn \ncommitments in the area of disarmament are ignored. \n Conventional weapons are responsible for the \ndeaths of millions of people around the world. Our \ncountry has given a high priority to initiatives \nassociated with the conclusion of an arms trade treaty. \nDomestically, we have initiated programmes for the \nvoluntary handover of firearms, the initial results of \nwhich have been encouraging.  \n The reform of the Security Council is still \npending. We are hoping for a reform that will make this \ncentral body more responsible, democratically \nrepresentative and dynamic. It will not, however, \nachieve this objective by creating new privileged \ncategories. We trust that the ongoing process of \nconsultations will be successful so that the Council can \nbe adapted to today\u2019s world. \n Before concluding I wish to raise a matter of \ncontinuing importance to the Argentine Republic: the \nquestion of the Malvinas Islands, which include South \nGeorgia, South Sandwich and the maritime areas \nsurrounding those islands. This year, 174 years will \nhave passed since the British began to occupy this part \nof Argentine national territory. Ever since that act of \nforce in 1833, my country has protested against this \nillegal occupation and has demanded that the full \nexercise of its sovereignty be restored. \n We would also mention that 2007 marks the \ntwenty-fifth anniversary of the 1982 conflict in the \nSouth Atlantic, a conflict unleashed by the military \ndictatorship without the backing of the Argentine \npeople, who had always endeavoured to find a peaceful \nsolution to its legitimate sovereignty claim. \n The General Assembly has dealt with this matter \non many occasions, both prior to and since 1982. \nStarting in 1965, when the Assembly adopted \nresolution 2065 (XX), the Organization has recognized, \nyear after year, the existence of a sovereignty dispute \nbetween Argentina and the United Kingdom relating to \nthe question of the Malvinas Islands. It urged the two \nGovernments to negotiate, as soon as possible, a \npeaceful, just and lasting solution to the dispute, taking \ninto account the relevant resolutions of United Nations \nbodies and the interests of the people of the islands. \nThe ongoing and unrenounceable objective of \nregaining the full exercise of Argentine sovereignty \nover this part of our territory and the permanent \nreadiness of my country to resume negotiations aimed \nat finding a solution to the dispute have been reflected \nin our national Constitution. \n It is incomprehensible to us that the United \nKingdom should be unwilling to negotiate this matter, \nthereby violating the provisions of General Assembly \nresolution 2065 (XX) and numerous similar \nresolutions. \n The time has come for the United Kingdom to \nshoulder its responsibility and put an end to an \nanachronism: the illegal occupation for clearly colonial \npurposes of territory belonging to another State. \n My Government vigorously rejects the British \nclaim on the establishment of maritime areas \nsurrounding the archipelagos. In particular, it rejects \nthe recently divulged intention of the United Kingdom \nto make a submission to the Commission on the Limits \nof the Continental Shelf \u2014 established by the United \nNations Convention on the Law of the Sea \u2014 relative \nto the outer limits of the continental shelf of these \nArgentine territories.  \n In this, my last message to the General Assembly \nas the President of the people of Argentina, I wish to \nreaffirm our profound conviction that it is only through \ndemocracy, accompanied by freedom, social justice \nand peace, that man can realize his full potential. This \nAssembly of the peoples has a bounden duty to help \nensure that that will come to pass. \n"

        "file_text": "Kindly accept my \ncongratulations, Sir, on your election to the presidency \nof the General Assembly at its sixty-second session. \nMy delegation assures you of its full cooperation as we \naddress issues identified in the annual report of the \nSecretary-General (A/62/1) and as we responsibly and \ncreatively move forward with pending reforms of the \nOrganization. \n At the outset I would like to express India\u2019s deep \ngratitude to all Member States for the recent \nunanimous adoption by the General Assembly of \nresolution 61/271, deciding to annually observe the \nInternational Day of Non-Violence, on 2 October, the \nanniversary of the birth of Mahatma Gandhi. I also \nlook forward to participation by Member States in the \ninformal plenary meeting of the General Assembly and \nother functions being organized tomorrow at the United \nNations to mark the first International Day of \nNon-Violence. \nA central topic for this year\u2019s debate   \nresponding to climate change   is both timely and \nrelevant. India\u2019s views on it were recently set forth at \nthe high-level event on climate change, which took \nplace here on 24 September. Combined with the \nexchange of views in the general debate, it will no \ndoubt provide a useful backdrop to the meeting of the \nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate \nChange to be held later this year in Bali, Indonesia.  \n The impact of climate change and environmental \ndegradation falls disproportionately upon developing \ncountries. Developing countries are the most \nvulnerable to it, and also lack the means to tackle it. \nMeasures to address climate change must be based on \nmitigation and adaptation strategies with fair burden-\nsharing and measures to realize sustainable patterns of \nconsumption and production. The process of burden-\nsharing must also take into account where the primary \nresponsibility for the present state of greenhouse gas \nconcentration in the atmosphere rests and not foreclose \nrapid and sustained economic development for the \ndeveloping world, which, in any case, is an imperative \nfor adaptation. \n Technology is the other key area that needs to be \naddressed. It is important that critical clean \ntechnologies be made available and affordable to \ndeveloping countries. The intellectual property rights \nregime must balance rewards for innovators with the \ncommon good of humankind. Concerted international \naction to address climate change, in accordance with \nthe principle of common but differentiated \nresponsibilities and respective capabilities, as well as \nnational circumstances and social and economic \nconditions, is the need of the hour. India, for which \nenergy security is a national imperative, has a very \nsmall individual carbon footprint, with per capita \ncarbon dioxide emissions at just about a quarter of the \nworld\u2019s average. Even so, we are determined that, as \nwe pursue economic growth, our per capita greenhouse \ngas emissions will not increase beyond those of the \nindustrial countries. \n Poverty and underdevelopment are amongst the \ncentral challenges of our times. The overarching \nrequirement is for sustained economic growth to \neradicate poverty in developing countries. However, \neconomic growth must also be measured against the \ntemplate of social inclusion. Growth alone is not \nenough if it does not produce benefits that are \nsufficiently dispersed, not only in terms of increased \nincome and employment, but also for improved health, \nnutrition and education for all. \n I affirm India\u2019s resolve to achieve the \ninternationally agreed development goals, including \nthe Millennium Development Goals. The Government \nof India accords the highest priority to inclusive \ngrowth, including the political, legal, educational and \neconomic empowerment of women, effective and \naffordable public health, and enhanced access to \neducational opportunities, especially for all those who \nare disadvantaged. \n It is apparent that progress in the achievement of \nthe internationally agreed development goals has been \ntardy. The international community, through the United \nNations system, must more effectively support the \nefforts of developing countries to achieve the \ndevelopment goals. A comprehensive reform of the \ninternational financial architecture is a key ingredient \nin that process. The United Nations must play an \nimportant role in overseeing the reform of the \ninternational financial architecture. That should include \nmeasures to ensure a greater voice for and participation \nby developing countries in the Bretton Woods \ninstitutions. The process of reform must be carried to \nits logical conclusion if the credibility of those \ninstitutions is to be enhanced. \n We must also address as a priority the regrettable \ninversion of global resource flows. Today, instead of \nthe urgently needed inflow of resources to developing \ncountries to buttress their national economic \ndevelopment plans, we are confronted with a net \noutflow from them. Official development assistance \n(ODA) showed a marked fall during 2006 and remains \nwell below the target of 0.7 per cent of gross national \nproduct. It is primarily being used to finance debt \nrelief. That this is happening after so many years of \nliberalization and globalization highlights our \ncollective failure. Perhaps we should be considering \nmechanisms, such as an international debt commission, \nto redress the problem of developing country debt.  \n The least developed countries, which are \nparticularly hard hit by rising energy costs, find \nthemselves in an even more difficult situation. \nEnhanced and predictable resource flow to developing \ncountries remains a key objective of the global \npartnership for development. India will continue to do \nwhat it can to help with capacity-building in other \ndeveloping countries and to assist them through ODA \nwithin the limits of its capacity. By the end of the year, \nimports from least developed countries into India will \nface a zero-tariff regime. \n Early and substantive progress at the Doha Round \nof trade negotiations, based on the primacy of the \ndevelopment dimension, is another imperative. We \nmust return to the negotiating table with a redoubled \nsense of urgency, while recognizing that adherence to \nthe existing mandate remains critical. Nor can the \ninterests of subsistence farmers be ignored or equated \nwith those of other sectors. An illogical linkage \nbetween agriculture and non-agricultural market access \nwill only complicate the development impact of the \nRound. The overarching principle of special and \ndifferential treatment for developing countries remains \na categorical imperative. \n As part of India's commitment to the \nachievement of human rights for all, and as a member \nof the Human Rights Council, we remain actively \ninvolved in developing the institutional framework of \nthat body, including the universal periodic review \nmechanism, based on effective international \ncooperation as a central principle in the Council\u2019s \nmethods of work. India will work towards developing \nan international normative framework for the \npromotion and protection of human rights. India is \nhonoured to be one of the first signatories of the \nInternational Convention for the Protection of All \nPersons from Enforced Disappearance. Earlier today, I \nalso had the honour of depositing India\u2019s instrument of \nratification of the United Nations Convention on the \nRights of Persons with Disabilities.  \n As the largest democracy in the world, India has \ndeveloped a system of local self-government with \ndemocratically elected institutions of representative \nGovernment at all levels   the village, the district, the \nState and the nation. The effort to make participatory \ndemocracy more meaningful to every Indian citizen \nunderpins what is perhaps one of the greatest social \nexperiments in the world today, namely, the transfer of \ndecision-making power to nearly one million elected \nwomen local Government representatives. As a result, \nwomen are not merely the beneficiaries of change in \nIndia, but are its instruments. \n As the world\u2019s largest democracy, it was also \nnatural for India to support the establishment of the \nUnited Nations Democracy Fund. We made an initial \ncontribution of $10 million to the Fund and remain \nactively and constructively involved in realizing the \nobjectives for which it was set up. As a small token of \nour commitment to that laudable initiative, I have the \nprivilege of announcing a further pledge of $10 million \nto the United Nations Democracy Fund. \n The international system cannot be reordered \nmeaningfully without a comprehensive reform of the \nUnited Nations. If the Organization is to remain the \ncornerstone of the international architecture in this \ncentury, it cannot remain mired in the realities of the \n1940s. Despite substantive implementation of the \nUnited Nations reform agenda that emerged from the \n2005 World Summit Outcome, such reform will \ninevitably remain incomplete without comprehensive \nreform and expansion of the Security Council and \nrevitalization of the General Assembly. Elements and \nideas on the reform of the Security Council have been \ndiscussed for well over a decade in numerous reports \nand interminable consultations. It is now time for \nintergovernmental negotiations to commence in order \nto make the Security Council more democratic, \nrepresentative and responsive.  \n We, together with partners from Africa, Latin \nAmerica and Asia, tabled a resolution on 11 September \n2007, spelling out the principles on which reform \nought to be based if it is to be meaningful. These \nprinciples are expansion in both permanent and \nnon-permanent categories of membership; greater \nrepresentation for developing countries and \nrepresentation for developed countries that is reflective \nof contemporary world realities; and comprehensive \nimprovement in the working methods of the Security \nCouncil, including ensuring greater access for island \nand small States. We welcome recent statements from \nthis podium by President Bush of the United States of \nAmerica and other world leaders on the need for \nSecurity Council reform in both the permanent and \nnon-permanent categories. It is high time that we \ncollectively bring these ideas to implementation. \n Reform of the United Nations would also be \nincomplete without revitalization of the General \nAssembly. The central goal of such revitalization must \nbe the restoration and enhancement of the role and \nauthority of the General Assembly as originally \nenvisaged in the Charter. \n Given the significance of developmental \nactivities for the developing world, India sees a \ncorresponding need for the reform of United Nations \noperational activities in favour of development. Since \nthese activities are aimed at supporting the work of \nMember States, it follows that Members must \ndetermine their direction and shape through an \nintergovernmental process. The litmus test for any \nreform proposal is whether it improves the support \nextended by the United Nations to the efforts of \nprogramme countries. India would therefore judge \nreform proposals by their impact on the ground, by the \nresultant improvement in the effectiveness of the \nsystem and by the impact on transaction costs for the \nUnited Nations development system. \n Steps to achieve the complete elimination of \nnuclear weapons have also only made limited headway. \nDespite some progress, the world remains far from \nachieving the objective of total elimination of nuclear \nweapons. India\u2019s long-standing commitment to \nuniversal, non-discriminatory and comprehensive \nnuclear disarmament is embodied in the vision of late \nPrime Minister Rajiv Gandhi for a nuclear-free and \nnon-violent world. This vision was put forward nearly \ntwo decades ago. It remains undiminished today.  \n Indeed, it is all the more relevant today, given the \nfact that peaceful uses of nuclear energy can address \nthe inexorably growing demand for new and  \nnon-polluting sources of energy to fuel economic \ndevelopment. We will be bringing proposals to \nMember States and this Organization to see how we \ncan refocus on general and complete disarmament, \nparticularly nuclear disarmament. Disarmament is our \nagreed goal, and it subsumes arms control and \nnon-proliferation. \n It is well known that India has an impeccable \nrecord in preventing the proliferation of sensitive \ntechnologies. That is in keeping with our commitment \nto being a responsible nuclear Power. India is ready to \nwork with the international community to develop a \nnew international consensus on non-proliferation. The \ninternational community needs to intensify the effort to \naddress the very real threat posed by the link between \nthe proliferation of weapons of mass destruction \n(WMDs) and related materials and technologies and \nthe ability of non-State actors to acquire them. The risk \nposed by the intersection between proliferation and \nterrorism is real and serious. The central objective must \nbe to ensure that our solidarity in words is translated \ninto action. \n The adoption of the United Nations Global \nCounter-Terrorism Strategy last September was a \nnoteworthy development, signalling the will of the \ninternational community to combat this menace in a \nholistic and coordinated manner. Welcome as the \nStrategy is, there is much more that needs to be done to \ncombat the menace that international terrorism has \nbecome. India is convinced that without the early \nadoption of a comprehensive convention against \ninternational terrorism, the global struggle against \nterrorism remains incomplete and likely to succeed \nonly partially. We must ensure that there is zero \ntolerance for all forms of terrorism. \n In conclusion, I would express the hope that our \ndeliberations in the year ahead will lead us to \nenlightened action. With maturity and resolve we will \nsuccessfully overcome the many challenges before us. \n"

        "file_name": "ECU_62_2007.txt",
        "file_text": "Allow me  to begin my statement by recalling the commitment to \nfight poverty, in force since September 2000, when 189 \ncountries signed the Millennium Declaration, which \nincluded the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). \nOn that agreement we undertook to meet by 2015 some \nbasic goals on the path of human development. \n Today, from a Government that has declared in \nEcuador a citizens' revolution, one that is democratic, \nethical and nationalist, we wish to set out some critical \nthoughts with regard to the very concept of the MDGs, \ntheir limitations and the dangers that minimum \nprogrammes of that nature entail, in particular with \nregard to the profound social and economic inequalities \nthat exist on the planet. \n The first limitation of the MDGs is that they \nconstitute a minimum as a poverty-reducing strategy. \nOur goal is to go much further than such minimums by \ngoing into greater depth on those objectives and \nincorporating others. The fact that we subscribe \nexclusively to a focus on minimum needs, such as that \npresented in the MDGs, carries a high risk that in \nseeking to satisfy our consciences we limit the \naspirations for social change. \n I think it is fair to say that there are two \nthresholds by which we can characterize the lives of \npeople. The first has to do with the indispensable \nabilities of human beings to survive within a society \nand without which life could not be called human. The \nsecond refers to the capacities that allow each \nindividual to be fulfilled within that society. We are \nspeaking not only about subsistence, but of the right to \nenjoy a life that is worthy of living. \n Ecuador believes that to have the goal of living \non $1 plus 1 cent per day in order to supposedly \novercome extreme poverty or to avoid dying \nprematurely, as one might deduce from the MDGs \u2014 \ndoes not lead to a dignified life. The development of \npublic policies in a country that is attempting to bring \nabout radical change - as is the case in Ecuador - \ncannot be satisfied with those minimum objectives. \nObviously, avoiding the premature death of girls and \nboys or of pregnant women is an objective that nobody \nwould question. However, if we base ourselves only on \nthat, we run the risk of agreeing that human life is \nsimply a process of resistance, the aim of which is to \nextend someone's existence by a few more hours. \n What we propose therefore are common goals, \nnot only with regard to living minimums but with \nregard to social maximums as well. For example, we \nfeel that it is possible to draw on diverse identities, to \nbuild and restore public areas, to guarantee access to \njustice and to have work which enables people to enjoy \nthe right to support themselves and to have time for \ncontemplation, artistic creation and recreation \u2014 goals \nthat are already contained in the national development \nplan that is being implemented by the Government of \nEcuador.  \n Accordingly, we renounce the idea of a \nhistorically inevitable present to which we must \nsurrender by simply looking for minimums that are \nclearly basic. Furthermore, to be satisfied with the \nminimum also means - and that is very serious - \nlegitimizing the reality that we experience because the \nminimum will not alter the distance and power \nrelationships between individuals and between \nsocieties. Hence, we also favour the recognition of \nequal dignity for all human beings. Granting some \npeople certain minimums must be an initial and \ntemporary goal and must never be considered a modus \noperandi of public policy. For that means that the \n\u201cbeneficiary\u201d is placed in a position of inferiority \ncompared to everyone else. In other words, it means \nthat their dignity is not recognized as equal with \neveryone else's. In fact, it is no accident that \ninternational bureaucracies such as the World Bank \nalways suggest producing poverty reports, but never \nconsider publishing inequality reports. \n For this reason, perhaps the best way to reduce \npoverty with dignity is to reduce social, economic, \nterritorial, environmental and cultural gaps. One of my \nGovernment's main goals is thus to reduce inequality \nin an endogenous development framework of economic \ninclusion and socio-territorial cohesion, domestically \nas well as within the global system. And along the \nsame lines, we in Ecuador are seeking to apply the rule \nof human rights and universal values. On the other \nhand, the long and sad neoliberal night proposed - \n from an existential perspective with its consequent \nabsolutism of the market - social programmes that \nended up by breaking up society into as many parts as \nthere are social groups.  \n However, a national plan and a change in the \npower relationships within a society do not mean that \nall the fragments will come together. There is no claim \nthat, by some twist of fate, these will acquire meaning \nand coherence and will assemble themselves like the \npieces of a puzzle - even if some of the pieces are \nmissing. It is indispensable to have a common plan that \nmust be constantly redesigned and whose goal must be \nthat we all want to be part of it. \n That is why, in Ecuador, we are creating our \nnational development plan in a democratic fashion. We \nknow that without everyone's participation in society's \nbasic decisions, no country can legitimize its public \ndecision-making and make it more efficient. We must \nchange a political practice employed by the traditional \nsectors, with their technocrats and elites, and return \nspeech and action to those who should be the owners, \nprotagonists and beneficiaries of public policy.  \n I would like furthermore to point out that the \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) offer a vision \nof development that is linked to consumption and a \nstrategy linked to processes of economic liberalization. \nOur view on development is very different from that. \nWe understand development to be the attainment of a \ngood standard of living for everyone, in peace and in \nharmony with nature, and with the indefinite extension \nof human cultures. In that respect, we are extremely \nhappy to see that the Assembly has broadly debated the \ndevastating and unjust effects of climate change.  \n Ecuador has submitted a specific and innovative \nproposal to contribute to the reduction of carbon \ndioxide emissions and to the preservation of \nbiodiversity: our Yasuni-ITT proposal. It involves a \ncommitment not to extract some 920 million barrels of \noil, thereby avoiding the emission of approximately \n111 million tons of carbon that would come from the \nburning of this fossil fuel. However, that will mean that \nwe will have to forgo significant investments of around \n$720 million each year, a very significant amount for \nthe economy of Ecuador.  \n We are prepared to make this huge sacrifice, but \nwe also ask for shared responsibility on the part of the \ninternational community, particularly on the part of \ndeveloped countries, the planet's main predators, and \nfor a minimum compensation for the environmental \nbenefits that we are generating. That would be an \nextraordinary example of global collective action, \nsetting aside rhetoric in favour of concrete facts and \npractical actions: not only would it reduce global \nwarming for the benefit of the whole planet, but it \nwould also bring about a new way of thinking about \neconomics in the twenty-first century, where the \ngeneration of value is compensated, not just the \ngeneration of goods. \n Speaking of cultures, we were very happy to see \nthat the General Assembly recently adopted the \nDeclaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples \n(resolution 61/295), which was sponsored very actively \nby Ecuador. The Declaration is an instrument that had \nto wait more than 20 years to be adopted and that will \nbe the fundamental charter for the protection of human \nrights of our indigenous peoples. \n Finally, the good living that we are talking about \npresupposes that genuine individual freedoms, \nopportunities and potentials be enhanced. An immoral \nparadox arises here: at the world level, we are \npromoting the free movement of goods and capital, \nlooking for the highest profitability. But, on the other \nhand, we are penalizing the free circulation of people \nwho are looking for decent jobs. That is quite simply \nintolerable and absolutely unsustainable from an \nethical point of view.  \n For the Government of Ecuador, there are no \nillegal human beings. There is no such thing, and the \nUnited Nations must insist on this point. There is no \nsuch person as an illegal human being. It is not \npermissible to think in that way. We are working \nactively to bring about changes in the shameful \ninternational migration policies, particularly those of \nthe countries of the so-called first world, without \nforgetting, of course, that our greatest responsibility is \nto build a country that will guarantee decent life as a \nway of preventing forced exodus because of poverty \nand exclusion.  \n We must not be misled by those who proclaim the \nend of ideologies and the end of history. Conservatives \nwant to make us believe that we live in the best of all \npossible worlds and that we have to abandon any \nattempt at change, any attempt to build our own \nindividual and collective identity, any attempt to build \nour own history. In the face of such a miserly and self-\nsatisfied worldview, we say that it is possible to have  \ncollective action that is both aware and democratic, in \norder to direct our lives and organize world society in a \ndifferent way with a more human face. Our \nunderstanding of development obliges us to recognize \none another, understand one another and appreciate one \nanother, so that we can move towards self-realization \nand the building of a shared future. Ecuador invites the \nAssembly to build this world, this dream.  \n"

We must foster a shared sense for what is just \nand what is necessary. We must understand that the \nbasic premise of collective security is that we must \nagree upon the threats that we face and the manner in \nwhich we must tackle them.  \n We must accept that collective security, in order \nto be legitimate, must defend international law in the \nabstract, without preference for some over others. \nNevertheless, we continue to have an unequal \ncommitment to international law. Some of us have \naccepted a multilateralism that is based on open \nagreements openly arrived at, whereas others refuse to \nyield imaginary shares of sovereignty. As long as the \nlatter continue to understand sovereignty as the \nabsence of obligations and responsibilities to others, \nmultilateralism is compromised.  \n Cultures and viewpoints from all parts of the \nworld gather here. They do so because they know that \nthe solitude of unilateralism is a dead-end road. \nMultilateralism must, however, have preconditions. \nThose who want to be treated as a partner must behave \nas one. If not, we will never be able to live up to our \npromise of \u201cnever again\u201d. The \u201cnever again\u201d that we \npronounced at the end of the First World War and the \nSecond World War or that we asserted following the \ngenocides in Kampuchea and Rwanda, still fails to \nmobilize us today to solve other situations that are just \nas unacceptable, just as intolerable and, on occasion, \njust as unimaginable.  \n It is not right to compromise multilateralism; it is \nespecially wrong to do so when, through a lack of will, \nwe affect one or more partners making a desperate \nappeal for help. In that regard, we welcome the fact \nthat this General Assembly has put climate change at \nthe top of its agenda. But how long has it taken us? We \nsimply cannot be satisfied with a \u201cbetter late than \nnever\u201d, when in 1987, exactly 20 years ago, President \nMaumoon Abdul Gayoom of the Republic of the \nMaldives alerted us that he did not come to speak \nabout international political issues but rather about \u201cthe \ndeath of a nation\u201d, the death of a nation whose 1,190 \nislands will be virtually submerged with the rise in sea \nlevel owing to climate change. The emergency hotline \nmust respond not only to 11 September but to all the \nemergencies covered by the Charter of the United \nNations.  \n It is time to pay our debt to nature. We simply \ncannot continue to distort the evidence of climate \nchange. Regardless of how inconvenient the truth may \nbe or what our respective shares of responsibility are, \nthe truth is here to stay. Year after year we are \nreminded of it with greater frequency and intensity.  \n In Costa Rica where the most species per square \nkilometre of anywhere in the world are found, we are \ncommitted to going beyond our obligations. We have \nadopted concrete and sustainable actions, such as \nsetting aside 27 per cent of our national territory as \npreserves, the generation of energy using renewable \nenergy sources for 98 per cent of our generating \ncapacity, the introduction of environmental service \npayments and the commitment to advance towards a \ncarbon-neutral economy by the year 2021. However, no \nmatter how sustainable our commitment at the national \nlevel, our efforts will have less impact if they are not \nmet by similar commitments in other parts of the \nworld. Since climate change does not recognize \nborders, others with large environmental debts simply \ncannot continue to live in debt, as this accelerates the \ncoming of the day of judgement.  \n Although we have seen some strides in \ninternational environmental governance at both the \nglobal and regional levels, we continue to be indebted \nto nature. The Kyoto Protocol is an incomplete \ninstrument, not only because it has not attained \nuniversality, but also because it does not incentivize \nthe sustainability of the primary forest and its \necosystem. In that respect, Costa Rica is working on \ncompensatory mechanisms to avoid deforestation with \ndifferent intergovernmental groups, such as the \nCoalition for Rainforest Nations and the Group of 11, \nto make sure that the post-Kyoto scheme does not \nexclude primary forests.  \n We cannot compromise on multilateralism. It is \nunrealistic to press others for compliance with the \nobligations that arise from the Treaty on the \nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and the \nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), \nwhile disregarding one\u2019s own obligations. Both treaties \nand all of their articles are part of an intricate \narchitecture of mutual trust that does not allow for any \npartial constructs. We must avoid both horizontal and \nvertical proliferation, promote compliance with all of \nthe obligations that arise from those treaties and \ncondemn every attempt to break the regime of mutual \ntrust. We cannot allow for the proliferation of \nexceptions to non-proliferation.  \n Multilateralism is not built on a show of strength. \nIn 2006, the world reached a record $1.2 trillion in \nmilitary spending. According to the Millennium \nProject, with one tenth of this amount, that is, $121 \nbillion, we would have met the targets for 2006 for all \nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) in all \ncountries of the world. In 2006, on average, for every \ndollar spent on official development assistance by the \nmember States of the Organization for Economic \nCooperation and Development, $7.5 were spent on \nweapons. \n Security does not come from multiplying \nweapons; history has proven this time and time again. \nSecurity comes from remedying injustices, easing \nshortages and creating opportunities so that we can \nhave collective prosperity on par with collective \nsecurity. In this regard, Costa Rica has been calling for \ncompliance with the Charter of the United Nations, \nArticle 26 of which commits us to promote \u201cthe \nmaintenance of international peace and security with \nthe least diversion for armaments of the world\u2019s human \nand economic resources\u201d. Thus says the dead letter of \nthe Charter of the United Nations. \n It is in this spirit that we have pressed for the \nadoption of an arms trade treaty, a legally binding \ninstrument that codifies the existing obligations of \nStates under international law that may apply to the \narms trade. Therefore we celebrate the adoption, by a \nsignificant majority, of Assembly resolution 61/89, \nwhich allows us to re-activate this noble objective of \nthe Charter. \n It is also in this spirit that we have called for the \nanimation of the Costa Rica Consensus, so that \ninternational donors can reward those developing \ncountries that are making sustainable and verifiable \nefforts to meet the most pressing social needs, \nincluding the MDGs, while increasing social \ninvestment and reducing military spending. \n Multilateralism requires a shared sense of \nurgency. We need to face all global threats, all global \nchallenges in a timely fashion, not creating a world \nwith two different speeds: one in which we need two \ndecades to respond to the call made by President \nGayoom, among others, and another in which we \nrespond in a just a few days, with binding resolutions \nlike Security Council resolutions 1373 (2001) or 1540 \n(2004). \n Our commitment to combat terrorism must aim at \nprevailing not only over the terrorists, but also over the \nroot causes from which they draw strengthen and \nrenewal. In this regard, it is as important to combat the \nmanifestations of terrorism, its financial channels and \nphysical hideouts as it is to fight the poverty and \ndespair that provide an easy harvest for extremists. To \nsucceed we can no longer afford to be late in dealing \nwith the challenges of development. \n Multilateralism also requires a shared sense of \njustice. For that, we need more States to ratify the \nRome Statute of the International Criminal Court. As \nwe advance towards the universality of the Statute and \nthe acceptance of its complementary jurisdiction, we \nwill close the gaps and loopholes by which the worst \ncriminals in the world escape and hide. \n Finally, we must have the courage to look at \nourselves in the mirror, as an Organization and as \nMember States. We cannot permit this Organization\u2019s \nfoundations to be weakened by a few errors. We need \nto learn from our mistakes and allow space for self-\ncriticism. We do a disservice to the credibility and the \neffectiveness of this Organization if, each time a \ndifficult or inconvenient situation arises, we simply \nproduce a report for the archives. Our scant follow-up \nto the reports on Srebrenica and the Oil-for-Food \nProgramme provides two clear examples of our \napparent incapacity for learning. \n As Harry Truman said, referring to the convening \nof the San Francisco Conference, \u201cit was important for \nus to make a start, no matter how imperfect\u201d. Since \n1945, this Organization has expanded and changed, \nimproving through experience and reform, \nincorporating more and more cultures and views, \nputting into practice, with more or less success, the \nprinciples and purposes of the Charter. This \nOrganization certainly does not have all the answers \nand does not possess all the resources required, for in \nthe end, it is restrained by the lowest common \ndenominator, that is, by ourselves, the Member States. \n We have a world of reasons to persevere and \nprevail over the challenges we face. Neither the \nchronic pessimism of some nor the ungrateful egoism \nof others will check the slow but determined march \nforward of those of us who believe in multilateralism \nand in a future of greater shared welfare for all. \n"

        "file_text": "I have the  honour to address this General Assembly on behalf of \nthe European Union. \n I would like to start, Mr. President, by wishing \nyou all the best in the mandate you are beginning. I \nwould like you to know that you can count on the firm \nsupport of the European Union (EU) throughout this \nGeneral Assembly, certain that you will continue the \nexcellent work of your predecessor, Ms. Haya Al-\nKhalifa, whom I would also like to congratulate. \n Since this is the first session of the General \nAssembly to be convened since our Secretary-General, \nMr. Ban Ki-moon, assumed office, I also wish to take \nthis opportunity, on behalf of the EU, to renew our \nsolid support to him in his leadership of the United \nNations. \n In this globalized and interdependent world in \nwhich we live, only strong multilateral institutions can \npromote the fundamental values of peace, democracy, \nhuman rights and development. This is why the EU \nsupports the primacy of the United Nations in \nmaintaining international peace and security as the \nfoundation and focal point of our shared ambitions and \nconcerted efforts. And that is why we adopted effective \nmultilateralism and a rules-based international order as \nthe objective of the European security strategy. \n Let me make this clear: if the new century has \ntaught us only one lesson, it is that global challenges \nrequire global responses. What is needed is effective \nmultilateralism. That is what we are engaged in here at \nthe United Nations, and that is what we are seeking to \npromote in the United Nations. The message that I \nwish to leave with members today, on behalf of the EU, \nis that they can rely on us to make effective \nmultilateralism a reality, today. \n I propose to begin with what is undoubtedly one \nof the greatest objectives that we in the United Nations \nhave so far set for ourselves, which is to meet the \ninternationally agreed development goals, including \nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Those \ngoals are demanding, but they should not discourage \nus; on the contrary, they should inspire us to accelerate \nour work and enhance its effectiveness in eradicating \npoverty, building a true partnership for development, \npromoting education for all and decent health standards \nand combating climate change. \n In that context, I must mention one of the stated \nobjectives of the European Union: the adoption of a \njoint EU-Africa strategy to be endorsed by the second \nEU-Africa summit, to be held in Lisbon in December. I \nmention that objective because it is a clear sign of our \ntimes: a strategy, defined jointly by Africans and \nEuropeans, that reflects our commitment to the MDGs \nand is in keeping with the activities of both continents\u2019 \nmultilateral institutions. It is an inclusive and \nambitious strategy that reflects the progress made in \nEuro-African cooperation in a broad range of areas and \nsets standards to be met through shared responses to \nthe challenges likewise shared by the continents of \nAfrica and Europe. \n Climate change is one of the great global \nchallenges facing humanity today. It threatens our \nprosperity and could undermine our ability to achieve \nthe MDGs. Here, too, our response must be global and \ncollective.  \n I was pleased to take part in the high-level event \non climate change. Its results are encouraging and give \nrise to optimism. They clearly show a political will to \nmove forward. Sustainable development and emission \nreductions must go hand in hand; therefore, they are \nour shared responsibility. This initiative will add \nmomentum to the formulation of a post-2012 global \ncomprehensive agreement on a climate regime. I \nbelieve that we should agree to begin negotiations on \nsuch a regime at the Bali climate change conference, to \nbe held in December. I wish to make it absolutely clear \nthat the EU will make every effort to achieve an \nambitious and solid international consensus at the \nconference. \n Even more important, however, we need \neveryone\u2019s support. The EU has already unilaterally \ncommitted itself to cutting its greenhouse gas \nemissions by at least 20 per cent. But we want to go \nfurther, and we are prepared to do so. That is why we \nannounced that, as part of a future global agreement on \nclimate rules, we would increase that commitment to \n30 per cent. Here, I would like to reiterate our call for \nglobal emissions to be reduced by at least 50 per cent \nof their 1990 levels by 2050. I believe that by \nundertaking those commitments, the EU is sending a \nclear signal that it wishes to lead these global efforts. \n I also wish to say something about reform of the \ninstitutional framework for United Nations \nenvironmental efforts. The EU firmly believes that \nambitious reform is required if we are to achieve real \nchange. In that context, the EU is in favour of \ntransforming the United Nations Environment \nProgramme into a specialized agency   a United \nNations Environment Organization   because we \nbelieve it is essential to take heed of international \npublic opinion.  \n Sustainable development also involves \nrespecting, protecting and fulfilling human rights \nthroughout the world. We believe that that is crucial \nand that it must remain at the centre of all United \nNations sectoral activities. The General Assembly\u2019s \nThird Committee should continue to play a central role \nin promoting and protecting human rights throughout \nthe world. At the present session, the EU will do its \nutmost, as it has in the past, to ensure the Committee\u2019s \nsuccess.  \n Here, I should like to say to the members of the \nGeneral Assembly that the EU is following closely the \nsituation in Myanmar. We express our solidarity with \nthe people of that country and call on its authorities to \nrespect human rights. In particular, we call on them to \nrefrain from using any form of violence against people \nwho are engaged in peaceful protest. The authorities \nmust endeavour to promote a genuine process of \npolitical reconciliation, because that is what democracy \nand respect for human rights require.  \n I wish to reaffirm the EU\u2019s long-standing \nopposition to the death penalty and to reiterate once \nagain our appeal for its total abolition throughout the \nworld. In that regard, the EU will, together with \ncountries from every region of the world, formulate a \ndraft resolution on a universal moratorium on, and \nabolition of, the death penalty. \n Effective multilateralism also requires a \nconcerted response to the ever-widening range of \nthreats to international peace and security.  \n We welcome the establishment of the African \nUnion-United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur so \nthat we can jointly contribute to the political resolution \nof that conflict, which has had tragic humanitarian \nconsequences in the Sudan and the entire region. In \norder to address those consequences, the European \nUnion reaffirms its support for the deployment of a \nmultidimensional presence in eastern Chad and the \nnorthern Central African Republic and welcomes the \nopening of political talks on Darfur, which will take \nplace in Libya on 27 October. \n But peace and security are also a challenge in \nEurope. We share the opinion of the Secretary-General \nthat the status quo in Kosovo is not sustainable. For \nthat reason, the European Union supports and \nparticipates actively in the ongoing efforts of the \ninternational community, namely those of the Troika, \nto bring the parties closer together and obtain a \ncomprehensive political solution that will lead to a \ndemocratic and multi-ethnic Kosovo and will \ncontribute to the consolidation of stability and \nprosperity in that part of Europe: the Balkans. We urge \nboth parties to engage constructively and creatively in \nthat process. The European Union stands ready to play \na significant role in the implementation of a future \nstatus settlement at the end of the negotiations. \n The reactivation of the Middle East peace process \nremains a priority for the international community. We \nhave to act quickly, because the door is open at the \nmoment, but it will not stay open for long. The \nEuropean Union, as a member of the Quartet, reiterates \nits commitment to reaching a just, comprehensive and \nlasting solution to the Israeli-Arab conflict. That can \nhappen only through the creation of an independent, \ndemocratic and viable Palestinian State living side by \nside with Israel in peace and security. \n The stabilization of Lebanon will also contribute \nto the stabilization of the Middle East. Resolving the \npresent political crisis requires a special commitment \nand dialogue by Lebanon\u2019s leaders and the countries of \nthe region. For its part, the European Union is \ncommitted to ensuring Lebanon\u2019s sovereignty, \nindependence, unity and territorial integrity. \n In the same manner, the European Union \ncontinues to support the promotion of peace, stability \nand prosperity in Afghanistan and the wider region.  \n All terrorist acts are criminal and unjustifiable, \nregardless of their motivation, their form or their \nmanifestation. We must therefore make resolute efforts \nto counter terrorism, but that must be done in \naccordance with our obligations under international \nlaw, while fully respecting human rights and \nfundamental freedoms, the protection of which are \nessential in tackling the threat of terrorism. \n I wish to say a word, from the standpoint of \nEurope, about the Alliance of Civilizations. It is an \nimportant and timely initiative that seeks to strengthen \ndialogue among peoples, cultures and religions. The \nEuropean Union supports the appointment of former \nPortuguese President Jorge Sampaio to the post of \nHigh Representative for the Alliance of Civilizations \nand welcomes his action plan. I would also like to take \nthis opportunity to acknowledge the commitment of the \nGroup of Friends of the Alliance of Civilizations, for \nwhich we ask for everyone\u2019s support. \n For centuries, international trade has been the \nmain means of bringing different cultures and peoples \ntogether. That is why we also call for the earliest \npossible agreement in the World Trade Organization\u2019s \nDoha Development Round. This month will be \nabsolutely crucial for the Doha Development Agenda. \nTherefore, it is vital for all key members to show a \nspirit of compromise and constructiveness and the \ngenuine will to commit to a fair and balanced \nagreement that can bring greater wealth for all. \n Peace must be consolidated; failing this, it can be \nno more than the interval between wars. One of the \nnewest Members of the United Nations is an example \nof that. I am referring to Timor-Leste, which, thanks to \nthe efforts and commitment of the international \ncommunity to consolidate the foundations of its \nstatehood, its democracy and its development, recently \nsuccessfully held its first independently organized \nelections. But, notwithstanding that success   which \nis enormous   the presence of all players continues to \nbe required, to ensure the country\u2019s political, economic \nand social stability. \n We believe and wish to make it clear, here, \nbeyond all doubt that the only possible response to the \nchallenges of our times lies in effective multilateralism \nbased on the United Nations system. For that reason we \nremain committed to the reform of its main bodies in \norder to enhance the Organization\u2019s representivity, \ntransparency and effectiveness. \n Political will is needed in order to adapt our \ninternational system to the challenges we face today. \nThe General Assembly and the Secretary-General can  \nrely on the European Union to help turn that political \nwill into action. The response to those challenges lies \nin active and effective multilateralism. For all of us, it \nlies in the United Nations and in support for the \nOrganization. That is the final message I wish to \nconvey to the General Assembly on behalf of the \nEuropean Union. \n"

        "file_text": "I \nshould like at the outset to express our sincere \ncongratulations to His Excellency Mr. Srgjan Kerim on \nhis election to the presidency of the General Assembly \nat its sixty-second session. I am convinced that, thanks \nto his skill as an experienced diplomat, he will ably \ncarry out his mandate. He can count on the cooperation \nof the delegation of Burkina Faso. I should also like to \nexpress our deep gratitude to his predecessor, Her \nExcellency Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa, for the \nability with which she led the work of the sixty-first \nsession.  \n I would like, finally, to pay tribute to the \nSecretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, who has shown, in \nthe less than a year that he has been at the head of this \nOrganization, his full-fledged commitment to peace \nand development and his firm determination to pursue  \nthe ambitious work of modernizing the United Nations \nbequeathed to him by his predecessor, Mr. Kofi Annan. \n As I speak to this Assembly, Burkina Faso has \nhad floods this year, which have bereaved many \nfamilies in all regions of the country. The dozens of \ndeath, the thousands of homeless people and displaced \npersons, the food crisis and the subsequent epidemics \nhave implications above and beyond the statistics \u2014 \nthe heavy price that a country, such as Burkina Faso, \npays for global warming and all other phenomenon \nlinked to climate change. It is my hope that the \nconclusions of the important summit on climate change \nheld here on 24 September will promote the adoption \nof appropriate and urgent measures that will shield our \npopulations from this type of scourge. \n All types of tension are shaking the world and, in \nparticular, the African continent, which gives us \nreasons to welcome the role played by our \nOrganization in the search for and strengthening of \npeace and peacebuilding. Burkina Faso, which is the \nChair of the Economic Community of West African \nStates (ECOWAS), is mindful that no sustainable \ndevelopment can be contemplated without an \nenvironment of peace and stability and has made \nconflict resolution a key thrust of its diplomacy. \n Therefore, President Compaor\u00e9 has made a \nresolute commitment as facilitator to search for \nsolutions to the crises that have affected the fraternal \nand neighbouring countries of Togo and C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire. \nThe Inter-Togolese Dialogue, which led in August 2006 \nto the signing in Lom\u00e9 of a comprehensive political \nagreement. The agreement is bearing fruit, which \npleases all those concerned. The latest session of the \nfollow-up committee, which was held in Ouagadougou \nin August 2007, noted the conclusion of the electoral \nroll revision process and the setting of a date for \nlegislative elections on 14 October 2007. \n Prospects are encouraging in Togo and, on behalf \nof President Compaor\u00e9, facilitator of the Inter-Togolese \nDialogue, I can confirm the sincere will and the real \ncommitment of the people and the political class of \nTogo to get their country out of this crisis and to create \nthe best conditions conducive to reconstruction, growth \nand development. And, in thanking the international \ncommunity for their assistance, I would call on them to \npursue their action for institutional reforms, \npeacebuilding and economic development in Togo. \n In the Republic of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, thanks to the \nOuagadougou Political Accord, signed on 4 March \n2007 by President Gbagbo and the Secretary-General \nof the Forces Nouvelles Guillaume Soro, the end of \nhostilities is now a reality. And so we should commend \nand encourage them to persevere to a final peace in \nC\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire. The facilitator of the direct dialogue in \nthe Ivorian crisis, President Compaor\u00e9, who is \nPresident of the Conference of Heads of State and \nGovernment of ECOWAS at this time, is please to see \nall of the political class and the entire population of \nC\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire joining in the Ouagadougou Accord. This \nAccord translates the will of the parties to proceed with \nidentifying people for an electoral enumeration and to \norganize a free, open and transparent presidential \nelection. The Security Council, in its resolution 1765 \n(2007), has endorsed this Accord. \n I would like to express our appreciation to the \nUnited Nations, which has supported Burkina Faso in \nits efforts to establish peace and security, particularly \nin West Africa. In deciding to be a candidate for a non-\npermanent seat on the Security Council, for the period \nof 2008-2009, Burkina Faso hopes to make its \ncontribution to the triumph of a world of justice and \npeace over the current world, where exclusion, \nintolerance and frustrations generate violent acts of \ndespair. At this time, I would like to reiterate our \nthanks to the member States of the ECOWAS and the \nAfrican Union (AU) who decided to make the \ncandidacy of Burkina Faso an African candidacy. Our \nhope is that all Members of this Organization will give \nus their trust. We will be worthy of it. \n Burkina Faso remains concerned by situations of \ntension and conflict in Africa and throughout the \nworld. We welcome the decision of the Security \nCouncil to deploy a hybrid United Nations-African \nUnion force in Darfur (UNAMIS). Burkina Faso has \ndecided to participate in it, as we have done in a \nnumber of other theatres of operation. I would call \nupon the international community to give peace a \nchance in the Sudan by giving this hybrid force the \nlogistical and financial resources necessary for \naccomplishing their mission. As for the protagonists, \nthey will have to do everything they can to make the \nupcoming talks an important milestone in the process \nof national reconciliation and in bringing peace to the \ncountry. \n We also think about the persistence of conflicts in \nSomalia and between Ethiopia and Eritrea. The \nSaharan zone, which includes the north of Mali and \nNiger, has also been hit by armed conflict. Burkina \nFaso has expressed its solidarity to those two \nneighbouring countries and hopes that durable \nsolutions will allow for peace to be re-established and \nwill allow for the promotion of socio-economic \ndevelopment. \n We are pleased about the political developments \nin Sierra Leone, a country which has just had great \nsuccess in organizing free, democratic and transparent \ngeneral elections. This is the most recent illustration \nthat democracy and good governance are gradually \ntaking root in Africa. Throughout the continent, this \nprinciple of good governance is part of the political \nagendas. \n We also congratulate the Moroccan Government \nfor having initiated direct talks with the Polisario Front \non the future of the Western Sahara. By this direct \ndialogue the two parties are, together, proving their \nability to look for a mutually beneficial political \nsolution. We would strongly encourage them to do so, \nconvinced as we have always been that only a \nnegotiated, political solution will put an end to this \nconflict. \n Because it is at the heart of any lasting peace in \nthe region and throughout the world, the settlement of \nthe Israeli-Palestinian conflict must remain an absolute \npriority for our Organization. In this respect, it has \nbeen established that the only solution is the creation \nof a Palestinian State that is viable with secure and \ninternationally recognized borders alongside a State of \nIsrael that is also certain of its security. And this is now \nwhere all efforts should be focused. \n In welcoming the existence of nuclear-weapon-\nfree zones, Burkina Faso is also calling for a \nresponsible, just and equitable approach to the so-\ncalled nuclear crises. My delegation is very much \nconcerned by the proliferation and the trafficking of \nsmall arms and light weapons, which for the victims \nare truly weapons of mass destruction. In West Africa, \nthe phenomenon is particularly disturbing and its \neradication requires sustained cooperation among \nStates, as well as significant support on the part of the \ninternational community. Burkina Faso, which is the \nChair of ECOWAS, has decided to make a priority of \nthis issue. \n The West African region is also in the process of \nbecoming a key centre of drug trafficking. That \nsituation requires urgent and appropriate action on our \npart, since it is likely to destabilize States, particularly \nby disrupting their economies and increasing the level \nof organized crime and corruption. Therefore, we call \nfor solidarity and support from the international \ncommunity to help us eradicate this scourge as swiftly \nas possible. \n Those worrisome issues will certainly be on the \nagenda of the conference on peace and security in West \nAfrica and the role of the joint European Union-Africa \nstrategy which my country will host in November \n2007. A joint initiative of the Republic of Austria and \nBurkina Faso, that important meeting will be an \nopportunity to identify the underlying causes of \nconflict and to formulate solutions capable of ensuring \nthe sustainable development of countries in the \nsubregion. \n The current situation in many countries reminds \nus of the cruel reality of terrorism, which remains \namong the most pernicious of challenges and thus the \nmost difficult to overcome. We must therefore \ndemonstrate greater solidarity to contain it. In \nparticular, we call for diligent implementation of the \nUnited Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy and, \nin that connection, effective international cooperation \nto strengthen the current legal arsenal and the \nconclusion of a comprehensive convention as soon as \npossible. \n By working for sustainable peace, we offer our \nStates the best guarantee for their economic \ndevelopment. Nevertheless, the current international \neconomic reality, which is characterized by \nglobalization and excessive liberalization, continues to \nbatter economies such as that of Burkina Faso. What is \nmore, these fragile economies must contend with unfair \ntrade rules. \n Several years ago, President Blaise Compaor\u00e9, by \nlaunching his crusade against subsidies for Northern \ncotton growers \u2014 a crusade that was also carried out \non behalf of his peers in Benin, Mali and Chad \u2014 \nsought to put an end to one of the most cynical \npractices of international trade. We hope to see the \nconclusion of the Doha Round of negotiations, which \nwill place development at the heart of international \ntrade. \n Millions of men, women and children \u2014 \nparticularly in Africa \u2014 are waiting to benefit from the \npositive impact of international trade in the hope that it \nwill contribute to their development and to the \nimprovement of their living conditions. For them, \npoverty and misery are not statistics or assessments, let \nalone projections. They are the mother who, because \nthere is no drinking water or no health facility within a \ndistance of 10 kilometres, sees the baby whom she bore \nwith difficulty die in her arms; they are the child who \nis eager for knowledge but who will never go to \nschool; they are the father who sees his only son \nconfront the wrath of the sea and jeopardize his life in \nsearch of a supposedly better life on some shore. Those \nare the daily tragedies to which all of us here can \nattest. \n We have the means to act. We must act quickly. \nWe must act now. \n For a number of years, we have engaged the \nUnited Nations in a process of qualitative change to \nequip it with the means to deal with the demands of the \nmodern world and to be able to effectively fulfil the \naspirations of peoples. However, while the \nachievements are considerable, the task remains vast \nand the expectations pressing. Thus, we must \ndemonstrate the will and the discernment to give the \nOrganization viable structures and adequate means. \nBurkina Faso hopes that, at the end of this process, the \nhistorical wrongs committed against Africa and other \nparts of the world will be corrected, particularly at the \nlevel of the Security Council. \n We also deplore the ongoing injustice committed \nagainst the Republic of China on Taiwan, whose \nlegitimate aspiration to participate fully in world \naffairs has been denied. Nevertheless, that country is a \ngood example of successful democracy and social and \neconomic development. By depriving 25 million men \nand women of the right to make their contribution to \nthe realization of United Nations principles and \nobjectives, our Organization is also depriving itself of \nits own quest for modernity and universality. \nTherefore, it is a new United Nations, open to all, that \nBurkina Faso earnestly calls for. \n Burkina Faso reaffirms its faith in multilateralism \nand in the role of the United Nations as an \nirreplaceable instrument for peace, development and \nthe promotion of dialogue among peoples, which it is \nour historic duty to preserve and strengthen. \n"

I am convinced that under your able \nleadership, the current session will be a fruitful one. I \nalso wish to thank Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa for \nher contribution during her presidency of the previous \nsession. \n The current international environment is highly \ncomplex. Mankind is facing both unprecedented \nopportunities and challenges. There is a growing trend \ntowards peace, development and cooperation in the \nworld. But, on the other hand, traditional and non-\ntraditional security threats are intertwined; hotspot \nissues are acute; the gap between the North and South \nis widening; trade protectionism is resurfacing; and \ndeveloping countries generally remain in a \ndisadvantaged position. The steady trend towards \neconomic globalization and towards a multi-polar \nworld is fostering a new way of thinking about \ninternational relations. \n In this Hall two years ago, Chinese President Hu \nJintao called on mankind to build a harmonious world \nwith lasting peace and common prosperity in the \ntwenty-first century (see A/60/PV.5). The core message \nof his call is that, while recognizing the diversity of the \nworld, differences of interests and diversity of cultures, \nwe should harmonize interests, defuse conflicts and \npromote cooperation for win-win progress in a \npeaceful and cooperative manner. \n In its 62-year history, the United Nations has \nplayed an irreplaceable role in promoting humankind\u2019s \ncause of peace and development. The current session of \nthe General Assembly should focus on promoting \nharmonious coexistence among countries. Resolving \nhotspot issues and peacefully settling international \ndisputes through dialogue and cooperation are not only \nexplicitly called for by the United Nations Charter. \nThey are also the right way to uphold world peace and \nstability and achieve mutual benefit and a win-win \nsituation for all. \n China remains committed to seeking a peaceful \nsolution to the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula \nthrough dialogue to uphold peace and stability on the \npeninsula and throughout North-East Asia. The Six-\nParty Talks have become an important platform for the \nparties concerned to maintain dialogue and \nconsultations on achieving denuclearization on the \npeninsula, normalizing relations between the countries \nconcerned and building a new harmonious architecture \nin North-East Asia. We will continue to play a \nconstructive role in advancing the process of the Six-\nParty Talks and the denuclearization of the Korean \npeninsula. \n Diplomatic negotiations are the best option for \nresolving the Iranian nuclear issue peacefully and \nmeeting the common interests of the international \ncommunity. China opposes nuclear-weapon \nproliferation and stands for upholding the international \nnuclear non-proliferation regime and peace and \nstability in the Middle East. No non-proliferation effort \nshould deviate from the goal of upholding international \npeace and stability. Countries should honour their due \ninternational obligations, and their right to peaceful use \nof nuclear energy should be fully respected. China \nurges the parties concerned to show flexibility and \nresume negotiations at an early date. China will \ncontinue to contribute its share to the peaceful \nsettlement of the Iranian nuclear issue. \n The Palestine-Israel conflict is at the core of the \nMiddle East issue. China supports the just cause of the \nPalestinian and other Arab peoples and the restoration \nof their lawful national rights, and it sincerely hopes \nthat Arab countries and Israel will promptly end their \ndisputes through political negotiations on the basis of \nrelevant United Nations resolutions and the principle of \nland for peace. China calls on Palestine to strengthen \nits unity and welcomes the initiative to hold an \ninternational conference on the Middle East. We hope \nthat the Iraqi people will continue to work for national \nreconciliation and restore peace and stability at an \nearly date, and that this will lead to a comprehensive, \njust and lasting resolution of the Middle East issue. \n The trilateral dialogue and consultation among \nthe United Nations, the African Union and the \nSudanese Government on an equal footing is an \neffective mechanism for resolving the Darfur issue. \nThe international community should work to sustain \nthe current sound momentum and give full play to the \nrole of the trilateral mechanism as the main channel. \nWe should adhere to dual-track strategy, promote \nbalanced progress in peacekeeping operations and the \npolitical process and seek a lasting solution to the \nDarfur issue through making progress in the security, \npolitical, humanitarian, economic and social areas. \nChina is committed to a proper settlement of the Darfur \nissue. It has provided humanitarian assistance to Darfur \non a number of occasions and will send a military \nengineering unit to join the peacekeeping operations \nthere. China will continue to firmly support the peace \nand national reconciliation process in the Sudan and \nwill contribute to the resolution of the Darfur issue and \npeace, stability and development in the Sudan. \n At its current session, the General Assembly \nshould promote the peaceful development of all \ncountries. Poverty is a major source of disputes, and \nonly development can eliminate poverty. Human \ndevelopment concerns us all. Obviously, it is \nimpossible to build common prosperity when there is a \nhuge chasm between the North and the South. The \ninternational community should act with a sense of \nurgency and redouble its efforts to deliver the \nMillennium Development Goals, narrow the North-\nSouth gap and, in particular, meet Africa\u2019s special \ndevelopment needs. Developed countries should \nincrease assistance, further open their domestic \nmarkets, transfer more technologies to developing \ncountries and provide greater debt relief to them. \n For their part, developing countries, on their part, \nshould adopt development strategies and policies \nsuited to their national conditions and boost their \neconomic development. We should support an open, \nequitable and fair multilateral trade regime and oppose \ntrade protectionism. We should work for an early, \ncomprehensive and balanced outcome of the Doha \nRound negotiations and make it a development round. \nReform of the international economic system should \nfully reflect changes in the world economy and should \ngive developing countries more say and greater \nrepresentation in the international economic system. \n China gives a high priority to strengthening \ninternational cooperation on development as it \ndevelops itself. We seek coordinated and balanced \nglobal development. While a developing country itself, \nChina has all along provided assistance to African \ncountries and other developing countries, according to \nits ability, and has helped them to improve their \ncapacity for independent and sustainable development. \nThat is because we believe that lasting peace and the \ncommon prosperity of the world is possible only with \nthe development of developing countries. \n To help Africa attain stability, security and \nsustainable development is the common responsibility \nof the international community. China and African \ncountries enjoy mutual political respect and equality \nand economic mutual benefit and win-win cooperation. \nThey support one another and maintain close \nconsultation in international affairs. We draw on one \nanother\u2019s strengths in governance to promote \ndevelopment. Thanks to our joint efforts, China-Africa \ncooperation has yielded fruitful results. Such \ncooperation is well received by the African countries, \nand it has brought great benefits to both the Chinese \nand African peoples. China\u2019s cooperation with Africa \nfacilitates Africa\u2019s cooperation with other countries and \nis not targeted against any third party. \n The current session of the General Assembly \nshould be devoted to promoting harmony between man \nand nature. Development in the world has both \nadvanced material progress and caused ecological \nimbalance and environmental pollution. To protect our \ncommon homeland is a matter of vital importance for \nour common future. \n Climate change is an environmental issue, but \nultimately it is an issue of development. It has arisen in \nthe course of development and can be resolved only \nthrough development. We should uphold the \nframework of the United Nations Framework \nConvention on Climate Change and the Kyoto Protocol \nand adhere to the principle of common but \ndifferentiated responsibilities. Developed countries \nshould face up to their responsibilities, fulfil their \ncommitments on emissions reduction in earnest and \ncontinue to take the lead in emissions reduction after \n2012. We should strengthen international cooperation \non energy, resources and the environment, step up \nefforts to develop and introduce energy-conserving \ntechnologies, environmental protection technologies \nand low-carbon energy technologies, and establish \nreasonable mechanisms for financing and technology \ntransfer. That will enable developing countries to gain \naccess to and afford advanced environmental-\nprotection technologies, enhance capacity to respond to \nclimate change and effectively address climate change \nthrough achieving sustainable development. \n China takes climate change seriously. Though its \ncurrent per capita carbon dioxide emissions are less \nthan one third of the average of developed countries, \nChina, acting in a way that is highly responsible to \nmankind, has taken many effective measures to tackle \nclimate change, including adopting a series of laws and \nregulations and setting the goals of reducing energy \nintensity and increasing forest cover. The Chinese \nGovernment has set the following targets: to reduce \nenergy intensity and total discharge of major pollutants \nby about 20 per cent and 10 per cent respectively and \nto increase the forest cover rate to 20 per cent for the \nperiod between the end of 2005 and 2010. Under its \nNational Climate Change Programme, China will take \nan active part in international cooperation in climate \nchange and contribute its share to protecting the global \nclimate. \n Advancing United Nations reform and enabling \nthe Organization to play a more important role in \nmaintaining world peace, promoting common \ndevelopment and strengthening cooperation among \ncountries is crucial to building a harmonious world. \nChina supports the reform of the United Nations. The \nreform decisions made at the high-level meeting \nmarking the sixtieth anniversary of the United Nations \nheld in 2005 should be implemented in a \ncomprehensive and balanced manner. Priority should \nbe given to reform in the area of development, and the \nUnited Nations should increase its input in that area. \nThe Human Rights Council should build on the \noutcome of reform in its previous phase and become a \nplatform for dialogue and cooperation rather than an \narena for political confrontation. Security Council \nreform should give priority to increasing the \nrepresentation of developing countries and give small \nand medium-sized countries more opportunities to \nparticipate in decision-making. Reform proposals \nshould be based on the widest possible consensus. \nChina is ready to work with all other parties to turn \nreform into a process of strengthening consultation and \ndialogue and promoting solidarity and cooperation \namong all United Nations Member States. \n China is committed to building a society of \ndemocracy, the rule of law, equity and justice, integrity \nand amity, vitality, stability and order, where people \nlive in harmony with nature. To achieve that goal, \nChina is fully implementing the outcomes of scientific \nthinking on development. We are working to boost \nsocial productivity and ensure people\u2019s rights in the \npolitical, economic, cultural, social and other fields. By \nstriving to build a harmonious society and by \nimproving the material and cultural life of one fifth of \nthe world\u2019s population, China is making a true \ncontribution to the building of a harmonious world. \n China has always pursued its own development as \na part of the global effort to promote the common \nprogress of mankind. In international affairs, we are \ncommitted to the following goals: promoting \nparticipation in international affairs by all countries on \nan equal footing and democracy in international \nrelations; enabling all countries to share the benefits of \neconomic globalization and progress in science and \ntechnology for a win-win outcome; promoting \nexchanges and understanding among civilizations and \ndiversity in the world; enhancing dialogue and trust \namong countries; and jointly tackling global issues. \nChina unswervingly pursues a path of peaceful \ndevelopment and will continue to make further \ncontributions to humankind\u2019s cause of peace and \ndevelopment. \n Taiwan is an inalienable part of China\u2019s territory. \nWe will not permit any challenge to the one-China \nprinciple and General Assembly resolution 2758 \n(XXVI). For 15 years running, since 1993, the General \nAssembly has rejected the inclusion of Taiwan-related \nissues in the agenda of the General Assembly session. \nThis fully demonstrates that any move that runs \ncounter to the purposes and principles of the United \nNations Charter or attempts to distort and deny General \nAssembly resolution 2758 (XXVI) will not receive any \nsupport from the United Nations Member States and is \ndoomed to failure. We hope that the countries \nconcerned will not allow themselves to be manipulated \nby the Taiwan authorities and will stop making wrong \nmoves of this kind. \nThe Taiwan authorities are now obstinately \nclinging to the separatist course of \u201cTaiwan \nindependence\u201d and are trying by all means to secure a \nreferendum on applying for membership of the United \nNations under the name Taiwan. This is another \ndangerous step towards \u201cde jure Taiwan independence\u201d \ntaken by the Chen Shui-bian authorities. If unchecked, \nthis move will gravely endanger peace and stability \nacross the Taiwan Strait and in the Asia-Pacific region. \nThe Chinese Government has always made every effort \nto promote with all sincerity peaceful development of \ncross-Strait relations and to seek peaceful \nreunification. However, we will never allow anyone to \nseparate Taiwan from China in name or in any other \nway. We hope that the international community will \ncontinue to support China\u2019s cause of peaceful \nreunification, support the Chinese people in opposing \nand repulsing separatist activities for \u201cTaiwan \nindependence\u201d and work with us to maintain peace and \nstability across the Taiwan Straits and in the Asia-\nPacific region. \n The Olympic Games, which represent humanity\u2019s \naspiration for peace, development, cooperation and \nfriendship, will for the first time be held in China, a \ncountry both ancient and youthful, starting on 8 August \n2008. One World, One Dream   this is the theme of \nthe Beijing Olympic Games. The 1.3 billion people in \nChina, together with the rest of the world, are eagerly \nlooking forward to the opening of the Games. The \n2008 Olympic Games are a great event for both the \nChinese people and the other peoples of the world. We \nare confident that with the efforts made by the Chinese \npeople and with strong support from the international \ncommunity, the 2008 Olympic Games will stand out as \na highly successful event. \n"

        "file_text": "First of all, I would \nlike to congratulate the President on his election to the \npresidency of the sixty-second session of the General \nAssembly. His great attributes will contribute greatly to \nthe success of our work. I would like to assure him of \nthe constant support of the delegation of Guinea-Bissau \nin the realization of his noble mission. \n I would also like to extend my warm \ncongratulations to the President\u2019s predecessor, Sheikha \nHaya Rashed Al-Khalifa of Bahrain, for the talent and \ncompetence she displayed during her tenure. \n I would also like to take this opportunity to \nextend my congratulations to Secretary-General Ban \nKi-moon for the excellent work he has done since his \nelection. We fully agree with the contents of his report \nand with his analysis of the international situation. We \nendorse the measures he has recommended. \n The prevention and peaceful resolution of \nconflicts and the maintenance of international peace \nand security occupy a central position in the Charter of \nthe United Nations. It is therefore the duty of all \nMember States to make efforts to achieve those noble \nobjectives. We believe that the establishment of an \ninternational coalition for peace, international security \nand the promotion and defence of human rights is the \nideal way to promote efforts towards the resolution of \nconflict. \n Terrorism and drug trafficking are scourges that \nthreaten all of us and can even gravely affect the \nstability of a country. Guinea-Bissau, like many other \ncountries in West Africa, is confronting the \nphenomenon of drug trafficking. The weakened \ninfrastructure of the State and the problems we face in \ncontrolling our borders   in particular our waters   \nhave made it possible for drug traffickers and other \norganized crime elements to flourish in our country. \nThat has resulted in many sorts of difficulties for our \nauthorities, to the point of damaging Guinea-Bissau\u2019s \nimage and putting at risk our relations with the \ninternational community. \n Despite the Government\u2019s political will and \ndetermination to combat drug trafficking, we have not \nbeen able to put an end to this scourge. Its eradication \nwill only be possible through international cooperation. \nThe emergency plan to combat drug trafficking \ndeveloped by my Government illustrates my country\u2019s \ndetermination to make the fight against the trafficking \nof drugs and organized crime a national objective. \nUnfortunately, however, we do not have the trained \nhuman resources or the material and financial means \nneeded to carry it out. \n I am pleased that an international conference on \ndrug trafficking in West Africa will take place soon. \nWe would like to thank the Portuguese Government for \nits willingness to host it in Lisbon. Likewise, a regional \nconference to be held in Dakar will seek to promote \nbetter coordination between the countries of the \nsubregion.  \n I would like to launch an appeal to all countries \nable to share their experience and technology relating \nto drug trafficking and organized crime to assist us in \nthe fight against those criminal activities, which \njeopardize the internal security and stability of our \ncountries and pose a great danger to our young people. \nIn that regard, I welcome the efforts of the United \nNations system to establish a genuine international \nnetwork to eradicate this scourge. \n The Government of Guinea-Bissau has decided to \nlaunch programme to address problems in the financial \nsector that will serve as an adjustment instrument \nvis-\u00e0-vis international financial institutions. That step \nwill certainly allow us to re-establish and strengthen \nthe framework for interaction and external partnerships \nof cooperation for development. The approval of a \npost-conflict programme by the Executive Board of the \nInternational Monetary Fund will be an important step \ntowards achieving the country\u2019s economic recovery \nand stabilization. \n We are aware of our responsibilities to manage \ntransparently the meagre resources at our disposal and \nto combat corruption through good governance based \non true democracy. \n The disbursement of pledges made during the \ndonors\u2019 conference for Guinea-Bissau in Geneva last \nNovember is much-needed in the political and \ninstitutional stabilization of our country. It goes \nwithout saying that without the firm support of the \ninternational community, it will be difficult for us to \nput in place the conditions necessary for the \nconsolidation of stability and for the promotion of true \nnational political reconciliation, which is essential if \nwe are to preserve peace and achieve sustainable \ndevelopment in Guinea-Bissau. \n Allow me to pay tribute to subregional \norganizations such as the Economic Community of \nWest African States and the West African Economic \nand Monetary Union for their constant support and \nsolidarity, from which we have benefited in our efforts \nto confront the enormous political, economic and \nfinancial difficulties we face. I would also like to \nwelcome the important contribution made by the \nInternational Contact Group on Guinea-Bissau to \nimprove dialogue between international development \npartners and to mobilize external assistance for my \ncountry at a particularly difficult moment in our recent \nhistory. \n It is also important to emphasize the role played \nby the Ad Hoc Advisory Group on Guinea-Bissau of \nthe Economic and Social Council. \n I wish to express our thanks for the contribution \nof the United Nations system in general, as well as that \nof the United Nations Peacebuilding Support Office in \nGuinea-Bissau (UNOGBIS) in particular, in the \nprocess of establishing peace and political stability in \nour country. \n The relationship between the Community of \nPortuguese-speaking Countries and the United Nations \nhas been developing in a steady and satisfactory \nmanner. We draw attention to the progress already \nmade in consolidating democracy and the rule of law \nas well as in promoting respect for human rights in the \nCommunity. This constitutes a marked change in the \nlife of the peoples of its member States. Indeed, our \neight countries   Angola, Brazil, Cape Verde, Guinea-\nBissau, Mozambique, Portugal, Sao Tome and Principe \nand Timor-Leste   are committed to pooling together \ntheir affinities and their cultural identities in order to \nestablish a forum for exchange, in a spirit of constant \nand active solidarity. My country, Guinea-Bissau, has \nbenefited from the support of these sister countries in \ntackling the many difficulties I have outlined. On \nbehalf of the people of Guinea-Bissau, I warmly \ncommend the leaders present here, and thank them, \nreiterating our determination to strengthen the \nhistorical ties of friendship and cooperation among our \npeoples. \n Allow me also to reaffirm our determination to \ncontribute to strengthening the role of the United \nNations in attaining peace, international stability and \ndevelopment. We support the peaceful settlement of \ndisputes and the promotion of dialogue in all \ncircumstances and situations. History teaches us that \nchange, because it is inescapable, cannot be hindered \nindefinitely.  \n China is one nation, one people. The People\u2019s \nRepublic of China\u2019s contribution to the maintenance of \ninternational peace and security and its partnership, \nespecially with regard to cooperation for development, \nare exemplary. The People\u2019s Republic of China is the \nsole, legitimate and true representative of the Chinese \npeople. \n We are aware of the problems and the difficulties \nwhich we confront in the world in general, and in \nAfrica in particular, where conflict situations and \nhumanitarian crises persist, as in Darfur and in \nSomalia. We hope that a new spirit of cooperation will \nprevail within the international community so that a \nlasting solution and peace can be found in the Middle \nEast. \n We therefore need an effective Organization that \nrepresents the geographical, cultural and religious \ndiversity of the world, an Organization that takes into \nconsideration and defends with equal commitment and \ndetermination the legitimate aspirations of a large \nnumber of countries for just representation and \nparticipation in the deliberations and decision-making \nof the Security Council. \n"

        "file_text": "It is a privilege and an \nhonour for me to address this audience and to represent \nBulgaria in its new status as a State member of the \nEuropean Union. Having subscribed to the statement \nmade by the Prime Minister of Portugal (see \n), I would like to assure the Assembly that, \nas part of the European family, my country is now even \nmore committed to the universal and normative role of \nthe United Nations in today\u2019s globalized world. \n I warmly congratulate you, Mr. Srgjan Kerim, on \nyour assumption of the presidency of the General \nAssembly at its sixty-second session. We are delighted \nto see in the leadership of this body an outstanding \nrepresentative of a neighbouring State and of our \nregion, South-Eastern Europe. I reiterate that my \ncountry fully supports the priorities you have outlined \nfor the work of this session. We wish you every success \nin the months ahead. \n Our gratitude goes to Her Excellency Sheikha \nHaya Rashed Al-Khalifa, for her leadership as \nPresident of the sixty-first session. I also take this \nopportunity to commend the dedicated and energetic \nperformance of the Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, \nduring his first nine months in office. \n(spoke in French) \n I would like to thank the President for having \nchosen climate change as a central theme for our \ndebate. That world challenge calls upon all of us to \nprovide an immediate response based on shared but \ndifferentiated responsibilities of Member countries. We \nwelcome the fact that the high-level event on climate \nchange held on 24 September has given considerable \nimpetus to future negotiations on a new international \nagreement, which will benefit broadly from the United \nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change \nand the Kyoto Protocol. \n Global warming is exacerbating the serious \neconomic and social problems that developing \ncountries are facing. It also threatens the \nimplementation of development goals set by the \ninternational community, including the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals. In that regard, we join other \ncountries in supporting the recent United Kingdom \ninitiative calling for urgent action to meet those goals. \nBulgaria is prepared to play its part in solidarity with \ndeveloping countries. \n Unfortunately, the list of serious threats to our \ncommon security is not short. Non-proliferation of \nweapons of mass destruction, arms control and \ndisarmament continue to be at the forefront of the \ninternational scene. Strengthening the regime of the \nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons to \nmake it truly universal remains one of the major \npriorities of our time. It is regrettable that no progress \nhas been achieved on the pending question regarding \nIran\u2019s nuclear programme. \n Bulgaria reaffirms its support for the United \nNations Programme of Action on Small Arms. We are \nfirmly committed to the process towards adoption of an \ninternational treaty on the arms trade in the near future. \n My country unambiguously condemns terrorism \nand rejects terrorist ideology in all its forms and \nmanifestations. Terrorism cannot be linked to any \nspecific culture or religion. The United Nations must \ncontinue to play a central role in mobilizing the \ninternational community to meet this challenge and to \nmeet the related challenge of radicalism and political \nextremism. \n In order to combat terrorism, we must first \naddress the fundamental problems of poverty and \nunderdevelopment, overcome prejudices and \nstereotypes and promote tolerance in a world of great \ndiversity. That is why Bulgaria has joined the Group of \nFriends of the Alliance of Civilizations, fully \nsupporting other complementary initiatives as well. \n The situation in Iraq continues to be a source of \nconcern for the international community. This calls for \nthe commitment of the United Nations. Bulgaria is \nparticipating in joint efforts to ensure that Iraq will be \nable to achieve its vision of a safe, unified and \ndemocratic State. \n Afghanistan is another example where a powerful \nneed has been felt to see increased involvement of the \nUnited Nations, along with NATO and the European \nUnion, to support the difficult national reconstruction \nprocess. \n Progress towards peace in the Middle East is of \nprimary importance for the international community. \nBulgaria welcomes the resumption of bilateral talks \nbetween President Abbas and Prime Minister Olmert \nand hopes that they will lead to a just and lasting \nsolution in accordance with the relevant resolutions of \nthe Security Council and the Quartet principles. \nLebanon too continues to require a strong commitment \non our part to secure its national unity, territorial \nintegrity, recovery and reconstruction. \n Today, the role of the United Nations is no longer \nsolely to maintain peace, but to ensure that peace is \nfirmly rooted and sustainable. The Peacebuilding \nCommission is now up and running. We believe that it \nhas great potential, and its position vis-a-vis the \nprincipal organs of the United Nations must be \nstrengthened and better defined. We see the future of \nthe Commission as a modern multilateral instrument \nfor the long-term resolution of conflicts. \n The institution-building process in the Human \nRights Council has led to a compromise. We believe \nthat this has led to opportunities for us to make the \nCouncil an effective international tool to promote \nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms for all. \n Bulgaria fully shares the view that human life has \nsupreme value and invites Member States to support a \ndraft resolution on a moratorium on and abolition of \nthe death penalty. \n For multilateralism to be effective, it must \ninvolve strong partnership between the United Nations \nand regional organizations. We heartily endorse the \ngrowing interaction between the United Nations and \nthe European Union. The recently updated Joint \nDeclaration on United Nations-European Union \nCooperation in Crisis Management has provided a new \navenue for joint action. In addition, the United Nations \nand the African Union are involved in an \nunprecedented peace operation, the African Union-\nUnited Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur, for \nremedying the critical situation in Darfur. We also \nwelcome the pragmatic cooperation established \nbetween the United Nations and NATO. \n Various forms of regional and subregional \ncooperation have always been the cornerstone of a \nglobal system of collective security. Bulgaria is now \nchairing two regional organizations: the Central \nEuropean Initiative and the South-East European \nCooperation Process. Regional cooperation in South-\nEast Europe has grown stronger and is gaining \nmomentum. The Stability Pact, which was launched at \nthe initiative of the European Union in 1999, has \nprovided important impetus. In accordance with the \nconcept of regional ownership, the key role today has \nbeen assumed by the South-East European Cooperation \nProcess. Agreement on the creation of a regional \ncooperation council secretariat has just been signed by \nthe Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the member \ncountries in the Bulgarian city of Plovdiv. \n Bulgaria is now leading this process and will \nspare no effort to strengthen the prospects for \nEuropean integration for the entire South-East \nEuropean region. Our priorities focus on cooperation in \nsectors such as infrastructure, security, energy, the \nenvironment, tourism, justice and domestic affairs. \n The unresolved status of Kosovo has a negative \neffect on security in the entire region. We regret that \nthe Security Council has not been able to adopt a new \nresolution to replace resolution 1244 (1999) and thus to \nconfirm its backing for a negotiated solution on the \nbasis of the proposal of Special Envoy Ahtisaari. \nBulgaria steadily supports all efforts aimed at reaching, \nas quickly as possible, a viable and legitimate solution \nwith respect to the status of Kosovo. Such a settlement \nwould guarantee regional peace and stability; it should \ntake into account the interests and the concerns of \nneighbouring countries. \n Thanks to the efforts deployed by the Contact \nGroup Troika, we now have perhaps the final chance to \nfind a negotiated solution. We hope that Belgrade and \nPristina will be able to take this opportunity to find a \ncompromise that can open the path to a new European \nfuture. While these talks are under way, it is essential \nto prevent any worsening of the situation. The \ninternational community   first and foremost the \nUnited Nations, NATO, the European Union and the \nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in \nEurope   are working together with local institutions, \nand they must continue to provide the necessary \ninstruments and the guarantees to preserve regional \nstability. \n Promoting democratization, stability, security and \ncooperation is a major challenge in the Black Sea \nregion. Consistent efforts are required so that we can \narrive at a settlement of the of the frozen conflicts in \nTransdniestria and in the southern Caucasus, which \ncontinue to undermine stability and hamper regional \ncooperation. \n Bulgaria actively supports the formulation and \nimplementation of the Black Sea dimension in the \npolicy of good-neighbourliness with the European \nUnion. Major projects have been started in important \nsectors such as transportation, energy, trade, \nenvironment and border security. Stability and \npredictability in this region are more important than \never to ensure energy security in Europe and to ensure \nthe diversification and reliability of energy supplies to \nthe continent. \n Bulgaria is firmly convinced that in order for the \nUnited Nations to play its role effectively worldwide, it \nmust steadfastly pursue the radical reforms identified \nat the 2005 World Summit. Progress was achieved at \nthe sixty-first session, but much remains to be done so \nthat the reforms meet the international community\u2019s \nhopes. \n Despite the good-faith efforts of the mediators, \nno tangible progress has been seen on a question that \nhas been discussed at length: reform of the Security \nCouncil. My delegation supports the recommendation \nto move this process forward to the negotiation phase, \nwith a view to reaching a broadly acceptable \ncompromise that would take account of equitable \ngeographic representation. It is obvious that reform of \nthe Council will not be an easy task. We will require \ninterim solutions at various stages over a certain period \nof time. The first step, however, cannot be put off \nindefinitely, because if we are unable to reform the \nSecurity Council, then broad reform of the United \nNations will be incomplete. \n A critical consideration of the implementation of \na number of pilot countries in the One United Nations \nInitiative has revealed positive results. But consensus \nhas yet to emerge on how to further the process of \nattaining system-wide coherence in the work of the \nUnited Nations. We hope that the final outcome will \ntake the form of improved and increased development \nassistance, which would go together with a United \nNations synergy in the concerned countries and the \ncompetent structures. \n In conclusion, we should recognize that progress \nhas been made in a number of reform areas. But we \nhave not yet achieved enough. Bulgaria expects that \nthe remaining tasks on the United Nations reform \nagenda will be pursued energetically and without delay. \nTo that end we appeal to Member States to show more \nflexibility on the decisions needed to ensure the \nconsistency of the reform process. It is in our common \ninterest to ensure that the sixty-second session is a \nsuccess. So let us work together and with goodwill to \nmake it happen. \n"

That is why I want to use this platform to \nexpress my admiration and support for United Nations \nmissions around the world, from Lebanon to Liberia, \nfrom Congo and Haiti to East Timor, which, even as we \nmeet in New York this week, are saving lives and \nspreading hope. \n Since 1946, when the first meeting of the General \nAssembly took place in London, the United Kingdom \nhas been determined to fulfil its international \nresponsibilities through the United Nations. The new \nGovernment in the United Kingdom, under the \nleadership of Gordon Brown, is proud to continue that \ntradition, and I reaffirm our commitment today. \n The focus at this session has been on immediate \nand pressing issues. In the Middle East, we need urgent \naction towards a two-State solution that addresses the \nsecurity of Israelis and the rights of Palestinians at the \nsame time.  \n In Iraq, recent security gains can only be \nsustained through continued support for the \ndevelopment of the Iraqi security forces, through \nnational reconciliation and through political support \nfrom the whole region. \n Our international community depends on \nresponsibilities as well as rights. If Iran wants to be a \nleading and respected country, it must cease its support \nfor terrorist groups in Iraq and Afghanistan and end its \ndefiance of three Security Council resolutions in \nrespect of its nuclear programme. \n In Zimbabwe, we need United Nations action to \nsupport African leadership to reverse the vicious cycle \nof economic and social devastation that now afflicts \nthe country. \n We have all seen the extraordinary scenes in \nBurma. I call on the regime to allow peaceful protest, \nencourage national dialogue and promote genuine \nreconciliation. Let us today send a message to the \nmonks on the streets of Burma: we support your \ndemand for a democratic Burma. And let us take a \nmessage from the monks on the streets of Burma: the \nhuman desire for freedom knows no bounds of race or \nreligion or region. It is good that the Burmese \nGovernment has allowed Ambassador Gambari into the \ncountry, but it is now vital that they use his presence \nthere to start the process of reconciliation. \n But as well as addressing the traumas of our \nfellow citizens around the world, the United Nations \nmust be the place where we address the longer-term \nthreats. Today, I devote my speech to one of the great \nthreats to stability and prosperity in the world: the \nthreat of global inequality. I do so because inequalities \nare not just morally offensive; they are also dangerous. \nInequality fuels extremism. It undermines support for \nan open, global economy. It corrodes trust and respect \nand reciprocity between nations. \n The United Nations Charter talks of the \n\u201csovereign equality of States\u201d, and it also talks of the \n\u201cequal rights and dignity of men and women and of \nnations large and small\u201d. The principle of equality is \nnowhere more evident than in the General Assembly \nwhere all States have an equal voice. But in the world \noutside this Hall, economic, social and political \ninequalities within and between States persist and \nworsen. We cannot stand united against the shared \nthreats and opportunities in our world when we are so \ndivided by economic and political disparities. So the \nneed for Governments and international institutions to \nreduce inequalities and promote our common humanity \nis stark. \n Traditionally, we have focused on the divide \nbetween developed and developing nations. However, \nthe growth rates in many developing countries are \nfaster than in developed economies. That is the good \nnews. But there remain around a billion people in the \nworld   one sixth of its population   living in 58 \ncountries, who have been left out of the story of human \nprogress. This \u201cbottom billion\u201d have an average life \nexpectancy of 50 years. Fourteen per cent of the \nchildren in the bottom billion die before their fifth \nbirthday, and more than a third suffer malnutrition. The \ncountries that are home to the bottom billion saw their \nnational incomes fall each year during the 1980s and \n1990s. \n Even where inequalities are narrowing between \nnations, they are widening within them. According to \nthe United Nations Development Programme, in 73 \ncountries   containing 80 per cent of the world\u2019s \npopulation   economic inequality has risen in recent \nyears. \n Every nation represented here has responsibilities \nto its own people. The drive to tackle poverty needs \nopen markets. It needs the empowerment of citizens \nthrough democratic and transparent institutions, free \nfrom corruption. It needs strong and effective \neducation and health services open to all. \n But national action is not enough. Because the \ncauses of inequality cross national boundaries, we need \ncooperation between nations, bilateral and multilateral, \nled by the United Nations. \n First, three quarters of the countries where the \nbottom billion citizens reside have recent or current \nexperience of civil war. Conflict is the trapdoor to \nextreme poverty. Look at Darfur: more than 200,000 \npeople are dead, 2 million are displaced and 4 million \nare on food aid. As the international community, we \ndecided on a course of action in Security Council \nresolution 1769 (2007). Now we need to get on with it: \nan agreement on force composition, swift deployment, \neffective protection of civilians on the ground and a \npolitical process in which the legitimate grievance of \nthe Darfur people is addressed through negotiation. In \nAfghanistan, one of the five poorest countries in the \nworld, we need to back up military efforts to secure \nsafe space with economic, social and political \nreconstruction. \n Beyond those crises, we also need to improve our \ncapacity to prevent the emergence of conflict. That is \nour vision of the responsibility to protect. A critical \ndimension is controlling the spread of weapons whose \neasy availability makes it so simple to set up militias \nand provoke violence and mayhem. Last year, the \nAssembly voted overwhelmingly to take forward \nUnited Nations work towards an arms trade treaty (see \nresolution 61/89). The Government of the United \nKingdom will continue to press for the achievement of \nthat goal. \n Secondly, freedom from conflict is the platform \nfor progress, but the battle against disease and \nilliteracy is the second stage. Despite progress in some \ncountries, the world is off track to meet the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). That is why, in July here \nat the United Nations, the Prime Minister of the United \nKingdom launched a call for action: to honour our own \ncommitments and go further, to build a truly global \npartnership   with the private sector, trade unions, \nfaith groups, civil society and cities   that can meet \nthe 2015 MDG targets. That requires the developed \nworld to meets its commitment to spend 0.7 per cent of \nits national incomes on development. The United \nKingdom will meet that commitment by 2013. But that \nrequires shared responsibility. Poor governance and \ncorruption are the enemies of development. \n Thirdly, progress on aid needs to be combined \nwith a new global trade deal that opens up economies \non a fair basis. Western producers continue to benefit \nfrom subsidies and tariffs, particularly for agriculture. \nHigher tariffs for processed goods prevent poor \ncountries from diversifying their economies. That is a \nbad deal for Western consumers, and it squeezes out \nthe livelihoods of producers in poor countries. Neither \nis it in rich countries\u2019 financial self-interest, nor is it \nfair. The Government of the United Kingdom believes \nthat concluding the Doha trade round this year is not \njust necessary, but also possible, and we will work to \nachieve that goal. \n Finally, we must address the greatest long-term \nthreat to our aspirations to tackle inequality: climate \nchange. Climate change affects all countries, but the \npoorest countries   and the poorest people within \nthose countries   will suffer the most disruption and \ndevastation. I congratulate the President of the General \nAssembly on choosing climate change as a central \ntheme of this general debate. And I congratulate the \nSecretary-General on his leadership on this issue. But \nwe need more than debate. \n The United Nations Framework Convention on \nClimate Change is the only body that can conclude a \nglobal agreement on climate change. Therefore, in the \nnext two months we need an urgent agreement on the \nsteps towards progress to be taken at the December \nmeeting in Bali. Beyond that, we need a road map to \nthe 15th conference of parties to the Convention, to be \nheld at Copenhagen in two years\u2019 time, and agreement \non a global deal that succeeds the end of the first \ncommitment period of the Kyoto Protocol. \n At the heart of such an agreement must be the \nprinciple of common but differentiated responsibilities: \nall countries taking on responsibilities, but making sure \nthat they are equitably distributed, with the greatest \naction taken by the richest countries. The United \nKingdom stands ready to play its part. This year, our \nclimate change bill will be enacted into law in the next \nsession of Parliament to place on a statutory footing \nour commitment to cut carbon emissions by at least 60 \nper cent from 1990 levels by the year 2050. But we \nneed similar binding commitments from all rich \ncountries. \n The challenges are therefore immense. Crisis \nresolution and conflict prevention, the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals, a new trade deal, climate \nchange   they call for all our resources. Military \nintervention is never the whole solution, but sometimes \na solution cannot be found without armed force. \nDevelopment budgets are necessary, but the developing \nworld needs a growth plan, not just an aid plan. \nDiplomacy needs to bridge differences between \nnations, but also to reach out to civil society and \nbusiness. \n The United Kingdom is proud not just of its \nbilateral relations with the countries represented in the \nAssembly, but also of its commitment to multilateral \ninstitutions, which can be a force for good in the world. \nBut international institutions need to reflect the world \nas it is, not the world as it was. The United Kingdom \ntherefore welcomes the prospect of intergovernmental \nnegotiations at this session to achieve agreement on \nreform of the Security Council. We support permanent \nmembership for Germany, Japan, India and Brazil and \npermanent representation for Africa. We are not \nwedded to a single model of reform. Achieving \neffective change is what matters. \n In a world where more than a billion people are \nonline, where companies have bigger turnovers than \ncountries and where global non-governmental \norganizations have memberships that are bigger than \nnational populations, our international institutions must \nlook inwards to internal reform, but also outwards to \nbroader popular movements for change. \n In the last phase of globalization, in the \nnineteenth century, the emergence of new Powers and \nthe breakdown of the international order resulted in \nconflict that scarred the whole of the twentieth century. \nUnless we can build trust and reciprocity between \nnations and embody them in durable and robust \ninternational institutions that reconcile differences and \nnurture common values, the latest phase of \nglobalization could be another false dawn. \n Globalization is not just something to which we \nmust adapt; it is something that we can and must shape \nfor the achievement of our own goals. It must be put to \nuse spreading power, wealth and opportunity. For my \nGovernment, this mission is driven by both moral \npurpose and national interest. We must address the \ninsecurity and inequality that exist beyond our borders \nif we are to enhance security and prosperity within our \nborders. \n We live in a more prosperous, more peaceful and \nmore democratic world than ever before. Let us \ncommit ourselves to living in a more equal world. \n"

        "file_text": "I am pleased to be able \nto address the global community on the first day of the \ncurrent session of the General Assembly of the United \nNations. \n Please accept my congratulations, Sir, on your \nassumption of the high office of the President of the \nsixty-second session. To Sheikha Haya Rashed \nAl-Khalifa, I wish to convey Sri Lanka\u2019s gratitude for \nher astute leadership of the sixty-first session. \n Sri Lanka can boast of a very old and advanced \ncivilization, similar to Greek, Roman and Nile Valley \ncivilizations. One of the important characteristics of \nour civilization is the use of living languages such as \nSinhala and Tamil, two languages used by many even \ntoday. I therefore consider it my obligation to use \nSinhala, a living language, to address the General \nAssembly. \n Let me begin by quoting the immortal words of \nSir Isaac Newton: \u201cWe build too many walls and not \nenough bridges\u201d. We all became Members of an \nOrganization that was created to let all our voices be \nheard and to avoid an approach aimed at resolving \nproblems through violence, revenge and blame. Yet we \nsee a trend to find fault, to place countries in the dock \nand penalize those who do not fall into line. Instead of \nseeking solutions through cooperation, we have often \ncreated suspicion and built walls between ourselves \nthrough double standards. \n I am proud to inform the Assembly that, despite \nthe significant challenge posed by the ongoing conflict \nwith a ruthless terrorist group in the north of our \ncountry, we have freed the Eastern Province from \nterrorism and restored law and order there. My \nGovernment has already launched a massive \nprogramme of rehabilitation and reconstruction in the \neast. We propose to make the Eastern Province of Sri \nLanka a model for development and rehabilitation, \nessentially through our own effort but also with the \nassistance of all donors. We are taking steps to return \nthe usurped rights of the people by conducting \nprovincial and local Government elections in the east \nearly next year. There is a clear opportunity for the \ninternational community to play a vital role in breaking \nthe cycle of conflict by focusing on development. \nWe launched military operations only to exert \npressure on terrorists in order to convince them that it \nwould not be possible for them to obtain a military \nvictory. Our goal remains a negotiated and honourable \nend to this unfortunate conflict. I must say that the All \nParty Representative Committee is working \nsuccessfully towards it. \n Sri Lanka was one of the first developing \ncountries to promote universal health and education, \ngender equality and social mobilization. We have been \nable to achieve exceptional socio-economic \nindicators   way ahead of those normally expected of \na country in the lower-middle income range   and are \non the way to achieving or surpassing many of the \nMillennium Development Goals. It is a beautiful sight \non our rural roads to see thousands of children in clean \nwhite uniforms heading for school. It is a fine example \nof our success in achieving education for all. \n Despite 25 years of brutal terrorism, we have \nbeen able to continue with this social development. My \nGovernment maintains a policy of openness and \ncooperation with all international human rights \nmechanisms, and a number of high-level officials have \nvisited Sri Lanka recently. Sri Lanka\u2019s ancient \ncivilization was rooted in the Buddhist principles of \nmetta and ahimsa   metta being loving kindness to all \nliving beings and ahimsa being a deep respect for life. \nHuman rights have been an essential part of our great \ncultural tradition for millennia. It is therefore nothing \nnew for us to protect human rights. Women in \npre-colonial Sri Lanka enjoyed rights that are \nprescribed under the Convention on the Elimination of \nAll Forms of Discrimination against Women   \nincluding rights of property ownership and inheritance \nrights. It was certainly no accident that Sri Lanka \nproduced the first democratically elected woman Prime \nMinister in the world in 1960. \n Guided by the principles of Buddhism, we have \nlong respected the rights of our fellow human beings. It \nhas therefore not been necessary for us to experience \nglobal wars or the deaths of millions to learn to \nrecognize their value. My country has no record of \ninflicting misery on fellow human beings for the \npurpose of empire-building, for commercial advantage \nor for religious righteousness. Sri Lanka, as one of the \nfounding members of the Human Rights Council, \nbelieves that human rights are too important to be used \nas a tool to victimize States for political advantage. It \nis essential that international action to facilitate \ncompliance with human rights standards be fair and \neven-handed. Human rights have to be protected and \nadvanced for their own sake, not for political gain. \n Even as we are gathered here, State sovereignty, \ncivil society and the rule of law are increasingly being \nthreatened by terrorism and other illegal and illicit \nactivities in many countries. We need to be vigilant \nabout these activities. Although the United Nations \nsystem has set up mechanisms to deal with many of \nthese problems, the capacity of the United Nations to \naddress these challenges effectively has been brought \ninto question. There are many Member States \nrepresented in the Assembly today that have first-hand \nexperience of the havoc caused by brutish terrorism, \nwhich has stretched out its claws to many corners of \nthe world to mar innocent lives. All terrorist attacks  \nwhether in New York, Mumbai, Cairo, London or \nColombo   are acts that threaten the democratic way \nof life, and must be condemned unreservedly. \n Terrorism anywhere is terrorism. There is nothing \ngood in terrorism. Sri Lanka has taken an up-front \nposition in the global community\u2019s efforts to deal with \nterrorism. We have become party to 11 of the 13 United \nNations conventions for the suppression of various acts \nof terrorism. We think that the comprehensive \nconvention on international terrorism   which, in our \nview, remains a priority   is a hostage to endless \ndiscussion. I emphasize that we must conclude those \nnegotiations soon. \n In whatever continent there are conflicts, those \nwill affect the world economy. Peace in the Middle \nEast would have a great impact on our economy. \nSolutions sought for conflicts in various countries must \nbe indigenous. Otherwise, even if the international \ncommunity is appeased, people in the countries saddled \nwith conflicts will not be satisfied. That would be a \nblow to democracy. At this point, we must focus our \nattention on the Palestinians who are striving for an \nindependent State. The world community must help \nthem to manage their country without any undue \ninfluence. \n We strongly support the strengthening of United \nNations mechanisms for countering fund-raising for \nillegal and illicit activities. We encourage the \nSecretary-General to allocate more resources to this \narea, especially to enhance technical skills in countries \nthat do not have such skills. Many developing \ncountries would benefit from such assistance. We need \nto have a better mechanism to provide solutions to the \nproblems confronting us. Support from all Member \nStates should be obtained for this purpose. \n The United Nations has a mixed record of \nachievements. As resources received by the United \nNations are limited, it has been only possible to deliver \nlimited results. We need to focus on these as they often \nhave been characterized by countless, poorly \ncoordinated, ineffectively designed, ineptly staffed and \noverlapping programmes, with unnecessary inter-\nagency competition. The United Nations must always \nremember that its primary function is to render \nassistance for the well-being of its Member States. \n We have rounded the Development Decade \ndeclared by the General Assembly. My country has \ndeclared the \u201cMahinda Chintana\u201d 10-year vision to \nusher in a new Sri Lanka in line with those goals. \nThrough that we are committed to achieving the \nMillennium Development Goals. We have accorded \npriority to the areas liberated from terrorism, those that \nhave been devastated by natural disasters and rural \nareas lagging behind in development. However, it is a \nhuge challenge for us to fill the gap created by the loss \nof human lives arising out of disasters. \n We are implementing a rural development \ninitiative based on Maga Neguma, the road \ndevelopment programme, and \u201cGama Neguma\u201d, the \nrural reawakening programme and a national \ninfrastructure development initiative. The \u201cMahinda \nChintana\u201d 10-year development vision includes \ncontinuous qualitative upgrading of education and \nhealth programmes in all areas, livelihood initiatives \nfor low-income groups, and broad social welfare \nprogrammes covering poor and disadvantaged \nmembers of society, aimed specially at children and \nwomen. We also implement programmes to protect our \npeople from narcotic drugs and diseases transmitted \nthrough social contact. \n The working population, as well as low-income \nand poor groups in developing countries such as ours, \nface tough challenges due to escalating world oil prices \nand increases in the prices of essential food items. \nSimilarly, we are severely affected by natural disasters \nand uncertainties in the world financial markets. For \nthose reasons, it has become a challenge to achieve the \nMillennium Development Goals declared by the \nAssembly. \n The World Bank, established for economic \ndevelopment, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), \nwhich was set up for financial stability, and other \nregional banks established at the same time as this \nworld organization, all need to implement new \nprogrammes to assist the countries affected by these \nchallenges. Priority must be given to providing \nresources for this purpose. \n I believe that our obligation as global leaders at \nthese sessions of the General Assembly, is to commit \nourselves to programmes that will eradicate terrorism, \nestablish human-welfare-oriented development, \nestablish democracy and ensure there is hope for \nlow-income groups for economic development. \nAccordingly, I appeal to the global community to make \nthe sixty-second session the beginning of a new \nchapter, rather than just another session. \n"

        "file_text": "I wish to begin by \nconveying my respect and gratitude to Ms. Haya \nRashed Al-Khalifa, who presided over the sixty-first \nsession of the General Assembly. I also sincerely \ncongratulate her successor, Mr. Srgjan Kerim, the \nnewly elected President of the General Assembly at its \nsixty-second session.  \n The current session is the best proof that we live \nin a world of numerous contradictions and multiple \napproaches to the basic issues facing humankind today. \nWe can say that what some people took to be obvious \nfollowing the fall of communism in 1989, which came \nto be called the end of history in the academic world, \nwas not borne out by reality. History is rife with such \ncontradictions, which are linked above all to \ninequalities in economic development between various \ncountries and regions. Echoes of those inequalities are \nheard every year in this Assembly Hall, and we have \nheard them today as well. \n The problem is closely tied to an issue that has \nbeen discussed in the past few days in the course of the \nhigh-level event on climate change. I thank the \nSecretary-General for his initiative of convening that \nevent. The topic of global warming is one of the key \nthemes of this session. The problem can be considered \nfrom various perspectives. \n First, as President Vaclav Klaus of the Czech \nRepublic noted, the causes of global warming are not \nobvious. A debate is under way concerning those \ncauses. In my country, some support the theory that \nclimate change is not caused by human activities, but \nthose people are in the minority. Most experts in the \nfield claim that human economic activities, especially \nthe generation of carbon dioxide, are the factors behind \nclimate change, which has been dramatically described \nby many speakers over the past two days. \n The problems and the efforts to resolve them are \nintrinsically linked to the contradictions of our world. \nWhen the first climate convention was adopted some \n12 years ago, the developed countries were believed to \nbe the main perpetrators of excessive carbon dioxide \nemissions, but much has changed since then. In many \nrespects, we have observed changes for the better. Two \nof the largest countries on the planet, China and India, \nhave begun to grow dynamically. That growth has \nclearly led to increased emissions to carbon dioxide, \nwhich contribute to climate warming. \n How can we solve the problem? The 1997 Kyoto \nProtocol set out three methods, two of which would \ncontribute most to limiting the carbon dioxide \nemissions of the highly developed countries, while the \nthird alone promotes, to a certain degree, the mitigation \nof such emissions by the less developed. The results of \nthe Kyoto Protocol have been significant, but they do \nnot resolve every issue and the Protocol has not been \nratified by every country. Many powerful States have \nfailed to adopt it, but in any case it will no longer be in \neffect after 2012. \n Thus, the world is facing a new challenge. On the \none hand, as the representative of a developed \ncountry - though it is not among the most \ndeveloped - I would stress that we cannot limit the \nless wealthy countries' right to development. On the \nother, we must make progress towards resolving the \nproblems under discussion. We must therefore consider \nthe best way to achieve progress. \n I agree with those who claim, regardless of the \ncountries they represent, that the problem cannot be \nresolved exclusively by methods linked to the pursuit \nof profit and the treatment of all goods as \ncommodities - in other words, by the application of \npurely economic instruments. The market economy is \nthe most efficient means of achieving economic growth \nand generating welfare, as attested by the failure of the \ncommunist system. However, market rules cannot be \nthe sole principle governing not only the economy, but \nalso social life and international relations. In that \nregard, as I did last year, I call for a much higher \ndegree of solidarity. Without far-reaching assistance \nfrom the highly developed countries to countries that \nare rapidly developing or hoping to grow faster, there \nis no possibility of success. \n What should such assistance consist of? Well, \nfirst of all, the transmission of technologies that \ncontribute to mitigating emissions. Does the world now \nhave regional organizations that would provide for the \ntransfer of resources from country to country on a \nmajor scale? Yes, indeed. We have such countries and \norganizations, for instance, the European Union (EU), \nwhich serves as evidence of the existence of such \nframeworks. Of course, the EU deals with general \ndevelopment and the protection against climate change, \nbut, in this regard, it can serve as an example. It is an \nexample that needs to be globally followed, where \napplicable. The question is who can be the agent \norganizing such international solidarity? The \nexperience of the past sixty years shows that there is \nonly one such organization, the one in which we are \ndebating today, the United Nations. \n But in order to achieve that objective, the United \nNations must be significantly reformed. Poland has \nconsistently advocated such reform. The main idea of \nthe reform consists of the simple adaptation of the \nstructure of the United Nations system to the \nfundamental changes in the political geography of the \nglobe over the past sixty-two years. This is intrinsically \nlinked to the reform of the Security Council.  \n In conclusion, I would like to mention some \nexperiences of my country, similar to those of the \nCzech Republic, represented here today by Mr. Klaus. \nWe recently did away with Communism. Since then, \nwe have achieved economic success and, on the way, \nwe have reduced greenhouse gas emissions by 30 per \ncent. Therefore, we see that it is, indeed, feasible to do \nso. Despite apparent obstacles, the problem is not \ninsurmountable.  \n So, what methods can be applied? On the one \nhand, certain types of production should be stopped. \nOn the other hand, we can develop forestation of the \nland. In Poland and in other countries, this approach \ncan generate fantastic results. But, to achieve this, \nforests must be under general public control. I \nrepresent a country that operates on the basis of a \nmarket economy, but forests are a public resource. \n Some years ago, the problem area we are \ndiscussing today was one of the essential but not \npredominant issues. Today, it is a key subject in debate \nin the European Union. Today it is also a theme raised \nby the United Nations. I believe there are reasons \nbehind this. Therefore, this subject matter needs to be \npursued further. \n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of the  delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of \nKorea, I should like at the outset to congratulate you, \nSir, on your election to the presidency of the General \nAssembly at its sixty-second session. I am confident \nthat your able leadership will ensure the success of our \nwork. \n I wish to begin my statement by reiterating the \nprincipled and just position of the Democratic People\u2019s \nRepublic of Korea and to emphasize its sincere effort \nto resolve the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula, \nwhich continues to draw the attention of the \ninternational community. That issue, as has been made \nclear time and again from this very rostrum, is no more \nthan a product of the deep-rooted and hostile policy of \nthe United States towards the Democratic People\u2019s \nRepublic of Korea   a policy that has lasted for more \nthan half a century. \n Peace and stability on the Korean peninsula is \ndirectly linked to the peace and security of the North-\nEast Asian region and of the world as a whole. It is \nregrettable, however, that there has never been lasting \npeace and stability on the Korean peninsula. Rather, \nthere has been a recurring cycle of tension and d\u00e9tente \nwhose principal cause is nothing other than the current, \nhostile relations between the Democratic People's \nRepublic of Korea and the United States. \n As history has proved, no issue can be resolved \nby resorting to sanctions and pressure. There has been \nno other option for the Democratic People\u2019s Republic \nof Korea   whose territory and population are \nsmall   but to strengthen its military power for self-\ndefence, on the basis of Songun politics, to protect its \nnational sovereignty and dignity in the face of the \nUnited States\u2019 threats of nuclear strikes and harsh \neconomic sanctions.  \n It is the Songun politics of the respected General \nKim Jong Il and our active efforts that guarantee peace \nand stability on the Korean peninsula and a strategic \nbalance in the North-East Asian region. Our Songun \npolitics is a source of great pride and self-confidence \nfor us, because it deters military conflict and ensures \npeace on the Korean peninsula and in North-East Asia.  \n Our national military power has a self-defensive \nnature, since it is intended solely to safeguard our \nsovereignty and to fulfil the aspirations of the countries \nin the region for peace, security and stability. \n Denuclearization of the Korean peninsula was the \nlifelong teaching of our fatherly leader President Kim \nIl Sung, and it has been our consistent position that the \nnuclear issue must be resolved peacefully through \ndialogue and negotiation. Thanks to our sincere efforts, \nseveral rounds of the Six-Party Talks have been held to \ndate. That made possible the adoption of Joint \nStatement of 19 September 2005, followed by the  \n13 February 2007 agreement on initial actions to \ndenuclearize the Korean peninsula. The Joint Statement \nsets out the obligations of all parties in the \ndenuclearization of the Korean peninsula on the basis \nof the principle of words for words and actions for \nactions. \nDenuclearization of the Korean peninsula will not \nlead to our unilateral disarmament, but can be achieved \nby ending the hostile relations between the Democratic \nPeople\u2019s Republic of Korea and the United States and \nby eliminating all nuclear threats on the Korean \npeninsula and in the surrounding region. \n The Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea \nsuspended the operation of the Nyongbyon nuclear \nfacilities and allowed monitoring by the International \nAtomic Energy Agency, thus fulfilling its obligations \nunder the 13 February agreement in a sincere manner. \nThe Nyongbyon nuclear facilities are the parent body \nof our independent nuclear power industry, built with \ntremendous human and material resources. \nAccordingly, it is a courageous political decision to \nhalt their operation and now pass to the stage of \ndisabling them prior to eventual dismantlement. \n As we clarified again at the Six-party Talks \nrecently held in Beijing, the successful implementation \nof the 19 September Joint Statement requires all parties \nto fulfil their respective obligations in accordance with \nthe principle of \u201cactions for actions\u201d. Specifically, it \ndepends on what practical measures the United States \nand Japan will take to end their hostile policies towards \nthe Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea. The \nUnited States should take steps to change its policy \ntowards my country and to normalize bilateral \nrelations, while Japan should make a clean break with \nits past policy of aggression and crimes and set aside \nits hostility towards my country, as it has pledged to \ndo. We will watch closely every move on the part of \nthe United States and Japan at this stage, the stage that \nrequires actions. \n Nothing is more urgent or important than the \nreunification of the nation, which has had to live with a \nterritorial division imposed by outside forces for more \nthan half a century. Ever since the early days of the \ndivision, the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea \nhas consistently sought to reunify the nation through \nindependent dialogue and negotiations between the \nnorth and south of Korea, as it sees reunification as the \nsupreme national task. The historic North-South Joint \nDeclaration of 15 June 2000, a declaration of national \nindependence and peaceful reunification, sought to \nachieve reunification through concerted efforts in \naccordance with the ideal of \u201cby our nation itself\u201d, \nthereby rejecting interference from outside forces.  \n The north-south summit now under way in \nPyongyang opens a significant new phase that augurs \nwell for peace, joint prosperity and reunification, \ntaking Korean relations to a higher level, in accordance \nwith the historic Joint Declaration and the spirit of \u201cour \nnation itself\u201d. With the north and the south sitting face \nto face in a spirit of national independence and love for \ncountry, all problems can surely be resolved in the \ninterests of our nation, regardless of differences in \nideas and systems. \n In order for the objectives of the North-South \nJoint Declaration to be achieved and for peace and \nreunification to return to the Korean peninsula, the \nUnited States policy of hostility towards our country, \nand its interference in our nation\u2019s internal affairs, \nshould be brought to an end. In any case, the \nGovernment of our Republic will make every effort to \nbring about national reunification as soon as possible \nby emphasizing the concept of one nation, defending \npeace, realizing unity under the ideal of \u201cby our nation \nitself\u201d, and upholding the banner of the North-South \nJoint Declaration. \n I would also like to draw the Assembly's \nattention to Japan\u2019s recent attempt to use militarization \nto cast a dark shadow across the future development of \nthe Korean peninsula and its neighbours. In addition, \nJapan\u2019s discriminatory and repressive acts deny the \nnational rights of Koreans in Japan, in violation of \ninternational law.  \n Japan's recent manoeuvres against the \nDemocratic People's Republic of Korea and the \nGeneral Association of Korean Residents in Japan \n(Chongryon), have driven relations between Japan and \nour country to the lowest possible level. In an open \nchallenge to the international community\u2019s \ndenunciation and condemnation of Japan\u2019s treatment of \nKoreans, Japanese authorities have not hesitated to \ndistort history, even going so far as to try to conceal \nJapan\u2019s bloody past crimes, while turning the \u201cself-\ndefence force\u201d into a regular army with a mandate that \npermits pre-emptive strikes against other countries by \nchanging the \u201cPeace Constitution\u201d into a war \nconstitution. \n Indeed, Japan's attempt to eliminate by force the \nChongryon, the legitimate overseas organization of \ncompatriots from my country, constitutes an \ninfringement of the sovereignty of the Democratic \nPeople's Republic of Korea as serious as any financial \nsanction could be and a massive human rights violation \naccording to the provisions of existing international \nhuman rights instruments.  \n We therefore hope that Japan will truly follow the \npath of friendship and peace rather than revive its \nunsavoury past. Unless it makes a clean break with its \npast crimes, Japan is not entitled to a future.  \n Although the first decade of the new millennium \nis already nearing its end, our planet has yet to be \npeaceful, even for a day. Indeed, world peace and \nsecurity are now confronted with serious challenges of \never-increasing intensity. Principles of respect for \nnational sovereignty and equality   the foundation of \nmodern international relations   are threatened by \nattempts to extend and expand the \u201cwar against \nterrorism\u201d for self-serving reasons, and by the high-\nhandedness and arbitrariness of forces that advocate \npre-emptive nuclear strikes and accelerated the \nmodernization of nuclear weapons. \n The present international situation requires the \nUnited Nations to strengthen its central role and \nfunctions in resolving such issues as global peace and \nsecurity and sustainable economic and social \ndevelopment, in conformity with the purposes and \nprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations. \nUnilateralism and high-handedness should never be \ntolerated, as they violate principles of international law \nand the Charter, as well as collective efforts to build a \nnew and just world order, based on respect for \nsovereignty, territorial integrity, equality and mutual \nbenefit. \n Disputes should be resolved peacefully through \ndialogue and negotiations. Collective sanctions and the \nuse of force in the form of armed aggression against \nsovereign States must never be tolerated on any \naccount. \n The Security Council should be a responsible \norgan that truly ensures international peace and \nsecurity. It should not be used by certain countries to \npromote their own strategic interests. \n The peaceful and prosperous new world desired \nby humankind must have as its basis fair international \nrelations in which the sovereignty of all States \nMembers of the United Nations is respected without \ndifferentiation and the principles of equality and \nmutual benefit are observed. \n The Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea will \ncontinue to strive for the creation of a just and equal \nworld order based on the ideals of independence, peace \nand friendship. \n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President,  congratulations on your election as President of the \nGeneral Assembly. Congratulations also to our \nSecretary-General, His Excellency Ban Ki-moon, who \nwas such a good friend of the Philippines when he was \nForeign Minister of the Republic of Korea. We \nembrace his vow to focus on strengthening the three \npillars of the United Nations: development, security \nand human rights. \n The United Nations is a pillar of development. It \nplays a major large role for the Philippines. Poverty \nalleviation is the most important part of our agenda and \nour vision of transforming the Philippines into a \nmodernized nation in 20 years. We want to be actively \nengaged in local, regional and global affairs, because \nthat is the future. \n We believe in the power of the global trading \nsystem to alleviate poverty and modernize nations \nthrough market forces. That does not mean we believe \nthat countries like the Philippines are ready to compete \nhead-to-head today in every sector, but it does mean \nthat we cannot afford to be afraid of globalization. \n By being increasingly connected to the world, the \nPhilippine economy has reached a new level of \nmaturity and stability, with some of the strongest \nmacroeconomic fundamentals in 20 years. Six years \nago, noone thought we could get more revenue, cut \ndown on tax cheats, strengthen the peso and move the \nstock market. Noone thought we could bring our \nbudget into balance, which we did last month, or \nprepay our debts and raise employment, but we have. \n We must both grow our economy and sustain our \nnatural environment at the same time. We are \ndeveloping and promoting our \u201cGreen Philippines\u201d \nagenda. It emphasizes a sustainable economic model \nthat brings together economic opportunity and concern \nfor our environment. \n At the Secretary-General\u2019s High-level Event on \nClimate Change earlier this week, United Nations \nmember nations focused on what the United Nations \nFramework Convention on Climate Change and Kyoto \nProtocol meetings in Bali to be held in December 2007 \nshould do. The Clean Development Mechanism under \nthe Kyoto Protocol has allowed developing countries \nsuch as the Philippines to voluntarily reduce their \ngreenhouse gas emissions through private sector \ninitiatives. But there is a need to expand the carbon \nmarket and to expand international cooperation and \nfinancial support to promote strategies to adapt to \nclimate change. \n Too many nations, both developed and \ndeveloping, believe the environment must be sacrificed \nat the altar of growth. We believe otherwise. We \nbelieve that we have a unique opportunity to get it right \nfrom day one: to introduce new industries that are \nclean and profitable.  \n That includes a biofuels industry that helps our \nenergy independence, creates jobs and keeps our nation \nclean for future generations. We are further developing \nour geothermal power, which is one of the two largest \nin the world.  \n We reiterate our commitment to the global trading \nsystem and, when that fails us, to strengthening the \nAsia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), the \nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and \nregional relations in order to bolster our economy.  \n The multilateral trading system, through the Doha \nRound, remains the best option to address poverty and \nimprove standards of living around the world through \nan agreed set of international trade rules. The Doha \nDevelopment Agenda was launched with an emphasis \non creating a developmental dimension and integrating \nit into all elements of the negotiations. To make the \nDoha Round truly a development round, there must be \na greater coherence of policies among international \ndevelopment institutions, such as the World Bank, the \nInternational Monetary Fund, the United Nations \nDevelopment Programme (UNDP) and the World Trade \nOrganization, so that trade is mainstreamed in the \ndevelopment agenda and capacity-building can be \nfocused on trade competitiveness.  \n As part of capacity-building, we call on the \nUnited Nations and our partners among developed \nnations to strengthen South-South cooperation, wherein \ndeveloping nations with specific strengths can share \nwith other developing nations in need of their \nstrengths, funded by developed nations or multilaterals \nsuch as UNDP.  \n The developed nations were the prime movers of \nglobal trade when it suited them; now some countries \nare slowing things down. That is not right, nor is it \ngood for our respective economies. But there has been \na ray of hope, with the developed countries declaring \nthat they are willing to maximize flexibilities in \nexchange for greater market access.  \n On the sidelines of the current session of the \nAssembly, we hope the contending countries can \ncontinue consulting to find the right formula of subsidy \ncuts and market access to break the Doha impasse.  \n But let us be clear: even as the Philippines works \ntirelessly to move the talks forward, we are not going \nto stand by and do nothing. For us, it is full speed \nahead; preferably with Doha, but full speed \nnevertheless. We recognize that if the multilateral \ntrading system is fragmented into trading blocs, it will \nresult in a more complex set of trade rules. That could \nincompatible with and detrimental to the interests of \ndeveloping nations. In the meantime, while we are \nhoping for a successful conclusion to the Doha Round, \nwe have to maximize the economic opportunities \nprovided under bilateral and regional free trade \nagreements. That will complement efforts under the \nmultilateral trading system.  \n At a time of uncertainty, when the Doha Round is \nfaltering, ASEAN has taken a bold step forward by \ndrafting its Charter. That is our first step to creating a \npermanent sense of community. We are working \ntowards a single market with free movement of goods, \nideas and skilled talent.  \n In APEC, the world\u2019s largest economy, the United \nStates, and the world\u2019s fastest-growing economy, \nChina, are active participants. We have a strong \nalliance with the United States, which remains our \nlargest trading partner and our strongest strategic ally. \nWe have stood shoulder to shoulder for many \ngenerations. We expect to continue building on our \nmature relationship with the United States.  \n We have also forged a strong relationship with \nChina. China\u2019s rise is a significant opportunity for the \nPhilippines. Our overall relations are now more \nconfident and comprehensive.  \n Relations are not just about trade. They are also \nabout people, and this includes migration, a worldwide \nreality. We thank the Secretary-General for supporting \nthe Philippine hosting of the Global Forum on \nMigration and Development next year, and we invite \nall Member States to participate.  \n Overseas Filipino workers are honoured by the \nGovernment and the people for their sacrifice and \ndedication to work, family and nation. We welcome \ntheir contribution, but we are working towards the day \nwhen Filipinos no longer need to go abroad for a job, \nthe day that overseas work is just another career \noption. We believe that our ambitious economic \nreforms will increasingly keep our best and brightest \nright in the Philippines, closer to friends and families, \nhelping to build our communities and provide the next \ngeneration of leadership.  \n The United Nations is a pillar of security and \nhuman rights. It remains the central pillar underpinning \nconflict resolution. Our country is among the largest, if \nnot the largest, contributor of police officers to United \nNations peacekeeping missions. The Philippines has \npeacekeepers, both military and police, in Afghanistan, \nC\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Georgia, Haiti, Kosovo, Liberia, the \nSudan and Timor-Leste. We will continue our \nparticipation to safeguard communities so that they \nmay overcome conflict and regain the peace needed to \npursue development.  \n Closer to home, I have personally advanced the \nprocess of peace in Muslim and Christian Mindanao to \na new level of engagement, focusing on interfaith \ndialogue, economic development and mutual security. \nWe have done so with the largest possible international \ninvolvement, including that of the United Nations. \nPeace in Mindanao is very much an issue of human \nrights, as is poverty alleviation, our number-one issue.  \n The Philippines is the most democratic country in \nour region. We have no tolerance for human rights \nviolations at home or abroad. We support the effort to \nrevitalize and refocus the work of the United Nations \nin human rights. For that reason, the Philippines sought \nand won a seat on the Human Rights Council.  \n The attention of the international community has \nbeen drawn, with great reason and justification, to the \ncurrent situation in Myanmar. This is the time for \nMyanmar to return to the path of democracy, to release \nDaw Aung San Suu Kyi   now   and to involve all \nthe parties, including the National League for \nDemocracy, in the democratization and constitutional \nprocesses.  \n In conclusion, the number of globe-sized issues \nwe will face in the twenty-first century will require \nglobe-sized cooperation. We must build bridges of \npeace and prosperity, and the place to start is in \nbuilding a stronger United Nations.  \n"

        "file_text": "I have  the particular pleasure of conveying to you, Sir, my \nsincere congratulations on your election to the \npresidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-second \nsession. This attests to the esteem and trust enjoyed by \nyour country. Your unanimous election to your high \noffice is also recognition of your ability and your \nwealth of experience as a talented academic and \ndiplomat, which we believe will ensure success in the \nwork of this session. I assure you of my delegation\u2019s \nsupport and its full readiness to assist you in carrying \nout your lofty mission. \n I should also like to thank Her Excellency \nSheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa for her commendable \nefforts throughout the entirety of the previous session \nof the General Assembly. The measures she took are a \nfurther step towards modernizing the United Nations \nand improving its effectiveness. \n I would also like to express our sincere gratitude \nto Mr. Ban Ki-moon and to tell him how pleased we \nare to see him participating in the work of the General \nAssembly as Secretary-General. By unanimously \nelecting him to lead the Organization, we have \ndemonstrated our confidence in his ability to continue \nthe work of reforming the United Nations begun by his \npredecessor with a view to making the Organization an \neffective tool in achieving the noble objectives of \npromoting peace and development throughout the \nworld. We should continue to support him in realizing \nthat enormous and ambitious undertaking. \n Gathered here at the General Assembly two years \nago for the World Summit, our heads of State or \nGovernment took historic decisions for the future of \nthe United Nations. Although we are pleased with the \nprogress made to date, there is still a long way to go in \nachieving all the goals set at the Summit. Efforts must \nstill be made to find the most appropriate response to \nthe serious threat posed by climate change, which was \nthe subject of discussion last week; achieving the \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs); a \ncomprehensive convention on international terrorism, \nwhich has still not been agreed; strengthening United \nNations system-wide coherence; and reforming the \nSecurity Council, without which the overall reform \nprocess will remain incomplete. Algeria, which has \nalways called for thorough and comprehensives reform \nof the Organization, continues to believe that decisive \ncommitment and the widest possible endorsement by \nMember States are crucial to achieving the fruitful \nconsensus to bring about a positive outcome of this \nambitious reform effort. \n The world today faces new types of destabilizing \nfactors and numerous threats that jeopardize \ninternational peace and security. That is especially the \ncase with regard to terrorism, which is by definition a \nthreat to the basic right to life. It spares no region of \nthe world and makes no distinction as to race, gender \nor religion. It therefore requires resolute international \nmobilization and a collective and decisive response \nbased on solidarity from the international community. \nOnly in that way can we ensure the effectiveness and \nsustainability of the effort. \n My country has long suffered from heinous \nterrorism, which we have fought on our own and for \nwhich we paid a great price due to the indifference of \nthe international community in the 1990s. We therefore \nappreciate the daily growing awareness of the dangers \nposed by that phenomenon and of the need to prevent \nand eradicate it. In that regard, Algeria supported the \nUnited Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy, \nwhich was adopted by the General Assembly in \nSeptember 2006 as resolution 60/288. We call for a \ncommitment by Member States to implement it \nimmediately. We would like to point out, however, that \nthe fight against terrorism should not be waged solely \nthrough the use of force but should also entail \naddressing the underlying causes of the phenomenon, \nin particular by finding just and equitable solutions to \nconflicts, especially the conflict in the Middle East.  \n In addition to expeditious measures to thwart this \ndevastating phenomenon, it is also urgent to conclude a \ncomprehensive convention against international \nterrorism that includes a clear definition of the concept \nof terrorism. Such a convention should also clearly \nde-link terrorism from the legitimate struggle of \npeoples against occupation. It should also not equate \nterrorism with any religion, civilization or geographic \nregion. \n In a world torn by conflict and tormented by \nextremism and intolerance of all sorts, it is essential \ntoday that we work to calm hearts and minds in order \nto promote a productive dialogue among cultures and \ncivilizations, so as to dispel misunderstanding, \neliminate prejudices and stereotypes and strengthen \nmutual understanding. With patience, determination \nand solidarity, we should dispel all theories and \nassociations that promote the dangerous discourse of a \nclash of civilizations. \n We have great hopes for the General Assembly\u2019s \nforthcoming High-Level Dialogue on Interreligious and \nIntercultural Understanding and Cooperation for Peace. \nWe hope that the dialogue will serve to bring \nrationality to debates surrounding this issue, in line \nwith the ambitious efforts of the Alliance of \nCivilization. Algeria is pleased at the particular \nattention given to this issue, including the appointment \nof Mr. Jorge Sampaio as High Representative for the \nAlliance of Civilizations. We will spare no effort to \npromote this approach, which is more crucial than ever, \nto achieve a productive dialogue among civilizations \nthat makes it possible for us to address such common \nchallenges as underdevelopment, ignorance, poverty, \nracism and extremism.  \n Despite the Organization\u2019s laudable efforts, the \ntask of decolonization remains unfinished. I would like \nto refer in particular to Western Sahara, which is the \nlast case of decolonization in Africa. Its people are still \ndeprived the right to self-determination enshrined in \nthe relevant resolutions of the General Assembly and \nthe Security Council. The international community had \nharboured genuine hope for a just and lasting \nresolution of the conflict, especially in the wake of the \nSecurity Council's unanimous support for the peace \nplan proposed by Mr. James Baker, former Personal \nEnvoy of the Secretary-General  a plan that \nresolution 1495 (2003) rightly referred to as an \n\u201coptimum political solution\u201d (para. 1).  \n We are resolutely committed to the search for a \npeaceful solution under international law. Algeria \nwelcomed the adoption on 30 April 2007 of Security \nCouncil resolution 1754 (2007), which clearly \nemphasized the need to find a just and lasting political \nsolution which will provide for the right of self-\ndetermination of the Saharawi people. We hope that the \nnegotiations that began in June and resumed in August \nat New York will continue, in order to allow the two \nparties   Morocco and the Frente POLISARIO   to \nreach an agreement in line with international law that \nmakes it possible for the people of Western Sahara to \ndecide their own fate freely and without constraints in \na referendum on self-determination. \n Other tragedies are taking place in Africa: \nfratricidal wars, pandemics and natural disasters. This \ntragic situation only serves to push countries with \nlimited resources into a precarious situation that \ndiminishes the possibility of socio-economic \ndevelopment of any kind. \n Although, from its inception in 2004 the Peace \nand Security Council of the African Union (AU) has \nbeen providing appropriate African solutions to \nconflicts on the continent, and as commendable as \nthose have been, its efforts will not be effective \nwithout the firm commitment and considerable \nsustained assistance of the entire international \ncommunity   such as the tremendous efforts made \nrecently to resolve the crisis in Darfur. Effectively \naddressing the multidimensional problems involving \npeace, security and development faced by the continent \ntoday also requires that the international community \nsupport the New Partnership for Africa\u2019s Development \n(NEPAD), which is a viable vehicle to address Africa\u2019s \nsocio-economic concerns. \n In the Middle East, which is another especially \nunstable part of the world, the situation is \ndeteriorating. This is reflected in daily violence and \nrecurring crises. If we are not vigilant, that situation \nthreatens to undermine any hope of establishing lasting \npeace in the region. The international community must \nonce again become more involved in order to establish \na just and lasting peace in the Middle East that is based \non the implementation of the Road Map and the Arab \nPeace Initiative. In that regard, Algeria welcomes the \nrenewed attention being given to the Arab Peace \nInitiative, as reflected in President Bush\u2019s proposal to \nhold an international peace conference this fall. The \ninternational community should support that effort, \nwhich has rekindled hope for a comprehensive \nresolution of the Arab-Israeli conflict, in order to avert \nfailure, which would have enormous consequences for \ninternational peace and security. \n The situation in Iraq also continues to be of \nconcern. That fraternal country is experiencing scenes \nof deadly violence on a daily basis. Sectarian and \ncommunal violence also prevails throughout the \ncountry, which undermine the values of citizenship and \ncoexistence among the children of a single people. \nThose events appeal to our collective conscience and \ncall on us to mobilize assistance to that country by \nmaking our contribution to finding a solution that \npreserves Iraq\u2019s national unity, sovereignty and \nterritorial integrity. \n I should also like to express my country\u2019s \nconcern about the current impasse in the multilateral \ndisarmament and non-proliferation process: the failure \nof the Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty \non the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) \nheld in May 2005 and the impasse at the 2005 World \nSummit on this issue. This is a matter that calls on us \nto act, for it is of crucial importance to the future of \nhumankind. My country continues to believe that \ncomplying with the NPT entails the comprehensive and \nequitable implementation of all its provisions, ensuring \na balance between the rights and obligations of States \nparties. The three fundamental pillars of the Treaty \nmust be inseparable and complementary. Moreover, the \ngoal of preventing nuclear proliferation should not be a \npretext for preventing developing countries from \nhaving access to nuclear technology for peaceful \npurposes. \n On the basis of that deeply held belief, on \n9 January 2007 Algeria was host to the first African \nhigh-level regional conference on the theme of nuclear \nenergy\u2019s contribution to peace and sustainable \ndevelopment. The goal was to translate into action the \ncommon African concern to ensure that nuclear energy \nserves to promote peace and sustainable development \non the continent.  \nThe issue of development has always been at the \ncore of the international community\u2019s concerns. In that \nregard, it is extremely important that it continue to be a \nvery high priority for the Organization. In the light of \nthe September 2000 Millennium Summit and the \nfollow-up meetings held both under the auspices of the \nUnited Nations and outside the system, it is clear that \nthe issue of development has become one of the major \nchallenges   such as peace, with which it is \ninextricably linked   that the international community \nmust address. In that connection, African heads of \nState, who launched NEPAD, and the leaders of the \nGroup of Eight (G8) met last June at Heiligendamm, \nGermany, and took up the issue of peace and \ndevelopment in Africa as part of the agenda of that \nmeeting. My country welcomes the decision taken by \nthe G8 to provide $60 billion in assistance to combat \nAIDS, malaria, tuberculosis and other pandemics in \nAfrica.  \n Implementing that decision   and the progress \nmade in other areas, such as in effectively liberalizing \ninternational trade   should be important steps \ntowards achieving the development goals set by the \ninternational community. To that end, we believe that it \nis essential that the entire international community   \nand developed countries in particular   becomes more \ninvolved and honour the commitments undertaken at \nthe 2000 Millennium Summit, the 2002 Monterrey \nInternational Conference on Financing for \nDevelopment, the 2002 Johannesburg World Summit \non Sustainable Development and the 2005 World \nSummit. \n In that regard, we are pleased to note that there \nwere a number of encouraging signs during the high-\nlevel dialogue on climate change held at the United \nNations last week. That illustrates that there is now a \ncollective awareness of the reality of the threat to \nhumankind posed by climate change and of its \ncorrelation with the issue of development. In that \nconnection, I would like to emphasize the central role \nthat should be played by the United Nations in carrying \nout negotiations in advance of the Conference of States \nParties to the United Nations Framework Convention \non Climate Change, which is to be held in Bali, so as to \nensure that the meeting produces a global regime to \nreplace the Kyoto Protocol upon its expiry, in 2012. \nThat regime should include an emissions reduction \nstrategy that is fair, effective and equitable and based \non the principle of common but differentiated \nresponsibilities. In essence, it is a matter of \nsafeguarding the interests of developing countries, \nespecially African countries, which pollute the least but \nare the most exposed to the effects of climate change. \n We are determined to continue our active \nparticipation in the international effort to protect the \nenvironment. Algeria has made its energy strategy part \nof its sustainable development policy by deciding to \npromote renewable sources of energy.  \n I am also pleased to note that, on 5 June 2006, \nAlgeria had the distinct honour of hosting the \nfestivities for World Environment Day. In addition, \nfrom 17 to 19 December 2006, we hosted the Joint \nInternational Conference on Desertification, which was \nheld to mark the end of the International Year of \nDeserts and Desertification, an issue which is linked to \nthat of climate change. \n Algeria has embraced the Millennium Declaration \nand has spared no effort to take concrete steps through \nits national development policies. We are also working \nwithin the context of NEPAD to promote all efforts that \nwill contribute to development on the African \ncontinent.  \n Consolidating domestic reforms by strengthening \ndemocracy and the rule of law as important elements of \ngood governance stems from our desire to modernize \nour country, economy and society. In that vein, Algeria \nhas voluntarily agreed to peer review under the African \nevaluation Mechanism established for that purpose. \nThat undertaking is part of Africa\u2019s efforts to \ncontribute concretely to strengthening good \ngovernance in every country of Africa, and in the \ncontinent as a whole.  \n A report was presented to heads of States \nmembers of the African Peer Review Mechanism \nmeeting at Accra in June 2007. Among other things, \nthe report underscored Algeria\u2019s great socio-economic \nprogress. It also welcomed the steps that have been \ntaken to achieve national reconciliation, which were \nthe result of a courageous and visionary political \ndecision taken by President Abdelaziz Bouteflika that \nhas now been realized through a popular referendum \nthat reaffirmed a very broad-based desire for \nreconciliation. \n In conclusion, allow me to point out that in 2005, \nwhen we commemorated the sixtieth anniversary of the \nfounding of the United Nations, we charted a course to \nundertake genuine reorganization in the architecture of \ninternational relations by adapting the Organization to \nthe world we live in today. Only an Organization that is \neffective, just and credible will be able to meet the \ndemands brought about by change and to rise to the \nchallenges produced by the turbulence of today\u2019s world \nin order to ensure peace, security and development for \nfuture generations. That is Algeria's firm conviction, as \nwell as that of the entire international community.\n"

I also wish to congratulate \nhim on the high-level event on climate change, held \nlast week, which undoubtedly helped to raise \nawareness about an issue that deserves priority \nattention. \n At a time when the international community is \nfacing many challenges that test our capacity to fulfil \nthe purposes enshrined in the Charter of the United \nNations, it is essential to strengthen and make effective \nuse of multilateral institutions. In that connection, the \nOrganization must daily reaffirm itself as the \nindisputable centre for coexistence among States and \nthe guarantor of compliance with international law. \nMexico, as a founding Member of this pre-eminent \nuniversal forum, takes this opportunity to reaffirm its \nfirm and decisive commitment to multilateralism. \n We are living in a complex world situation \ncharacterized by armed conflicts of various sorts, \nincluding inter-ethnic conflicts that are not confined by \nborders; the commission of terrorist acts; the \ndestabilizing activities of transnational organized \ncrime; the proliferation of the arms race in all its \naspects; and environmental degradation, situations of \nabject poverty, social exclusion and discrimination and \npandemics affecting broad sectors of the world \npopulation. That is why, more than ever before, we \nneed an Organization capable of meeting the needs of \nwomen and men throughout the world. In that context, \nwe must think about the role of the United Nations.  \n Mexico sees three fundamental approaches for \nharmonizing relations among States and addressing the \ngreat challenges of our time: shared responsibility in \nthe face of globalization, the promotion of human \nsecurity for development and the responsibility to \ncooperate in the multilateral arena.  \n Every State is responsible, to its own society and \nto the international community, for guaranteeing the \nrule of law and the full enjoyment of human rights, \npromoting development, protecting the environment \nand countering new threats to security in order to \nprovide the best possible living conditions for its \npeople. The actions of the Government of Mexico at \nthe internal level are based on those pillars so as to \nguarantee the rule of law throughout the national \nterritory, given the onslaught of organized crime, and \nto reaffirm the authority of the State in the full exercise \nof its responsibilities.  \n The security of the population is not limited to \nthe physical protection of individuals. That is why \nhuman security must be understood as a broad and \nintegral concept that can meet the needs of society as a \nwhole. It is a concept that includes elements ranging \nfrom strict respect for human rights and fundamental \nfreedoms to adequate preparation of the population to \ndeal with natural disasters or pandemics.  \n Mindful of the value of the individual, the \nGovernment of Mexico bases its activities on the quest \nfor sustainable human development, which means \nseeking to promote the comprehensive development of \nindividuals in all aspects   social, economic, political, \ncultural, human and environmental   and to do it in \nsuch a way as to ensure that future generations have \nopportunities to achieve well-being.  \n Within the framework of multilateral institutions, \nStates have freely shouldered the obligation to \ncooperate with others in addressing all problems in \nareas such as, inter alia, combating drug trafficking and \nterrorism and preserving the environment, in which \ninternal efforts alone are insufficient and concerted \naction is required. \n Shared responsibility in the face of globalization, \npromoting human security for development and the \nresponsibility to cooperate in the multilateral arena are \namong the main concerns of our Organization. A good \nexample of this is climate change. As the \nSecretary-General himself has indicated, climate \nchange is among the most serious, complex and \nmultifaceted threats confronting the world. Mexico \nfavours the multilateral climate change regime \ndeveloped within the United Nations as an ideal \nframework for shaping commitments to be adopted in \nthe near future. The United Nations Framework \nConvention on Climate Change and the Kyoto Protocol \nare the appropriate areas for negotiation. \n Emerging and developing countries must consider \nthe fact that the costs of inaction of passivity in the \nface of climate change will be to the detriment of their \nown development efforts. We in Mexico have \nunderstood this. The national development plan 2007-\n2012 includes actions related to environmental \nsustainability, with two specific objectives: reducing \nemissions of greenhouse gases and promoting measures \nto adapt to the effects of climate change. The inaction \nof others must not be a pretext for failing to do our \npart. We are convinced that shared but differentiated \nresponsibilities must motivate all countries to take \naction to the best of their abilities and that developed \ncountries, without exception, must contribute \nsubstantially to the collective effort in the \ntechnological and financial sphere. \n Mexico believes that we must break away from \nthe limitations of the Clean Development Mechanism \nof the Kyoto Protocol, whereby the achievement of \ndeveloped countries\u2019 goals depends on their \ngeographical location. What we need are positive \nincentives to supplement, not replace, the national \nefforts of developing countries. It is urgent that such \nincentives reward the efforts of beneficiary countries \nthat make such efforts in their own interests. \nAccordingly, those that do more should receive greater \nsupport.  \n In recent years, the international community has \nhad to face a series of challenges in the fight against \nterrorism. One of those challenges has been to \nguarantee the maintenance of international peace and \nsecurity in the face of terrorism\u2019s evil effects without \nrenouncing the universal and absolute values of human \nrights. That is an essential condition for civilized \ncoexistence within and beyond our borders.  \n The United Nations has determined, in a number \nof commitments, that measures adopted by States to \ncombat terrorism and to protect their citizens and \nprovide adequate security for them must respect \nobligations undertaken in accordance with international \nlaw, in particular human rights norms, the rights of \nrefugees and international humanitarian law.  \n Promoting and protecting human rights is one of \nthe highest priorities for the Government of Mexico. \nWe, the international community, have the \nresponsibility to ensure universal and indivisible \nrespect for human rights for all, regardless of the \ncircumstances. Today, the situation in Myanmar \ndemands our attention.  \n The creation of the Human Rights Council and \nthe adoption of the institutional reform package, which \nincludes the establishment of a universal periodic \nreview mechanism, have marked a watershed in \nbuilding a more just and equitable international system \nfor human rights. Double standards in this area can no \nlonger exist. With objectivity and in a spirit of \ncooperation, we must promote the evaluation of human \nrights in all Member States without any distinction. \nThat effort strengthens the essential role of the \nOrganization in developing international norms to \nprotect human rights and represents the most solid \nfoundation for achieving the well-being of our peoples.  \n In that regard, we welcome the recent adoption of \nthe Convention on the Rights of Persons with \nDisabilities and the United Nations Declaration on the \nRights of Indigenous Peoples. Mexico remains open to \nscrutiny by treaty bodies and to special procedures on \nhuman rights, which have played an essential role in \nidentifying the challenges our country still faces.  \n Given the multidimensional nature of \ninternational migration, Mexico believes that our \nOrganization is the most fitting forum for dealing with \nthese problems, on the basis of the principle of shared \nresponsibility and of strengthening cooperation among \nStates directly affected by that phenomenon. The issue \nof migration can in no way be limited solely to its State \nsecurity aspects. We must have a comprehensive \nunderstanding based on respect for the human rights of \nall migrants, regardless of their legal status, taking into \naccount the economic, social and cultural implications \nof the phenomenon.  \n We say this from our own experience. Mexico is \na country of origin, transit and destination for \nmigrants. For that reason, in addition to recognizing \nour own responsibility domestically, we must adopt \neffective measures to strengthen the international \nframework for the protection of migrants. The \nInternational Convention on the Protection of the \nRights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their \nFamilies is, without a doubt, a valuable reference \npoint. While we recognize the need to cooperate in that \narea, Mexico is shouldering its own responsibility to \ncreate conditions so that our compatriots are able to \nfind more and better opportunities within our country. \nThat is why the Government of President Felipe \nCalder\u00f3n is taking action on a number of fronts to \npromote public and private investment in order to \ndevelop programmes to create more jobs; to increase \naccess to secondary and post-secondary education; to \nguarantee access to medical services, including in the \nmost isolated and marginalized areas of the country; to \nensure social security coverage; and to reduce \ninequality among our citizens. \n It is clear that the success of our development \npolicies requires a favourable international economic \nenvironment and cooperation among States. The United \nNations is playing an essential role in providing \ntechnical assistance and monitoring the implementation \nof commitments undertaken by the international \ncommunity at the major conferences, summits and \nforums sponsored by the Organization.  \n Seven years from the date set for the achievement \nof the Millennium Development Goals, we note with \nconcern that while significant progress has been \nachieved in some areas of the world, in other areas \nthere are still delays and even steps backward. We \nrecognize that each country is responsible for its own \ndevelopment. However, national efforts must be \naccompanied by international action based on the \nglobal alliance forged at the International Conference \non Financing for Development, held in Monterrey, \nMexico. That will ensure complementarity between \nnational strategies and the development of the world \neconomy. Mexico hopes that the Economic and Social \nCouncil\u2019s new Development Cooperation Forum and \nthe international review conference on the Monterrey \nConsensus to be held in Doha in 2008 will be steps in \nthat direction.  \n International security requires renewed \ncommitments. Although there has been a numerical \nreduction in nuclear arsenals since the end of the cold \nwar, it is disturbing to see the growing sophistication \nof related technology. Unfortunately, that points to a \nnew phase in the arms race. Mexico is convinced that \nthe only guarantee against the use of nuclear weapons \nis a progressive reduction aimed at their complete \nelimination and the certainty that they will never be \nproduced again. As one of the initial steps for \nachieving nuclear disarmament, the Comprehensive \nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty must enter into force as soon \nas possible. Mexico also believes that the vital \nstrengthening of the non-proliferation regime requires \nthe fulfilment of obligations undertaken by all States, \nnuclear and non-nuclear, under the Treaty on the \nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), with a \nview to its universalization. If no progress is achieved \non non-proliferation or disarmament, fear, mistrust and \ngreater insecurity will prevail. In this regard, the NPT \nreview conference to be held in 2010 is a new \nopportunity for safeguarding and strengthening these \nobjectives.  \n We welcome the agreements recently reached \nwith the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea. We \nare convinced that the ongoing controversy over \nnuclear matters in the case of the Islamic Republic of \nIran must be resolved through diplomacy and strict \ncompliance with commitments undertaken within the \nframework of the International Atomic Energy Agency.  \n Mexico supports the resolution of conflicts in \nvarious regions through dialogue, negotiations and full \nrespect for international law. That is particularly true in \ndealing with the most critical items on the United \nNations agenda.  \n We are following with particular attention recent \ndevelopments on various aspects of the situation in the \nMiddle East and their impact on international stability. \nWe support efforts aimed at a new peace process \nbetween Israel and Palestine, convinced that a final \nsolution can be achieved only through negotiation \nbetween the parties with the active support of the \ninternational community. We hope that in the very near \nfuture the State of Israel and a politically and \neconomically viable Palestinian State can coexist \nwithin secure and internationally recognized borders, \nin accordance with the relevant Security Council \nresolutions.  \n If multilateralism has returned, it is now up to \nStates to show the political will necessary to promote \nconcrete reform, ranging from adjusting the Security \nCouncil to meet the needs of our time to ensuring \ngreater coherence in action to promote sustainable \ndevelopment. The response to the institutional crisis of \nrecent years does not lie in alternative mechanisms or \nunilateral or partial approaches, but rather, we must \ngive the Organization the necessary tools to carry out \nits responsibilities effectively.  \n Mexico believes that expanding the Security \nCouncil is an unavoidable necessity in order to make \nthat body more representative. In this regard, my \nGovernment favours increasing the number of \nnon-permanent members, with the possibility of being \nre-elected in order to promote accountability. We \nbelieve that any other formula will highlight existing \ninequalities. \n Mexico is the tenth largest contributor to this \nOrganization and a country loyal to the cause of the \nUnited Nations. We are committed to its reform and \nready to shoulder greater responsibilities on the \ninternational scene. In line with this vision, Mexico has \nsubmitted its candidacy for a non-permanent seat on \nthe Security Council for the 2009-2010 period. \n The Government of Mexico has expressed its \npolitical will to constructively participate in the work \nof the Council in the areas of maintaining international \npeace and security and dealing with questions on the \nworld agenda that are within the purview of the \nCouncil.  \n On this basis, Mexico reaffirms its determination \nto actively contribute to building a more secure, \ndemocratic and equitable international society. \n"

        "file_text": "Let me address at the \noutset a burning issue: the situation in \nMyanmar/Burma. We join the call of many, including \nour partners in the European Union and in the \nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations, for an \nimmediate cessation of violence. The bloodshed has to \nstop. Democratic rights and the freedom of assembly \nand expression have to be respected. We reiterate the \ncall for the release from detention of Nobel Peace Prize \nlaureate Aung San Suu Kyi, the leader of the Burmese \ndemocratic opposition. That appeal was also made at \nthis morning\u2019s meeting of the Women\u2019s Empowerment \nNetwork, which unites women leaders from around the \nglobe. \n We can all feel a sense of urgency at this sixty-\nsecond General Assembly session about the need to \ncounter contemporary challenges with decisive joint \naction. Climate change, disarmament and dangerous \ntechnologies are just three examples requiring such \njoint action, now. \n Let me thus call for relaunching effective \nmultilateralism. And let me make the case for a new \nglobal partnership   the joint search for sustainable \njoint solutions, united by a shared sense of \nresponsibility and purpose. The very concept of \npartnership is key in addressing the new challenges, \nboth inside our societies and in the global village. \nPartnership is an eye-to-eye approach, based on \nrecognizing and respecting each other as equals. \nPartnership is also a demanding option: anyone who \nwants to be treated as a partner has to behave as a \npartner. \n We all know that none of us, not even the \nstrongest, can master the challenges of the twenty-first \ncentury on his or her own. In the age of globalization, \nunilateralism and nationalism are dead-end streets. \nThey simply do not achieve effective and durable \nresults. We thus need both global processes and global \nobjectives. We need to actively engage to build \nconfidence and to counter the erosion of trust that so \noften breeds unilateral action. \n Climate change is the obvious challenge to be \naddressed in such a new global partnership. The United \nNations is the only framework in which a fair and truly \nglobal agreement can be designed. Regional and \nsectoral efforts need to be linked, feeding into this \nglobal process. Furthermore, it is here only that those \nwho contribute least to climate change but are most \naffected by it   such as the small island developing \nStates   can make their voices heard. \n Disarmament, arms control and conflict \nprevention are next in need of a credible relaunch of \nmultilateralism and a new partnership. In the nuclear \nage, we simply cannot afford to acquiesce to the \npresent level of armament and to signs of a new arms \nrace. Non-proliferation and an actual reduction of \nweapons stockpiles thus have to make an immediate \ncomeback to the top of the global agenda. \n On certain limited issues, multilateral progress is \nwithin reach. A consistently growing number of States \nis rallying behind our call for the adoption by 2008 of a \nlegally binding instrument to prohibit cluster \nmunitions, which cause unacceptable harm to civilians. \nAustria is determined to continue leading this process \nby example, with a total national ban of this atrocious \nweapon. \n Nuclear technology is a third field for a new \nglobal partnership. The world is turning nuclear, \nwhether we like it or not. This in itself is regrettable \nfor countries like Austria which have renounced \nnuclear energy altogether because we believe it is a \ndangerous and non-sustainable source of energy. \nInevitably, the rise of nuclear power across the globe \nwill lead to more and more tensions with regard to the \nnature   whether for energy purposes or for weapons \ndevelopment   of national nuclear programmes. There \nis a highly dangerous grey zone between what is \npermitted and what is possible. \n A new global partnership where sensitive parts of \nthe nuclear fuel cycle are multilateralized could offer a \nway out. We should create a regime in which \nenrichment facilities would be placed under the control \nof the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). \nThe Agency would guarantee adequate fuel supply to \nthose who fulfil strict non-proliferation criteria through \nan international nuclear fuel bank. This would help to \ndissuade tensions and make new national enrichment \nfacilities superfluous. \n At present, the Iranian nuclear programme   for \nmany reasons   is deeply upsetting for the entire \ninternational community, not just for some of us. Iran \nshould take these concerns very seriously. It is clearly \nup to Iran to dispel any shadow of doubt over the \nnature of its programme by providing undisputable \nproof to the world\u2019s nuclear watchdog, the IAEA, now. \nLike many others, we strongly support Director \nGeneral ElBaradei\u2019s appeal for a double time-out and \nurge Iran to heed this call. \n Our engagement for peace and security is rooted \nin the firm belief that right must prevail over might. \nSmaller and medium-sized Member States like Austria \nunderstandably have a profound attachment to the rule \nof law. For us, respect for the rule of law is a matter \nnot of choice but of necessity. Together with many \nother like-minded countries, we will continue \npromoting the rule of law and will give strong support \nto the newly established Rule of Law Assistance Unit. \n Austria believes in the power of partnership, \nwhere equality, mutual trust and respect for diversity \novercome the crude logic of power. From our \nexperience, effective global partnership best builds on \nboth regional partnerships and regional ownership. \nAustria is thus committed to developing a new \nrelationship among equals between the European \nUnion and the African Union, at the forthcoming \nEuropean Union-Africa summit in Lisbon. \n To this end, Burkina Faso and Austria will \nco-host a conference in Ouagadougou in November on \nhow to create sustainable peace. The meeting will unite \nparticipants from countries of the Economic \nCommunity of West African States and Europe in an \nendeavour to provide a common input to the Lisbon \nsummit   by furthering policies of good-\nneighbourliness, the rule of law and good governance; \nby fighting the proliferation of small arms and light \nweapons; by creating employment for young people; \nand by actively promoting the education of girls. \n Together with the United Nations, the African \nUnion is currently breaking new ground with the \npreparations for the African Union-United Nations \nHybrid Operation in Darfur. The human suffering we \nwitness in the region sometimes goes beyond \nimagination. We therefore welcome the ongoing efforts \nto alleviate this plight, including in neighbouring \nStates. \n We Europeans cannot credibly call upon other \nregions of the world to assume their regional \nresponsibilities if we remain unable to cope with the \nchallenges on our own continent, and in particular the \nKosovo issue. We need to resolve the last open status \nissue in the Western Balkans now. We therefore fully \nsupport the ongoing efforts of the Kosovo Troika and \nencourage Belgrade and Pristina to energetically make \nuse of that negotiating space. The Special Envoy of the \nSecretary-General, President Ahtisaari, has provided us \nwith a clear sense of direction. We Europeans want \neach and every person in Kosovo to live in dignity, \nfreedom and security. The international organizations \nconcerned, including the European Union, must spare \nno effort towards that end. It is also our continued \nobligation under Security Council resolution 1244 \n(1999), which referred to the specific contribution the \nEuropean Union can make to the stability of Kosovo as \nwell as the entire Balkan region. \n Women around the world are ready to bear a key \nresponsibility in conflict prevention, conflict resolution \nand peacebuilding. But women also need to be given a \nfair share of positions in international mediation and \npeacebuilding efforts. Not so long ago, there was not a \nsingle woman among the 54 United Nations Special \nRepresentatives and Envoys to conflict and post-\nconflict regions. I am encouraged by the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s support on this matter and the recent \nnomination of three women Deputy Special \nRepresentatives: for Liberia, the Sudan and Lebanon. It \nis also up to us, the Member States, to nominate more \nwomen for such positions. \n No conflict is too complex or too deep to durably \nresist dialogue. The absence of dialogue breeds \nmisperceptions and sometimes even opens space for \nviolence. Austria has long-standing experience in \npromoting dialogue among civilizations, religions and \ncultures, and we will continue our activities in that \nfield with vigour. We must actively combat attempts to \nhijack religion for other purposes anywhere in our \nglobal village. Religious leaders must also take a clear \nstance in condemning and fighting practices not related \nto religion, such as so-called honour killings or female \ngenital mutilation. \n Austria firmly supports the current bilateral and \ninternational efforts that are taking place to renew the \ndialogue between Israel and its Arab neighbours. We \nhope that the meetings between Prime Minister Olmert \nand President Abbas will create the basis for \nimplementing the two-State solution: Israel and a \nPalestinian State living as neighbours in peace and \nsecurity. \n We appreciate the efforts by the United States for \nan international meeting later this year to assist the \nparties in their quest for a just solution. We expect that \nmeeting to advance the peace process substantially and \nsustainably by addressing the core issues, and we stand \nready to assist in preparatory and follow-up activities. \nThe people of the entire Middle East region are thirsty \nfor a new perspective of hope. \n In 2008 we will celebrate a landmark in the \npromotion and protection of human rights: the sixtieth \nanniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human \nRights and its immutable foundation, the universality \nof fundamental rights. All human beings are born free \nand equal in dignity and rights. It is therefore not \nacceptable that human rights be revitalized or \ndiminished in relation to geography or other factors. \nThere is no doubt that women must enjoy the same \nuniversal rights, wherever they live and whatever their \nculture, creed or religion. \n Our peoples expect from their leadership nothing \nless than a life in dignity, but above all a life in \nfreedom from fear and in freedom from want. If we are \ntruly committed to human security, it is essential that \nwe make every effort to meet the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals by determined, concerted action to \neradicate poverty and hunger, to promote equality \nbetween men and women and to protect our planet\u2019s \nresources. The Austrian Government has made it an \nexplicit priority to actively live up to the rising \nchallenges. \n Based on our long-standing engagement for the \nprinciples and values of the United Nations, I pledge \nthat Austria will be a responsible and reliable partner \nas a non-permanent member of the Security Council \nfor the term 2009-2010. We hope that the Members of \nthe United Nations will entrust Austria with that \nresponsibility, which we stand ready to shoulder in a \nspirit of true partnership. \n"

        "file_text": "Before I begin, I wish \nto indicate that my statement is complementary to that \ndelivered yesterday (see ) by the Prime \nMinister of Portugal on behalf of the European Union, \nto which Cyprus fully subscribes. \n As this is the first general debate since the \nelection of the new Secretary-General, I would like to \ntake this opportunity to congratulate Mr. Ban Ki-moon \non his appointment to that crucial post and wish him \nevery success. His report on the work of the \nOrganization (A/62/1) demonstrates not only the broad \nspectrum of issues dealt with by the United Nations but \nalso the comprehensive character and vast potential of \nmultilateral diplomacy. Among the aspects of the \nOrganization's work that are of particular interest, we \nnote the disconcerting developments in the Middle \nEast, the modest progress made with respect to the \ndevelopment agenda, the effects of the Organization's \ninvolvement in different crises, particularly in Africa, \nand the increasing impact of its humanitarian \ncontribution. \n To date, we have ample scientific data and other \noverwhelmingly convincing evidence suggesting that \nworld climate is changing to the detriment of human \nand ecological systems as a result of human activity. \nThus, our response to this alarming phenomenon \nshould be the focus of our debate rather than the extent \nto which it exists. \n We believe that it is important for us to define, \nfrom the outset, the scope of the response we are \nseeking to formulate. In the face of the quasi-\nirreversibility of the damage done thus far, we should \nat least put the necessary focus, resources and energy \ninto curbing the galloping deterioration of the situation \nand urgently decide the first steps to protect our \nsocieties from large-scale future climate change. \n The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change \nhas suggested a number of technological and policy \ninstruments that are available to Governments for \nmitigation action. We stand ready to support the \nadoption of a number of sectoral policies and measures \nthat the Panel has deemed effective, such as the use of \nrenewable energy, the use of technology to produce \nenergy cleanly, improved waste and waste-water \nmanagement and the use of alternative technologies in \nexploiting human systems like forestry, fisheries and \nagriculture. \n In deciding and enforcing our response, we see \nno plausible framework other than the United Nations. \nAside from its unique position to address the issue \nbecause of its global character, its success in \nconfronting a threat with such massive potential as \nclimate change will be a litmus test for the relevance of \nour Organization. One could say that climate change is \nthe modern-day equivalent of the security threat that \nnecessitated the establishment of the Organization in \n1945. It remains to be seen whether our system can be \nas effective in dealing with contemporary threats to \nhumanity as it has been in dealing with more \ntraditional security deficits. \n Let me now turn to an issue with which the \nUnited Nations has had a long involvement, an issue \nwhich we aim to keep as one of the Organization\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \npriorities until it has been definitively resolved within \nthe framework set out in the numerous relevant \nresolutions of this Organization. \n For many years, the United Nations has engaged \nin strenuous efforts aimed at brokering a solution. It \nmay be that the task has proved so very arduous, \nbecause the Cyprus issue, when stripped of the niceties \nof diplomatic terminology, is a question of foreign \naggression and continuing occupation of a significant \npart of a sovereign State, entailing enclaved and \nmissing persons, refugees and massive and enduring \nviolations of human rights. \n Cyprus has survived the most difficult \ncircumstances created by the many facets of the \nproblem and has primarily insisted on one thing vis-\u00c3 -\nvis the involvement of the United Nations in its \nresolution: the full application of the values on which \nthis Organization was founded and which it has worked \nso hard to promote. \n So, why does this problem persist after so many \nyears during which the national, regional and \ninternational political landscape has undergone \ndramatic changes? Certainly, it is neither for lack of \npolitical will nor for lack of effort on our part. Rather, \nthe occupying Power has not displayed any motivation \nto solve the problem, and this has only been reinforced \nby the Annan plan, which satisfied all Turkish \ndesiderata, thus being readily accepted by the Turkish \nside. Instead, Turkey has used its dominant position to \ncommand trade-offs of all sorts. \n Secondly, Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s long-standing objective of \ngaining political and military control over Cyprus \nremains unchanged. Despite declaratory remarks of \nwillingness to solve the Cyprus problem, its actions \nconfirm its dedication to its ab initio pursuit of \ncontrolling Cyprus by partitioning it geographically \ninto two ethnically clean parts, with Turkey securing \nrights of suzerainty and the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153right\u00e2\u20ac\u009d of intervention in \nCyprus. \n Thirdly, efforts to solve the Cyprus problem have \nnot been filtered through a system of values and norms \nof international law. They have not been tailored to \ntackling the roots of the problem or even to the \nproblem itself; rather, their centre of gravity seems to \nhave been the kind of solution the occupying Power \nwould want or could, at least, tolerate. In fact, it is \nclear through the conduct and negotiating positions of \nTurkey that it has not contemplated a solution outside \nthe boundaries of the status quo. \n Fourthly, shifting the problem from the context of \nits origin \u00e2\u20ac\u201d that of invasion and occupation \u00e2\u20ac\u201d has led \nto a problem-solving methodology that divides the \ndistance that separates the parties, caving in to the \ndemands of the more powerful party and making \nsuccess conditional upon the other\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s magnanimity. \n Fifthly, the occupying Power has insisted on \ndiscussing elements that form neither part of the \ngenesis of the problem nor part of its solution. The \nCyprus problem is caused by not bad community \nrelations but by outside intervention. Persisting, \ntherefore, with a constitutional arrangement, set up \nprimarily on the basis of ethnic origin \u00e2\u20ac\u201d without due \nrespect for the overriding democratic principles of \nliberty and equality of all citizens \u00e2\u20ac\u201d insults the dignity \nof those citizens and dooms the viability of any \nsettlement. \n We currently find ourselves engaged in an effort \nto implement a process consisting of an Agreement \nconcluded and signed by the two communities in \nCyprus on 8 July 2006 and complemented by letters \nexchanged between the leaders of the two communities \nand the then Under-Secretary-General for Political \nAffairs of the United Nations, Mr. Gambari, on \n15 November 2006. The surprising laboriousness in the \nimplementation of this carefully crafted Agreement \u00e2\u20ac\u201d \nthe purpose of which is to prepare the ground for \nsubsequent negotiation and to lead to a comprehensive \nsettlement of the Cyprus issue \u00e2\u20ac\u201d is not inherent to this \nparticular process. We should therefore concentrate on \nimplementing what has been agreed. The pace can only \nbe determined by progress, with full-fledged \nnegotiations as needed. Sidelining or circumventing \nstages of the process will lead, not to expediting the \nsolution, but to confirming the deadlock. \n So, what does the future hold for the mission of \ngood offices entrusted to the Secretary-General by the \nSecurity Council? For our part, we remain fully \ncommitted, as it is clear to us that we cannot sustain \nthe status quo and must insist on a meaningful and \nforward-looking process that can elicit concrete results, \nleading to the establishment of a bizonal, bicommunal \nfederation, within the true meaning of each of these \nterms. The only process that can take us forward is the \none established by the 8 July agreed process I have just \noutlined. This process is expected to test suggestions, \nideas and alternatives at the expert level, adequately \nprepare the ground and submit to the leaders, any \npoints that warrant political compromise or agreement. \nAlthough the last meeting with the Turkish Cypriot \nleader did not signal the beginning of the \nimplementation of the Agreement as we had hoped, we \nwill not rescind our efforts to put the 8 July process \nback on track. The element of time is very important; \nhowever, only progress through preparing the ground \ncan bring us sooner to an agreed settlement. With a \nview to achieving progress, I submitted to the \nSecretary-General certain ideas and proposals that I \nhope will contribute to this end.  \n Turkey's intentions are not only manifest in the \nnon-resolution of the Cyprus problem after all these \nyears. They transpire from all its actions: the \nnon-normalization of its relations with Cyprus as a first \nstep to becoming a European partner, the non-removal \nof any of its troops from Cypriot soil as a confidence-\nbuilding measure, the intensification of efforts to \nproject a secessionist entity in Cyprus and its \nsystematic violations of our sovereign air and maritime \nspace and of the military status quo. This was recently \nconfirmed by explicit statements of its leadership at the \nhighest political level referring to a settlement based \non two peoples, two democracies, two States and two \nreligions. That is an arrangement we shall never \naccept. \n Over the past year, we have also witnessed \nrepeated attempts by the occupying Power to illegally \nexplore my country's natural resources and to sabotage \nour sovereign right to explore and manage these \nresources. It has carried out unauthorized demolitions \nof Greek Cypriot houses in the areas it occupies and it \ncontinues to destroy cultural and religious heritage. It \nhas intensified the large-scale illegal exploitation of \nGreek Cypriot properties in the occupied part of \nCyprus, not least because this will skew the terms of a \nfuture settlement. \n At the same time, Turkey pursues its own \nstrategic objectives in Cyprus at the expense of \nreunification and is only guided by its own interests \nand not those of Turkish Cypriots. It has ascertained \nover the years that the occupied part of Cyprus would \ncome completely under its political, economic and \nmilitary control. We regret to note that Turkey has been \ntrying to involve our friends and neighbours in this ill-\nconceived effort. Underpinning this strategy is the \nintent to legitimize the fait accompli of the invasion \nand attribute political status to its results. Such a \nstrategy could not have been achieved without \npresenting the Turkish Cypriot community as victims, \nnot of Turkish aggression as really is the case, but of \nGreek Cypriots for resisting this fait accompli. A prime \nexample of those tactics has been the ongoing \ncampaign to deceivingly suggest that the Turkish \nCypriot community is economically disadvantaged \nbecause it is isolated. Considering that the per capita \nincome of Turkish Cypriots has doubled over the past \nthree years and that they now enjoy the 59th highest \nper capita income in the world, one can easily detect \nthe political agenda behind the attempt to link their \neconomic development with the fate of the illegal \nregime. \n For years now, we have been advocating that the \nroad to solving the Cyprus problem is not via the \nexclusion of the inconvenient truths that underlie it or \nthe bypassing of principles that are, for us, the \nguarantee that the settlement of the Cyprus problem \nwill continue to be valid and relevant in a constantly \nchanging world. \n Equally important, we regard the preservation of \nour interests and those of Turkey in our region not as \nmutually exclusive but as complementary and \ninterdependent. Our vision must be to bequeath to \nfuture generations the legacy of friendship, cooperation \nand good neighbourliness. We are afforded the \nopportunity to avoid eternalizing this feud and we \nshould seize it. \n"

        "file_text": "As he  had to leave New York earlier than scheduled owing to \npressing engagements, President Denis Sassou \nNguesso has asked me to address the Assembly on his \nbehalf in order to share with other Member States the \nperspectives of the Congolese Government on items on \nthe General Assembly\u2019s agenda at this session. \n On behalf of my delegation, I wish first to thank \nSheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa of Bahrain for her \nexcellent work. I also thank the President on his \nelection as President of the General Assembly at its \nsixty-second session. The five priorities that he has \narticulated and the road map for climate change, the \ndrafting of which he announced at his election, \nrepresent an agenda that is in line with the objectives \nthat have been pursued by the United Nations since the \nMillennium Summit of September 2000. He can rely \non my delegation\u2019s cooperation when we consider \nthose issues. \n To Mr. Ban Ki-moon, in his first experience of \nthe General Assembly\u2019s general debate as Secretary-\nGeneral, I reaffirm my Government\u2019s commitment to \nassisting him in the direction he seeks to set for our \nOrganization. My country is sensitive to the many \ndisplays of interest in us that he has demonstrated time \nand time again since his election last year. Proof of \nthat, inter alia, are the visit he made to Brazzaville in \nJanuary 2007 and his choice of a son of our country, \nMr. Rodolphe Adada, former Foreign Minister of the \nCongo, to direct the African Union-United Nations \nHybrid Operation in Darfur (UNAMID). We are very \ngrateful to him for that. \n Following the violent crises that shook our nation \nin the late 1990s, the Congo has gradually found peace \nand stability through political dialogue and national \nreconciliation, which remain our ongoing objectives. \nThe return of a number of Congolese who left the \ncountry during the civil wars is part of that positive \ntrend. The legislative elections that have just been held \npeacefully are indeed the sign of a democracy at peace. \nThat favourable dynamic needs, of course, to be \nencouraged, assisted and supported by the international \ncommunity. \n Despite enormous losses in human life and \nconsiderable material damage, at the end of the civil \nwar the Congo was not considered to be a country in a \npost-conflict situation. We had to undertake at our own \nexpense the vast task of restoration and reconstruction. \nWe therefore plunged resolutely into difficult \nnegotiations with the Bretton Woods institutions to \nelaborate a programme of debt relief, implementation \nof the Millennium Development Goals   including the \nfight against poverty   and economic recovery. In that \ncontext, in order not to exacerbate further the daily \nexistence of the majority of our people already living \nwithout the basic necessities, we are trying to prevent \nthe negotiations from being an intolerable burden on \nthem. We therefore hope to bring the negotiations to a \nconclusion as soon as possible so as not to delay the \nimplementation of the necessary reforms. \n The return to peace and stability has allowed my \ncountry to resume its place on the international stage. \nIn less than three months, the Congo will end its term \nas a non-permanent member of the Security Council. \nFor the past 20 months, we have participated in the \nCouncil\u2019s deliberations in a constructive spirit. We \nhave always favoured the resolution of disputes \nthrough peaceful means and dialogue, seeking \ncompromise and enhanced multilateralism. Our \nparticipation has strengthened our belief in the need \nand urgency of reform of that main organ of the United  \nNations, entrusted with the maintenance of \ninternational peace and security. Our position and that \nof Africa is well known on that question. We have also \nfocused on improving the Council\u2019s working methods \nin order to ensure greater transparency and \ninclusiveness in its decision-making process. \n During the presidency of the African Union \nassumed by Congolese President Denis Sassou \nNguesso in 2006, the Congo had occasion to speak on \nbehalf of a continent whose issues occupy the lion\u2019s \nshare of the Council\u2019s agenda. We made the case for \nstrengthening the partnership between the United \nNations and the African Union in order to ensure that \nthe Council\u2019s decisions take the concerns of African \ncountries into consideration and are thereby legitimate \nand viable. We called for ongoing dialogue between the \nCouncil, on the one hand, and the African Union, \nthrough its Peace and Security Council, and African \nStates as a whole, on the other, as well as parties to \nconflicts.  \n We encouraged the international community to \nremain involved in the Democratic Republic of the \nCongo through the United Nations Organization \nMission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, \nincluding after the elections, which clearly represented \na great step forward but left unresolved the questions \nof peace in the East, the disarmament of armed groups, \nthe repatriation of foreign combatants and economic \nreconstruction. Such developments could be facilitated \nin the context of the pact signed at the conclusion of \nthe second summit of the International Conference on \nthe Great Lakes Region, which is an appropriate \nregional framework. \n In the C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, after much uncertainty, it is \ncomforting to note that the process engaged by the \nOuagadougou agreement has opened prospects for a \nresolution of the crisis, which we need to encourage \nand assist.  \n The same prospects for encouraging \ndevelopments are now open to Darfur following the \nadoption of Security Council resolution 1769 (2007). \nIn his statement to the Council summit of \n25 September, the Congolese Head of State called on \nthe international community to seize this opportunity to \nact with a sense of urgency.  \n We must accelerate the pace of work in the \nfollowing three areas, as emerged from the high-level \nmeeting on Darfur held here in New York on \n21 September. First, political dialogue is to resume on \n27 October in Tripoli, where all parties must \nparticipate, bearing in mind the exceptional open-\nmindedness of the Sudanese Government, which has \ndecided to observe a ceasefire once the Tripoli talks \nbegin. Sanctions should be considered for all reticent \nparties. To encourage the initiative of political \ndialogue, which will determine any possible success \nfor the international community\u2019s involvement in \nDarfur, my Government has decided to contribute to \nthe special Trust Fund created by the Secretary-General \nto that end. \n Secondly, peace must be maintained via the \ndeployment of UNAMID. The creation of the force was \na most significant decision that must be implemented \nwithout delay in order to avoid any political setback \nand any deterioration of the situation on the ground. In \nthat area, too, my Government has demonstrated its \nsolidarity by deciding to dispatch a contingent, along \nwith the military observers it sent earlier as part of the \nAfrican Union Mission in Sudan. In that regard, my \ndelegation vigorously condemns the recent attack on \nthe African Union peacekeepers in Haskanita in \nsouthern Darfur. We ask that the perpetrators be \nactively sought and punished. \n Thirdly, humanitarian assistance and economic \nrecovery are more than indispensable to stabilization \nand a return to normalcy in Darfur. With respect to \nAfrican crises, we cannot ignore the tragedy of \nSomalia. As we all know, Africa has committed to \ndeploying the Africa Union Military Observer Mission \nin Somalia, which should be vigorously supported and \nultimately relieved by a United Nations force. Somalia \nmust not become a forgotten crisis. The Somalis \nthemselves, however, must assume their \nresponsibilities and make a serious commitment to an \ninclusive political dialogue that will lead to genuine \nnational reconciliation. \n Until the end of this month, the Congo is the \nPresident of the Economic Community of Central \nAfrican States. Our subregion has always been \ninvolved in international initiatives concerning the \nsituations in its various constituent countries. A \ncontingent put together by some of those countries is \ntherefore contributing to the stability of the situation in \nthe Central African Republic. The twenty-sixth meeting \nof the United Nations Standing Advisory Committee on \nSecurity Questions in Central Africa, held in Yaound\u00e9 \non 7 September 2007, resulted in a series of \nconclusions including, in particular, an appeal to the \ninternational community and the donors to help the \nGovernments of Burundi, the Democratic Republic of \nthe Congo and Chad secure their borders and improve \ngeneral security conditions; support for the \nmultidisciplinary operation to be deployed to secure \nthe situation in the areas of Chad and the Central \nAfrican Republic bordering the \nSudan   the subject of Security Council resolution \n1778 (2007), adopted on 25 September   and pursuing \nsubregional cooperation on questions of security, \nincluding the announcement of the military exercise of \na simulated peacekeeping operation, scheduled for \nChad in November.  \n And finally, still in Yaound\u00e9, on the margins of \nthe meeting of the Advisory Committee, a ministerial \nconference on cross-border security questions in \nCentral Africa resulted in the adoption of a statement, \nwhich amounts to a political commitment, by the States \nin the subregion to implement organizational, \nadministrative, legal and technical mechanisms of \ncooperation in border areas. This will allow us to \ntackle such phenomena as uncontrolled or forced \nmovement of populations, criminal activities of armed \ngroups, illicit flows of small arms and light weapons \nand the illegal exploitation of natural resources.  \n My country also remains vigilant to the threats \nthat weigh on other parts of the world and crises that \nshake several regions around the globe. In this spirit, \nwe have always supported a peaceful settlement to the \nMiddle East conflict that takes into account the \nQuartet\u2019s Road Map and the Arab Peace Initiative. We \nhave also called for an international conference on the \nMiddle East, with the participation of all countries in \nthe region that can make a useful contribution. We \ntherefore welcome with interest and hope the \nannouncement of the November conference on the \nMiddle East.  \n In terms of nuclear non-proliferation, we have \nalways called for compliance with the \nNon-Proliferation Treaty in all its aspects, including \nthe right of all countries to develop nuclear technology \nfor civil purposes. We have always insisted on the \ncrucial role of the International Atomic Energy Agency \nand on the need for a political dialogue with the \ncountries whose nuclear programs raise questions. In \nthis respect, we are pleased with the evolution of \nnegotiations with North Korea, and we encourage \npursuing dialogue with Iran to make sure that there is \nno slippage in the programme that country is \ndeveloping. \n My delegation is also pleased with the \nmobilization of the international community around a \nquestion crucial for the future of mankind: the real \nthreat of climate change. Now, thanks to science, it has \nbeen clearly established that it is human activity that is \nat the origin of this scourge. We agree with the \nSecretary-General and the President of the General \nAssembly that the time has come to act. Therefore, we \nwelcomed the high-level meeting held here on \n24 September on this theme. The President of the \nCongo personally participated in that meeting to show \nthe commitment of the countries of the Congo Basin   \nthe world\u2019s second ecological lung, after the Amazon \nBasin   in the struggle for survival of our species and \nsafeguarding the planet overall. On the basis of a \nstrategic plan called the convergence plan, a ten-year \nplan, these countries have made a commitment to \nnational and subregional actions having to do with \nsustainable management of forest ecosystems in the \nBasin.  \n The awareness that we have a responsibility in \nthis common fight has led us to cooperate with the two \nother great forest areas   the Amazon and in \nBorneo   to promote better forestry and commercial \npractices. The talks that these three areas held on \n24 September, on the margins of the high-level \nmeeting, have permitted our delegations to prepare for \na common approach to be presented at the conference \nof the States parties to the United Nations Framework \nConvention on Climate Change in Bali this December. \n Our constant commitment to peace and \ninternational security today includes many aspects. \nClimate change merits this special attention that this \nAssembly, as the world\u2019s conscience, must give to \nthese great challenges confronting humanity. \n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, I am \nprivileged to stand before you today in the place of my \nPrime Minister, Mr. Manasseh Sogavare, to renew the \nfirm commitment of the Government and the people of \nSolomon Islands to the principles, ideals and values \nthat gather us together here annually for their \nre-examination and reaffirmation. The privilege of \nmembership in the United Nations allows my country \nto sit amongst Member States and stand up for, as well \nas against, decisions on issues that either unite or \ndivide us. Belonging to this Organization for almost \nhalf the time it has existed is a proud feat for a country \nthat is barely 30 years old. The experience of nearly \nthree decades of sovereign statehood has taught \nSolomon Islands many lessons that we can share with \nthe rest of the world. In particular, we are well placed \nto highlight the fragility of our independence as a \nnation of peoples whose survival is both threatened and \nguaranteed by our interdependence with the \ninternational community as represented in this \nAssembly. \n Mr. President, representing my Prime Minister \nand addressing this Assembly on behalf of more than \nthe half a million people of Solomon Islands, I wish to \nbegin by congratulating you on your recent election as \nPresident of the General Assembly at our sixty-second \nsession. Both you and Secretary General Ban Ki-moon \nhave been selected by fate to pledge your devotion to \nduty in a cause challenged by humanity\u2019s survival. We \ntrust you to do what is right to attain the best for the \nrest of us. Your distinguished predecessors have paved \npathways for the progress of this Organization along \nmany routes which you must now travel to fulfil our \nCharter\u2019s promises to us and those whom we are \nfortunate to represent. \n Much has happened in Solomon Islands since my \nPrime Minister\u2019s address to this Assembly in \nSeptember last year. Turning firstly to cataclysmic \nevents, just six months ago, a series of earthquakes and \ntsunamis terrorized, devastated and swallowed up some \nof our islands, their inhabitants, homes, gardens, \nanimals and worldly possessions. From that \ncatastrophe alone, we suffered the loss of more than 50 \nlives and injury to countless more, the total destruction \nof over 3,240 homes and severe damage to another \n3,000 homes. The damage bill is estimated to exceed \n$100 million. Thanks to the instantly televised news \ncoverage of the devastation, the entire world was \nshown graphic evidence of the sinking of some of our \nislands, the elevation of submerged reefs 3 metres \nabove sea level and the submersion of many coastal \nlands.  \n Not visible at the time were the immediate and \nfuture effects of nature\u2019s structural adjustments on the \ndaily livelihoods of Solomon Islanders. Traditional \nfishing grounds have shifted. Agricultural activities \nhave had to be relocated. The debris is slowly being \ncleared. The water supply is being restored. Roads, \nwharves and bridges are being rebuilt and hospitals, \nclinics, schools and houses are being repaired or \nreconstructed. Entire villages will need to be relocated \nand rebuilt. Life can no longer be the same for the vast \nmajority of our people in rural areas, who depend on \nfishing and subsistence agriculture for their daily \nsurvival. Any slight tremor or vibration causes them to \nflee to higher ground in panic. The emotional and \npsychological effects of nature\u2019s non-negotiable terrors \nare what our people have to struggle with for the rest \nof their lives. \n My snapshot of the April earthquakes and \ntsunamis and of their aftermath would not be complete \nif I did not acknowledge and place on record the \neternal gratitude of Solomon Islands to all those \nGovernments, international organizations and peoples \nwho offered sympathy, prayers and a helping hand \nthrough the humanitarian relief that was dispatched to \nour affected areas. Without the assistance and \ninvolvement of all those who volunteered their time \nand resources and the generosity of those who donated \nemergency relief funds, supplies and provisions, my \nGovernment would not have progressed to the \nrehabilitation phase of the disaster recovery \nprogramme as fast as we have. It is at this time of \nsuffering and need that we appreciate the true value of \nhuman compassion and sacrifice. \n With the increasing incidence of disasters all over \nthe world, we must bolster the resources of the United \nNations humanitarian relief programme and its \ncapacity to respond rapidly and effectively to such \ncrises to alleviate human suffering. As much as we \nappreciate the quantum of funds pledged by \nsympathetic individuals, institutions and nation-States, \nwe are left to wonder whether the filtering of donor \nfinancial assistance through national charitable \norganizations is calculated to whittle down its value \nthrough the consumption of largesse in its delivery and \nadministration. Respecting the generosity and altruism \nof those who give and the desperation of those who \nneed requires that we enshrine the principles of \nefficiency and effectiveness to guide humanitarian \nrelief efforts across international borders. Human \ncharity and human suffering are done a disservice \nwhen disasters create \u201cfeeding frenzies\u201d for \nnon-governmental charitable organizations. The recent \nexperience of Solomon Islands mirrors what many \nother nations have undergone and underlines the need \nfor concerted international action to regulate the \ncollection and delivery of humanitarian aid. \n Dealing with the effects of environmental \ncatastrophes rather than their causes takes us only half \nas far as we ought to go. The proceedings of last \nweek\u2019s High-level Event on Climate Change have \nemboldened small island developing States to rally \ntogether to demand the intensification of international \nefforts to curb global environmental recklessness.  \n It appears that the fragility of States such as \nSolomon Islands has less to do with the quality of our \ngovernance machinery and more to do with our \necological vulnerability. My Government wonders: \nwhat is so virtuous about foreign aid when billions of \ndollars can be spent on improving the governance \nstructures of an economy that derives its export income \nfrom the destruction of tropical forests, when just a \nfraction of that expense is all that is needed to preserve \nour forests and finance our annual national budgets? \nSolomon Islands believes that the protection of our \nglobal environment is a matter of international \nresponsibility and that it can be capably addressed \nthrough the enunciation of principles that dictate \nreciprocal undertakings aimed at the continued \ngranting and receipt of foreign aid. \n I now turn to the ongoing disputes concerning the \nfuture occupation of Solomon Islands by the \nAustralian-led visiting contingent. My Government has \ninitiated a parliamentary review of the legislative basis \nfor the continued presence of the occupying police, \nmilitary and civilian personnel from our neighbouring \ncountries. Credit must, however, be given to the \nvisiting forces deployed in 2003 to restore law and \norder in Solomon Islands following many years of \nethnic rivalry and violence. The policing of the crisis \nfor four years has contained it on the surface, without \naddressing the underlying socio-cultural roots of \ndissension. My Government is determined to delve \ndeeper into the historical causes of the friction between \nour peoples and to do what is necessary to resolve the \ndisputes that prevent their reconciliation.  \n The Commission of Inquiry into the April 2006 \nCivil Unrest in Honiara   capital of Solomon \nIslands   whose establishment was announced by the \nPrime Minister during his most recent address to the \nAssembly (see A/61/PV.17), finally became functional \nthis year after the failure of externally orchestrated \nmanoeuvres to derail it. The Commission of Inquiry\u2019s \ninterim reports have exposed major flaws in our \nnational security operations. My Government \nappreciates the support of and the financial assistance \npledged by Papua New Guinea in staffing the \nCommission of Inquiry. The Commission\u2019s final report \nand recommendations should be available in the next \nfew months. \n Our people\u2019s gratitude to Australia and New \nZealand for financing the deployment of their nationals \nto police our crisis with the help of a small contingent \nof personnel from neighbouring Pacific island nations \nis often expressed and is genuine. However, as our \nfellow Pacific island States can readily appreciate, our \nsovereign right to determine the terms under which the \nGovernment of Solomon Islands will permit our \ncontinued occupation by the visiting contingent cannot \nbe undermined by any Member of the United Nations.  \n The long neglect of our internal problem by the \nUnited Nations, followed by the hasty conclusion of \nthe regionally based multilateral agreement, which led \nto the dispatch of the initial visiting contingent of \nAustralian, New Zealand and other Pacific island \nforces, have caused the ongoing controversies \nconcerning their continued existence and eventual \nreturn to the Organization\u2019s doorstep. Viewed from the \nperspective of Chapter VIII of the Charter, the nature \nof the arrangements and activities embraced by the \n2003 agreement, as well as their practical application \nand operation since that time, appear to transgress \nArticle 52 of the Charter as a result of apparent \ninconsistencies with Articles 1 and 2.  \n However disguised and rationalized, intervention \nand occupation allow assisting nations to spend and \nearn substantial revenue for their supporting businesses \nand industries. My Government is too nationalistic to \nbecome captive to the fortunes that justify our \nperpetual retention under a state of siege. My Prime \nMinister and my fellow ministers and parliamentarians \nremain unmoved by Australian resistance to our \nattempts to reclaim our sovereignty and independence.  \n In keeping with our obligations under Article 54, \nwe shall keep the Security Council fully informed of \nthe activities undertaken under the 2003 agreement and \nshall seek its assistance in reducing the financial \nburdens that Australia and New Zealand needlessly \nbear under the current arrangements. \n As members of the Assembly know only too well, \nthose who pay the piper call the tune. Our experience \nwith the Australian-designed cooperative intervention \npackage demonstrates the need for greater United \nNations involvement in the leadership of future \nregional peacekeeping operations. \n The impetus for Australia\u2019s involvement in our \ninternal unrest was a dramatic change of focus and \nheart concerning the protection of its strategic interests \nin the Pacific region. The threat of terrorist penetration \nthrough porous frontiers is sufficient cause for \ninternational anxiety, insecurity and sometimes \nparanoia. Despite global condemnation of terrorism, \nthe struggle for consensus on an acceptable definition \nof terrorism retards the progress of multilateral \ninitiatives in the formulation of a comprehensive anti-\nterrorism convention. \n Illustrative of the potential for overreaction to \nterrorism is the indignity that I, as Foreign Minister of \nSolomon Islands, had to suffer when my multiple-entry \nvisa to Australia was suddenly cancelled last year. The \nwritten explanation for that decision identified me as a \nrisk to the health, safety or good order of the Australian \ncommunity under Section 116 (1) (e) of its Migration \nAct. One would have to admit that that is an incredible \njustification for excluding democratically elected \nleaders of neighbouring countries not known for \nbreeding terrorists. Just over a century ago, many of \nour ancestors were kidnapped and forcibly taken to \nwork as labourers in a country that is now quick to \nregard their descendants as terrorists. Defining \nterrorism has proved to be more difficult than \ndeploring it. \n Moving from the preoccupations of the past year \nto our perennial protestations, Solomon Islands is \ncompelled by principle, rather than pragmatism, to \nventilate again our people\u2019s concerns arising from the \nnon-representation of the Government and people of \nTaiwan in this Assembly. Our recent attempts to \nchannel Taiwan\u2019s application for admission through the \nestablished gateways was resisted   without any \nregard for the legitimate quest of 23 million Taiwanese \npeople for self-determination   by fellow Member \nStates committed to upholding a peremptory rule of \ninternational law also enshrined in Article 1 of the \nCharter of the United Nations. Organized international \nhypocrisy is the only basis for explaining the indignity \nthat the Taiwanese people must suffer at the hands of a \npowerful constellation of States interested only in the \nprotection of trade and investment and not any \nhumanitarian concerns. \n China\u2019s assertion of sovereignty over Taiwan \nmust be the pretence that it invariably is, since most of \nits major trading partners have also forged and \nmaintain bilateral relations with Taiwan, which are \nultimately predicated on politico-juridical autonomy. \nSolomon Islanders have a native empathy for all people \nwho are struggling to reclaim what is rightfully due to \nthem under international law. Our support for their \nstruggle stems from our convictions about what is right \nand just. Our sovereign conscience is not a tradable \ncommodity. Our rejection of regular approaches for the \nreconsideration of our existing allegiances to Taiwan is \npremised on our preference, ideally, to recognize both \nChina and Taiwan on a realistic rather than an \nimaginary politico-juridical footing. \n This Assembly is the forum in which mutual \nrespect and goodwill prevail and enable us to implore \nChina, as one of the oldest civilizations of our world, \nto pledge its non-resort to force in settling the disputed \nquestion of its sovereignty over Taiwan. \n As one of Taiwan\u2019s long-standing diplomatic \nallies, and undeterred by the result recently engineered \nby international political pragmatism, Solomon Islands \ncannot shirk its Charter obligations under Article 35, \nparagraph 1, to bring to the attention of this Assembly \nthe situation currently prevailing between Taiwan and \nChina. The situation is clearly of a nature requiring \ninvestigation by the Security Council, pursuant to \nArticle 34, on the basis that it \u201cmight lead to \ninternational friction or give rise to a dispute\u201d. The \nSecurity Council is obliged to investigate the situation \nin order to determine whether the continuance thereof \nis likely to endanger the maintenance of international \npeace and security.  \n Having now brought the situation to the attention \nof this Assembly, Solomon Islands expects that we will \nfollow the stipulations of Article 11, paragraph 2, in \ndiscussing any questions relating to the maintenance of \ninternational peace and security and making the \nnecessary recommendations or taking the requisite \naction that this Assembly is empowered to make and \ntake under the applicable provisions of the Charter. A \nfull, frank and fair discussion of the situation is the \nleast the Assembly can undertake to affirm our faithful \nobedience to our Charter\u2019s creed and satisfy ourselves \nas to the existence of grounds for our further proactive \ninvolvement. \n Led by Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare, my \nGovernment belongs to a constituency of States for \nwhom the United Nations represents the promise of \nhope for civilizations condemned by circumstance to \neternal misery. The effective representation of our \nhope, voice and vision in this Organization can be \nachieved only by the reform of its governance \nstructures to reflect the changing configurations of \ngeopolitical power and influence. Solomon Islands \ntherefore supports the proposal for the enlargement of \nthe Security Council. We also believe that India and \nJapan must be allocated permanent seats on the \nCouncil. \n The attainment of the Millennium Development \nGoals will remain elusive for many nations unless \ninnovative strategies for debt conversion and \ncancellation are devised and adopted to fast-track the \npoor's exit from poverty. We look forward to exploring \nthat prospect at the forthcoming meeting on financing \nfor development in Doha. \n Solomon Islands has reason to register its \ndisappointment with the Division for Ocean Affairs and \nthe Law of the Sea for its tardy action in releasing \nfunds that are payable to us from the Trust Fund for \nSpecial Aspects of the Implementation of the United \nNations Convention on the Law of the Sea to defray \nthe costs and expenses of establishing our sovereign \nclaims to continental shelf areas registrable under \narticle 76 of the United Nations Convention on the \nLaw of the Sea. We are concerned that any further \ndelay in accessing those funds might affect our \nregistration entitlements due to non-compliance with \ntime restrictions. \n Time deprives me of the opportunity to chronicle \nmany more grievances that we needlessly experience in \nsecuring the benefits accorded us by virtue of our \nmembership in this Organization. The appointment of \nthe Deputy Resident Representative of the United \nNations Development Programme, stationed in the \nSolomon Islands, is a welcome sign of the United \nNations interest in my country\u2019s problems and permits \nus to interact more closely with the Organization in \nprioritizing the remedial action we need to undertake \nfor the betterment of the lives of our population. With a \nvisible presence in our midst and on our shores, the \nUnited Nations will no longer be remote from the \nconsciousness of the people it exists to serve. \n Before I conclude, allow me to take this \nopportunity to extend to Secretary-General Ban \nKi-moon my Prime Minister\u2019s invitation to visit our \nshores during his tenure in office. We sincerely hope \nHis Excellency will honour the Government and people \nof Solomon Islands by becoming the first Secretary-\nGeneral to venture to my country. \n"

        "file_text": "First  of all, I would like to join in the sincere \ncongratulations on your election as the President of the \nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-second session and wish \nyou every success in this lofty office. I would also like \nto avail myself to this opportunity to express gratitude \nto your predecessor, Her Excellency Mrs. Haya Rashed \nAl-Khalifa, for her selfless and efficient work during \nthe sixty-first session. We also join in the words of \nwelcome addressed to the Secretary-General of the \nUnited Nations, Mr. Ban Ki-moon. \n Tajikistan welcomes the continued reforms of the \nUnited Nations structure and enhancement of its \nactivities aimed at strengthening peace and \ninternational security, furthering the promotion of \nhuman rights, expanding its humanitarian mission, \nplacing the problem of climate change as an issue of \ntop priority and addressing today\u2019s other challenges. \nWe believe that further progress in dealing with these \nissues of global importance is dependent on joint, \nconcerted and consistent actions of the entire \ninternational community. \n Tajikistan attaches primary importance to the \nfurther strengthening of the disarmament process, the \nnon-proliferation of nuclear weapons, the speedy entry \ninto force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban \nTreaty and activation of negotiations on the \nestablishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones. In \ncooperation with other Central Asian States, Tajikistan \ntook a very active part in the drafting of the Treaty on a \nNuclear-Weapon-Free-Zone in Central Asia, which was \nsigned on 8 September 2006 in Semipalatinsk, and in \nthe adoption of the relevant General Assembly \nresolution (A/Res/61/88) last year. \n It is common knowledge that international \nterrorism, transnational organized crime and illicit drug \ntrafficking have become a serious obstacle on the road \ntowards sustainable development, inflicting much \nsuffering and causing trouble to humanity. The \ninternational community should intensify its efforts \naimed at counteracting the commission of acts of terror \nand the proliferation of ideologies based on terrorism, \nextremism and separatism, interreligious and \ninter-ethnic intolerance and hostility, and should \nenhance its struggle against the financing of terrorism. \n The global system of combating terrorism, which \nis currently taking shape, cannot be established without \nthe involvement of regional and subregional \norganizations. In our region, the Commonwealth of \nIndependent States, the Collective Security Treaty \nOrganization and the Shanghai Cooperation \nOrganization are serving this purpose. \n We believe that long-term success in combating \nterrorism and religious extremism depends on \neliminating the root causes of these negative \nphenomena associated with social and economic \nproblems within society. It is essential to jointly search \nfor ways of addressing poverty issues, overcoming \nnegative consequences of globalization, and resolving \ninternal and regional conflicts. Actions based on force \nalone will not be able to uproot terrorism. \n Regrettably, today, we witness the merging of \nterrorism with transnational organized crime and the \ndrug trade, which gives rise to our shared and \njustifiable concern. Prevention of illicit drug \ntrafficking, which, to a certain extent, is the breeding \nground for terrorism and international crime, should \nbecome part and parcel of our common struggle against \nterrorism. In this regard, I would like to reiterate \nTajikistan\u2019s willingness to continue constructive \ndialogue and cooperation with the aim of establishing \nan effective global partnership for counteracting the \nnarcotics threat. \n An international conference dedicated to the tenth \nanniversary of the signing of the General Agreement on \nthe Establishment of Peace and National Accord in \nTajikistan was held in Dushanbe in June 2007, in \ncooperation with the United Nations. Almost \nsimultaneously, the United Nations Tajikistan Office of \nPeacebuilding successfully concluded its activities. \nMoreover, for the first time, the citizens of my country \njoined international United Nations peacekeeping \noperations. These events provide convincing proof that \nthe United Nations has the capacity to assist in \nreaching a peace and in ensuring further sustainable \ndevelopment in a country that has lived through serious \ninternal conflict. \n For Tajikistan, like for most United Nations \nMember States, the achievement of sustainable \ndevelopment is a high priority goal. Within the United \nNations framework, much has been accomplished the \nworld over in order to promote sustainable \ndevelopment and to alleviate poverty, epidemics, \nfamine and illiteracy. Meanwhile, the implementation \nof a large-scale programme on the attainment of the \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) will require \nnot only extra effort but also additional resources. \nTajikistan\u2019s intention is to realize the greatest possible \nprogress in the implementation of the MDGs. The main \npurpose of the National Strategy for Development of \nthe Republic of Tajikistan up to the year 2015 and the \nStrategy for Poverty Reduction in Tajikistan for the \nyears 2007-2009 is to ensure stable economic \ndevelopment and to provide a better standard of living \nfor the country\u2019s population. \n It is also obvious that the attainment of the \nMDGs, to a large extent, also depends on the attitude \nof the international community when it comes to \nrendering assistance to developing countries and on the \ntimely mobilization of internal and external resources. \nWith this in mind, Tajikistan joins the appeal addressed \nto the donor community to at least double the amount \nof assistance targeted for development. The proposal to \npardon the debts incurred by developing countries in \nexchange for the implementation of national projects \naimed at sustainable development remains equally \nimportant. In this connection, we attach much \nsignificance to the unification of efforts aimed at \nsupporting sustainable financing for development, first \nand foremost, in the interests of attaining the MDGs. \nWe are in favour of a joint search for effective and \nfeasible development financing mechanisms. Partial \nwriting off of debts could be equally important, since it \nwould make it possible to invest liberated funds into \neducation, environmental protection, combating \nHIV/AIDS and other MDGs. \n Tajikistan wholeheartedly supports the creation of \na mechanism of additional measures aimed at making \nfurther progress in the realization of the right to \ndevelopment, as enshrined in the Declaration on the \nRight to Development. Among the issues that should be \nregarded as associated with that right are the rational \nusage of natural resources for the purpose of \ndevelopment, provision for the well-being of the \npopulation and addressing the problems of poverty and \nunemployment. \n In that connection, Tajikistan believes it has the \nright to develop the hydropower sector of the economy \nby building water reservoirs and dams on the major \nrivers of the country, because sustainable development, \nimproved living standards of the population, \nachievement of the MDGs, the provision of reliable \nregulated irrigation water flows and an increased \nproduction of electrical energy depend on the \navailability of hydropower resources. Not only is the \nimplementation of hydropower projects in Tajikistan \nextremely advantageous for the country itself, but it \nwill also be able to influence favourably the \nsustainable development of the other States of the \nregion. For instance, the completion of the construction \nof the Ragun hydropower station in Tajikistan alone \nwill make it possible to supply an extra three million \nhectares of land with water in the neighbouring Central \nAsian states. Only an integrated approach towards the \nuse of hydropower and other natural resources of the \nregion, based on the principles of mutual \nunderstanding, assistance and trust among the States of \nthe region, can ensure sustainable development in the \nregion and promote a resolution of environmental \nproblems, which are closely interconnected with the \nrational use of those resources. \n Tajikistan is interested in getting support and \nestablishing a partnership with countries and \ninternational organizations in the field of renewable \nsources of energy and energy-efficient technologies, \nwhich help to reduce the usage of other traditional \ntypes of energy that negatively affect our climate and \ndo enormous damage to the environment and to the \nfuture of humanity. \n Tajikistan welcomes the High-Level Event on \nClimate Change held recently in New York and the \nforthcoming conference on the same subject to be held \nin Bali in December 2007. \n Within the context of global warming, \ndegradation of glaciers and the snow cover on the \nterritories of Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan, which are the \nupper watershed zones of Central Asia\u2019s rivers, has \nbecome an ever increasing concern for the Central \nAsian region. According to various sources, over the \nlast 10 years the area of glaciers in Tajikistan has \ndecreased by 30 to 35 per cent. Although supplying the \npopulation with drinking water is being discussed at \nthe top level, and the fact that numerous declarations \nand other international instruments have already been \nadopted on this issue, the situation remains urgent. The \nsolution of the problem requires further coordinated \nefforts on behalf of countries and international \norganizations. This problem is not only addressed in \nthe Millennium Development Goals, but it is also \nranked among those challenges that the world \ncommunity encounters on a daily basis. \n For this reason, the implementation of the \nInternational Decade for Action \u201cWater for Life\u201d, \nproclaimed by the United Nations on the initiative of \nthe Republic of Tajikistan, is regarded as even more \ntimely and appropriate. As part of the Decade, the \nGovernment of Tajikistan has planned an international \nconference for 2008 in Dushanbe on water-related \nnatural disasters, to be held in cooperation with United \nNations agencies and other international organizations. \nTajikistan hopes that all United Nations Member States \nwill participate actively in this conference. \n From time immemorial the water originating in \nTajikistan has quenched the thirst of all nations of \nCentral Asia and has irrigated the dry steppes of the \nregion. However, it is obvious that the region has \nalready been experiencing water-related difficulties \nthat can become more aggravated on a yearly basis. To \naddress this urgent problem, Tajikistan proposes to \nprovide the Central Asian States with environmentally \nsound freshwater from Lake Sarez, which is located at \na height of almost 3,300 metres above sea level and \nwhich could provide freshwater to half the population \nof Central Asia. The implementation of this initiative \nwould make it possible to eliminate the real threat of \nan overflow of Lake Sarez, which could affect millions \nof people who reside in the downstream areas in \nneighbouring countries. \n As for the development of trade and economic \ncooperation with other countries, the major challenge \nthat Tajikistan is facing in this area is lack of access to \nthe sea and other transportation and communication \ndifficulties. For this reason, Tajikistan is committed to \nthe decisions and recommendations outlined in the \nAlmaty Programme of Action for transit transport \ncooperation, which addresses the special needs of \nlandlocked developing countries to efficiently use the \navailable transport infrastructure and to increase transit \ncapacity in order to encourage development of trade \nand the advancement of investments in Central Asia. \n The rehabilitation process in Afghanistan is \ncreating favourable conditions for cooperation in the \nregion in the implementation of transportation and \ncommunication projects aimed at gaining access to \nsouthern sea ports. The creation of new multi-optional \ntransport corridors and the restoration of the Great Silk \nRoad routes seek to establish a unified interconnected \nsystem of communications and to provide the Central \nAsian States with reliable access to promising markets. \nThe August opening of the bridge across the Pyandj \nRiver between Tajikistan and Afghanistan was among \nthe practical measures taken to achieve that goal. \n The magnitude of the challenges facing the \ninternational community requires the further \nstrengthening of our Organization. There is no doubt \nthat all of us must do our utmost to make the United \nNations even more effective in addressing current \nissues. For that reason, we believe that all of us must \nshoulder our responsibilities towards the Organization, \nin the interests of all Member States. \n"

        "file_text": "Let me first \ncongratulate you, Sir, on your election as President of \nthe sixty-second session of the General Assembly. I \nalso congratulate His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon at \nthis, his first General Assembly session as Secretary-\nGeneral. \n I am humbled to once again address this \nAssembly, and I stand before you humbled and \nemboldened. Humbled by the magnitude of the socio-\neconomic challenges we face as a community of \nnations and emboldened by the trust that has been \nplaced in me by the people of Antigua and Barbuda to \narticulate their interests in an increasingly competitive \ninternational system. I am further humbled by the \ngravity of the environmental challenges facing our \nworld today and emboldened in the knowledge that \nwithout courageous and timely action, countless lives \nwill continue to be plagued by misery and countless \nmore unnecessarily lost. \n As the Prime Minister of a small island State, I \nam also humbled and emboldened by the show of \nconfidence we have received from the Group of 77, \nhaving been elected Chairman for 2008. It is not a \nresponsibility that we take lightly, and you can rest \nassured we intend to rise valiantly to the task of \nchairmanship, executing the responsibilities of the \nChair with the sort of professionalism and skill the \nGroup rightly expects of us. As Chairman of the Group \nof 77 for 2008 and like the Chairs before us, we pledge \nto uphold the principles and objectives of the Group, to \npreserve, at all times, our collective interest as \ndeveloping countries, safeguard our common positions, \nand, by so doing, achieve significant advancement in \nthe development agenda. \n I am humbled and emboldened enough to quote \nAlbert Einstein, who once said:  \n\u201cThe world is a dangerous place, not because of \nthose who do evil, but because of those who look \non and do nothing.\u201d  \n\u201cLooking on and doing nothing\u201d is no longer an option \nfor any of us. \n Let me, at the outset, unequivocally state that \nmultilateralism should be the preferred means for \neffecting international peace, security and human \ndevelopment. There are some who would prefer for \nmultilateralism to recede and for the world to be run by \na few dominant Powers. They should be reminded of \nthe intent and purposes of the Charter of the United \nNations, which, among other things, reaffirms in its \nPreamble the faith of humanity: \u201cin fundamental \nhuman rights, in the dignity and worth of the human \nperson, in the equal rights of men and women and of \nnations large and small\u201d. It is no small wonder, then, \nthat the crafters of the Charter pledged their \ndetermination \u201cto employ international machinery for \nthe promotion of the economic and social advancement \nof all peoples\u201d. \n The Charter of the United Nations is perhaps \nmore relevant today than it was at the time of its \ncreation. The challenges to peace, security and \ndevelopment that require collective action have \nmultiplied immeasurably. At the same time, humanity \nhas so advanced that today it is possible to achieve the \nintentions of the Charter on a scale beyond what might \nhave been achievable at the time of its crafting. \nRegrettably, fulfilment of the purposes of the Charter \nof the United Nations seems to be hindered to an \nunprecedented degree by a paucity of political will and \ndetermination. \n However, an equitable international system \nresponsive to the needs of all countries and people is \nnot beyond our reach. In that context, there is a role for \nall nations, large and small, that includes the firm \nresolve to strengthen the multilateral system in order to \ncorrect systemic imbalances that hinder the \nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals \n(MDGs) and other internationally agreed development \ngoals. Systemic imbalances in international trade, \nfinance and international governance keep millions \nlocked in poverty and millions more in a perpetual \nstate of insecurity because they remain \nunderrepresented. \n Indeed, there is a role for all States. It should \ntherefore come as no surprise that Antigua and Barbuda \nis of the view that small States can and should play a \ncrucial role by being voices of reason \u2014 voices that \nare not shackled to the dogmatic positions that power \nnecessitates. The absence of so-called high power \nallows small States to be pragmatic and practical in \ncoming up with solutions to some of the most pressing \ninternational problems. \n We can no longer continue talking while \nhumanitarian conditions continue to deteriorate. The \nsituation in Darfur calls for our immediate and swift \naction. We cannot continue talking while women and \nchildren are forced to live in refugee camps. We cannot \ncontinue talking while tens of thousands of persons \ncontinue to die. \n We must act now. There must be swift action to \nstrengthen the African Union-United Nations Hybrid \nOperation in Darfur, which will support the African \ntroops already there. Every citizen has the right to life \nand the right to live in peace. We call on all parties to \nend arm sales to the fighting factions. We must ensure \nthat that happens.  \n While acknowledging the reality that the \ndistribution of power is skewed among nations, we \nbelieve that talent, ability and good intentions remain \nin abundance in all countries, large and small. Further, \nno country is too small to be able to contribute \ninnovative solutions to some of the most pressing \ninternational problems. \n We in Antigua and Barbuda may be among the \nsmall and the powerless in terms of might and money, \nbut we are willing and able to play our part to achieve \ninternational peace and development through active \nmultilateral diplomacy, and we are intent on doing so. \n Global poverty and economic inequality can be \nresolved only through sustained economic growth. \nCentral to sustaining the economic growth of poorer \ncountries is the establishment of a pro-development \ntrading regime with a fair playing field, where large \nand small play by the rules \u2014 rules meant to create a \nfairer system and to allow the maximum benefits from \ninternational trade to be widely distributed among \ncountries. \n In that regard, we re-emphasize that it is \nimportant that individual United Nations Member \nStates abide by fair trading practices, which eliminate \ntargeted barriers designed to deny access to small, \nvulnerable countries seeking economic opportunities \nthrough such options as Internet trading. \n Equally important is the need for Member States, \nbig and small, to play by the international trade rules. \nThe economic survival of our people depends on that. \nOur tourism and financial services sectors depend on \nthat. Wealthy nations will ultimately have to pay a high \nprice for actions that further pauperize already poor \nsocieties. \n In a local context, the reduction of income \ninequality is a key priority for the Government of \nAntigua and Barbuda. My Government has ensured \nthat affirmative action to ease the economic squeeze on \nthe poor is embedded in all revenue-generating \nmechanisms. My Government resolves to ensure that \nthe benefits of economic growth are shared among the \nentire population, by focusing on employment \ngeneration and the provision of free or low-cost social \nservices in the areas of health and education, among \nothers. \n Climate change is a global problem requiring a \ncollective response, and, if we do not respond quickly, \nthe result will be disaster on a global scale. This \nrepresents a monumental test of the political will and \ncourage of humanity in general, but especially of the \npolitical leaders of the most powerful countries. \n For small island States, the challenge of adapting \nto climate change is not new; what is new is its \nurgency. The increased risk of natural disasters adds an \nextra dimension to the vulnerability of the island States \nof the Caribbean. Because of our size and the nature of \nour primary economic activities, the infrastructure of \nan entire country can be destroyed by, for example, the \npassage of a single hurricane. The livelihood of the \nentire population is at once threatened. \n Antigua and Barbuda, like many of our Caribbean \nbrothers and sisters, has had to place greater priority on \ndisaster preparedness, resulting in increased \ncompetition for the already meagre resources of the \ngovernmental budget. Our situation is not unique. \n I take this opportunity to highlight the importance \nof international action to support our efforts at disaster-\nrisk reduction, through an ambitious climate change \nregime within the ambit of the United Nations \nFramework Convention on Climate Change. That must, \nof necessity, include a commitment to increasing the \nlevel of international financing for adaptation in \nvulnerable countries. \n The proliferation of crime in our already \nvulnerable societies represents a threat to the peaceful \nand stable communities for which the Caribbean is \nknown. In all Caribbean societies, the bulk of violent \ncrime is drug-related. It so happens that the bulk of \nnarco-trafficking activity in our region is linked to \nillegal drugs bound for North America and Europe. \nThat means that small Caribbean economies are \nrequired to pay a high price to protect societies to our \nnorth and in the Atlantic from drug shipments headed \ntheir way. We urge the United Nations family of \nagencies, in recognition of the link between \nglobalization and crime, to provide the Caribbean with \nincreased assistance in this area.  \nWe also need the support and cooperation of \nindividual Member States, particularly those that carry \nout a policy of criminal deportation. That practice \nparachutes graduates of metropolitan criminal systems \nonto societies in which they often have no families and \nno social network to assist in their re-entry into the \nvulnerable Caribbean societies from which they had \nlong been exiled. That is a monstrous assault on \nseveral of our societies.  \n With regard to the problem of drug-related crime \nand the proliferation of handguns, Antigua and \nBarbuda reiterates its call for the strengthening and \nimplementation of the various United Nations treaties \non small arms and light weapons. The scale and scope \nof the disruptions and destruction caused by the \nproliferation of small arms in the hands of unemployed \nyouth in the Caribbean is tremendous. Here, too, small \ndeveloping States which produce no weapons are \nconfronted by the tragedy wrought by guns \nmanufactured in countries that fail to control their \nweapons of death and appear untroubled by the ease \nwith which those weapons cross international borders. \nEven a miniscule increase in violent crime has a \nnegative impact on development in small island States. \nThese perspectives should inform the international \ndebate on peace and security. \n All countries, large and small, have a national \ninterest in eliminating the threat to development caused \nby international terrorism. Antigua and Barbuda \ncontinues to play its part by adhering to the various \nanti-terrorism resolutions of the United Nations, \nincluding our obligations under Security Council \nresolutions 1540 (2004) and 1373 (2001), among \nothers. \n Additionally, we have taken the added initiative \nto enact our own national legislative requirement by \nway of our National Anti-Terrorism Act of Parliament \nin 2005. \n Combating international terrorism should not \ndepend on the trampling of religious and cultural \ndiversity and individual rights and freedoms. Cultural \nand religious intolerance and prejudice and the stifling \nof cultural diversity will only serve to perpetuate the \ncauses of terrorism. \n Earlier this year, Antigua and Barbuda, along \nwith the rest of the Caribbean Community \n(CARICOM), held activities to commemorate the \nbicentennial anniversary of the abolition of the trans-\nAtlantic slave trade. CARICOM also led an initiative \nfor the anniversary to be commemorated here at the \nUnited Nations. That is an issue that should remain on \nthe agenda of the United Nations. My Government is \nproud to have been a part of the initiative led by \nCARICOM member States at the United Nations to get \nthe international community to recognize this \nanniversary.  \n Such international recognition is important \nbecause it provides the opportunity to carry forward \nthe fight for justice. Despite all the modern treaties and \ninternational statutes and recognition of the slave trade \nas a crime against humanity, this crime remains \nunpunished; the entities remain unaccountable for their \nparticipation and profiteering. Maintaining \ninternational focus on this issue gives our nations and \nthe world the opportunity to make progress in repairing \nthe damage caused by 500 years of slavery and \ncolonialism, so that those who profited from such a \ncrime may be urged to take responsibility for rectifying \nthe effects that remain today. \n Progress may be slow in the fight for justice for \nthe descendants of slaves, but we must not give up. As \na community of sovereign nations, Antigua and \nBarbuda and the other CARICOM member States \nconsider it necessary for the international community \nto become accountable for this crime against humanity. \nThe question of reparations must be placed on the \nUnited Nations agenda now. \n We urge the United Nations system and Member \nStates to continue to pay special attention to the issue \nof gender equality and empowerment of women. The \ndividends from investing in gender equality and \nempowerment of women are two-fold: democratic \ngains, on the one hand, and development gains, on the \nother. My Government has placed top priority on \nempowering women politically and economically. The \nSpeaker of the House of Assembly in Antigua and \nBarbuda is female. So, too, are the President of the \nSenate and the Clerk of Parliament. My Government \nhas the honour of having the first female elected \nMember of Parliament, who currently holds the \nposition of President of the Inter-American \nCommission of Women. \n We have not stopped there. The Chairman of the \nIntegrity Commission, pursuant to the Integrity in \nPublic Life Act, is a woman. The Governor General of \nAntigua and Barbuda, appointed earlier this year on the \nadvice of the Prime Minister, is female. The \nOmbudsman, a creature of the Constitution of Antigua \nand Barbuda is also a woman. The Chairman of the \nPublic Service Commission, also a creature of the \nConstitution of Antigua and Barbuda, is a woman. \n We continue to focus on increasing women\u2019s \nparticipation in the political decision-making process. \nIn that regard, we have been helped by the normative \nframework of the various United Nations gender \nentities. We will continue to work towards even greater \ngender parity in the political, economic and social \nspheres, and we encourage all Member States to do the \nsame. \n As we in the Caribbean grapple with the increase \nin HIV/AIDS cases, we are also confronted with \nanother great threat to the survival of our people. \nChronic non-communicable diseases have become a \nmajor concern for the Caribbean. Recently, an historic \nsummit of heads of CARICOM on chronic \nnon-communicable diseases held in Trinidad and \nTobago agreed to give full support for the initiatives \nand mechanisms aimed at strengthening regional health \ninstitutions through the signing of a comprehensive \ndeclaration highlighting a plan of action on this critical \nhealth issue. We strongly believe that the health of the \nregion is the wealth of the region, which underscores \nthe importance of health to development.  \n It is therefore necessary for the United Nations, \nthrough its various organs and agencies, to lend \nsupport to our initiatives to develop strategies to \nprevent and control heart disease, stroke, diabetes, \nhypertension, obesity and cancer in the region by \naddressing their causal risk factors of unhealthy diets, \nphysical inactivity, tobacco use and alcohol abuse, in \naddition to strengthening our health services. We must \nact together now to reduce the suffering and burdens \ncaused by non-communicable diseases on the citizens \nof our region, which is the worst-affected in the \nAmericas. \n We seek the cooperation of the United Nations \nand our international partners in the development of \ninitiatives for the screening and management of \nchronic diseases and risk factors so that, by 2012, \n80 per cent of people with non-communicable diseases \nwill receive quality care and have access to preventive \neducation based on regional and international \nguidelines. \n Allow me to conclude on the point at which I \nbegan, by referring once more to the Charter of the \nUnited Nations. Sixty-two years ago, when the United \nNations was formed, the international system was less \ncomplex and colonialism was still the dominant \nconcern. Humanity was reeling from the effects of a \nsecond world war. It was not the best of times. \n Today, in my opinion, it is still not the best of \ntimes for a majority of the people on planet Earth. The \nprimary catalysts to positive change and improved \nlives for the global population are the United Nations \nand the leaders of its Member States. I am hopeful that \nsharing our collective wisdom, and drawing from this \nsource, the sixty-second session of the General \nAssembly will translate into meaningful and enduring \nbenefit for the peoples of the world. \n I am equally confident that our deliberations on \nclimate change will lead to solutions that will ensure \nthe protection of our planet and its peoples. \n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of the delegation of the Central \nAfrican Republic, and in the name of our Head of \nState, President of the Republic Fran\u00e7ois Boziz\u00e9, I \nextend warm and heartfelt congratulations to \nMr. Kerim on his election to preside over the General \nAssembly at its sixty-second session. We are also \ngratified to assert that his distinctive skills will \nguarantee the success of our work. \n I also wish to pay a warm tribute to his \npredecessor, Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa of the \nKingdom of Bahrain. Five decades after the presidency \nof Mrs. Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit of India, she wisely led \nthe work of the sixty-first session of the General \nAssembly, to the great satisfaction of all. \n Finally, on behalf of President of the Republic \nand Head of State Fran\u00e7ois Boziz\u00e9, allow me to \naddress our sincere congratulations to Secretary-\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon on his dynamism and the \nefficiency with which he has undertaken his work in \nthe context of current important international issues, \nincluding the maintenance of international peace and \nsecurity, climate change, human rights, and combating \ndrugs and terrorism in all its forms, which remain \npressing issues that no country in the world can address \nin isolation. \n The conflicts afflicting the innocent civilian \npopulations in the Middle East, the Great Lakes region \nand the Sudan, a neighbour of the Central African \nRepublic, with their hosts of refugees and displaced \npersons, are causes of grave concern. The conflict in \nDarfur and the presence of rebels, armed groups and \nroad-blockers cause the proliferation and unlawful \ncirculation of small arms in that subregion, thus \nprovoking widespread and continuous insecurity.  \n The consequences for the Central African \nRepublic often take the shape of recurrent crises that \nchronically undermine the economic fabric and \naggravate the poverty of our people by creating \nhazardous and precarious living conditions. All of this \nleads to the breakdown of the social fabric, the loss of \ncivic spirit and, ultimately, the failure of confidence in \ntheir institutions and, especially, in justice.  \n We applaud the adoption of Security Council \nresolution 1778 (2007) on the deployment of the hybrid \nmultidimensional force to the borders of the Central \nAfrican Republic, Chad and the Sudan. We should like \nto see it accompanied, however, by genuine support for \nthe reinforcement of institutional capacities in the \nCentral African Republic. In that regard, we thank and \npraise France for its courageous decision and effective \nparticipation in that peacekeeping force. \n During the fifteenth session of the Commission \non Sustainable Development, held in New York from \n30 April to 11 May 2007, whose chosen theme was \nturning commitments into action and working together \nin partnership, participants highlighted the correlation \nand interdependence among the four areas of the \nthematic cluster: energy for sustainable development, \nindustrial development, air pollution and climate \nchange. The Commission\u2019s fifteenth session also \ndemonstrated that much significant progress remains to \nbe achieved: advances in those sectors are minimal and \nstill far from the objectives the international \ncommunity set for itself in Rio in 1992 and in \nJohannesburg in 2002. \n In order to meet these challenges of the \nenvironment in particular and sustainable development \nin general, a partnership endeavour, supported by \nsufficient resources, is absolutely essential in order to \nallow developing countries, in particular in Africa, the \nCaribbean and the South Pacific, to implement these \ncommitments, especially since those regions, and \nparticularly Africa, while bearing but little \nresponsibility for the advent of this phenomenon, are \nmore vulnerable to the risks associated with climate \nchange. \n By choosing climate change as a central topic of \nthis General Assembly session and organizing the high-\nlevel dialogue \u201cThe future in our hands: Addressing the \nleadership challenge of climate change\u201d, the Assembly \nPresident has pinpointed the growing concern \nassociated with global warming for a country such as \nours, the Central African Republic. Indeed, the \nproblems associated with climate change now lie at the \ncore of international debates. The moment has thus \narrived to transform good intentions into concrete \nactions. \n For its part, the Central African Republic hopes \nthat during the Bali Climate Change Conference this \nDecember the wealthy countries will at last honour \ntheir commitments in the area of technology transfer \nand will provide assistance to strengthening the \nnational and regional structures required for effective \naction to combat climate change. I would like to pay a \nwarm tribute to the Secretary-General for the interest \nhe has shown in these problems and for his initiative of \nappointing three special envoys in the area of climate \nchange. \n Allow me to present the specific case of my \ncountry, the Central African Republic, which spans \nthree climatic zones, with great diversity in its \necosystem, from dense humid forest in the south, to the \npre-Sahelian area in the north.  \n This central position at the crossroads of different \nAfrican ecosystems   from the Sudan-Sahelian areas \nin the north to the dense humid forest in the south   \ngives it great ecological potential. It has many assets: \nrich and fertile soil, mineral and forest wealth, \ndiversified fauna and varied agriculture, with the latter \nbeing the country\u2019s economic base. \n The Central African Republic understands the \nwealth of its natural resources, but also the threats \ninvolved. That is why we have built environmental \nconcerns into the constitution of our country, notably \nin its preamble and its article 9 where the collective \nconsciousness is called upon to respect the principle of \ngood environmental governance.  \n Despite these resources, the economic reality of \nthe country shows that the Central African Republic is \namong the least developed countries, where the \npopulation lives on less than a dollar a day. In recent \nyears, the rate of economic growth has fallen below the \naverage predictions. Structurally, the country comes up \nagainst many obstacles in its development efforts. For \ninstance, its domestic market is tiny, and it is isolated \ndomestically and externally because of its distance \nfrom maritime ports. The economic situation may be \nsummed up as follows: lack of individual income, \nlimited State resources, inequality between men and \nwomen and the rate of illiteracy.  \n Our economy is largely dependent on \nenvironmental resources. Aware of the difficulties it \nfaces, the Government has opted for regional and \ninternational cooperation by participating in many \ninitiatives concerning the environment and sustainable \nforestry management, such as the Central African \nForest Commission, the Network of Protected Areas of \nCentral Africa, the Sangha Tri-National Landscape and \nthe Congo Basin Forest Partnership. \n Generally speaking, the implementation of most \nof these initiatives has not met expectations: the \ninitiatives were ambitious, but the capacities for \nimplementation and the financial resources were \ninadequate. The enterprises exploiting these resources \nimpose binding environmental rules on us while the \npopulation does not reap any benefit.  \n We need to halt and eliminate poverty with the \nparticipation of all. Poverty creates injustice. Here I \nwish to cite President Sarkozy, the printed text of \nwhose recent statement observed that justice meant the \nsame chances for success for each poor child in the \nworld as for each rich one. In this very Hall, President \nSarkozy said:  \n Justice means that a developing country on \nwhich we wish to impose environmental rules, \neven though its inhabitants have barely enough to \neat, can be helped to put such rules in place. \nJustice means that we cannot tap a country's \nresources without paying a fair price for them. \n  I solemnly appeal to the United Nations to \nconcern itself with the issue of fairer distribution \nof wealth and of the income derived from \ncommodities and technology.\n The Central African Republic is ready to open its \nborders to developed nations and to public and private \ninvestors in order to increase its resources. The Central \nAfrican Republic applauds the great nations - France, \nthe United States, China, Japan, Germany, Britain and \nRussia and certain emerging countries of the South   \nfor their willingness to cooperate in order to slow the \ndeterioration of the environment. \n We thank the European Union and the African \nDevelopment Bank for their assistance and, in \nparticular, the International Monetary Fund and the \nWorld Bank for having allowed the Central African \nRepublic to reach the decision point under the \nenhanced Highly Indebted Poor Countries Initiative. \nWe praise the actions of those international financial \ninstitutions, and we ask them to open a new chapter on \nthe environment and the economies of poor countries. \n We call on all for a continuing effort to reduce \ninequality between men and women, because in Africa, \nwomen are very often heads of families in the most \nremote regions. They play a very important role. In that \nway, the support of the international community in \neliminating inequality will provide a solution in terms \nof sustainable development.  \n We cannot achieve a healthy environment without \nwiping out illiteracy. We hope that the developed \ncountries of the South and the North will help poor \ncountries to create the right conditions in terms of \ninforming and training their populations in order to \nshow them that they have an interest in preserving the \nenvironment. \n Our country is rich. It wishes to exploit the \nwealth of its subsoil in order to protect its \nenvironment. With assistance, we can hope to bring \nourselves closer to the Millennium Development Goals \nby 2015.  \n In his opening statement, the President stated, \nKeep your mind level. If the mind is level, the whole \nworld will be level. \n The President of the Central African Republic, \nMr. Francois Bozize often teaches us about the mind of\nthe spirit: \n Infinite spirit is all. All is one. All is all. \nAnd all is the Universe. The Universe is calm. If \nwe have understood this, let the world follow the \nexample of the wise by avoiding the errors of the \nsemi-wise who perish because of their \nfoolishness\u201d. \n I would like to hope that this message will be \nfavourably received by our partners, both bilateral and \nmultilateral. \n"

        "file_text": "I would like to take \nthis opportunity to express to you, Mr. President, my \ndelegation\u2019s sincerest congratulations on your well-\ndeserved election. A special tribute goes to Her \nExcellency Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa and to \nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon, for their visionary \nand dedicated leadership. \n Recent events in Bangladesh have aroused \nconsiderable interest worldwide as we struggle to fulfil \nthe promise of democracy for our people. I will take \nthis opportunity to share with the global community \nsome of our recent experiences in consolidating \ndemocracy. We have learned that democracy is not an \nevent; it is an ongoing process. It is not just about \ncasting votes and changing Governments; it is also \nabout social justice, accountability and empowerment \nof the people. \n Those who have followed events in Bangladesh \nover the past few months will know that the Caretaker \nGovernment came into office in January this year amid \na political stalemate. The fabric of our democracy had \nbeen torn apart by years of catastrophic corruption. \nWidespread frustration with the status quo had led to a \nrising tide of political violence. That in turn had \ndisrupted ordinary life and shattered all public \nconfidence in the possibility of credible elections. \nMoreover, there was little hope that a tainted election \ncould end the cycle of violence. A state of emergency \nwas therefore declared on 11 January of this year in an \neffort to end the ongoing chaos and to usher in a new \nbeginning. \n As stipulated in our constitution, the non-party \nCaretaker Government acts as a bridge between two \nsuccessive political Governments. Our task is, first and \nforemost, to ensure a free and fair election, and we are \nfully committed to fulfilling that responsibility. \nHowever, our nation has learned through harsh \nexperience that an election cannot simply be a one-off \ncasting of votes, but must be part of a dynamic and \ncontinuing process whereby people freely choose their \nleaders.  \n While Bangladesh has held three elections in the \npast two decades, our democracy has been brutally \nundermined by ruinous corruption. The lack of \nsystemic institutional safeguards allowed corruption to \nrun rampant. That created a winner-takes-all electoral \nsystem, whereby the spoils of electoral victory were so \ngreat, and the stakes of winning so high, that the \npolitical process became hopelessly polarized, leading \nto a paralysis even of ordinary governance. As the \nbenefits of winning elections increased, so did the \ncosts of securing victory, creating a truly vicious circle \nin which corruption became the linchpin. Corruption \nthus became both the means and the end in terms of \nwinning elections. If our democratic spirit is to emerge \nunscathed from that downward spiral, and if we are to \ndeliver free, fair and meaningful elections, we must \nfirst free our politics from the clutches of corruption \nand violence. \n Democracy and the rule of law are not merely \nconcepts; they must be embodied in functioning public \ninstitutions. In Bangladesh, the very institutions that \nform the foundations of democracy have been eroded \nby ongoing corruption. Rebuilding those institutions \nand restoring public confidence through meaningful \nreforms are Herculean tasks, but they are ones in which \nwe cannot and will not fail. \n In Bangladesh, the task of conducting free and \nfair elections is the responsibility of the Election \nCommission. The Caretaker Government has already \noverhauled the Commission, guaranteeing its \nindependence and giving it a broader mandate. The \nElection Commission, of its own accord, has \nannounced a timeline for the holding of the next \nparliamentary election by the end of 2008. Our \nAdministration is committed to ensuring that that \ntimeframe is adhered to. We will bring to bear the full \nresources of the Government in that effort. \n Our Government has reorganized the Independent \nAnti-Corruption Commission to ensure that it can \neffectively lead the fight against corruption. We have \ngiven the Commission broad and sweeping powers \u2014 \nincluding operational independence \u2014 not only to \napprehend those who have been corrupt, but also to \nwork as a deterrent. Within a month after coming into \noffice, our Government acceded to the United Nations \nConvention against Corruption as a clear signal of our \nunwavering commitment against corruption.  \n The implementation of the Convention will not \nonly contribute to the reduction of corruption in \nBangladesh, but will also help us to recover the \nill-gotten gains of corruption stored abroad. Those who \nengage in corruption must confront the reality that \nthere is no safe haven for them. The world is united in \nthe struggle against corruption, and today Bangladesh \npledges itself an active partner in that endeavour. \n One of the most critical elements of a functioning \ndemocracy is an independent judiciary. In Bangladesh, \nthe lower judiciary and criminal prosecution were \ntraditionally under the executive branch of the \nGovernment, contrary to the constitutional principle of \nseparation of powers. While judicial independence has \nbeen part of the political manifesto of successive \ngovernments over the past 15 years, each has \nrepeatedly reneged on its public promises in this \nregard. Recognizing the importance of an independent \njudiciary to the rule of law, the Caretaker Government \nwithin its first month in office initiated the necessary \nsteps to fully separate the executive and judicial \nbranches of the Government. We have also revamped \nthe Bangladesh Public Service Commission and the \nUniversity Grants Commission in order to restore the \napolitical nature of those important institutions. \n Political parties are among the core constituents \nof democracy. Their accountability and true democratic \ncharacter remain critically important for democracy to \nfunction. In response to demands of the people, the \nmain political parties have themselves initiated various \nreforms, and the revamped parties will interact with the \nrevitalized institutions of the Government to move our \nnation forward.  \n Bangladesh reaffirms its unflinching commitment \nto universal and inalienable human rights. Any society \ncommitted to democracy requires the recognition and \nenforcement of human rights, and in Bangladesh the \nfight against corruption and the strengthening of the \nrule of law go hand-in-hand with the protection of \nhuman rights. The Caretaker Government has, \ntherefore, taken the decision to establish a national \nhuman rights commission to ensure that our laws and \npublic institutions reflect international standards and \nnorms of human rights. It is unfortunate that successive \nGovernments have shied away from taking this \nimportant step.  \n Bangladesh remains resolute in its relentless \ncampaign against international extremism and \nterrorism. We recently acceded to the International \nConvention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear \nTerrorism. Bangladesh is now a party to all terrorism-\nrelated United Nations conventions, a testament to our \ncommitment to fighting terrorism in all its forms. On \nthe domestic front, we have taken stern measures \nagainst militant groups and their patrons. In particular, \nwe categorically reject the claims of those who cloak \nthemselves in the rhetoric of Islam to justify terrorism. \nBangladesh is steadfast in its commitment to curb \nreligious fundamentalism in all its manifestations.  \n Our experience in re-instilling confidence in the \nGovernment has a wider relevance to the international \ncommunity. The problems that we are facing today are \nnot unique to Bangladesh. After all, in the developing \nworld democracy does not necessarily ensure good \ngovernance. Many countries face similar problems of \npolitical violence, mis-governance and corruption. This \nis particularly true for post-conflict and transition \nsocieties, where the politics of mistrust is pervasive. \nWe feel that a greater understanding of our challenges \nand, more importantly, of our efforts to re-build \npolitical and social institutions, can serve as \nbenchmarks for others facing similar situations. For \nexample, Bangladesh represents an effective model of \ncivil-military cooperation in crisis prevention. Our \nexperience in crisis management could be relevant for \nmany crisis-torn, nascent democracies.  \n One way in which we can share our experiences \nin governance is through our robust presence in United \nNations peacekeeping operations. We have consistently \nbeen one of the top troop-contributing countries in the \nworld, and our peacekeepers have earned accolades for \ntheir contributions. We are confident that Bangladesh \nwill continue to play a leadership role in multi-\ndimensional peacekeeping efforts, and we are ready to \nprovide comprehensive deployment packages in future \npeace operations. We also remain active in the United \nNations peacebuilding endeavours in post-conflict \nsocieties.  \n We warmly welcome the Secretary-General\u2019s \ntimely initiative to restructure the Department of \nPeacekeeping Operations. The world is witnessing a \nnatural evolution from the monitoring of peace to \nmultidimensional tasks of peacebuilding, \ndemocratization and development. As one of the largest \ntroop-contributing countries (TCCs), we strongly feel \nthat the TCCs should have equitable representation and \nplay a greater role in deployment and other strategic \ndecisions.  \n The United Nations is in the midst of a \ncontinuing evolution. It is our collective responsibility \nto make the United Nations more relevant to the \npresent day world, to fulfil the promise Dag \nHammarskj\u00f6ld spoke of when he said, \u201cThe day will \ncome when men will see the United Nations and what \nit means clearly.\u201d The Secretary-General\u2019s report on \nsystem-wide coherence presents several useful \nrecommendations in this connection. However, we feel \nthat the reform exercise should focus on the \nrequirements of achieving the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs), and we recognize that the \nspeed of reform must be gradual.  \n We must reflect upon what is needed by the \nUnited Nations, in terms of financial and human \nresources, to foster development. Keeping in mind that \ndeveloping countries differ greatly in their political, \nadministrative and social structures, the reform \nexercise must take this diversity into account and allow \nindividual countries to determine the structure of the \nUnited Nations presence at the country level, the \nrepresentation of different United Nations agencies and \ntheir country programmes. We must not undermine the \nidentities of individual United Nations agencies, \nincluding their mandates, independence and \ninstitutional integrity.  \n Earlier this week, we discussed the exceedingly \nimportant issue of climate change. World leaders \nreaffirmed our shared commitment to address the issue \nof global warming. Bangladesh is particularly \nvulnerable to global warming, given that as much as 30 \nper cent of our land will be submerged if the Bay of \nBengal rises by just one metre. The adverse effects of \nglobal warming, deforestation and increased salinity \nare already evident in Bangladesh. Floods have become \nan annual calamity, and this year our people have \nsuffered particularly severe losses owing to flooding. \nWhile the resilience of our people and the quick \nmobilization of our limited domestic resources helped \nus to overcome the crisis this year, we envisage that \nthis may become harder in the future. We therefore \nurge enhanced international cooperation to meet the \nchallenges of global warming and its consequences.  \n There is a growing acknowledgment that trade \nliberalization can be an effective tool for economic \ndevelopment. For the least developed countries \n(LDCs), the trade-to-gross domestic product ratio \naverages about 58 per cent, while it is roughly 25 per \ncent for many Organization for Economic Cooperation \nand Development countries. These statistics show that \nthe LDCs are far more dependent on trade than their \ndeveloped counterparts. Bangladesh, along with many \nother LDCs, is facing significant tariff and non-tariff \nbarriers in accessing developed markets. Global trade \nregimes must provide unimpeded access to all products \nof LDCs, so as to ensure that the fruits of progress are \nshared by all.  \n While representing a nation of 140 million \npeople, squeezed into an area roughly the size of New \nYork State, I must underscore the importance of \nmigration to our development efforts. For many in \nBangladesh and other developing countries, temporary \nlabour migration provides a livelihood option and a \nroute out of poverty. If we are to reduce poverty by \nhalf by 2015, we must strengthen our efforts to ensure \nthe free movement of labour. The international \ncommunity is recognizing the critical linkages between \nmigration and development. It is encouraging that the \nGlobal Forum on Migration and Development, held in \nBrussels this July, accorded migration its due priority. \nWe must also intensify our efforts to defend the rights \nof migrant workers. We would also like to see \nmomentum in the liberalization of Mode IV services. \nWe call for renewed international efforts \u2014 at the \nWorld Trade Organization and in other forums \u2014 to \nfacilitate the free movement of labour services.  \n Let me conclude by reiterating my Government\u2019s \nunswerving commitment to democracy and the \nprotection of human rights. We have pledged to put \nBangladesh on a higher trajectory of good governance, \nrule of law and development. We are determined to \nhold a free, fair and meaningful election within the \ntimeframe stipulated by our independent Election \nCommission and to keep our country firmly on the path \nof democracy. My Government is fully committed to \nensuring that our reform initiatives are comprehensive \nand irreversible. Bangladeshis now stand united for a \nprosperous future for their country and the world. \n"

        "file_text": "May I offer \nmy congratulations to you, Mr. President, your \nGovernment and people on your election. I would also \nlike to offer my thanks to your predecessor, Her \nExcellency Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa, for her \nleadership of the General Assembly over the past year. \nI also offer my congratulations to the Secretary-\nGeneral on the progress he has made during the past \nnine months. His first report (A/62/1) is very \nencouraging, and we welcome his response to the new \nchallenges we are all facing. I also wish to thank our \nUnited Nations representatives, workers and volunteers \nthroughout the world who are undertaking very hard \ntasks which are often extremely dangerous. We thank \nthem for their professional dedication. This is \nespecially so in many parts of the Middle East. Here I \noffer once more our continued strong support for all \nthe efforts being made by the United Nations to find a \nsolution to the suffering of the Palestinian people. In \ndoing so we reaffirm our solidarity with the people of \nPalestine in their efforts to find a just and lasting \nsolution to problems that have been going on for \nalmost 60 years.  \n My last word of thanks, Mr. President, is to you \npersonally. We were most encouraged by your \nacceptance speech and your plan for the future. We \nwere pleased to hear you express strong support for \nmultilateral solutions to world problems. We certainly \nagree on the need for the United Nations to strengthen \nits central position in the multilateral system. Most of \nall, we are very happy with the idea of a lasting \nconsensus among Member States, the private sector, \nnon-governmental organizations and civil society. We \nare especially pleased that civil societies were \nincluded. That means giving ordinary people a place in \nthe consensus. That is why we found the statement so \nencouraging. Nevertheless, it has set a very serious \nchallenge to the United Nations. It is most important \nthat our people gain the understanding that comes from \nknowledge, experience and expertise. Our theme of \nclimate change at this session shows this very clearly. \n The many discussions we have had this week \nhave taught us that all modern problems are extremely \ncomplicated. It has also shown us how important it is \nto gain a full understanding of these difficulties. If our \npeople are to gain such understanding, it will come \nfrom having universal good education, good health and \nstrong social services. This will come only when all \ncountries have reached the United Nations Millennium \nGoals. So it is more urgent than ever that these Goals \nbe reached on time. They cover all aspects of modern \nlife   political, social, cultural, and, perhaps above all \ntoday, economic and commercial. As such they provide \na way for people to understand modern problems well, \ntake a full part in the consensus and help to find a \nsolution.  \n I say this because we are now at the critical \nhalfway point that we set seven years ago in planning \nthe Millennium Development Goals. The discussion we \nhave had all week on climate change shows how vital \nthe next seven years will be. In my own country we \nhave only just started to realize how difficult the \nsubject is. It is like security and sustainable \ndevelopment and energy. These are all new, \ntwenty-first century problems, and they all mean that \nour people need to learn more and more and to learn \nvery quickly. \n We need to include the subject I have mentioned \nin all aspects of national development planning, and we \nneed to share knowledge and expertise. We believe that \nthis is more important than ever. This is because by \nexchanging views and information on climate change \nthis week we have also learned another new lesson, \nwhich teaches us that when it comes to modern twenty-\nfirst century problems we are all in them together. That \nis what your consensus, Mr. President, means. It \nrecognizes that we all have an important contribution \nto make   if we work together. That is why we very \nmuch value the partnership you have proposed. We \nhope it will result in our people becoming far more \nthan just receivers of solutions. We hope it will start to \nmake them one of the most important agents in finding \nsolutions. \nWe feel you have begun your term of office, \nMr. President, by inviting us all to share a modern \nplatform on which we can all work well. We are very \npleased to join you and your consensus for the sixty-\nsecond session of the General Assembly, and we wish \nyou much success in broadening and strengthening it \nduring the coming year. \n"

        "file_text": "I would like to take this \nopportunity to congratulate the President on his \nelection to preside over the sixty-second session of the \nGeneral Assembly. Malaysia will work with him \ntowards realizing the objectives of the Organization, \nparticularly in efforts aimed at conferring more power \non the General Assembly in managing the affairs of the \nUnited Nations. \nThe course of human history is marked by a few \npivotal moments during which we had an opportunity \nto make either the correct or the wrong decision, which \nhad an impact on the destinies of those who come after. \nWe are now living in such a time. There are certain \nproblems that touch all our lives without exception. \nThe change in climate and the increasing discord \nbetween cultures and civilizations are two such \nproblems. The first problem is now globally affecting \nthe well-being of planet Earth, while the second is \nthreatening to tear apart the fabric of peaceful relations \nbetween peoples and nations. Let me first say \nsomething about climate change. \n We are now fully aware of the gravity and the \nimmediacy of the situation. Natural disasters and other \nextremes in the weather are occurring now, often in \nparts of the world that never before experienced such \ncalamities. The worst is yet to come. Indeed, the 2007 \nreport of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate \nChange has made it clear that the scale and urgency of \nthe challenge is greater than we had thought or feared. \n In December of this year, Indonesia will be \nhosting on Bali the thirteenth Conference of the Parties \nto the United Nations Framework Convention on \nClimate Change. We must agree to launch the process \nfor negotiations on a post-2012 agreement. Ongoing \nnational and regional initiatives to deal with climate \nchange must not compete with, and should instead \ncomplement, the negotiations under the United Nations \nframework. Malaysia will fully support Indonesia in \norder to ensure that the Bali Conference achieves the \nsuccess that it deserves. \n We need to achieve consensus on certain \nfundamental issues, even before the negotiations begin \nfor a post-2012 agreement. The principle of common \nbut differentiated responsibilities must prevail. We \nmust recognize the fact that the poorest countries of the \nworld have the least capacity to adapt and should \ntherefore be apportioned the least responsibility to \nmitigate the impacts of climate change.  \n A post-2012 agreement needs to build upon the \narchitecture and other fundamentals of the Kyoto \nProtocol. For example, there should be absolute \nemission-reduction targets for developed countries, \nexpanded mechanisms that facilitate contributions from \ndeveloping countries and special provisions for the \nleast developed countries and the small island \ndeveloping States.  \n We know that climate change has implications \nnot only for the environment but also for the global \neconomy. That is an important additional reason why \nthe principle of differentiated responsibilities must \napply, so that developing countries can maintain their \ncapacities for sustainable development. Of course, \ndeveloping countries have their part to play in the \nmanagement of climate change, but it must be \ncommensurate with their abilities to perform. \n On this subject, we must never forget the Earth \nSummit, held in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, where it all \nbegan. Caring for the environment and ensuring \nsustainable development were the themes of that global \nconference. The message of that Summit was that \nnothing less than a transformation of our attitude and \nbehaviour will bring about the necessary changes. \nThose principles remain fully valid, and they should \nguide us as we begin the process of negotiations for the \npost-2012 agreement on climate change. \n Let me now turn to the problem of the discord \nthat is growing between Islam in general and the West \nas a whole. The main cause is the misperception in the \nWest that Islam promotes exclusivity and encourages \nextremism. We must take action to generate greater \nunderstanding between the followers of different \ncultural and civilizational traditions. Malaysia fully \nsupports the various efforts being made in that regard \nat the international level. We are confident that such \ndialogue will establish the truth that Islam is a religion \nthat espouses universalism and not exclusivity, and \ntolerance rather than bigotry. \n Malaysia is equally convinced that it is wrong to \nput the blame on religion as the cause of existing \ndisputes between nations. All genuine religions \nadvocate peace and harmony among peoples, as well as \nacceptance of others. That is certainly the case with \nIslam, which teaches its believers to practice tolerance, \nforgiveness, peace, fraternity and coexistence. The \nKoran, which is the foundation of the religion of Islam, \nis very explicit in recognizing the existence of \nreligions other than Islam. \n That religion is not the root cause of the world\u2019s \ntroubles, as has been confirmed by the report of the \nHigh-level Group for the Alliance of Civilizations that \nwas released on 13 November 2006. The report \nmaintains that, although religion is often cynically \nexploited to stir passions, fuel suspicions and support \nalarmist claims that the world is facing a new war of \nreligions, the root of the matter is political, not \nreligious. We should support various initiatives at the \nnational and regional levels to promote the message \nand recommendations of the 2006 report. \n Nevertheless, it is Malaysia\u2019s view that such \nnational and regional initiatives must finally culminate \nin a truly universal dialogue based on the multilateral \nintergovernmental process. It is only such a process \nthat can establish binding commitments. Indeed, the \nsuccess of such a dialogue has now become an \nimportant condition for securing the wider goals of \nglobal peace, security and prosperity. \n There is a tendency to blame history, but there is \nno evidence in history that points to religion as the \ncause of the current discord between cultures and \ncivilizations. Religion is not the explanation for the \nexistence of conflicts between Western and Muslim \ncountries. The answer lies in more recent times: the \nrepeated use of force by the powerful over the weak to \nsecure strategic or territorial gains. The vestiges of \nthose wars for control and domination persist today as \nthe gnawing problems in Afghanistan, Lebanon, the \nGolan Heights and Iraq. \n With regard to Iraq, we cannot deny the fact that \nmany of the problems now confronting the people of \nIraq emanate from foreign occupation of that great \ncountry. Iraqis should be given a full opportunity to \ndetermine their own future. For that purpose, Iraq \nneeds a government of national unity. That can be \naccomplished through national reconciliation.  \n I place great emphasis on national unity, because \nit has been our experience in Malaysia that national \nunity is best achieved through the practice of power-\nsharing in a government in which ethnic groups of \ndifferent religious faiths are represented. Our \nGovernment has succeeded in bringing peace and \nprosperity to the country for the past 50 years of \nMalaysia\u2019s independence. The international community \nhas a clear responsibility to assist the people of Iraq to \nachieve peace and stability, so that the unity of Iraq as \na nation is preserved, and the territorial integrity of \nIraq as a State is not compromised. \n With equal candour, I must also say that the \nproblem of Palestine, which has been festering for 60 \nyears without a solution being found, tops the list of \ngrievances that the Islamic world holds against the \nWest. We are all aware that there are fresh initiatives to \nbring Israel and Palestine, together with other States, to \nhigh-level peace talks in the very near future. Although \nI take the position that any final settlement of the issue \nof Palestine must necessarily take place within the \nframework of the United Nations, let us support the \npeace talks and hope that they create momentum for a \ntrue meeting of minds.  \n In particular, we should urge the Israeli and \nPalestinian leadership to act courageously so as to meet \nthe needs and expectations of their peoples, who have \nsuffered long enough. Of course, real peace can only \nbe achieved if the legitimate rights of peoples are \nrecognized and protected during the negotiations. \nPalestine has been partitioned before. That should \nnever happen again. \n All of us must play the role of honest brokers, \nassisting the parties through a difficult negotiating \nprocess on the path towards true peace. Both sides to \nthe Israeli-Palestinian conflict must commit to reaching \nsolutions through compromise. This opportunity must \nbe seized. The onus of delivery is on all of us. \n I believe that the single most important issue in \nthe way of peace and fraternity between Islamic and \nWestern countries is the unsettled problem of Palestine. \nI am equally certain that once the problem of Palestine \nis settled, there will be greater harmony between \nWestern and Islamic countries, the inheritors of the \nworld\u2019s two greatest religions and civilizations. \n For their part, Muslims have a responsibility to \npresent to the world the true face of Islam. It must be \nmade clear that Islam is a religion that abhors conflicts, \nmore so between Muslims. When disputes do arise, \nIslam enjoins forgiveness and reconciliation through \nmushawarah, which can be translated as engaging in \ndialogue and peaceful negotiation. Furthermore, the \nteachings of Islam put a very high premium on peace \nand development. Islam is definitely not an \nencumbrance to progress and prosperity. In my country, \nMalaysia, although Muslims constitute the large \nmajority of the population, the Government has used \nthe progressive teachings of Islam as the basis for good \ngovernance to deliver benefits to all sectors of our \nmulti-ethnic and multireligious society without \ndiscrimination. We call this approach Islam Hadhari. \n I have highlighted two major challenges that we \nnow face in our time. I remain optimistic, however, \nthat universal human fraternity and coexistence are \nattainable if, and when, critical political and strategic \nissues are resolved in tandem with the closing of the \ngap of misunderstandings between cultures and \ncivilizations. That effort requires our collective \nwisdom and courage to recognize the problems. The \nwell-being of planet Earth and all the people who \ninhabit it are actually within our control. We must have \nthe will to moderate our excesses and cater for the \nneeds of future generations, using science and \ntechnology as our tools. The time for us to invest in our \ncollective future is here and now. \n I would be remiss if   Malaysia being a member \nof the Association of Southeast Asian Nations \n(ASEAN)   I ignored the situation in Myanmar. \nASEAN has done everything possible to encourage \nMyanmar towards reconciliation and democracy. Their \nfailure to do so has brought upon them the current \nsituation. Let me express my country\u2019s disapproval, \nalong with that of other ASEAN countries, of the use \nof excessive force by the Government of Myanmar to \nput down justifiable civilian protests. Malaysia \nsupports the efforts of the United Nations in sending \nUnder-Secretary-General Ibrahim Gambari to \nMyanmar. We call upon the Government of Myanmar \nto give him its fullest cooperation to enable him to \nfulfil his mission on behalf of the international \ncommunity. Let me also call for the release of Aung \nSan Suu Kyi and for direct engagement between the \nleaders of Myanmar and various groups   in particular \nthe National League for Democracy. \n"

        "file_text": "Allow me, on behalf of the Republic of Uzbekistan, to \nwelcome the participants in the General Assembly at \nits sixty-second session and wish this forum success in \nits work. \n I am not mistaken if I say that the world \ncommunity is looking forward to concrete results from \nthe realization of the development goals formulated in \nthe Millennium Declaration. A special role has been \nassigned to the United Nations in achieving the \nobjectives set by the Declaration, including elaborating \nfair and acceptable approaches to the issues of the \naccess to, and use and distribution of, natural \nresources; maintaining environmental sustainability; \ncombating transnational threats; and establishing a \nfree, tolerant and stable developing world in the \ncontext of globalization. \n One of the most serious problems of the present \nday is the reasonable use of natural resources and, \nabove all, water and energy resources. Various and \nambiguous approaches in this sphere hamper the \nprocess of development and lead to conflict situations \nand sometimes to ecological catastrophes. The fate of \nthe Aral Sea may serve as an example. The receding of \nthe Sea has tragic consequences not only for the \npeoples of Central Asia but also for the larger \nsubregion and even all of Eurasia. \n It is necessary to underscore that the major point \nis the use of resources and watercourses of \ntransboundary rivers, which over the span of centuries \nhave met the vital needs of States and peoples living \nalong these rivers. The Republic of Uzbekistan \nbelieves that all decisions on the use of the \nwatercourses of transboundary rivers, including the \nconstruction of hydropower facilities, must in no way \ninflict ecological damage or infringe upon the interests \nof the population of countries in the neighbouring \nterritories. \n The Convention on the Environmental Impact \nAssessment in a Transboundary Context of February \n1991, the Convention on the Protection and Use of \nTransboundary Watercourses and International Lakes \nof March 1992, and the Convention on the Law of the \nNon-navigational Uses of International Watercourses \nof 1997 directly point to the reasonable use of \ntransboundary river resources. Those Conventions \nrequire that transboundary waters be used in a \nreasonable and equitable way, taking into particular \naccount their transboundary character, in the case of \nactivities that have or are likely to have a \ntransboundary impact. \n In the case of the infliction of damage, all \nmeasures must be taken to repair or mitigate such \ndamage, and, if necessary, the issue of compensation is \nto be considered. It is underscored in United Nations \nConventions that the watercourse States shall cooperate \non the basis of sovereign equality, territorial integrity, \nmutual benefit and good faith. According to those \nfundamental requirements of the Conventions, \nauthoritative international experts must give guarantees \nthat the construction of hydrotechnical facilities will \nnot have irremediable ecological consequences and \nwill not throw off the established balance of the use of \nwatercourses of transboundary rivers by all States \nlocated in the basin of those rivers. \n We are convinced that those requirements must \nbe fulfilled in the implementation of various projects \nbuilding hydropower facilities in Central Asia with the \nparticipation of both national and transnational \ncompanies, so as not to allow for a catastrophic \ndeterioration of the ecological situation in the region. \nWe would like to remind investor countries who have \nexpressed a wish to participate in the implementation \nof such projects of those conditions. \n The current situation in Central Asia \ndemonstrates the interlinking of many contradictory \nprocesses, which could negatively influence security \nnot only in our region, but also far beyond its limits. \nUzbekistan has consistently supported the effective \npost-war recovery of Afghanistan. We strongly believe \nthat stabilizing the situation in Afghanistan should be \naccomplished not through militarization, but through \ndemilitarization, the resolution of outstanding social \nand economic problems and support to the country\u2019s \npopulation through the active participation and \nassistance of the world community. Certainly, the most \nimportant conditions for that are the reaching of a \nconsensus, the taking of coordinated measures by all \nparties interested in stabilizing and reviving \nAfghanistan and curbing the ever-present drug threat \nthat emanates from that country. \n The matter of shaping and promoting an ideology \nof tolerance, mutual understanding and cultural \ndiversity has taken on a special urgency in the context \nof maintaining peace and security at the regional and \nglobal levels. The Republic of Uzbekistan makes its \nown contribution to the support of the dialogue among \ncultures and civilizations, which must be maintained in \nthe framework of international law without strain or \npressure, without attempts to impose unacceptable \nvalues and moral norms and by preserving respect for \npeoples, thought processes which have been shaped \nover many centuries and millennia. The correctness of \nsuch an approach was particularly stressed during the \ninternational conference on Uzbekistan\u2019s contribution \nto the development of Islamic civilization, held in \nUzbekistan in August 2007, and attended by prominent \nscholars, theologians and government and public \nfigures from different parts of the world. \n The designation by the Islamic Educational, \nScientific and Cultural Organization of Tashkent, the \ncapital of Uzbekistan, as a world capital of Islamic \nculture represented the recognition of the role and \nsignificance of Uzbekistan in Islamic civilization. \nUzbekistan has for centuries been a centre of \nenlightened Islam, which seeks to strengthen in the \nconsciousness of people such eternal values as the \naspiration towards kindness and peace, tolerance in \ninter-ethnic and inter-faith relations, and mutual \nrespect and accord among peoples, regardless of the \ncolour of their skin or their beliefs. That is why we are \nseriously concerned about some negative \ninterpretations of the historical role of Islam and the \ndeliberate distortion of historical facts. We resolutely \noppose the transformation of counterterrorism into \nIslamophobia and into an overt or covert stand-off with \nthe Islamic world. \n In such circumstances, the role of the United \nNations is more important than ever before in \nencouraging and promoting cultural diversity, tolerance \nand mutual understanding among religions. In that \ncontext, Uzbekistan welcomes the High-level Dialogue \non Interreligious and Intercultural Understanding and \nCooperation for Peace to be held on 4 and 5 October. \n In conclusion, I wish to express the sincere hope \nthat the results of the work of the General Assembly at \nits sixty-second session will promote the successful \nrealization of the joint efforts of Member States to \naddress challenges and threats to global security, as \nwell as the further peaceful development of the world\u2019s \nnations. \n"

        "file_text": "Our people, from the Bolivarian Republic of \nVenezuela, have followed last week\u2019s debate of \nGeneral Assembly. They are a people in the middle of a \nrevolution that has succeeded in building new spaces \nfor a political culture; a people that is informed and \neducated, that has followed closely the positions put \nforward at this Assembly. We could say that the debate \nhas reflected the current situation in the world, a world \nthat is struggling to build itself in peace, a world that is \nseeking new directions. \n A year ago, the President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez Fr\u00edas \nspoke from this podium to warn the world, to confirm \nthe alert of many in the world on the madness, the \nwarmongering madness that has been imposed \nalongside the desire for peace, a desire of the majority \nof the world.  \n Today, we can take stock of this warmongering \nmadness. Six years ago, through a lie, invasion and \naggression were sold to a brotherly people, the people \nof Iraq. It was built on the basis of a global campaign, \na justification for the military occupation of the Arab \npeople of Iraq, of the Iraqi nation. \n Today, five years later, we can see the result of a \npolicy filled with hate and evil. From 2002 to 2006 of \nthe United States budget, $610 billion have been \ninvested in maintaining the war in the Middle East   \n$610 billion to bring about death and destruction, $610 \nbillion that were taken from American taxpayers in \norder to invest in bullets, bombs and death. That $610 \nbillion invested in war, if it had been invested during \nthe past six years that the Iraqi occupation has lasted, \ntoday could have meant social progress, equality and \njustice for the people of Iraq. \n But the results are obvious, and clearly visible. \nResearch by the world\u2019s universities states that more \nthan 600,000 Iraqis have died as a result of the \ninvasion and military occupation. More than the 3,600 \nyoung American were sent to their deaths. More than \n25,000 young Americans have now returned to their \ncountry crippled, blind, deaf or disabled for life. The \n$610 billion invested in death has only multiplied the \nviolence, and the result that we see today is that the \ninvasion has not led to a safer or more balanced world. \nThe result has not been a world at peace. Today, the \nnations of the world must acknowledge that we have a \nworld that is less safe, with greater dangers because of \nterrorism. We have an unbalanced Middle East, filled \nwith violence and divisions.  \n If that $610 billion invested in war and death in \nIraq had been invested in life, we would be looking at a \ndifferent situation today. With $610 billion, we could \nbuild 3 million clinics to provide health services to the \nworld, as is done today by the people of Cuba and \nVenezuela through the Bolivarian Alternative for the \nAmericas for people throughout Latin America and the \nCaribbean. With the $610 billion invested in war, we \ncould build more than 12 million decent homes for \nneedy men and women of the three neediest latitudes \nof the world: Africa, Asia, and Latin America and the \nCaribbean. With that $610 billion invested in bullets \nand bombs for the purpose of killing, we could have \nbuilt more than 300,000 schools that would have \nreceived at least 350 million children and young \nstudents around the world.  \n But no, madness and greediness for the natural \nresources of the world lead the elites of the United \nStates to undertake an absurd and irrational war and to \nbring violence and death to the world. Today, if we \ntook stock of the situation, of the direct results of this \nsenseless and irrational war, we would have to say that \nthis war has led to death, destruction and \ndestabilization and has created even more sources of \nterrorism than it has been able to heal. That is why this \nsenseless war is the worst example of how the security \nsystem has functioned to protect balance and peace in \nthe world. \n Today, the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela calls \nupon our brothers in the world to think. We must adjust \nthe mechanisms to find balance and peace and to stop \nthe madness of war.  \n We have seen how in recent days there has been \nan increase in the international media campaign to \ndemonize the people and Government of Iran. We have \nseen how dangerously successive threatening \nstatements have been made against the peace of the \npeople of Iran. Has the world, or have the \nGovernments represented in this General Assembly, \nwondered what would happen if the insatiable madness \nof the elite who govern the United States were to lead \nto a dreadful attack on the peaceful people of Iran? \nWhere would such a situation lead us? It is time to stop \nthat campaign of demonization, to issue warnings, to \nbuild restraining walls, to call for an end to, and make \nalliances to stop, the belligerent madness of the elite \nwho govern the United States of America.  \n Today, the war and the struggle against terrorism \noccupy a very prominent place in the international \npublic agenda. From this podium, we would like to \nreiterate to the Government of the United States of \nAmerica the legal request for the terrorist Luis Posada \nCarriles to be extradited, in accordance with \ninternational law, and to be prosecuted for the crimes \nhe committed in Latin America and the Caribbean \nagainst our peoples. Does this Assembly know that one \nof the most dangerous terrorists, Luis Posada \nCarriles   the head of a terrorist gang, who has been \nconvicted of and confessed to crimes committed in \nSouth America during Operation Condor, who was \nresponsible for the disappearance of hundreds of men \nand women, who has been convicted of and confessed \nto having blown up a Cubana Airlines plane in \nBarbados in 1976 and who placed bombs in tourist \nspots in Cuba in the 1990s   is now free in Florida \nand protected by the Government of United States of \nAmerica? Does this Assembly know that this terrorist \nprovided his services to the Central Intelligence \nAgency for 40 years?  \n We have asked the Counter-Terrorism Committee \nof the Security Council to examine that matter with all \ndue diligence, and we are asking for the support of \nfriendly Governments around the world for this \nterrorist to be extradited and prosecuted for having \nblown up a Cubana Airlines plane in Venezuela. This \ntwo-faced behaviour shows the hypocrisy of a policy \nthat fuels war supposedly to combat terrorism but that, \non its own territory, protects one of the most dangerous \nterrorists that the western hemisphere has ever known.  \n Likewise, we wish to express from this podium \nour solidarity with the growing call by Governments \nand peoples of the world for a fair judgement and the \nimmediate release of the five Cubans imprisoned in the \njails of the empire as part of the war on terror being \ncarried out on United States territory. This demand that \nwe are making before the General Assembly today is \npart of the flags of struggle that the Bolivarian \nRepublic of Venezuela is raising today. \n From this podium today, we would like to \nwelcome the victory of President Rafael Correa, of the \nprogressive forces and of the people of Ecuador in the \nrecent elections to designate the Constituent National \nAssembly, which will direct the peaceful process of \nchange in Ecuador. This victory in Ecuador is part of a \ngroup of processes of change that have peacefully and \ndemocratically paved the way in South America, Latin \nAmerica and the Caribbean, processes of change that \nthey tried to stop through campaigns by national \noligarchies, through international conspiracies and \nthrough media campaigns. But the voice of the people \nof Ecuador is clear. They have joined the voices of the \npeople of Bolivia, Venezuela and Uruguay. South \nAmerica, Latin America and the Caribbean ask, we \ndemand that the right to peaceful democratic change in \nour societies be respected. We demand that the right to \nbuild, through democratic revolution, new processes \nand new economic and social structures be respected, \nmaking it possible to overcome poverty and to build \ndemocracies that are truly established by equality. \n The world knows that there has been an ongoing \nconspiracy against the Venezuelan democracy and \nPresident Hugo Ch\u00e1vez. The world knows that in 2002 \nour people defeated an attempted coup d\u2019\u00e9tat that \nsought the destruction of democracy and the \nassassination of President Ch\u00e1vez.  \n Today, the people of Venezuela are in the midst of \na thorough reform of the Constitution. In December, \nthe people of Venezuela, following a debate on terms \nand proposals related to constitutional reform, will go \nto the polls to decide in a sovereign manner what our \ncountry\u2019s future should be and what reforms we should \nundertake to expand the foundations of political, social \nand economic democracy. Today, we reaffirm to the \nworld that we want respect for Venezuela\u2019s sovereignty \nand independence and an end to imperialist-led media \ncampaigns that try to distort the real conditions of \ndemocracy building by our people and by our popular \nrevolution.  \n Today, we reaffirm the need for deep-seated and \ncomprehensive reform of the United Nations. A new, \nmultipolar world of equilibrium, without imperialistic \nhegemony, is necessary, urgent and possible. We have \njoined the debate on United Nations reform. We \nbelieve that the Organization must be reworked. We \nbelieve that the Organization must rebuild itself so that \nit can faithfully serve a multipolar world, a world of \nequilibrium, a world of peace, a world without \nhegemony. Seventeen years of a unipolar world has \nshown us the need for a deep-seated transformation of \nmultilateral organizations so that they can be placed at \nthe service of peace, equality, justice and the great \ncauses of humanity.  \n Today, we reaffirm our conviction that the \nOrganization must be thoroughly reworked and must \nmove forward by democratizing the Security Council, \nexpanding both its permanent and its non-permanent \nmembership; by establishing new functions for the \nGeneral Assembly; and by strengthening the political \nrole of the Secretary-General. \n Finally, let us move forward with new \nmechanisms for dialogue, coexistence and the building \nof a multipolar world where we can all be equal   a \nworld where our peoples can see themselves as equal \npartners in a global cooperative undertaking to build \nthe foundations of peace and justice, to overcome the \ninsanity of war and to be able to thwart the desire of \nthe world\u2019s elites to take control of the natural \nresources and wealth of our people. \n The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela reaffirms \nits will to move forward together with the peoples of \nthe world in a thorough reform that will transform the \nUnited Nations into a new Organization   a genuine \ninstrument for peace, life and development. \n"

        "file_text": "Climate \nchange, at the centre of the high-level event a week \nago, constitutes one of the greatest challenges of our \ngeneration. It puts to the test our ability to create the \ncollective political will necessary to counter a \nphenomenon of potentially disastrous socio-economic \nconsequences. It also offers a great opportunity to \nmake the best use of the unique framework that this \nOrganization provides. The Bali meeting must bring \nabout a long-term commitment by all States to \nlaunching an ambitious and practical road map towards \na gradually decarbonized global economy. We can \nreach that goal if we translate today\u2019s political \nmomentum into concrete action that goes beyond \ntomorrow\u2019s activities.  \n Climate change is but one of the areas of concern \nto the international community, where it is absolutely \nclear that the United Nations is today more than ever \nan indispensable Organization. It appears indeed that \nits unique nature and potential are more widely \nrecognized and accepted today than they were until \neven very recently. In the words of Secretary-General \nBan Ki-moon, the pendulum is swinging back in our \nfavour. As a strong believer in multilateralism, we \nwelcome that development. \n However, as true friends of the United Nations, \nwe must also continue to question the ability of the \nOrganization to fully use its potential and to fulfil the \npurposes and principles of its Charter. Our record in \nthe area of reform, two years after the 2005 World \nSummit, is mixed. We yet have to achieve certain \ninstitutional reforms, and the principle of the \nresponsibility to protect must be translated into \nconcrete action, such as in the case of the oppressive \npolicies of the regime in Myanmar against its own \npopulation. Of course, however, reform of an \norganization with tasks as diverse and daunting as the \nUnited Nations is never concluded. We must always be \nprepared to make the adjustments that are necessary to \nimprove its impact, its legitimacy and its efficiency. \nToday, such adjustments require a two-fold approach. \nOn the one hand, we must strengthen its operational \nparts and, on the other hand, we must ground the work \nof the Organization more firmly in its origins, namely, \nthe Charter of the United Nations. \nThe demands in the area of peacekeeping are \ngreater than ever before. That attests to the faith placed \nin the United Nations, but it also makes the \ndeficiencies in the management of the Organization a \nmore pressing issue. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon \nwas therefore right to propose changes to strengthen \ninstitutional support for the Organization\u2019s field \nactivities. We look forward to further progress in that \nrespect, in particular in the area of procurement. We \nare not convinced that the lessons from the oil-for-food \nscandal, which has done great damage to the United \nNations, have been fully absorbed, let alone fully \ntranslated into concrete action. We must also credibly \nimprove the financial efficiency and accountability of \nthe Organization. That will, in turn, allow us to present \nto our domestic constituencies the ever-increasing bills \nfor peacekeeping operations. \n All the strengthening of the operational and \nmanagerial capabilities of the United Nations will not \nchange the fact that, operationally and financially, this \nis not a powerful Organization. Its budget will always \npale in comparison to what a number of States spend \non their defence budgets, to cite an obvious example. \nThe genuine power and strength of the Organization \nlies in its foundation in international law. The Charter \nitself can be regarded as the greatest achievement in \nthe history of international law. More important, \nthough, the United Nations has the unique ability to \nbestow legitimacy and legality on international action. \nIn the eyes of the world, the United Nations \nsymbolizes the rule of law in international relations.  \n That is a tremendous asset that we must cherish \nand promote wherever possible. The United Nations \nand its organs must always be seen as the guardians of \ninternational law. Given its central place in the \ninstitutional architecture of the Organization, that \napplies in particular to the Security Council. The \ncurrent practice of the Council with respect to the \nlisting and de-listing of individuals targeted by \nsanctions is therefore a cause for concern. We believe \nthat disregarding international standards of due process \ndoes nothing to improve the effectiveness of sanctions \nregimes, but much to undermine the authority of the \nCouncil itself. \n Long years and much energy have been spent on \nthe reform of the Security Council. It would appear \ntoday that we are as far from a solution as ever. We \nbelieve that the legitimacy of the Council\u2019s actions has \na number of sources, the most important of which are \nthe quality of its decisions and the extent to which they \nreflect international law. In addition, the decisions of \nthe Council have the necessary legitimacy if they are \ngenuinely taken on behalf of the membership as a \nwhole, and therefore also on behalf of the vast majority \nof States that do not serve on the Council. That can be \nachieved through greater involvement by non-member \nStates, in particular if and when their interests are \ndirectly affected. Finally, of course, the membership of \nthe Council must be more representative of the overall \nmembership of the Organization, and of the developing \nworld in particular. \n The past few years have not brought about the era \nof the rule of law that some had hoped for. Quite to the \ncontrary, there have been concerted, and ultimately \nunsuccessful, attacks on the importance of the rule of \nlaw in international relations. Nevertheless, we have \nachieved very significant progress in some areas, in \nparticular in the area of international criminal justice. \nThe Security Council has led the way through the \nestablishment of international and hybrid tribunals. But \nthe crowning success, of course, was the establishment \nof the International Criminal Court (ICC).  \n The referral of the situation in Darfur to the Court \nwas a landmark decision, both legally and politically. It \nwas a strong message by the Security Council that the \ninternational community does not accept impunity for \nthe most serious crimes under international law. That \nmessage, however, needs to be backed up by \nenforcement action, in particular by the arrest of all \nindictees sought by the Court. We therefore call on all \nStates and the United Nations to cooperate with the \nICC to that end. \n We will continue to take great interest in the work \nof the Security Council. At the same time, of course, \nwe will focus our energy on making the General \nAssembly a more relevant and more essential part of \nthe United Nations system. In that regard, my \ndelegation looks forward to the President\u2019s leadership \nand to closely cooperating with him on the priority \nissues he has identified. \n"

        "file_text": "I would like to \nadd my voice to those of previous speakers in \ncongratulating you, Sir, on the occasion of your \nelection to the noble post of President of the General \nAssembly. I am confident that you will carry forward \nthe able legacy left by your predecessor, Mrs. Haya \nRashed Al-Khalifa. Our warm tribute also goes to the \nSecretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, as he strives to \nreinvigorate our Organization. \n We all have the great belief that in the twenty-\nfirst century the United Nations will be a more \neffective Organization. The continued relevance of this \nOrganization will, to a large extent, depend on our \nability to attune it to our concerns and make it \nresponsive to our needs.  \n The United Nations must continue to serve the \ninterests of all its Members States, regardless of \nwhether they are big or small. Our approach to \nproblems that transcend national boundaries should be \nbased on a global consensus, while maintaining the key \nrole of the United Nations in the cooperative \nmanagement of these problems. We need to advance \nfurther and harmonize diverging views on the reform \nof the Security Council. The Council should be \ntransformed into a democratic and respectful organ, \nreflecting its universal character, corresponding to \npresent-day realities, and taking into consideration the \nneed for balanced geographic representation in its \nmembership. \n The reform package should strengthen the \nGeneral Assembly as the policy-making organ of the \nUnited Nations. It is only through reinforcement of the \nAssembly\u2019s role and mandate that we can successfully \ntackle some of the most pressing issues facing \nhumanity, not least the process of globalization. \n This year, 2007, marks the fifteenth anniversary \nof Azerbaijan\u2019s membership in the United Nations. I \nwill use this apt occasion both for reflecting on our \nexperience and for looking ahead. The development of \nour region is inextricably linked to energy security \nissues. We in Azerbaijan have been working for more \nthan 10 years on our energy security. When we started \nour energy projects, the development of oil and gas \nfields and construction of pipelines, we could not \nimagine that our energy resources would be so crucial \nin supporting the causes of free competition and free \nmarket. But it so happens that we are right on time and \nready to provide an important contribution to global \nenergy security. \n Our firm dedication to the policy of economic, \npolitical and social reform allowed us to improve our \neconomic performance significantly. Last year, we had \na 34 per cent growth in gross domestic product (GDP), \nand more than 35 per cent this year. In four years, the \nState budget increased more than fourfold. We \nmanaged to decrease unemployment and poverty \nsignificantly. A 36.8 per cent increase in the \npopulation\u2019s income and savings in financial \ninstitutions is a direct indication of the improvement in \nlivelihood. \n Investments continue to play a catalytic role in \nthe overall development of the country. In 2007, the \nlevel of investments from all financial sources has \nreached a growth of 10.6 per cent. Most important, as \ncompared to previous years, the share of domestic \ninvestments currently accounts for a significant \nincrease of 50.8 per cent, and a large part of it goes to \nthe non-oil sector. These are very important steps \ntowards achieving our goal of a diversified economy. \n We believe that the sustainability of growth and \ndevelopment in Azerbaijan not only is ensured by the \navailability of natural resources but also attests to the \ncommitment and capacity of the Government to protect \nthe rights of investors and to implement its \ncommitments under various contracts in the \nmultibillion range. \n Transparency and efficiency in oil revenue \nmanagement constitutes an important part of the \nGovernment\u2019s efforts to improve public service and \naccountability. Thus, it gives me great pleasure to \ninform delegates that the State Oil Fund of Azerbaijan, \nwhich leads the implementation of the Extractive \nIndustries Transparency Initiative (EITI) in Azerbaijan, \nwon the prestigious 2007 United Nations Public \nService Award in the category of improving \ntransparency, accountability and responsiveness in the \npublic service. We believe that this success shows the \nefficiency of our Initiative, and we invite United \nNations Member States to discuss the achievements \nmade under the EITI. We plan to introduce a draft \nresolution on this subject during the current session. \n Using our geographical location and unique \ntransportation possibilities, we are pioneering projects \non bridging Europe and Asia. Countries to the east of \nthe Caspian Sea have expressed a vivid interest in these \nprojects, and the role of Azerbaijan in regional affairs \nhas become more important and has been transformed \ninto a stabilization factor. \n By dint of its political and historical background, \nAzerbaijan became home to various cultures and \nreligions. Building on this rich experience, during its \nchairmanship of the Organization of the Islamic \nConference Ministerial Council, our country provided \nsubstantial input to enhancing dialogue and broadening \nmutual understanding among nations, cultures and \nreligions. We believe that by spreading knowledge \nabout Islam and its values, cultural dialogue between \nthe civilizations will contribute to mutual \nunderstanding and trust. In this regard, the framework \nof the Alliance of Civilizations provides a good \nopportunity for joint action and partnership. \n Azerbaijan currently holds the rotating \nchairmanship of the GUAM (Georgia, Ukraine, \nAzerbaijan and Moldova) group. Our priority is to \nespouse GUAM geopolitical and geo-economic \nadvantages, utilize its role as a natural corridor \nbridging Europe and Asia and promote the \ndevelopment of civil societies and the economic \ncooperation of GUAM Member States. \n At the same time, GUAM serves as an effective \ninstrument to increase the international community\u2019s \nawareness about risks and challenges that its Member \nStates have been facing. In this regard, I would like \nrefer to agenda item 16 of the current session relating \nto the protracted conflicts in the territories of \nAzerbaijan, Georgia and Moldova. These conflicts \nhave almost the same origin, similarly-developed \nscenario and dangerous outcome. They all started from \nthe manifestation of aggressive separatism, were \naccompanied by ethnic cleansing against civilians and \nresulted in the violation of the sovereignty and \nterritorial integrity of these States. \n GUAM is firmly convinced that the settlement of \nthese protracted conflicts must be based on territorial \nintegrity within their internationally recognized \nborders. Together with GUAM colleagues, Azerbaijan \nwill defend this fundamental principle of international \nlaw, initiate formal discussions in the General \nAssembly and mobilize support of the United Nations \nMember States. \n The Armenian-Azerbaijani Nagorny Karabakh \nconflict remains the most serious challenge to the \nsecurity of our region. As a result of the conflict, we \nare still facing the continued occupation by Armenia of \na significant part, almost 20 per cent, of the \ninternationally recognized territories of Azerbaijan. We \nare hosting approximately one million refugees and \ninternally displaced persons, who were notoriously \nethnically cleansed and brutally expelled from their \nhomes of origin in Armenia and in the occupied \nterritories of Azerbaijan. \n Azerbaijan\u2019s position on conflict settlement is \nfully based on the norms and principles of international  \nlaw, plus four relevant resolutions of the United \nNations Security Council that provide for the \nrestoration of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of \nAzerbaijan and the establishment of vast opportunities \nfor the Azerbaijani and Armenian communities of the \nNagorny Karabakh region of Azerbaijan. \n Negotiations on conflict resolution, which since \n1992 have been carried out within the framework of \nthe OSCE Minsk Group, have so far not yielded any \nresults. The more time passes, the more difficult it is \nfor us to observe from our side of the line of contact \nthe attempts of the current Armenian leadership to \nconsolidate the results of the occupation of our \nterritories, their attempts to destroy everything \nassociated with the Azerbaijani legacy in these \nterritories and to carry out illegal activities thereon. \nThe United Nations shall not tolerate such action. From \nthis high podium, I would like to address the Armenian \nnation in order that they recognize that their policy of \nbreaching peace and stability in the region has very \ndangerous, counter-productive and disastrous \nimplications for the long-term perspective of \ndevelopment, above all, for Armenia. I am confident \nthat Azerbaijan will restore its sovereignty and \nterritorial integrity. It is only a question of time. \n Finally, on this issue, I would like to express our \ngratitude to Member States for their unequivocal \nsupport extended in September 2006 to General \nAssembly resolution 60/285, entitled \u201cThe situation in \nthe occupied territories of Azerbaijan\u201d. Although \nArmenia dissociated itself from the resolution after \njoining the consensus on it, we still believe that \nestablishing the proper conditions for the \nenvironmental operation may become a significant \nconfidence-building measure. \n As a member of the Human Rights Council, \nAzerbaijan attaches great importance to the efficient \nfunctioning of the Council. It is our common task and \nresponsibility to ensure that this institution lives up to \nthe expectations vested in it and becomes a truly \nobjective, vigorous and credible universal human rights \nbody. We are looking forward to finalizing the \ninstitution-building of the Council so that it becomes \nfully operational and devotes attention to the issues \ndirectly within its mandate. \n In the course of the last two years, the United \nNations has continued to represent a unique platform \nfor international standard-setting in the field of human \nrights by adopting two major documents \u2014 namely, the \nInternational Convention for the Protection of All \nPersons from Enforced Disappearance and the \nConvention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. \nUndoubtedly, adoption of those important instruments \nrepresents a significant step forward in a long \nhistorical process. Already a signatory to the first \nConvention, Azerbaijan is currently considering \nsigning the latter. \n"

        "file_text": "The  great challenges and problems, both global and \nregional, call for urgent and coherent responses. The \nresponsibilities and the role of the United Nations in \nraising awareness and in providing unity of direction \nare now greater and more important. That is exactly \nwhy compliance with United Nations resolutions \nshould be a top priority for all, including those are \nelected to represent the Organization and its agencies.  \n I should like to congratulate Her Excellency \nSheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa   who was only the \nthird woman in the history of the United Nations to \noccupy the post of President of this Assembly   on \nher efforts to promote the purpose and principles for \nwhich our Organization was founded. \n I should also like to express our appreciation to \nthe Secretary-General for his tireless efforts to \nsafeguard international peace and security and for his \nkeeping alive the authority and role of the Organization \nin this area. \n Greece fully aligns itself with the statement made \nby the Prime Minister of Portugal on behalf of the \nEuropean Union. However, we would like to add a few \npoints about the major issues on our agenda for the \ncoming period. \n The end of the Cold War ushered in a new era in \ninternational relations in which the threat of military \nconfrontation between the two power blocs dissipated. \nHowever, the world community still faces violent \ninternal conflicts, civil wars, genocide and other large-\nscale atrocities that cause immense destruction and \nsuffering to millions of people. \n And yet, conflicts within and between States are \nnot the only threat to international peace and security. \nNew threats and challenges are emerging. Proliferation \nof weapons of mass destruction is a serious challenge. \nOrganized crime and human trafficking constitute \nanother threat that can have destabilizing effects and \nfuel civil wars. Extreme poverty in many parts of the \nworld, failing States, large-scale humanitarian \ndisasters, deadly infectious diseases and environmental \ndegradation and catastrophes have devastating \nconsequences. \n We applaud the Secretary-General\u2019s initiative to \nhold a high-level event last week to deal with climate \nchange, environmental issues being potentially the \ngreatest threat to our societies. I hope that a global, \nsustained and comprehensive approach emerges soon \nto help save our planet, our future, our children\u2019s \nfuture. \n Controlling and coping with climate change is \none of the greatest environmental and development \nchallenges. Without swift action to face the problems \narising from these challenges, we all risk paying a high \nand bitter price.  We should proceed in a timely manner, \nthrough a step-by-step approach, building on national \nas well as international capacities in order to address \nthe causes, mitigate the effects and create synergies \nthat will allow for specific and measurable results in \nthe near future. A clear indication of the importance \nGreece attaches to the environment is the fact that the \nGreek chairmanship of the Human Security Network \nhas decided to focus on climate change and human \nsecurity. \n This summer my country suffered enormously \nfrom devastating wildfires. May I take this opportunity, \nwhile addressing the international community, to \nexpress our deep gratitude and thanks to all those \ncountries and friends who have extended to us their \ninvaluable support, help and assistance. \n Working for peace is not an easy task. The pursuit \nof international peace and stability, if it is to be \nsuccessful, means that threats have to be addressed in a \ncomprehensive way and that many conditions have to \nbe met. Unresolved conflicts have to be energetically \nconfronted, while, at the same time, we have to deal \nwith situations of deep-seated injustice, inequality, \nongoing violence, social exclusion, extreme poverty, \nfamine, illiteracy and cultural misunderstanding. \n In addressing the deep-rooted structural problems \nthat fuel conflicts, peacebuilding must bridge security \nand development. Good governance, the rule of law, \nstrong democratic institutions, respect for human rights \nand development assistance are critical components in \nreducing today\u2019s conflicts. \n Terrorism is undeniably one of the most serious \nthreats to peace and security, menacing the very \nfoundation  of our democratic societies, and actions to \ncombat this threat should be in conformity with \ninternational human rights standards and fundamental \nfreedoms. The adoption of the Global Counter-\nTerrorism Strategy by the General Assembly was a \nmajor accomplishment, and its full implementation \nshould be an absolute priority for Member States. In \nthis respect, I would like to emphasize the importance \nthat my country attaches to the conclusion of ongoing \nnegotiations for the elaboration of a comprehensive \nconvention against international terrorism; it would be \na valuable addition to the counter-terrorism legal \nframework. \n In the face of all the threats and challenges that \ntranscend State borders, we need a more \ncomprehensive concept of collective security, one \nbased on respect and justice as requirements for peace \nand solidarity as a condition for security, and entailing \na commitment from all to promote sustainable \ndevelopment. But above all, we need a commitment to \ncollective political action requiring the strengthening \nof the United Nations. \n The early, comprehensive and coherent \nprevention of conflicts lies at the heart of the United \nNations mandate for the maintenance of international \npeace and security. Integrated and long-term strategies \nto address the root causes of conflict are necessary. The \nUnited Nations should therefore be strengthened in its \nmanaging, resolving and preventing conflicts and their \nrecurrence. International regional organizations should \nalso be effective in this regard, and international \ntreaties should be respected. \n The United Nations was created on the basis of \nthe resolve of all States that collective action was the \nonly basis for taking measures to address our common \nglobal problems. We only have common values \nenshrined in the United Nations Charter that guide our \nefforts and give us direction to unite around what is \njust and right   freedom, democracy, human rights, \nequality, peaceful resolution of conflicts, respect, \nmulticulturalism, tolerance and open societies, and \ndialogue among neighbours, nations, religions and \ncultures. Greece\u2019s foreign and security policy is based \nprecisely on these principles and values. We are \ncommitted to the peaceful settlement of disputes, the \nupholding of international law, including international \nhumanitarian law, and promoting good neighbourly \nrelations. \n I deeply regret to note that, 33 years after the \nTurkish invasion in 1974, the Republic of Cyprus \nremains a divided island. Turkey continues to occupy \npart of a United Nations and European Union (EU) \nMember State with over 40,000 troops, violating \nUnited Nations resolutions and international law. Our \nsteadfast objective remains the withdrawal of all \noccupation troops and the reunification of the island, in \nthe context of a bizonal, bicommunal federation. To \nthis end, the relevant United Nations resolutions and \nthe EU principles and values provide a clear \nframework for a comprehensive settlement agreed upon \nby the two communities. \n Greece has consistently welcomed the United \nNations initiatives for finding a just and viable solution \nto the Cyprus question. In this vein, we strongly \nsupport the rapid implementation of the 8 July 2006 \nagreement, which was reached under United Nations \nauspices. We shall continue to do everything possible \nto assist the two communities to find an agreed \nsolution, not least because it would significantly \nenhance the development of friendship and cooperation \nbetween Greece and Turkey. We strongly urge Turkey \nto demonstrate the necessary will and flexibility \ntowards this direction. \n Our foreign policy is based on the principles of \ninternational law and the United Nations Charter. It is \nin this spirit that we approach our relations with \nneighbouring Turkey. Greece has taken specific steps \nand initiatives to continue broadening and \nstrengthening our cooperation with Turkey in all fields. \nLately, it has grown even further in the economic field, \nbut also in the energy sector. We believe that a \ndemocratic Turkey with a clear European orientation, a \nTurkey that meets the European criteria and \nrequirements set out in the negotiating framework with \nthe European Union, can be a factor for stability in our \npart of the world. That is why we support Turkey\u2019s \nEuropean aspirations. Turkey, however, must \nconcretely demonstrate its unequivocal commitment to \nthe principles of good neighbourly relations and \npeaceful settlement of disputes with all its neighbours. \nIn any case, from the outset Greece has repeatedly \nstated that Turkey\u2019s full compliance should lead to full \nmembership. \n Good neighbourly relations are the cornerstone \nupon which the countries of South-East Europe must \nbuild a common European future of peace, stability and \nprosperity. The European perspective of the countries \nof our region has been a strategic choice for Greece. \nOur vision is to transform our neighbourhood into a \nregion that is like the rest of Europe   an area of \npeace, democracy and prosperity. As the oldest member \nof the EU and NATO in the region, my country works \nintensively and constructively to create the necessary \nconditions of good neighbourliness, mutual \nunderstanding and stability in the Balkans. \n Enhancing regional cooperation, establishing \ngood neighbourly relations and finding mutually \nacceptable solutions to outstanding issues with \nneighbouring countries are fundamental prerequisites \nfor further integration of the aspirant countries of \nSouth-East Europe into the Euro-Atlantic institutions. \nProvocative acts and statements with irredentist \nconnotations are incompatible with United Nations \nprinciples and common European values. They poison \nthe necessary climate of understanding between our \npeoples, and they are contrary to the European concept. \nIn this context, Security Council resolutions 817 \n(1993) and 845 (1993), calling for a mutually \nacceptable solution to the name issue of the former \nYugoslav Republic of Macedonia, need to be respected \nin practice by all. \nOur efforts to secure a truly European future for \nthe Balkans will remain inconclusive if we fail to reach \na viable and sustainable settlement for Kosovo\u2019s future \nstatus. We remain convinced that this goal can be met \nonly if, first, effective compromises between the two \nparties are achieved in the course of the ongoing \nnegotiations and, secondly, if the settlement is \nlegitimized through a Security Council resolution. In \nany case, this is par excellence a European problem, \nand the role of the European Union in this issue is \nessential. \n I cannot think of any conflict that has held the \nunwavering attention of so many for so long as the one \nin the Middle East. We are all aware of the \nmultifaceted challenges that we face in this part of the \nworld. And we all agree that the nature of these \nchallenges is such that they affect not only the peoples \nof the region, but the entire international community. \nDespite the variances that we observe among us, there \nis one crucial element that is common to all, and that is \nthe need to achieve a just and lasting peace in the \nMiddle East based on a two-State solution that will \nguarantee security, mutual respect and a fair future for \nall. This is our common goal, and Greece is deeply \ncommitted to it. \n The progress Africa has been making in recent \nyears is both substantial and undeniable. It is \ncharacterized by economic growth, crisis management \nand a will for conflict prevention. The United Nations, \ndeeply involved in peacekeeping and providing \ndevelopmental assistance, has found in the African \nUnion and the African regional organizations a vital \npartner for the success of this process. Partnership \nbetween the United Nations and the African Union, as \nwell as the African regional organizations, could well \nbe the key to successfully overcoming the challenges \nfacing Africa today. In this context, we welcome the \ncreation of the joint African Union/United Nations \nHybrid Operation in Darfur (UNAMID), which, by \ncombining forces of the United Nations and of the \nAfrican Union, shows the way to the future for Darfur \nand for the continent as a whole. \n International development cooperation is one of \nthe priorities of Greek foreign policy. Our national \ndevelopment agency, Hellenic Aid, implements the \nUnited Nations Millennium Development Goals in the \nframework set out by the European Union and the \nprinciples followed by the Development Assistance \nCommittee of the Organisation for Economic \nCooperation and Development, while focusing on our \ncultural heritage. Our humanitarian and development \nprojects in 46 countries aim at combating poverty, \ndisease, malnutrition, lack of access to drinking water, \nand dealing with the consequences of natural disasters \nand conflict situations, while safeguarding the \nprotection of human rights. We strive to address the \nroot causes of illegal immigration, human trafficking \nand terrorism, since enforcement measures alone are \nnot enough to address those problems. In 2005, Greece \nallocated $384.22 million to finance actions to the \nbenefit of our partner countries in the developing \nworld. In Africa, development assistance, ranging from \nhumanitarian aid to HIV/AIDS care and refugee \nprogrammes, was offered to almost 20 African States. \n On all the issues I have referred to, my country is \ncommitted to assisting the United Nations and to \ncooperating with all individual Member States in order \nto achieve peace and prosperity for all peoples of the \nworld. \n"

        "file_text": "First, allow me to \ncongratulate you, Mr. President, on your election. At \nthe same time, I should like to pay tribute to the work \nof your predecessor, Her Excellency Sheikha Haya \nRashed Al-Khalifa. \n On this occasion I want to say how much my \ncountry has benefited from the existence of the United \nNations. The universal values enshrined in the United \nNations Charter and the Universal Declaration of \nHuman Rights have given a context and perspective to \nour sovereignty and self-determination. Iceland\u2019s story \nis testimony to the fact that it is through civilized \ncoexistence within the community of nations that \nsocieties prosper. Within living memory, Iceland \nprogressed from being one of the poorest countries in \nEurope to one of the most prosperous. We have had the \ngood fortune to be able to build a Nordic welfare \nsociety on the sustainable harvesting of our natural \nresources.  \n As a small, dynamic State without a military, it is \nour natural inclination to look for the peaceful \nsettlement of disputes within the international \ncommunity. Our independence, which we achieved \nsome 60 years ago, is built on more than our \ndemocratic institutions, fundamentally important \nthough they are. Our freedom in the widest sense has \nbeen achieved through economic development as well \nas the guarantee of human rights and democracy.  \n In our experience, freedom is complex and \nmultifaceted. All human rights are universal, \nindivisible, interdependent and interrelated. But it is \nevident that poverty, inequality and the lack of \neconomic and social rights can make the exercise of \npolitical and civil rights difficult.  \n We are now about halfway to our deadline for the \nMillennium Development Goals. The year 2015 is \naround the corner and we will soon need to deliver on \nour promises. There has been some good news: it \nseems likely that the goal of halving the number of \npeople living in extreme poverty by 2015 will be \nreached. However, progress on many human \ndevelopment goals, such as on child mortality, has been \ndisappointing. Regional challenges remain, particularly \nin sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. It is incumbent \nupon those who have the good fortune to be prosperous \nto join in solidarity with others to make these rights \navailable to all. What is more, the security challenges \nthat we face this century are such that they can only be \naddressed together, in solidarity with others. Climate \nchange is a prime example. \n Indeed, the phenomenon of climate change is \nalready devastating the lives of millions across a broad \nswathe of Africa, among many small island States and \nwidely in Asia. Every region and most countries can \nexpect to feel the effects of climate change in the near \nfuture. How we address this issue as an international \ncommunity is a test of our commitment to the \nfundamental values of the United Nations and our \nability to act together in light of our shared \nresponsibility. The discussions that took place earlier \nthis week were an important step in identifying means \nand measures in this respect, and I thank the Secretary-\nGeneral for his initiative. Although climate change is a \nglobal phenomenon, it tends to be the poorest in \ndeveloping countries that are hardest hit   those that \nare least responsible for causing climate change. \nClimate change is thus a severe threat to poverty \nreduction. \n It is important that the international community \ntreats adaptation to climate change not as a stand-alone \nissue but as an integral part of our common efforts to \nattain the Millennium Development Goals. A \ncomprehensive approach is needed if we are to see \nresults. The Government of Iceland is committed to \nshowing solidarity with the most vulnerable in \nadapting to the effects of climate change. \n Iceland regards women\u2019s empowerment and full \nparticipation at all levels as a fundamental issue for the \nnew millennium. Whether in relation to peace and \nsecurity, health, poverty or climate change, the \nempowerment of women is the key to success. Women \nand men need to be equally represented and listened to \neverywhere. I should like to reiterate Iceland\u2019s support \nfor the recommendations of the High-level Panel on \nUnited Nations System-wide Coherence regarding \ngender equality and women\u2019s empowerment. The \ncurrent United Nations structure and approach to \ngender issues is too fragmented. The excellent work of \nthe United Nations Development Fund for Women \n(UNIFEM) must be built upon and reinforced within \nthe new structures. We firmly support the \nestablishment of a new gender entity to strengthen the \nperformance of the United Nations in this field of \nwork. Establishing the post of Under-Secretary-\nGeneral for gender equality issues should provide \nstrong leadership and coordination, and it is my hope \nthat this post will be quickly filled. Gender \nmainstreaming has to be addressed throughout the \nwhole United Nations system in a more systematic \nmanner. Let us use the current momentum to bring this \nprocess forward at this session of the General \nAssembly. \n Official development assistance (ODA) plays a \nvital role in achieving the Millennium Development \nGoals. Let me state clearly that Iceland views these \nGoals as common goals. We see development as \nmutually beneficial co-operation. Freedom for Iceland \nhas been built through development and it is a vital \nelement of freedom for all peoples. Donors need to \ndeliver on their promises and accelerate their efforts in \nincreasing development assistance. The Government of \nIceland stands ready to shoulder its responsibility. Our \nODA has doubled over the past four years and we aim \nto be among the top ODA contributors. Increased aid \neffectiveness is central to development results. The \nGovernment of Iceland believes that the United \nNations should be at the forefront of such efforts. We \nsupport the follow-up of the report of the High-level \nPanel on System-wide Coherence (A/61/583), which in \nour view will make the United Nations more effective \nin delivering results on the ground. \n ODA is of course not a panacea. We need to make \nprogress in international trade negotiations. When I \nhad the privilege of attending the meeting of the \nAfrican Union in Accra this summer, I was made aware \nby colleagues of the tremendous potential that African \ncountries see in closer integration across that continent. \nIn a globalized world closer regional cooperation and \nintegration, including trade relations, has, in our \nexperience, been a step towards a better future, a joint \ninvestment of nation States in their common well-\nbeing. \n Iceland pledges full political support to our \ncommon goal of halting global warming. Bearing in \nmind that there is now a window of opportunity, which \nmay close within a decade, the Intergovernmental \nPanel on Climate Change (IPCC) recommendation on \nhalving emissions should be taken seriously. Iceland \nhas set itself a long-term aspirational goal of reducing \nnet greenhouse gas emissions by 50 to 75 per cent by \n2050. The Kyoto Protocol provides a basis for effective \naction by developed nations, which must lead the way \nin controlling emissions. But Kyoto is not universal \nand it is not enough. Iceland believes that the Bali \nmeeting should start a process leading to a \ncomprehensive climate agreement, ideally to be \nconcluded in 2009, the year of the summit in \nCopenhagen. This agreement would cover the \npost-2012 period.  \n There is no \u201csilver bullet\u201d solution to the problem \nof global warming. The issue of deforestation, \nespecially the rain forests, must be addressed. The role \nof new technology is crucial, particularly in regard to \nalternative, sustainable and clean sources of energy. In \nthe field of geothermal energy, where Iceland has \nconsiderable experience, there is wide scope for \ndevelopment. New technology must not, however, \nexacerbate the very serious problems we already face. \nIt is, for example, a matter of grave concern that \nincreases in the production of biomass-based energy \nsources could be raising food prices. New sources of \nrenewable energy must also adhere strictly to long-\nterm environmental demands. This is particularly \nrelevant to the planned build-up of nuclear energy \nreactors. The creativity and research capabilities of \nuniversities, the commitment and inclusiveness of non-\ngovernmental organizations and the drive of business \nand industry must be activated in a broad and \nconsistent effort. Governments cannot do this alone. \n Iceland regards human security, as formulated for \nexample by the 2005 World Summit, to be of \nfundamental political and conceptual importance when \nit comes to discussing and deciding on action \nconcerning peace and security. A key instrument for \nensuring human security is Security Council resolution \n1325 (2000), which needs to be thoroughly \nimplemented. Millions of individuals experience \nassaults on their personal security. I am thinking of the \nbrutality inflicted by some Governments on their own \npeople and by terrorists or irregular forces on civilians.  \n In this context allow me to express deep concern \nover events in Myanmar where the democratically \nelected leader Aung San Suu Kyi has been held in \ndetention for years and where the peaceful expression \nof political dissent is at present being brutally \nrepressed.  \n I am thinking of the attacks on the providers of \nhumanitarian aid in many conflict regions. I am \nthinking of the failure of authorities around the world \nto ensure the protection of women and children from \nviolence and trafficking. In this context I should also \nlike to encourage other Member States to support the \ndraft resolution on a moratorium on the use of the \ndeath penalty. \n I wish to express appreciation for the efforts of \nthe United Nations Secretary-General, the African \nUnion Commission Chairman, and the Security \nCouncil in finding a way forward towards alleviating \nthe suffering of the people of Darfur. There is however \nstill much to be done.  \n Crucial discussions are currently in progress to \nsolve the decades-long situation in the Middle East. It \nis clear to me that most people in Israel and Palestine \nyearn for peace. Indeed, opinion polls bear this out. In \nparticular, women from both sides voice their distress \nat the long-term effects of continued conflict on their \nchildren, who are the future of this region. The talks in \nprogress at the moment, with the support of the \nQuartet, the efforts of the Ad Hoc Liaison Committee, \nand, most important, the efforts of the Israeli and \nPalestinian Governments, give some hope. I encourage \npolitical leaders to ensure that the will for peace among \na great many people on both sides is reflected in the \npolitical process. This requires political courage and \ntrue leadership. It requires restraint when restraint is \nmost difficult. It requires a determination to outflank \nthe spoilers on both sides who wish to sacrifice the real \nprospects for a peaceful and fulfilling life for millions \nto the distant mirage of some unattainable utopia. Final \nstatus issues, which are critical to the Palestinians and \nthe Israelis, must be on the agenda for the peace \nconference that the President of the United States has \nproposed. The outcome must give both sides a clear \nview of a realistic and acceptable future for their \nchildren. Meanwhile, all who have it in their power, \nbear a responsibility to do their utmost to ensure the \nhumanitarian needs of the civilian population. \n Jordan and Syria, neighbouring States of Iraq, \nhave made generous provision for hundreds of \nthousands of refugees from Iraq. Iceland is determined \nto contribute to alleviating the suffering of the Iraqi \npeople and has pledged funds to the Office of the \nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugees for \nthe provision of schooling for Iraqi children in Jordan. \nWe also stand firmly behind United Nations-mandated \nefforts to assist in the stabilization and rebuilding of \nthe country.  \n Clearly a major threat to human security as well \nas State security is the proliferation of arms. Iceland \nregrets the current situation in the fields of arms \ncontrol, disarmament and non-proliferation. Despite \nsustained efforts by the majority of Member States \nover a number of years, only limited progress has been \nmade, some of it outside the United Nations \nframework. Our failures in this area pose a constant \nthreat to peace and security. Now is the time to renew \nour efforts. The conclusion of an arms trade treaty \nwould certainly be a significant achievement. A \nnumber of projects launched by the United Nations \nSummit of 2005 have made steady progress, including \nthe establishment of the Human Rights Council and of \nthe Peacebuilding Commission. The 2005 World \nSummit Outcome (resolution 60/1) also gave the \nGeneral Assembly the task of reforming the Security \nCouncil. The momentum for completing this work \nmust be maintained so that the Security Council can be \nmore representative of our world at the beginning of \nthe twenty-first century. This would entail an increase \nin the number of elected and permanent seats.  \n Iceland has been an active and committed \nMember of the United Nations since 1946. In the light \nof the principle of rotation and the importance of all \nMember States sharing in the responsibility of serving \non the Security Council, we announced in 2000 our \nfirst-time candidacy for a seat for the period 2009-2010 \nwith elections to be held next autumn. This \ncandidature, which is actively supported by the other \nNordic States   Denmark, Finland, Norway and \nSweden   reflects Iceland\u2019s firm commitment to play \nan active role in cooperation with others in addressing \nthe most pressing security threats of the twenty-first \ncentury. As a Nordic country we stand for a long \ntradition of active commitment to the United Nations \nand to the best interests of the whole. The Nordics have \na reputation for being bridge-builders   trusted \nmediators in complex situations. Iceland seeks to \nshoulder the responsibility to exercise with fairness \nand firmness the role of a Security Council member. \n"

        "file_text": "Allow me first of all to \nwarmly congratulate you, Sir, on your election as \nPresident of the General Assembly at its sixty-second \nsession. I am pleased to see you, a high-ranking official \nfrom the rather underrepresented Eastern European \nGroup, assuming that prestigious post of the United \nNations. In fulfilling your challenging tasks during this \nsession, you may be assured of the support and \ncooperation of the delegation of Hungary. I would also \nlike to pay tribute to your predecessor, Sheikha Haya \nRashed Al-Khalifa. \n During the sixty-first session, Member States \nworked hard to come to agreement on the proposals \nmade at the 2005 Summit meeting, but we still need to \ndo more to ensure that the United Nations system is \nmanaged coherently and effectively. I believe that the \nworld needs, more than ever before, effective \nmultilateralism, which is still a key word for the future. \nWe should make progress on management reform, \nmandate review and disarmament, and define further \nconcrete steps towards a renewed Security Council. \n Hungary would have preferred for the issue of \nSecurity Council reform to have seen more progress \nduring the sixty-first session of the General Assembly. \nThe impasse was certainly not due to the lack of effort \non the part of the President of the General Assembly or \nto a shortage of creative ideas. We believe that the best \nsolution would still be a balanced increase of seats to \nbetter reflect the political realities of today. The \nenlargement process should be combined with tangible \nimprovement of the Council\u2019s working methods. \n We welcome the adoption of the new resolution \non the revitalization of the General Assembly. It is up \nto each Member State to make the work of the \nAssembly meaningful and to ensure that the Assembly \ntakes up issues of genuine concern and takes decisions \nthat have a real impact on the political process. \n Let me now turn to Geneva, where important \nreforms have taken place as well. The Human Rights \nCouncil has finally started its work, in an atmosphere \nof high expectations. The consensus over the universal \nperiodic review mechanism sends a clear message that \nall countries will have their human rights records \nexamined at regular intervals. Thus, no country will be \nimmune from international scrutiny. However, in order \nto make it truly meaningful, we have to build a credible \nand robust mechanism. Special procedures and \ncontributions to the review from treaty bodies and non-\ngovernmental organizations will prove to be essential \nin that regard. \n In order to better protect human rights and \nfundamental freedoms, the system of special \nprocedures   a unique web of protection   has \ncontinued to provide effective action for the benefit of \nvictims of human rights abuses. Special rapporteurs \nand independent experts have continued their work, \ngiving a voice to the voiceless, even at times when the \nCouncil was focusing mainly on the task of institution-\nbuilding. \n We are thoroughly convinced that both thematic \nand country-specific mandates remain valid, given the \nnumerous human rights violations still occurring on a \ndaily basis. In that regard, we concur with the \nSecretary-General, who has emphasized the need to \nconsider all situations of possible human rights \nviolations on an equal footing. Not having a special \nrapporteur assigned to a particular country does not \nabsolve that country from its obligations under the \nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights and other \nhuman rights instruments. \n I should now like to share some thoughts about \nan issue dear to my country. We welcomed with great \nsatisfaction the recent decision of the Human Rights \nCouncil to establish a forum on minority issues. I am \nconfident that the forum will provide a useful platform \nfor dialogue and exchange of views between \nminorities, Governments and other stakeholders on \nissues related to national or ethnic, linguistic and \nreligious minorities. \n Allow me to place special emphasis on the \nempowerment of women. We firmly believe in the need \nfor the effective involvement of women in the \ndecision-making processes at both the national and the \ninternational levels. In that regard, Hungary supports \nthe ongoing debate on the future of the strengthened \ngender equality architecture. We welcome the steps \ntaken towards achieving effective gender \nmainstreaming throughout the entire United Nations \nsystem. \n On 30 March, we witnessed the signing ceremony \nof the Convention on the Rights of Persons with \nDisabilities. That new international instrument will \nimprove the living conditions of almost 650 million \npersons with disabilities all over the world, ensuring \nequal opportunities for them in all aspects of life. As \nthe second State party to ratify the Convention and its \nOptional Protocol, we hope that they will enter into \nforce soon. \n Seven years ago, our Governments made a \nremarkable promise to the world in adopting the \nMillennium Declaration (resolution 55/2). Although \nthere has certainly been some progress in achieving its \nobjectives, there will be regions of the world where the \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) will not have \nbeen met by 2015 if we do not intensify our efforts. In \nthe meantime, we must also emphasize the central role \nof national policies and development strategies in \nachieving the Goals. The sustainability of development \ndepends heavily on national ownership and leadership. \nAt the global level, the United Nations has a \ncomparative advantage in providing technical \nassistance in the preparation and implementation of \nnational development plans. We fully support the \nrecommendations of the High-level Panel on United \nNations System-wide Coherence to improve the \noperational effectiveness, inter-agency cooperation, \npredictability and accountability of the United Nations \nsystem. \n The Millennium Development Goals represent \nthe global commitment to fundamental rights, which \nmust be guaranteed if we genuinely seek to strengthen \nour democracies. Democracy should also mean \ncreating the conditions for sustainable economic \ndevelopment that provides people with access   \nthrough decent jobs   to opportunities to achieve full \npersonal development. \n We are particularly pleased that Hungary can \nshare its transitional experiences, both as a member of \nthe Advisory Board of the United Nations Democracy \nFund and through the International Centre for \nDemocratic Transition, which is based in Budapest and \nwhich has a partnership agreement with the Democracy \nFund. The United Nations has a special responsibility \nto address challenges related to institution-building and \nto promote democracy. As Amartya Sen, the Nobel \nPrize winning economist has said, countries need not \nbe fit for democracy; they need to become fit through \ndemocracy. \n Hungary, as an emerging donor, is determined to \nmeet the obligations set out in the Millennium \nDeclaration and the Millennium Development Goals. \nWe are ready to increase our official development \nassistance and to carry out our efforts in line with the \nEuropean Consensus on development and the Paris \nDeclaration on Aid Effectiveness. However, we are \nconvinced that scaling up the volume of aid in itself \nwill not necessarily lead to the achievement of the \nMillennium Development Goals. It is also important to \nemphasize the need for better complementarity, \ncoordination and coherence in development \ncooperation. \n Having been fully integrated into the European \nUnion (EU) and NATO structures, we are committed to \ncarrying out qualitative change in the outreach of \nHungarian foreign policy. We want to make our policy \nand our presence more visible in all parts of the world: \nan active development cooperation and assistance \npolicy coupled with an increased presence in United \nNations bodies. We are resolved to attach special \nattention to creating more balance in the geographical \nscope of our cooperation policy in order to include \nAfrican, Asian and Latin American countries. Stepping \nup our outreach efforts and developing not only \nassistance activities but also economic ties with Africa \nwill mark the beginning of a new era in our \nrelationship with that continent. \n We are also ready to assume more responsibilities \nin various international forums. Our ambitions are best \nembodied in our application for a non-permanent seat \non the Security Council for the period 2012-2013. We \nview our potential membership as an opportunity to \nengage in constructive cooperation with all our \npartners in order to achieve our common objectives on \nthe basis of shared interests and values. \n Let me now focus on some of the most urgent \nforeign policy issues of our day. \n Peace and stability in the Balkan region is of \nparamount importance to my country, and to Europe as \na whole. While the question of the future status of \nKosovo has drawn international attention, we are aware \nthat the issue of Kosovo is a challenge that needs to be \nprimarily tackled by Europe. Nevertheless, the United \nNations has played a pivotal role in the process to date. \nOur hope is that that will continue to be the case until a \nproper solution is found. \n There is no doubt that there is a significant role to \nbe played by the EU in facilitating a satisfactory \nsolution for Kosovo. One thing is certain among all the \nuncertainties: the status quo is not a solution. More \nthan ever, the region needs stability, economic \ndevelopment and inter-ethnic reconciliation. The \nEuropean Union has invested much in the region in \nterms of material, political and military assistance. It \nhas also offered the countries of the region prospects \nfor joining the European Union. \n With regard to Serbia, we are convinced that \nreinforcing the prospects for future membership of the \nEU may facilitate finding a solution to the question of \nKosovo. Hungary therefore looks forward to a \nsuccessful outcome to the new round of negotiations \nfacilitated by the EU-United States-Russia Troika, \nwhich the parties should approach in a constructive and \nfrank manner. We hope that the encouraging signs of \ntrust and a constructive approach will prevail in the \ncourse of the entire process, and that the parties will be \nable to come to an agreement endorsed by the Security \nCouncil. \nWe are following with great attention the work of \nthe teams set up recently by Israeli Prime Minister \nEhud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud \nAbbas to negotiate core issues related to a permanent \nsolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. We welcome \nthe initiative of the President of the United States to \nconvene an international conference in November. \n Hungary is firmly committed to the \nreconstruction of Afghanistan. As a State member of \nthe North Atlantic alliance, we have been involved in \nthe NATO-led International Security Assistance Force \nsince 2003. On 1 October 2006, we took over the \nleadership of the Provincial Reconstruction Team in \nBaghlan province. I am proud of the successful work \ndone by Hungary\u2019s military contingent and by \nHungarian teams of aid workers. Moreover, I can \nconfirm our future commitment in Afghanistan, which \nenjoys broad political consensus among all the parties \nrepresented in the Hungarian parliament. Nevertheless, \nwe must not forget that the primary responsibility for \nthe stabilization and development of Afghanistan lies \nwith the Afghan people themselves. We are concerned \nabout the security situation and the attacks carried out \nby Taliban and anti-Government forces, and we firmly \ncondemn all hostage-taking actions. Drug production \nand trafficking continue to be a major source of \ninstability, and we note the increase in opium \nproduction with grave concern. We encourage the \nAfghan Government, working in close cooperation \nwith the international community and in particular with \nits regional partners, to take effective measures to \nstabilize the whole region. \n The stabilization of Iraq is one of the major \nchallenges in the Middle East. We appreciate the \nresults that have been achieved so far in the course of \nthe country\u2019s democratic transformation. However, the \nIraqi political class needs to overcome the present state \nof deep division and start to walk down the path of \nreconciliation and cooperation in order to bring peace \nand stability to the country. As a precondition for a \nlong-lasting settlement of the conflict, the international \ncommunity must enable Iraqi leaders to assume \nownership and govern their country in an independent \nway. \n Hungary is very concerned about the acts of \nviolence perpetrated by the security forces of the \nBurma/Myanmar Government. We are committed to \nrespecting human rights and democracy, and we \ntherefore strongly condemn the brutal physical attacks \nagainst peaceful demonstrators. I reiterate our previous \ncall on the Government of Burma/Myanmar to fully \nrespect human rights and the norms of democracy, in \nparticular the rights to peaceful assembly and to the \nfree expression of opinions. \n Due to one of the most worrisome conflicts on \nthe African continent   the one raging in Darfur   \nthe situation in the Sudan and nearby countries is still \nunpredictable and explosive. Hungary welcomes the \nrenewed momentum in the efforts to resolve the Darfur \nconflict, in particular the agreement reached on the \ndeployment of the African Union-United Nations \nhybrid force and the subsequent adoption of Security \nCouncil resolution 1769 (2007). We consider it \nessential that the Hybrid Operation be launched, and \nthat troops be fully deployed in the full number \nauthorized, as soon as possible. I would like to \ncommend Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on having \nmade resolving the Darfur conflict a priority, as well as \non his visit to the Sudan. It is in that context that I \nreaffirm our support for the peacebuilding and \npeacekeeping efforts of the United Nations. \n Hungary welcomes the fact that the \nPeacebuilding Commission has started its work and has \nmet in a country-specific format to consider the cases \nof Burundi and Sierra Leone. We look forward to the \nfirst report on its work. We consider the Commission to \nbe an important instrument to enhance the capabilities \nof the United Nations to support countries emerging \nfrom conflict. \n We are fully aware of the need to strengthen the \ncapacity of the United Nations to mount and sustain \ncomplex and multidimensional peacekeeping \noperations. Hungary commends the efforts made by the \nSecretary-General to achieve that purpose and \nwelcomes the General Assembly\u2019s decision to establish \nthe Department of Field Support. My country\u2019s track \nrecord in the field of peacekeeping demonstrates that \nwe are willing to actively support the Security \nCouncil\u2019s decisions. Hungarian military and police \npersonnel are present in many of the peacekeeping \nmissions of the United Nations, namely, in Cyprus, \nGeorgia, Kosovo, Lebanon and Western Sahara. \n My recent participation at the fifty-first General \nConference of the International Atomic Energy Agency \n(IAEA) and my talks with Director General Mohamed \nElBaradei reaffirmed my conviction that questions \nrelating to nuclear safety and non-proliferation should \nremain high on our agenda. \n Hungary shares the concerns of the international \ncommunity over Iran\u2019s nuclear programme. We deplore \nIran\u2019s failure to take the steps required by the IAEA \nBoard of Governors and by Security Council \nresolutions, steps necessary to re-establish \ninternational confidence in the peaceful nature of its \nnuclear programme. We welcomed the adoption of \nSecurity Council resolutions 1737 (2006) and 1747 \n(2007), and we fully comply with the obligations set \nforth therein. We hope that Iran will soon realize that a \ndiplomatic and negotiated solution is possible and that \ncompliance has many benefits. \n Hungary continues to support the process aimed \nat achieving the denuclearization of the Korean \npeninsula in a peaceful manner and welcomes the first \npromising results of the Six-Party Talks. Developments \nrelated to the North Korean nuclear issue have \nunderscored the importance of the early entry into \nforce of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. \n Hungary supports all multilateral, regional and \nbilateral efforts that contribute in an effective manner \nto our common goal of achieving disarmament and \ncurbing the spread of weapons of mass destruction. \nSuch efforts must also aim at upholding and \nstrengthening key international treaties and export \ncontrol regimes. In that context, one of the most \nimportant challenges is to ensure compliance with the \nTreaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. \nMoreover, Hungary welcomes the entry into force of \nthe International Convention for the Suppression of \nActs of Nuclear Terrorism, which we ratified in April. \n An urgent issue in the field of counter-terrorism \nis the full and earliest possible implementation of the \nUnited Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy. In \nthat regard, the main responsibility lies with Member \nStates, which should all also actively participate in the \nupcoming implementation review. The conclusion of a \ncomprehensive convention on international terrorism \nremains another high priority for Hungary. \n Fifteen years after the United Nations Conference \non Environment and Development, the Rio Summit, it \nis evident that, at the current pace, our efforts will not \nbe sufficient to halt the emerging global threats, in \nparticular that of climate change. The European Union \nhas a clear position in that regard, and it has proposed \nto speed up the drafting of a new global compact. As a \nmember of the EU, Hungary fully agrees with the \nurgency of the matter. We hope that the ongoing \ndeliberations on the future of the United Nations \nFramework Convention on Climate Change and of the \nKyoto Protocol will lead to concrete results within two \nyears. I would like to take this opportunity to welcome \nthe efforts made by Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to \nraise awareness about climate change in the \ninternational community. \n On behalf of my country, I would like to reiterate \nHungary\u2019s commitment to upholding the rule of \ninternational law, to giving priority to effective \nmultilateralism, to spreading the culture of cooperation \nand the peaceful settlement of international disputes, \nand to making every effort to preserve a sustainable \nenvironment for future generations. \n In conclusion, Hungary is strongly committed to \nworking with you, Mr. President, during the sixty-\nsecond session of the General Assembly to achieve the \nobjectives set out in the 2005 World Summit Outcome. \n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of  the Government and the people of the Republic of San \nMarino, I join the unanimous tribute paid to you, \nMr. Srgjan Kerim, on your election as President of the \nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-second session by \nexpressing my most sincere congratulations on your \nelection to this high office. I am confident that you will \nbe able to give new momentum to the process of \nrenewal and reform of the United Nations. \n In particular, I wish to express my gratitude and \nappreciation to the outgoing President, Her Excellency \nSheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa, who has carried out \nwith determination and commitment an intense activity \naimed at implementing the reform programme \nundertaken by the Secretary-General. \n The Republic of San Marino is deeply concerned \nabout the latest events in Myanmar and expresses its \nsolidarity to the families of the victims. We hope that \nthe violence will soon be stopped and a dialogue \nimmediately re-established. \n The Republic of San Marino firmly believes in \nthe role and effectiveness of the entire structure of the \nUnited Nations, as well as in the process of progressive \nrenewal of its main bodies, which is now more than \never necessary, given time, evolution and the need to \nbest enhance the participation by the great family of \nthe Member States in the management of the \nOrganization. \n A small country like San Marino gains \nconsiderable strength and legitimacy from the major \ninternational organizations in its efforts to make its \nvoice heard regarding the great issues and main \nchallenges of our time. We are still determined to play \nthis role and will continue to fulfil the commitments \nundertaken, individually or in partnership with other \ncountries, to affirm those principles of solidarity and \nthe protection of rights, in which our history is rooted. \n In this regard, we believe that forms of \ncooperation among small countries can prove \nundoubtedly useful to major projects and deliver \npositive and effective messages of multilateral \ncooperation, in a spirit of mutual belonging to an \ninternational community, albeit still characterized by \nlarge gaps. \nIn this context, an example is the commitment \ntaken by San Marino, together with a group of small \nEuropean countries, in favour of a United Nations \nChildren\u2019s Fund project against HIV and destined for \nchildren living in Gabon. At the same time, the small \ncountries are intensifying their contacts within the \nUnited Nations to adopt further joint intervention \nprogrammes, mainly of a humanitarian character. \n The Republic of San Marino promotes and \nsupports, with the strength of its millenary history of \ncivilization, peace and respect for human rights, any \ncall advanced at a national or international level \nentailing a moral and civil commitment to the \naffirmation of specific ideological and cultural \nidentities, which, as is the case for San Marino, are \nbased on the principles of peaceful coexistence and \nrespect for others. \n It is in this spirit that my country believes in and \nactively commits itself to the promotion of \nintercultural and interreligious dialogue, as a \nfundamental instrument to prevent tensions and \nconflicts arising from intolerance and to promote peace \nbased on the principles of respect for fundamental \nhuman rights, justice and international cooperation. \n During its six-month chairmanship of the \nCommittee of Ministers of the Council of Europe, \nwhich ended last May, the Republic of San Marino \nbased its activity on the promotion of a culture of \ntolerance and mutual understanding by organizing \nhigh-level meetings and debates aimed at fostering \ndialogue among cultures and religions. In this context, \nthe conference organized last April in San Marino on \nthe religious dimension of intercultural dialogue in \nEurope, a priority issue of the San Marino \nchairmanship, met with great success. This conference \nwas attended by the representatives of the Council of \nEurope member countries, religious leaders belonging \nto the three major European monotheistic religions and \nexperts from civil society. At the end of its work, the \nconference adopted a final document, which testifies to \nthe wide range of this debate and marks a significant \nmoment in the process undertaken by the Council of \nEurope to promote, stimulate and develop intercultural \ndialogue in Europe, with particular reference to its \nreligious dimension. \n Among the initiatives taken in the last few \nmonths on this issue, it is worth mentioning the \nmeeting organized by the Permanent Mission of San \nMarino in New York on dialogue between religions, \nwith the presence and participation of the Secretary-\nGeneral, the President of the General Assembly and \nrepresentatives of more than 70 countries. \n In line with its history of peace, which makes it \nan ideal place for meeting and mediation, the Republic \nof San Marino will coordinate, starting from next year, \nthe future meetings of the Council of Europe on the \nreligious dimension of intercultural dialogue. It is in \nthis spirit that I will take part next week in the High-\nlevel Dialogue on Interreligious and Intercultural \nUnderstanding and Cooperation for Peace, organized \nby the presidency of the General Assembly. \n My country welcomes the adoption of this \ninitiative, which further stresses the need for us to join \nour efforts in support of dialogue among cultures and \nreligions, as an instrument to strengthen the climate of \nconfidence indispensable to promote peace, prevent \nconflicts and combat the threat of discrimination, \nracism, violence and terrorism. \n The Republic of San Marino is particularly \nsensitive to the issue of climate change, in the \nconviction that addressing this problem is an \nimperative for each member of the international \ncommunity, called upon to take action and share \ncommon strategies to prevent and face situations of \ndegradation and extreme emergency, which are \nbecoming increasingly evident and require joint actions \nthat can no longer be postponed. We are witnessing \nalarming phenomena that are deteriorating every \nelement of the environment, mainly due to human \nactivities. It is therefore necessary to develop \nalternative strategies, which can protect the climate \nfrom the increasingly serious threat posed to the entire \necosystem. \n The San Marino Government has expressed its \nstrong determination to progressively accede to the \nmajor international instruments, adopted in the \nframework of the United Nations, on environmental \nprotection and gas emissions, from the Vienna \nConvention and Montreal Protocol thereto, to the \nKyoto Protocol, in the awareness that the consequences \nof climate change are a serious obstacle to the \nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals. At \na domestic level, San Marino is preparing legislation \npromoting new technologies based on renewable \nenergy sources that will substantially modify the \nenergetic and environmental habits of the entire \ncountry. \n Just a few days ago, the Secretary-General \norganized a high-level event on climate change, which \ngave further momentum to the activity of our \nGovernments. \n It is worth reiterating that we take a strong stance \nagainst the death penalty on the basis of political and \nmoral principles. Indeed, the death penalty denies the \nright to life, and we deem it a groundless deterrent, as \ndo an increasing number of countries, which are \nprogressively abolishing it from their legal systems. \nThe Republic of San Marino expresses its satisfaction \nat the steps taken in this direction at a multilateral level \nand supports the new interregional initiative. We are \nconvinced that by promoting first of all a moratorium, \neach and every country can gradually achieve a \nmoderate attitude and eventually reach the decision to \nabolish the death penalty. \n San Marino fully shares the commitment \nundertaken on a global scale to achieve the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals and is ready to offer its own \ncontribution and its partnership to eradicate endemic \nproblems, by fully recognizing the fundamental rights \nof the most vulnerable groups of society, such as the \nelderly, women, children and disabled people. \n In this regard, I would like to underline in \nparticular the value of the action carried out by the \nUnited Nations in favour of social policies addressed to \npersons with disabilities, which has led to the adoption \nof the United Nations Convention on the Rights of \nPersons with Disabilities and its Optional Protocol. In \nthis context, the Republic of San Marino was one of \nthe first States to subscribe to these instruments. \n To achieve these objectives, which were also \namong the main issues included in the programme of \nthe recent chairmanship of the Committee of Ministers \nof the Council of Europe, my country has launched \nsome awareness raising and effective intervention \ncampaigns, such as the campaign on violence against \nwomen and in favour of children\u2019s rights. \n I wish to refer in particular to the protection of \nchildren\u2019s rights, to which my country pays special \nattention, prompted by the conviction that only the \nmobilization of Governments and societies can save \nchildren all over the world from today\u2019s sufferings and \nfrom enduring conditions of underdevelopment and \npoverty. My country has promoted legislative measures \nand solidarity initiatives with the precious contribution \nof institutions and civil society, and it commits itself at \na political, moral and social level to providing any \npossible instrument of protection and guarantee in \nfavour of minors. \n It is in this spirit and in full agreement with the \nprinciples contained in the detailed study on violence \nagainst children, drafted by United Nations expert \nPaulo Sergio Pinheiro, that the Republic of San Marino \nwill soon sign the Convention on the Protection of \nChildren against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual \nAbuse, adopted by the Council of Europe and aimed at \ninvolving the States in the drafting and implementation \nof an international plan to prevent and counter these \nphenomena. \n San Marino is fully aware of the need for the \nUnited Nations to maintain and strengthen its own \nstructure by revitalizing the main bodies, to attain \nimproved efficiency and progressive adjustment to a \nbroader multilateral context. \n In the light of the above and well aware of its \nstatus as a small country, San Marino is however \nintensifying its activities within the major international \norganizations. It has responsibly taken on the task of \nfacilitator assigned to it and to Senegal by the \nPresident of the sixty-first session of the General \nAssembly in the revitalization process of this organ. \n This task, performed by the San Marino \nPermanent Mission in New York, attributes to this tiny \nState a delicate and important role at an international \nlevel, which certainly represents a significant \nrecognition of the work done since 1992 to the present \nand of the commitment with which the Republic \nparticipates in the life of the international community, \nwith its renewed efforts to enhance dialogue and \ncooperation. \n The objective of revitalizing the General \nAssembly is a priority in the reform and modernization \nprocess of the main bodies of the United Nations, since \nthe General Assembly is the main representative and \ndecision-making body of the Organization, where all \nStates are permanent members and can and must play \nan important role by virtue of the principles of \ndemocracy and equal representation enshrined in this \nOrganization. \n The Republic of San Marino believes it necessary \nto strengthen the role of the General Assembly by \nenabling it to act efficiently and to cooperate with \nother statutory bodies in a more coordinated manner. In \nthis regard, San Marino expresses the hope that, in \norder to fully support the activities of this body, which \nis responsible for the whole process of standardization \nand codification of international law, the international \ncommunity will commit itself to increasingly receiving \nand implementing its resolutions. \n At the same time, it reiterates the need to reach \nthe broadest possible political agreement on the reform \nof the Security Council. This agreement should be the \nresult of a concerted and open vision in view of any \nadjustments that may be required in the years to come. \nFor many years, San Marino has constantly paid great \nattention to this issue of topical interest, because of its \nstrategic and structural implications. In this regard, I \nbelieve that today the presidency of the General \nAssembly deserves our unanimous gratitude for its \nreport, which represents an excellent basis to continue \nto consider this item on the agenda of the sixty-second \nsession. \n On behalf of a State, the Republic of San Marino, \nthat has always based its peaceful coexistence with \nother States and the spirit of its profound national and \ninternational solidarity on aspirations for international \npeace and security, I would like to express my \ncomplete confidence in the long-term effectiveness of \nthe United Nations system. Each and every State must \ntry to make a political and ideological contribution \nthrough concrete proposals to that system, on which \nevery State continues to place high expectations \nbecause of the impact of its activities at a national and \ninternational level. \n Allow me to conclude my statement by offering a \nbrief reflection, by virtue of the fact that I come from a \ncountry without any macroeconomic or military \ninterests, or any interests regarding the political \nbalance among the great Powers. I believe that the \nspace and attention we all devote to the international \ncommitment and contribution made by every State, \neven the smallest, can be a positive investment in the \nfuture of the United Nations, a future characterized by \nincreased understanding, closer cooperation and the \npromotion of dialogue and mutual respect, upon which \nthe foundations of this Organization rest. \n This renewed momentum will therefore provide \nlarge countries with the opportunity to demonstrate \ntheir full respect for international justice and will show \nsmall countries how useful their activities are in the \ncommunity of nations   activities that translate into \ncontinuous efforts aimed at achieving peace, mutual \nunderstanding and better living conditions for all \npeoples. \n With those hopes in mind, I express to you, Sir, \nmy most sincere wishes for a successful presidency of \nthis greatest of world assemblies, and I assure you that \nyou can fully rely on our support throughout the sixty-\nsecond session. \n"

        "file_text": "Allow me to join previous speakers from this rostrum \nin sincerely congratulating Mr. Kerim on his election to \nthe presidency of the General Assembly.  \n I also pay sincere tribute to Secretary-General \nBan Ki-moon for his tireless and laudable efforts to \ndefend and promote the purposes and principles of the \nOrganization\u2019s Charter. His visit to our country shortly \nafter he took office reassured us of his commitment \nand that of the United Nations to the Congolese people \nin its quest for peace, freedom and development. \n The sixty-second session of the General \nAssembly is taking place in an international context \nmarked by persistent violence throughout the world. \nThe United Nations task is harder than ever; by the \nsame token, it is more noble and inspiring than ever.  \n For the Democratic Republic of the Congo, this \nsession is unlike previous sessions. It marks our rebirth \nas a State based on law. It also marks our return to \ninternational affairs as a credible actor and partner. \nToday more than in the past, my country is aware of \nthe evils of war and of poor governance, as well as of a \npromising future of stable institutions, legitimate \nauthorities and peaceful coexistence among peoples. \nMy country is thus aware of the irreplaceable value of \nthe United Nations. We are an example of the \nOrganization\u2019s successful work.  \n I should like to pay tribute to our bilateral and \nmultilateral partners, and in particular to the United \nNations, for their invaluable assistance. Having \nreceived so much, we believe that it is now our turn to \ncontribute to peacekeeping operations. We look \nforward to playing an increasingly important role; in \nthe meantime, we have made the modest contribution \nof civilian police officers now deployed in two \nMember States. \n The path to the irreversible end of the multitude \nof crises that have beset my country for so many years \nremains strewn with obstacles. From the security \nperspective, we still need to finalize the process of \ndisarmament, demobilization and reintegration, \ncomplete the creation of a national republican police \nforce and army, and operationalize a credible justice \nsystem. Attaining that three-fold goal is an absolute \npriority for us.  \n Moreover, while stressing the political and \ndiplomatic approach, we must do all we can, resolutely \nand with a heightened sense of urgency, to resolve the \nremaining problems of insecurity in North Kivu. \nNothing can reasonably justify a situation in which \nCongolese continue to be the daily targets of every \nmanner of violence and abuse from national and \nforeign armed groups, and in which masses of our \npeople are displaced by war. Peace and security must \nrapidly and at all costs be restored to that part of our \nterritory, and they will be. \n With regard to foreign armed groups, United \nNations support is crucial to their voluntary or, if need \nbe, forced disarmament, repatriation and reintegration.  \n Despite such difficulties, we have in less than \nfive years successfully met the challenge of organizing \ndemocratic elections, establishing legitimate \ninstitutions, and relaunching economic growth. Our \ncurrent priority is reconstruction and development with \nthe aim of rolling back poverty, injustice and social \ninequalities. It is an immense task; if we are to meet it, \nthe resolve of our people and its aspirations to a great \nfuture will be critical, though not sufficient. The \nunflagging and unreserved involvement of all our \ndiverse partners remains indispensable.  \n Notwithstanding certain deficiencies, the United \nNations remains the conscious of humankind. Its \npresent and future role must be seen in the context of \nthe world\u2019s evolution and ever-changing challenges. \nThe future will be a time of increased competition \namong nations, particularly in the areas of trade, \nfinance and research, as well as of the universal \nenjoyment of clean air, drinking water and natural \nresources   vital commodities that the ever-growing \npopulation and economies of the world are making \nincreasingly precious and scarce.  \n In the face of those challenges and of the ongoing \nthreats to international peace and security, the United \nNations credibility will depend on its ability to ensure \nthat all Member States without exception implement its \ndecisions and that commitments they have freely \nentered into are effectively honoured.  \n In that respect, turning to the Middle East, the \ncredibility of our Organization will always be in \nquestion so long as the Security Council fails to do all \nin its power to ensure, pursuant to the provisions of our \nCharter and the relevant resolutions, the effective \nestablishment of two States, living side by side in \npeace and security.  \n On another subject, climate change is an \nundeniable reality today, an eloquent instance of the \nconstantly changing face of collective security. Its \neffects, unfortunately, will be more harmful in the \ndeveloping countries, particularly and unfairly in \nAfrica. Africa contributes the least to greenhouse gas \nemissions and does not have the resources to deal with \ntheir terrible consequences.  \n Making this point is a stark reminder of the need \nfor a responsible, equitable and unified approach to the \nproblems of sustainable development. I therefore \nwelcome the Secretary-General\u2019s organization on \n24 September of the high-level meeting on climate \nchange. The meeting was an opportunity for us to \ndevote to that crucial subject the attention it deserves \nand to sensitize ourselves to the consequences of the \npatterns of consumption that expose our world to the \nthreat of an irreversible disaster.  \n The Democratic Republic of the Congo is the \nnatural habitat of unparalleled biological diversity. Its \nprimeval forests make Central Africa the second lung \nof the world. We therefore undertake to participate in \nthe design and implementation of an effective strategy \nto preserve optimum conditions of life on Earth. In the \ninterests of humankind, we are prepared to make the \nsacrifices required by collective responsibility. In \nreturn, we call for fair compensation to ensure that we \ndo not jeopardize our own development. \n In the face of changes on the world scene, our \nOrganization must adjust and espouse an architecture \nthat, while preserving universal values, makes it fit to \nmeet increasingly diverse and growing challenges. \nDemocracy, which today is universally recognized as \nthe best form of Government, should not only permeate \nour collective action in international affairs, but should \nalso be reflected within our Organization. \n Accordingly, the Democratic Republic of the \nCongo welcomes the process of reforming the United \nNations system to create greater coherence and \neffectiveness of action. We wish to stress that increased \nrepresentation within the Security Council is a \ndemocratic requirement necessary to the harmonious \nfunctioning of the United Nations. The continent of \nAfrica must be represented on a permanent basis within \nthat important organ.  \n We also draw the Assembly\u2019s attention to the fact \nthat Security Council reform must not eclipse the need \nto revisit other bodies of this Organization. Their \nworking methods should be as efficient as possible and \ntheir future interaction better defined. As to the \nGeneral Assembly, its authority must be further \nreinforced so as to enable its President to play a \npre-eminent role in the search for solutions to \ninternational problems. \n With regard to the new threats and challenges \nlooming on the horizon, I have recalled the respective \ncommitments made by Member States under the United \nNations Charter, and I have reaffirmed the commitment \nof the Democratic Republic of the Congo to that \nfounding text of our Organization. I have also drawn \nthe Assembly\u2019s attention to the various scourges that \ncharacterize the international context and to the threats \nrelating to climate change. I have thereby stressed the \nneed for us to combine our efforts if we wish to enable \nour peoples to live in a world that enjoys the best \npossible living conditions, social progress and \ninternational peace and security.  \n Our political resolve to eradicate those scourges \nand our decisive, concerted action to do so will be the \nproof of how genuine our commitment really is to \nimproving the state of the world. That is the only way \nto bolster the confidence of our peoples in our \nOrganization. It is the only way, and nothing less will \ndo, to safeguard the legitimacy of the United Nations \nand to consolidate the effectiveness of its action. Let us \nmeet that challenge together. \n"

        "file_text": "It is with a profound sense of anticipation \nthat I welcome Mr. Kerim\u2019s assumption of the \npresidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-second \nsession. In accepting the presidency, he succinctly \noutlined an exciting raison d\u2019\u00eatre for a modern, active \nand engaged United Nations, namely, a focus on \nmultilateral cooperation to combat the challenges of \nglobalization, climate change, terrorism, immigration \nand sustainable development. I have every confidence \nthat, under his enlightened presidency, the General \nAssembly will fashion positive, tangible and creative \nsolutions to those global challenges. \n Our recent history has taught us that triumphalist, \nimperialist unilateralism is a consistent cause, but an \ninfrequent solution, to the problems confronting \ntoday\u2019s world. But it is at this moment, as the \nphilosophy of unilateralist misadventure is in its death \nthroes, that a modern, multilateral United Nations must \nseize the day, fill the vacuum and live up to the noble \nand immutable principles of its Charter. That modern \nand multilateral United Nations, under Mr. Kerim\u2019s \npresidency, should never sacrifice principle for an \nignoble practicality, but should instead be suffused \nwith a fairness that views the world through the eyes \nnot of imperial tsars, indifferent diplomats or apathetic \nagencies   to whom suffering is but a television event \neasily erased with the flick of a remote-control \nbutton   but through the eyes of the vast majority of \nthe world\u2019s citizens, who struggle daily for survival, \nwho dodge bullets in their backyards, who coax a \nmeagre living from parched and exhausted soils and \nwho have been globalized to the brink of extinction. It \nis not idealistic or naive to assert that engaged, fair and \ngenuinely concerned States working together can solve \nthe seemingly intractable problems besetting our \nimperfect planet. Our problems are largely man-made; \nso too are the solutions. \nThe recent focus by the United Nations on the \nissue of climate change and global warming is a \nwelcome development. It is the prayer of humankind \nthat this belated momentum has not come too late to \nreverse the damage already inflicted on our planet. \nAfter all, we are short-term caretakers of the Earth, and \nit is our sacred duty to preserve it for future \ngenerations. This is a great cause of our time, and we \nmust not be timid or doubtful in the face of any great \ncause. \n I would like to remind the General Assembly that, \n15 years ago, the 1992 United Nations Framework \nConvention on Climate Change recognized that global \nwarming would have a special impact on small States, \ncountries with low-lying coastal areas and countries \nwith areas prone to natural disasters. In Saint Vincent \nand the Grenadines, for example, the overwhelming \nmajority of our hard-won infrastructural developments, \nby way of geographic necessity, lie mere inches above \nsea level and perilously close to the coastline. Through \nabsolutely no fault of our own, the physical \nmanifestations of our emerging post-colonial State can \nbe obliterated by inexorably rising sea levels.  \n The Caribbean\u2019s vital banana industry, already \nbuffeted by the winds of iniquitous globalization, has \nbeen repeatedly devastated in recent years by \nincreasingly intense hurricanes, which have placed a \nhitherto dominant economic sector on veritable life \nsupport. In any event, the environmental damage \ncaused in producing quality bananas for the European \nCommunity over the recent decades is ignored by those \nwhose consumerist demands engender further \nenvironmental damage. \n The solutions to the problem of climate change \nare multifaceted, but an indispensable component must \nbe the adoption by the States parties to the United \nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change of \nthe climate change Adaptation Fund for \nenvironmentally challenged African, Asian, Caribbean, \nLatin American and Pacific States. The Fund would put \nflesh on the skeletal commitments of the Convention \non Climate Change, which compelled developed \ncountries to provide additional financial resources to \nassist developing countries that are particularly \nvulnerable to the adverse effects of global warming. \nThe Fund should be a source both of disaster relief and \nof the technological and infrastructural support needed \nto adapt to climate change.  \n The developed States Members of the United \nNations can no longer afford to view the increasingly \nfrequent and intense natural disasters as individual \nevents, capable of narrow prescriptive solutions and \nsubject to the vagaries of donor fatigue. They must live \nup to their obligations, both legal and moral, to assist \nthe developing world in dealing with challenges that \nwere born in the smoke-belching factories and \ncar-clogged highways of the polluters. \n The quest for energy self-sufficiency and \nenvironmentally friendly energy consumption has led \nto a rush towards the production of ethanol in some \ncountries. This, however, requires careful thought and \nsensible implementation. For example, the use of corn \nto produce ethanol is driving up the price worldwide of \ngrain, beef, chicken and milk. The poor will suffer \nunless a prudently balanced approach is adopted. The \nUnited Nations has a vital role to play in that regard. \n As a proud citizen of the Republic of Macedonia, \nthe President is all too familiar with the terrors \nwrought by wars born of ethnic conflict. It is my \nearnest prayer that his personal experience will lend \nurgency to what has been the seemingly heartless \nneglect on the part of the United Nations, in practical \nterms, of the genocidal campaign being waged in \nDarfur. While recent developments   including the \nSecurity Council resolution 1769 (2007), authorizing \nthe establishment of the African Union-United Nations \nHybrid Operation in Darfur, and the recent \nappointments of Rodolphe Adada as the Joint African \nUnion-United Nations Special Representative for \nDarfur and General Martin Luther Agwai as Force \nCommander   are somewhat encouraging, let us not \ndelude ourselves: the force on the ground is still \ninsufficient, its mandate is ambiguous and its emerging \npresence is years too late. For too long we have looked \nthe other way. We in the United Nations have caused \nthe world to wonder about the relative worth of a \nSudanese or Rwandan life versus an Israeli, Chinese, \nAmerican or European life. What is happening in \nDarfur is genocide. Let us call it what it is. The United \nNations must remain committed to alleviating the \nsuffering of the men, women and children of Darfur. \n In the same vein, the Government and people of \nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines stand unequivocally \nwith the people of Myanmar in their current struggle \nfor democracy and life without tyranny. \n The drama of war, the fight against global \nterrorism, insecurity and poverty, the struggle for \nreparation for the descendants of African slaves in the \nNew World and the insidious impacts of climate \nchange must continue to hold the collective attention of \nthe General Assembly. But there are other eminently \navoidable ills afflicting the developing world that also \ndemand our focus. The Caribbean faces the worst \nepidemic of chronic non-communicable disease in the \nAmericas. In 2004, the six leading causes of death in \nthe Caribbean were heart disease, cancer, diabetes, \nstroke, injuries and hypertensive disease   each of \nwhich claimed more lives in the region than \nHIV/AIDS. \n That looming health crisis, although largely self-\ninflicted, has an obvious global component. \nGlobalization has spawned a creeping cultural \nhegemony and homogeneity with a distinct mass-\nconsumption bias. Our home-grown Caribbean culture \nand our Caribbean civilization are being challenged \nand undermined by a shallow consumer ethic driven by \nmultinational corporations whose sole interest is to \ncreate a standardized population of global purchasers. \nThe explosion in media and information technology, \nfor all its obvious benefits, has been an all-too-willing \nhandmaiden to that cultural invasion. The \nhomogenized, vapid and consumerist culture of the \nmultinationals\u2019 empire is exported worldwide, beamed \ndirectly to our computers, televisions, newspapers and \ncinema screens. It is devoid of context, yet rich in \nsubtext. Its message, in a nutshell, is simple: our \nculture, our civilization, is better than yours. It is a \nsubliminal message that too many of our people have \nunfortunately been accepting at a faster rate than the \nability of our health care systems to adapt. Colonialist, \nimperialist, mindless and homogenizing globalization \nhas wrought havoc. Its deleterious contemporary \nmanifestations must be resolutely resisted.  \n The acceptance of a core of universal human \nvalues does not mean a submission to the consumerism \nof any empire. A quest by some to establish a global \nhegemony in everything will never be able to erase or \nsubjugate the legitimacy of the particularity of \ncivilizations, including our Caribbean civilization. In \nthat context, the call for an alliance of civilizations has \nour support. It is likely to be more uplifting and \nenduring than a quest for dominance by one over the \nother. \n The erosion of trade preferences at the \nmultilateral level has brought with it new challenges to \nthe small and vulnerable economies of the Caribbean, \nrequiring Governments to engage in structural \nadjustments and fiscal calisthenics to keep our \neconomies afloat. At the same time, the development \ndeliverables that the Doha Round promised to our \ncountries   which, like the Biblical manna, are \nurgently needed for our sustenance   have yet to \nmaterialize, owing to the floundering negotiations of \nthat Round. Let us recall that the first and last of the \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) speak, \nrespectively, to the eradication of poverty and to global \npartnership for development. But for small and \nvulnerable economies the attainment of those two goals \nwill be significantly compromised if the multilateral \ntrade rules and provisions are not sufficiently \naccommodating to the special needs of countries like \nours. \n Special and differential treatment for developing \ncountries is vital to offset the potential losses that are \noccasioned by globalization and the liberalization of \nmarkets. That is why aid-for-trade and a mobilization \nof resources must be on the agenda of multilateral \norganizations, to be used as an instrument for \neconomic growth and capacity-building in developing \ncountries. The recent launch of the MDG call to action \nby British Prime Minister Gordon Brown is an \ninitiative that my Government supports, and it may \nwell act as a much-needed spur to get us back on track \nto achieving the MDGs by the target date of 2015. \n Saint Vincent and the Grenadines yet again pleads \nwith the United Nations to permit Taiwan to be \naccorded its rightful admission to the United Nations \nand its specialized agencies. Taiwan, a democratic and \nprogressive country of 23 million people, remains a \nlegitimate and vibrant political expression of the \nancient and magnificent Chinese civilization. There is \nno adequate justification for the continued exclusion of \nTaiwan from participation in the numerous global \nexchanges in the United Nations and other \ninternational bodies. We urge Secretary-General Ban \nKi-moon to accept and deal with Taiwan\u2019s membership \napplication in accordance with the Charter. Taiwan \npossesses all the attributes and qualifications for \nmembership of the United Nations. Let it therefore be \ndone. Furthermore, the United Nations must play its \nrole in reducing tensions across the Taiwan Strait.  \nAggressive conduct must be restrained in a context \nwhere Taiwan is committed to peace and a \ncomprehensive political dialogue. \n I shall conclude as the Assembly President began, \nby urging swift and effective multilateral action to \ntackle the challenges of the modern world. As the \nCuban poet and national hero Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed once said, \u201cIt \nis a sin not to do what one is capable of doing\u201d. By that \nmeasure, the sins of omission and commission of the \nUnited Nations are manifold and manifest, despite its \nsuccesses. Our collective multilateral and principled \npenance must be measured even more by our actions \nfrom this day onward. We must therefore now act \ntogether on each of the world\u2019s enduring challenges. \nEach nation and each person has a vital role to play. An \narrogance born of triumphalism that seeks to exclude \nso many who look askance at an imperial agenda must \ncease. The master poet from Martinique, Aime Cesaire, \naddresses this issue well in his famous Cahier d\u2019un \nretour au pays natal:  \n No race has a monopoly on beauty, on \nintelligence, on strength ... There is room for \neveryone at the convocation of conquests ... We \nknow now that the sun turns around our Earth, \nlighting the parcel designated by our will alone ... \n[and that] every star falls from sky to Earth at our \nomnipotent command. \n"

        "file_text": "Allow me to congratulate \nMr. Kerim on his election to preside over this \nAssembly. We are confident that through his \nstewardship, issues on the agenda of the sixty-second \nsession will be dealt with in a balanced manner and to \nthe satisfaction of all. Allow me also to pay tribute to \nhis predecessor, Ms. Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa, who \nsteered the work of the sixty-first session in a very \ncompetent and impartial manner. Her ability to identify \nthe crucial issues facing the world today will be \nremembered as the hallmark of her presidency. \n We extend our hearty welcome to the new \nSecretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, who has taken \nup this challenging job requiring dynamism in \nconfronting the global challenges of the twenty-first \ncentury. Balancing global interests and steering the \nUnited Nations in a direction that gives hope to the \nmultitudes of the poor, the sick, the hungry and the \nmarginalized is indeed a mammoth task. We would like \nto assure him that Zimbabwe will continue to support \nan open, transparent and all-inclusive multilateral \napproach in dealing with those global challenges. \n Climate change is one of the most pressing global \nissues of our time. Its negative impact is greatest in \ndeveloping countries, particularly those on the African \ncontinent. We believe that, if the international \ncommunity is going to seriously address the challenges \nof climate change, then we need to get our priorities \nright. In Zimbabwe, the effects of climate change have \nbecome more evident in the past decade as we have \nwitnessed, alongside our neighbours, increased and \nrecurrent droughts, as well as occasional floods, \nleading to enormous humanitarian challenges. \n We are for a United Nations that recognizes the \nequality of sovereign nations and peoples, whether big \nor small. We are averse to a body in which the \neconomically and militarily powerful behave like \nbullies, trampling on the rights of weak and smaller \nStates, as sadly happened in Iraq. In the light of those \ninauspicious developments, this Organization must \nsurely examine the essence of its authority and the \nextent of its power when challenged in this manner. \n Such challenges to the authority of the United \nNations and its Charter underpin our repeated call for \nthe revitalization of the General Assembly, itself the \nmost representative organ of the United Nations. The \nGeneral Assembly should be more active in all areas, \nincluding those of peace and security. The \nencroachment of some United Nations organs upon the \nwork of the General Assembly is of great concern to \nus. Thus, any process of revitalizing or strengthening \nthe General Assembly should necessarily avoid eroding \nthe principle of the accountability of all principal and \nsubsidiary organs to the General Assembly. \n Once again, we reiterate our position that the \nSecurity Council as presently constituted is not \ndemocratic. In its present configuration, the Council \nhas shown that it is not in a position to protect the \nweaker States, who find themselves at loggerheads \nwith a marauding super-Power. Most importantly, \njustice demands that any Security Council reform \nshould redress the fact that Africa is the only continent \nwithout a permanent seat and veto power in the \nSecurity Council. Africa's demands are known and \nenunciated in the Ezulwini Consensus. \n We further call for the United Nations system to \nrefrain from interfering in matters that are clearly the \ndomain of Member States and are not a threat to \ninternational peace and security. Development at \ncountry level should continue to be country-led and not \nbe subject to the whims and caprices of powerful donor \nStates. \n Zimbabwe won its independence on 18 April \n1980 after a protracted war against British colonial \nimperialism that denied its people human rights and \ndemocracy. That colonial system which suppressed and \noppressed us enjoyed the support of many countries of \nthe West who were signatories to the United Nations \nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights. Even after \n1945, it would appear that the Berlin Conference of \n1884, through which Africa was parcelled out to \ncolonial European powers, has remained stronger than \nthe Universal Declaration of Human Rights. It is, \ntherefore, clear that for the West, vested economic \ninterests and racial and ethnocentric considerations \nhave proved stronger than Western adherence to \nprinciples of the Universal Declaration of Human \nRights. \n The West still negates our sovereignties by \ncontrolling our resources, in the process making us \nmere chattels in our own lands, mere minders of the \nWest\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s transnational interests. In my own country and \nother sister States in southern Africa, the most visible \nform of this colonial control has been control over land \ndespoiled from us at the onset of British colonialism. \nThat control largely persists, although it stands firmly \nchallenged in Zimbabwe, thereby triggering the current \nstand-off between us and Britain, which is supported \nby her cousin States, most notably the United States \nand Australia. Mr. Bush, Mr. Blair and now  \nMr. Brown's sense of human rights precludes our \npeople's right to their God-given resources, which \nmust, in our view, be controlled by our people. I am \ntermed dictator - and yesterday the General Assembly \nheard Mr. Bush in this Hall calling my Government a \ndemagogic regime \u00e2\u20ac\u201d because I have rejected this \nsupremacist view and frustrated the neo-colonialists in \ntheir endeavours to keep us as slaves in our own \ncountry. \n Clearly, the history of the struggle for our own \nnational and people's rights is unknown to the \nPresident of the United States of America. He thinks \nthe Declaration of Human Rights started with his terms \nin office. He thinks he can introduce to us, who bore \nthe brunt of the struggle for the freedoms of our \npeoples, the virtues of the Universal Declaration of \nHuman Rights. What rank hypocrisy! I spent  \n11 precious years of my life in the jail of a white \nEnglishman whose freedom and well being I assured \nand protected from the first day of Zimbabwe's \nindependence, and that was Ian Smith. I lost a further \n15 years fighting white injustice in my country. Ian \nSmith was responsible for the deaths of well over \n50,000 of my people. I bear scars of his tyranny, which \nBritain and America condoned. I meet his victims \nevery day. Yet, he walks freely today. He farms freely; \nhe has a farm of over 500 hectares. He talks freely, \nassociates freely under our black Government. We \ntaught him democracy. We gave him back his \nhumanity. He would have faced a different fate here \nand in Europe, if the 50,000 he killed had been \nEuropeans. Africa has not called for a Nuremberg trial \nagainst the white world, which committed heinous \ncrimes against humanity. It has not hunted perpetrators \nof this genocide, many of whom live to this day; nor \nhas it received reparations from those who have \noffended against it. Instead, it is Africa that is in the \ndock. It is Mugabe, and not the British Prime Minister, \nwho is in the dock, facing trial from the same world \nthat persecuted us for centuries. \n Let Mr. Bush read history correctly. Let him \nrealize that, both personally and in his representative \ncapacity as the current President of the United States, \nhe stands for this \\\"civilization\\\"\u009d that occupied, \ncolonized, incarcerated and killed. He has much to \natone for and very little to lecture us about on the \nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights. His hands drip \nwith the innocent blood of many nationalities, and, \ntoday, with the blood of the Iraqis. But he still kills. He \nkills in Iraq. He kills in Afghanistan. And he is \nsupposed to be our teacher in human rights? \n He imprisons. He imprisons and tortures at \nGuantanamo. He imprisoned and tortured at Abu \nGhraib. He has secret torture chambers in Europe. Yes, \nhe imprisons even here in the United States, with his \njails today carrying more blacks than his universities \ncan ever enrol. He even suspends the provisions of the \nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights. Take \nGu\u00c3\u00a1ntanamo for example. At that concentration camp, \ninternational law does not apply. The national laws of \nthe people there do not apply. Laws of the United \nStates of America do not apply. Only Bush's law \napplies. Can the international community accept being \nlectured by this man on the provisions of the Universal \nDeclaration of Human Rights? Definitely not. \n The President returned to the Chair. \n We are alarmed that under his leadership basic \nrights of his own people and those of the rest of the \nworld have summarily been rolled back. America is \nprimarily responsible for rewriting core tenets of the \nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights. We all seem \nguilty for 9/11. Mr. Bush thinks he stands above all \nstructures of governance, whether national or \ninternational. At home, he apparently does not need the \nCongress. He defies it. Abroad, he does not need the \nUnited Nations; he does not need international law and \nopinion. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I will go to Iraq,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d he said, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153with or without \nthe United Nations\u00e2\u20ac\u009d \u00e2\u20ac\u201d that is, with or without \ninternational law, in defiance of it.  \n This forum did not sanction Blair\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and Bush\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \nmisadventures in Iraq. Did we say yes to it? Did we \nsay yes to the attack on Iraq? The two rode roughshod \nover the United Nations and international opinion. \nAlmighty Bush: perhaps some might regard him as \ntheir god. No, he is not my god. I have but one God. \nHe is in heaven \u00e2\u20ac\u201d pater noster, qui es in caelis. \nIndeed, he wants us to pray to him. We say no to him \nand encourage him to get out of Iraq. Indeed, he should \nmend his ways before he clambers up the pulpit to \ndeliver pieties of democracy. Is he qualified to speak of \ndemocracy? Is he qualified to speak of human rights \nwhen he is shedding blood every day? \n The British and the Americans have gone on a \nrelentless campaign of destabilizing and vilifying my \ncountry. They have sponsored surrogate forces to \nchallenge lawful authority in my country. They seek \nregime change. It is they who seek regime change, not \nmy people. But they think they are entitled to change \ngovernments, placing themselves in the role of the \nZimbabwean people in whose collective will \ndemocracy places the right to define and change \nregimes. And they want to talk of democracy when \nthey are behaving that way.  \n Let those sinister Governments be told here and \nnow that Zimbabwe will not allow a regime change \nauthored by outsiders. We do not interfere with their \nsystems in America and Britain, where they steal \nelections, as he did during his first election. We do not \ninterfere. Mr. Bush and Mr. Brown have no role to play \nin our national affairs. They are outsiders - and \nmischievous outsiders - and should therefore keep \nout. The colonial sun set a long time ago in Africa - \nin 1980 in the case of Zimbabwe. And hence, \nZimbabwe will never be a colony again - never, ever. \n We do not deserve sanctions. We are \nZimbabweans and we know how to deal with our own \nproblems. We have done so in the past, well before \nBush and Brown were known politically. We have our \nown regional and continental organizations and \ncommunities. In that vein, I wish to express my \ncountry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gratitude to President Thabo Mbeki of South \nAfrica who, on behalf of the Southern African \nDevelopment Community (SADC), successfully \nfacilitated the dialogue between my ruling party and \nthe opposition parties, which yielded the agreement \nthat has now resulted in the constitutional provisions \nbeing finally adopted the amendments to the \nconstitution, which both parties agreed to and which \npaved the way to the elections for which various \nparties are now campaigning. Consequently, we will be \nholding multiple democratic elections in March 2008. \nIndeed, we have always had timeous general and \npresidential elections since our independence. \n We want to be left alone. We will interact with \nthose in our region and those in organizations to which \nwe belong. \n In conclusion, let me stress once more that the \nstrength of the United Nations lies in its universality \nand its impartiality as it implements its mandate to \npromote peace and security, economic and social \ndevelopment, human rights and international law, as \noutlined in the Charter. Zimbabwe stands ready to play \nits part in all efforts and programmes aimed at \nachieving those noble goals. The Charter of the United \nNations is our Charter also in Africa and we uphold it. \nWrath unto him who defies the Charter. \n"

        "file_text": "Year after year the international community meets in \nNew York in September to debate the major issues of \nconcern to humankind. This traditional encounter is of \nspecial importance in that it enables us to grasp very \ndirectly and intensively, in all their complexity, the \nchallenges that confront us, but also to bolster our \ndetermination to search for common solutions. That is \nthe very essence of the effective multilateralism that, \nwith great conviction, my country, Luxembourg, has \nplaced at the heart of its international action. \n And what could be a stronger illustration of this \nshared perception of what is at stake globally and this \nresolve to seek viable solutions in the short, medium \nand long, even very long, term than the high-level \nevent organized at the beginning of the week at the \ninitiative of the Secretary-General devoted to the \nproblems of climate change? \n As already said on behalf of the European Union \nby the Prime Minister of Portugal \nwhose statement I fully support, it is essential that \nDecember's Bali negotiations on an effective and \nviable post-Kyoto regime get off to a successful start. \nThat is our most basic responsibility vis-a-vis present \nand future generations. For its part, as a member of the \nEuropean Union and a State party to the Kyoto \nProtocol, Luxembourg, which has already undertaken \nweighty individual commitments, is ready to engage \nwith great resolve in the quest for innovative and bold \nsolutions. \n In order to address successfully the problems of \nclimate change, we must tackle them in all their \ncomplexity. In this regard, it should be noted that in the \nabsence of concerted and energetic international action, \nthere is a great risk that countries and populations that \nhave contributed the least to the emergence of this \nphenomenon are likely to be the ones to bear the \nheaviest adverse consequences. \n This, as I see it, is a political problem and, I \nwould say, a moral problem   of the first order. More \nthan ever, the issue of development and hence of \nsustainable development both in the North and in the \nSouth must remain in the forefront of international \nattention. Important decisions have already been taken. \nHere, I would refer in particular to the decision taken \nby the European Union in 2005 under the Luxembourg \npresidency to attain the objective of 0.7 per cent of \ngross national income for official development \nassistance (ODA) by 2015. Faced with the risk of \nstagnation in ODA, we must redouble our efforts to \nmeet our commitments. \n A member of this all-too select Group\nwith ODA that in 2007 reached close to 0.9 per cent of \ngross national income, and looking forward to \nachieving the objective of 1 per cent that we have set \nfor ourselves   Luxembourg can only look forward to \nthe expansion of this club. \n The year that lies ahead is crucial from the \nstandpoint of development. There will be a need to \nundertake resolutely, and in a way that seeks a \nconvergence, the World Trade Organization trade \nnegotiations, the follow-up to Monterrey in the area of \nfinancing for development, and the implementation of \nthe Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness. Only if we \nadopt generous and courageous policies will we be able \nto build on these advances and reduce the delays that \nunfortunately persist, particularly in a number of \nsub-Saharan African countries, with regard to the \nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals. \n The convening in 2008 of a high-level meeting on \nmid-term implementation of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals would undoubtedly be a good \nopportunity to take stock and relaunch our efforts. Here \nI would also applaud the recent establishment at the \ninitiative of the Secretary-General of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals Africa Steering Group. I am \nconvinced that this will make a significant contribution \nin terms of coordination and intensification of efforts \nvis-\u00e0-vis a continent with which Luxembourg \nmaintains relations of intense and multifaceted \ncooperation. \n The problems associated with climate change and \nsustainable development bring me to another subject \nthat is dear to my heart and is at the core of the \ninternational activities of the Luxembourg Government: \nhumanitarian action. When it first discussed the \nquestion of climate change (see S/PV.5663), the \nSecurity Council highlighted the numerous complex \ninteractions that could exist among natural disasters, \nthe stepping up of violent conflicts within and among \nStates and humanitarian disasters in various parts of \nthe world. We must tackle these emergency situations \non the operational level, seeking to make our action as \nefficient and prompt as possible. But there is also a \nneed increasingly to place these emergency situations \nin their political, socio-economic and cultural context \nin order to try to mitigate their effects and, as far as \npossible, to prevent recurrence. \n It is from this standpoint that a new Luxembourg \nGovernment strategy in the area of humanitarian crisis \nmanagement has recently been presented. The strategy \nthat rests on three pillars: emergency relief; \nrehabilitation and reconstruction in the transitional \nphase; and prevention. \n On the basis of the United Nations finding that \none euro invested in prevention may make it possible \nto save eight euros in crisis response and resolution, \nnearly 5 per cent of the Luxembourg humanitarian \nbudget will henceforth be devoted to a proactive, \npreventive approach. \n The 2005 World Summit Outcome, which is more \nthan ever the road map for international action, \nstressed the fundamental finding according to which, \n\u201cdevelopment, peace and security and human rights are \ninterlinked and mutually reinforcing. For my part, I believe that this is a cardinal \nprinciple that should guide and inspire all action by the \nUnited Nations and its Member States from an overall \nstandpoint of coherence in addressing the great \nproblems of the time: conflicts in Africa   and I am \nthinking particularly of the situations with tragic \nhumanitarian consequences currently prevailing in the \nSudan, Somalia, the Democratic Republic of the \nCongo, and, to be sure, Zimbabwe; the Middle East, \nwhere it is important to support fully ongoing Israeli \nand Palestinian efforts and to progress ultimately \ntowards a negotiated solution of two States living side \nby side in peace and security, and also towards a \nlasting solution for the whole region; and Afghanistan, \nBurma/Myanmar and other hotbeds of violence and \ninstability. There is no denying that we must take into \naccount simultaneously the dimensions of peace and \nsecurity, human rights, States rights, the rule of law \nand socio-economic development. \n I would like now to speak of the courage of the \nBurmese monks and other citizens who for weeks have \nbeen peacefully expressing their aspiration to \ndemocracy and respect for human rights. I condemn \nmost energetically the violence of the Burmese security \nforces against these peaceful demonstrators and call the \nauthorities to put an end to it. \n The imperative that I mentioned a moment ago \ncan also be seen very clearly in the work of a new and \ninnovative organ, of which Luxembourg has been a \nmember since the beginning of the year: the \nPeacebuilding Commission. The integrated \npeacebuilding strategies for each of the countries \nconcerned should take into account all the factors \ninvolved in order once and for all to break the cycles of \nviolence and place those countries on a stable track \ntowards development. I would like also to mention in \nthis context the essential dimension of reconciliation \nand combating impunity and to applauding in \nparticular the activities of the various international \ncourts, in particular the International Criminal Court. \n The protection and promotion of human rights is \none of the key focuses of Luxembourg\u2019s foreign policy. \nI continue to place great hope in the new Human \nRights Council, which has just finished setting up its \ninstitutional structures, including, in particular, the \nuniversal periodic review mechanism, which is a \nsignificant innovation. \n Faithful to its convictions and commitments, my \ncountry fully associates itself with the initiatives \nannounced by a group of States from all parts of the \nworld aimed at making progress in the international \ndebate on the question of abolishing the death penalty. \n In this rapid overview of the international \nsituation in the area of peace and security, allow me to \nlinger for a moment on an important issue that is of \nsuch concern to both the United Nations and the \nEuropean Union, namely Kosovo. The last act of the \nYugoslav tragedy, an urgent solution for the Kosovo \nissue must be found. The Special Envoy of the \nSecretary-General, President Ahtisaari, has been \nworking energetically to establish, in keeping with the \nestablished guidelines, the basis of the future status of \nKosovo. The Troika of representatives from the \nEuropean Union, the United States and Russia is also \ncommitted to a final attempt to bring the two parties \ntogether. These efforts have been continued in recent \ndays in New York. As members know, the parties are \neven now meeting in this building; I have high hopes \nthat dialogue will ensue. The Troika has agreed to \nsubmit its report to the Secretary-General by \n10 December. I reiterate that the European Union is \nready to fully assume its responsibilities in the region, \nfor which a European future lies ahead. \n I turn my attention to another issue that is of \nconcern to international public opinion and whose \npotential impact on peace and security is very \nworrisome: the area of disarmament and nuclear \nnon-proliferation. A few days ago, I had the \nopportunity to state the views of the Luxembourg \nGovernment at the General Conference of the \nInternational Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna. Here at \nthe General Assembly I advocate once again for \ncontinued efforts in the area of nuclear disarmament \nand a strengthening of the non-proliferation regime, of \nwhich the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear \nWeapons is and should remain the keystone. \n I would also like to speak briefly about other \ntypes of arms with destabilizing effects or unacceptable \nconsequences for civilians; small arms and light \nweapons and sub-munitions. I hope that significant \nadvances may soon be made, on those two categories \nof weapons in particular. The Luxembourg Government \nfor its part intends to participate actively in this debate \nand is currently preparing a bill forbidding the \nmanufacture, storage, utilization and trade in weapons \nemploying sub-munitions. \n The quest for international disarmament and the \nstrengthening of international regimes on weapons of \nmass destruction consistently remain objectives of the \nLuxembourg Government, because of the serious \nconcern we feel as we observe certain current \ndevelopments with regard to respect for existing \ninternational norms, in particular with reference to the \nIranian issue. \n While the agreement that has just been concluded \nbetween the secretariat of the International Atomic \nEnergy Agency   specifically Mr. ElBaradei   and \nthe Islamic Republic of Iran goes in the right direction, \nwe note with concern that Iran has not yet taken the \nnecessary measures to bring itself into conformity with \nthe three relevant resolutions of the Security Council. I \nappeal to Iran finally to take that action and to suspend \nall activities linked to enrichment. \n On the set of issues that I have just mentioned, \nthe Charter has entrusted a central role to the Security \nCouncil. It is essential for the Council to adapt to the \npolitical realities of the beginning of the twenty-first \ncentury by enlarging its membership in the categories \nof permanent and non-permanent members, \nguaranteeing an appropriate place for the small States \nthat represent the vast majority of States Members of \nthe Organization. It is important also to modernize the \nCouncil\u2019s functioning for the sake of enhanced \neffectiveness and transparency, with broader \ninvolvement for the entire membership. On the basis of \nthe consensus decision that was adopted at the end of \nthe sixty-first session of the General Assembly (see \nA/61/PV.109), I venture to hope that significant \nprogress will be achieved in the area of Security \nCouncil reform in months to come. My country is \neager to make its contribution to the achievement of \nthe purposes of the Charter and to shoulder its share of \nresponsibility in international peace and security, and \nthus wishes to become   for the first time since it \nplaced its signature on the San Francisco Charter in \n1945   a non-permanent member of the Security \nCouncil for 2013 and 2014. \n Security Council reform is an important portion \nof the United Nations reform agenda outlined at the \n2005 Summit. If recourse to a multilateral machinery, \nwith the United Nations at its core, is to be credible, \nthen the tool made available to the international \ncommunity must be commensurate with the \ndevelopments of our time and capable of responding \nadequately to the expectations of efficiency and \neffectiveness harboured by States and peoples \nworldwide. \n The reform effort should be pursued and \nsupported with conviction by a revitalized General \nAssembly, exercising its prerogatives with energy and \ndiscernment and achieving its priority objectives. \nReform, and thus the modernization of multilateralism, \ncan succeed only if it rests on the common will of all \nMember States. \n That applies in particular to the field of system-\nwide coherence in operational activities. To overcome \nthe fragmentation that has developed over more than \n60 years of United Nations history, to restore to the \nsystem and its actors a more effective capacity for \naction, particularly at the level of the countries and \npopulations concerned, and to strengthen operational \ncoherence in the eight areas covered by the report of \nthe High-level Panel (A/61/583) are primary objectives \nfor the performance and thus the credibility of the \nUnited Nations system. They are also decisions that \nneed to be taken courageously and proactively in the \nappropriate forums. \n While the success of reform would be reflected in \na win-win-win situation for donor countries, recipient \ncountries and the United Nations as a whole, as \nMr. Ban Ki-moon has rightly said, the failure of reform \nwould be likely to marginalize the entire system over \nthe long term. The choice is before us; we must \nshoulder our political responsibilities. \n More than ever, effective multilateralism is a \ngreat hope of our populations aspiring to a more just, \nmore peaceful and more prosperous world, where the \ngreat ecological balance is preserved and where every \nman and every woman can live in dignity and in full \nenjoyment of his or her human rights. Let us not \ndisappoint that expectation.  \n And let us remember this very wise saying from \nthe Roman philosopher Seneca: It is not because it is \ndifficult that we do not dare to do it; it is because we \ndo not dare to do it that it is difficult. \n"

        "file_text": "Allow me at the outset \nto convey my warm congratulations to Mr. Srgjan \nKerim on his election to the presidency of the General \nAssembly at its sixty-second session. My delegation is \nconfident that with his immense wealth of experience, \nhe will steer the session very successfully. Zambia \nassures him of its total support during his tenure of \noffice. \n Let me, at this point, pay tribute to Mr. Kurt \nWaldheim, the fourth Secretary-General of the United \nNations, and later President of Austria, who died on  \n14 June 2007. To us, he was a great diplomat who \nmade Africa one of his priorities, especially at the \nheight of the liberation struggle in Southern Africa. \n May I take this opportunity to thank Her \nExcellency Sheikha Rashed Al Khalifa of Bahrain for \nhaving presided over the affairs of the sixty-first \nsession in an exemplary manner. Among her \naccomplishments was the carrying forward of the \nUnited Nations reforms called for at the 2005 World \nSummit. It was gratifying to have a lady preside over \nthe highest office of the General Assembly after almost \nthree decades of male dominance. I hope that this \norgan will not again take that long to have an excellent \nwoman as President. \n Let me now congratulate Mr. Ban Ki-moon of the \nRepublic of Korea on his election as the eighth \nSecretary-General of the United Nations. I am \nconfident that he will build upon the strong foundation \nthat was laid by his predecessor, Kofi Annan of Ghana, \nto whom I wish to pay tribute for the manner in which \nhe steered the Organization during his tenure in office. \nHe made Africa proud, and I wish him success in his \ncurrent and future endeavours. \n Our world today presents many challenges. These \ninclude abject poverty for the majority of the world\u2019s \ninhabitants, underdevelopment, conflict, human \ntrafficking, climate change, terrorism, violations of \nhuman rights, the HIV/AIDS pandemic and gender \ninequality. While some of these challenges have only \nrecently emerged, others have been with us from time \nimmemorial. These challenges cannot be entirely \nresolved within national boundaries or at the regional \nlevel. They can be resolved only at the multilateral \nlevel, with all the players carrying out their roles \ndiligently. For that reason, Zambia supports a strong \nand coherent United Nations. We agree with the \nrecommendation of the High-level Panel on United \nNations System-wide Coherence that the United \nNations urgently needs more coherence and synergy. \nThat will enable it to perform as one and to use its \nunique universality, neutrality and capacity to operate \nefficiently. \n Furthermore, Zambia supports the ongoing \nreforms of the United Nations. In particular, we \nwelcome the mandate given to the Economic and \nSocial Council to make it more effective in executing \nits duties, which include formulating policy \nrecommendations on international and social issues, as \nwell as coordinating activities of specialized agencies \nin the economic, social and related fields. In that \nregard, collaboration of the United Nations with the \ninternational financial institutions and the World Trade \nOrganization should be further enhanced; we welcome \nthe work going on in this area. \n This brings me to another issue: reform of the \nSecurity Council. This matter has remained unresolved \nfor more than a decade. United Nations reform cannot \nbe complete without meaningful reform of the Security \nCouncil. Any new proposals to reform that vital organ \nshould seriously consider Africa\u2019s call to have two \npermanent seats with full veto power. Africa is aware \nthat the veto is an undemocratic instrument and would \nprefer to do away with it altogether. However, as long \nas others insist on keeping the veto, Africa should have \nit as well. The status quo is unacceptable. It is my hope \nthat during Mr. Kerim\u2019s tenure of office, this aspect of \nthe reform process will be concluded successfully. \n The issue of climate change is very important to \nthe current and future inhabitants of our planet. It is \ntherefore fitting that one theme of this session is \nresponding to climate change. I commend the \nSecretary-General for organizing the 24 September \n2007 high-level event on this matter. Indeed, the \neffects of climate change are being felt mostly by the \ndeveloping countries. For instance, Southern Africa is \nexperiencing critical food shortages due to torrential \nrains in some areas and severe drought in other parts of \nthe region. \n The problem of climate change is a global issue \nrequiring global action within the multilateral context \nof the United Nations. As a signatory to the United \nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change \nand the Kyoto Protocol, Zambia has already taken \nseveral measures to implement those international \ninstruments. In that regard, we submitted our first \nnational communication report in 2004. We have also \ntaken deliberate steps to create public awareness about \nthe problem of climate change so that our people can \ndevise appropriate local interventions. \n Regarding measures aimed at adapting to climate \nchange, Zambia has just finished formulating its \nNational Adaptation Programme of Action. The \nprogramme will help us identify the most vulnerable \nsectors of our economy, as well as adaptation activities \nrequired to alleviate the adverse effects of climate \nchange. For this reason, we call upon the international \ncommunity to ensure that the Adaptation Fund under \nthe Climate Change Convention, which has taken \nrather long to establish, is made operational. \n While placing emphasis on adaptation, we also \npledge to reduce emissions from industrial and other \nsources. We call upon industrialized countries, which \nhave a history of producing these emissions, to take \nserious steps to reduce them. We believe that the \nsituation is now serious and that narrow national \ninterests in this matter must be discarded forthwith. \n As a developing country, Zambia needs assistance \nto enhance its capacity in key adaptive areas, such as \nscientific research, early warning and rapid response, \nto address the adverse effects of climate change. \nAccordingly, Zambia calls for the speedy development \nand transfer of appropriate technologies to help us cope \nwith the negative impacts of climate change, as well as \nto put us on a low-carbon path to economic growth. We \nalso call for a more comprehensive institutional \nframework for international environmental governance. \n In 2000, the developing world embraced the \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) as a \ncomprehensive strategy to move our countries out of \neconomic and social decline and better integrate us into \nthe global economy. Halfway through the \nimplementation period, many countries are far from \nattaining most of the Goals. That is so in spite of the \nimproved economic performance recorded by some \ndeveloping countries following recent debt relief \ninitiatives, coupled with sustained prudent economic \nmanagement. \n To illustrate the point, in Zambia the economy \ngrew by 6.2 per cent last year, and inflation declined to \na single digit level for the first time in 30 years. Those \neconomic gains, however, have not translated into a \nsignificant decline in the incidence of poverty, which \nstands at 68 per cent. Zambia\u2019s development efforts are \nfurther compromised by the HIV/AIDS pandemic and, \nnow, the adverse effects of climate change. \n With regard to the HIV/AIDS pandemic, my \nGovernment has declared it to be a national crisis, \nrequiring sustained mitigation and preventive \nmeasures. I would like to take this opportunity to thank \nall our cooperating partners for their support to Zambia \nin the fight against HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and \nmalaria. \n Despite these challenges, Zambia, for its part, has \nmade steady progress and is likely to meet most of the \nMDGs by 2015. The Goals most likely not to be \nattained by 2015 are: reducing by three quarters the \nmaternal mortality ratio, integrating the principles of \nsustainable development into the country\u2019s policies and \nprogrammes and reversing the loss of environmental \nresources. Our goal now is to translate the economic \nachievements into tangible improvements in the quality \nof life of the Zambian people. That goal is enshrined in \nZambia\u2019s Vision 2030, which is aimed at raising the \ncountry to middle-income status, significantly reducing \nhunger and poverty and fostering a competitive and \noutward-oriented economy. \n But that goal will remain elusive if our \ncooperating partners do not fulfil their commitments. \nIndeed, it is saddening to note that total official \ndevelopment assistance declined in real terms by 5.1 \nper cent between 2005 and 2006, and only five donor \ncountries have met or exceeded the 0.7 per cent target. \nI urge the cooperating partners to fulfil their \ncommitments. Furthermore, while Zambia welcomes \nthe discussions and progress made on aid effectiveness \nfollowing the Paris Declaration, we call for official \ndevelopment assistance to be delivered in a more \nefficient manner, in accordance with the Declaration. \n Aid cannot be effective unless corruption is \nuprooted. My Government has, therefore, declared war \nagainst that social vice. Accordingly, I take this \nopportunity to urge the international community to \ndesist from providing safe havens for leaders who \nplunder national resources. Such ill-gotten wealth \nshould be returned to the countries from where it was \nmisappropriated so that it can be used to fight poverty. \n Zambia condemns international terrorism in all \nits forms and manifestations. For this reason, we call \nupon members of the international community to \nrefrain from harbouring terrorists. Zambia, for its part, \nsupports the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear \nTerrorism. \n Through regional bodies, such as the Southern \nAfrican Development Community (SADC), developing \ncountries enhance their ability to cooperate and also \njointly negotiate for better access to developed \ncountries\u2019 markets. Consequently, during Zambia\u2019s \ncurrent chairmanship of SADC, we shall continue to \nconsolidate the formation of the SADC free trade area \nby 2008 as a prerequisite to the Regional Customs \nUnion. In addition, Zambia will, on behalf of SADC, \nseek funding to develop an adequate regional \ntransboundary infrastructure in support of  \nmuch-needed connectivity in areas such as water, \ntransport, energy, communications and information \ntechnology. \n Many regions, including Africa, have been \ndogged by conflict. This has adversely affected the \ncountries\u2019 potential to participate in the global \neconomic arena. In the quest for peace in our \nsubregion, SADC has launched a stand-by brigade, \nwhich will have the capacity for peace support \noperations. It is our hope that the international \ncommunity will render necessary support to the \nbrigade to enable it to fulfil its mandate. \n Better still, SADC and Zambia value the tenets of \ndemocracy, political stability and integrated economic \ndevelopment as the ultimate sound basis for peace and \nstability. SADC will, therefore, continue to promote \nthe conducting of free and fair elections in the region. \n Mr. Berdymukhammedov (Turkmenistan), Vice-\nPresident, took the Chair \n In conclusion, I wish to reaffirm, with regard to \nthe theme of this session, Zambia\u2019s commitment to \ncooperate with the international community in \naddressing the problem of climate change. It is my \nsincere hope that all of us will play our full part, \naccording to our abilities to deal with this serious \nglobal challenge. To that end, we should not remain \nindecisive and indifferent to this serious issue. Neither \nshould we miss the opportunity to do what we can to \nmake the world a better place to live in. \n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of the people and the Government \nof Turkmenistan, I wish to express my good wishes to \nall members and to congratulate them on the beginning \nof the sixty-second session of the General Assembly. \n Let me take this opportunity to congratulate \nMr. Ban Ki-moon on his election to the post of \nSecretary-General and to wish him every success in \ndischarging his challenging responsibilities. \n I should also like to congratulate Mr. Srgjan \nKerim on his election to the presidency of the \nAssembly. I am certain that under his guidance, the \nwork of the Assembly will be effective and fruitful.  \n Since the very first days of its independence, \nTurkmenistan has considered the ideals of the United \nNations to be fully in accordance with our aspirations \nin terms of relations with the international community. \nThe basic principles of the Organization   the \nmaintenance of peace, equality of rights, respect for the \nsovereignty of all States and their right to choose their \nown path of development   formed the basis for our \ncountry\u2019s foreign policy, in which cooperation with the \nUnited Nations has become a priority area. \n Time has proved that the choice made by our \ncountry was right and well founded. In 15 years of \nintense cooperation with the United Nations, \nTurkmenistan has found its own place in the \ninternational arena and has gained invaluable \nexperience in interacting with the world community \nand developing harmonious, equal and mutually \nrespectful relations with other nations. We have every \nright to be proud of the fact that it was within these \nwalls that resolution 50/80 [A], on the permanent \nneutrality of Turkmenistan, was adopted on \n12 December 1995   a historic event for our country. \nIt is not an exaggeration to say that the resolution on \nneutrality has become the foundation of our foreign \npolicy and has played a major role in shaping our \nnational policy. \n Cooperation with the United Nations will \ncontinue to drive our foreign policy. Here, I should like \nto emphasize that such cooperation enriches our \nbilateral and multilateral ties and makes them more \nmeaningful. That is most apparent in regional matters, \nwhere the participation of the United Nations and its \nspecialized agencies promotes convergence of States\u2019 \napproaches to issues, thus creating a favourable \npolitical, diplomatic and legal environment for their \nresolution through concerted effort. \n In that context, I consider the recent decision to \nestablish a United Nations Regional Centre for \nPreventive Diplomacy in Central Asia to be a major \nmilestone. I am confident that the inauguration of the \nCentre, set for the end of the year, will mark an entirely \nnew phase in the efforts of our country and our \nneighbours to ensure peace, security and stability in the \nregion. \n Turkmenistan is fully prepared to engage in \nconstructive and fruitful cooperation with the Centre. \nWe are certain that its work will be a strong and \npositive force in resolving the problems faced by our \nregion. We highly appreciate the decision to establish \nthe Centre in Ashgabat, capital of neutral \nTurkmenistan. We see that as an expression of the \nOrganization\u2019s confidence in our country. Mindful of \nour great responsibility, I assure the Assembly that our \ncountry will do everything necessary to make the \nCentre\u2019s work effective and fruitful. \n Notwithstanding current changes in the world, the \ngreat humanist ideals of the United Nations and the \nprinciples of its Charter should continue to serve as the \nmoral and legal pillar of the international order. Only \non this basis can the issues of United Nations reform \nbe considered. United Nations reform as a whole \nshould be meaningful and goal-oriented and \ncorrespond to the objective realities of the age. In this \nrespect, Turkmenistan supports the efforts of the \nUnited Nations Member States and the Secretary-\nGeneral to make the work of the Organization more \ndynamic, efficient, transparent and democratic. \n In that context, Turkmenistan shares the view that \nit is necessary to improve further the structure of the \nSecurity Council and to develop closer and more \neffective interaction between the Security Council and \nthe General Assembly. We are in favour of reforming \nthe United Nations, making it stronger, enhancing its \nwork and expanding the role and functions of the \nSecurity Council as a guarantor of international peace, \nsecurity and stability. \n Turkmenistan\u2019s neutral status, its foreign policy \ndoctrine of non-affiliation with any blocs and its \nrejection of the use of force as a means of resolving \ninternational disputes predetermine our stance with \nregard to the issues of peace and security. In this \ncontext, Turkmenistan fully supports international \nefforts to combat the proliferation of weapons of mass \ndestruction, their delivery systems and related \ntechnologies. Accordingly, Turkmenistan has been \ntaking and will continue to take consistent practical \nsteps to ensure implementation of the international \nlegal framework on the non-proliferation of weapons \nof mass destruction. In its legislation, Turkmenistan \nproclaims its refusal to possess, manufacture, store or \ntransport nuclear, chemical, bacteriological and other \ntypes of weapons of mass destruction or related \ntechnologies. In 2005, the People\u2019s Council of \nTurkmenistan decided to adopt a Statement on \nSupporting the Initiatives of International \nOrganizations to Combat the Proliferation of Weapons \nof Mass Destruction. Last year, in Semipalatinsk, \nTurkmenistan, together with other States of the region, \nsigned the Treaty on a Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone in \nCentral Asia. That document is unique in many ways, \nsince, for the first time since the Second World War, it \nproclaims the establishment of a vast region free of \nnuclear weapons on the map of the northern \nhemisphere. It is noteworthy that our joint initiative \nechoes the aspirations of the majority of countries and \nthat it has been highly acclaimed by the international \ncommunity and endorsed by the United Nations \nGeneral Assembly. Let me take this opportunity to \nexpress our appreciation to all States, international and \nregional organizations that have supported the \ndocument. \n However, we need to realize that Central Asia is \nnot isolated. Our region has thousands of historical, \nethnic and humanitarian ties with neighbouring States. \nIn this context, Turkmenistan\u2019s concern with the events \nin Afghanistan is justified. We rejoice at the success of \nthe Afghan people in building a peaceful life; we feel \nthe difficulties they face as our own. Turkmenistan is \nassisting Afghanistan in rebuilding its economy, by \nproviding professional training, in the construction of \nsocial facilities and by providing oil and power to some \nprovinces of the country. Together with the \ninternational community, and with the United Nations, \nwe are striving to help achieve stability for Afghanistan \nand to help the brotherly people of that country to \nachieve peace and well-being. \n Geographically, Turkmenistan is conveniently \nlocated at the crossroads of Europe and Asia. Over its \nyears of independence, our country has built a modern \ntransportation and communication infrastructure. As an \nimportant element of international trade and economic \nrelations, it may also become a factor leading to \nsignificant revitalization and further development of \ncultural interaction between the regions, thus \npromoting rapprochement and mutual understanding \nbetween nations. It is in that spirit that Turkmenistan \ndefines its international energy strategy, aimed at \ndeveloping a multiple pipeline system to bring \nTurkmen energy resources to international markets on \na stable and long-term basis. This strategy is not \ndependent on either political circumstances or any kind \nof ideological bias. Our stand on this matter is a stand \nof principle and full transparency. We support the \nimplementation of economically justified pipeline \nprojects that would guarantee security, including \nenvironmental safety. That will determine their multi-\ntrack character. In this context, Turkmenistan is in \nfavour of the mutually advantageous use of energy \nresources by both exporters and consumers. \n From this point of view, we are convinced that \nthe implementation of projects aimed at bringing \nTurkmen energy to international markets will provide \nanother impulse to stimulate inter-State and \ninterregional trade and economic relations. That will \nalso serve to promote further economic growth in the \ncountries where pipelines run and assist in the \nresolution of issues relating to the provision of light \nand heat, the development of production and social \ninfrastructure and job creation, which will, ultimately, \nhave a positive effect on the overall political climate \nwithin and beyond the region. \n Turkmenistan is taking very seriously the issue of \nenvironmental protection and a whole range of other \nissues that will have to be addressed by engaging the \ncapacity of the international community at large. In this \ncontext, we support the efforts of the Secretary-General \nto promote and develop broad international \ncooperation, with a view to finding a comprehensive \nsolution to this global problem. To that end, \nTurkmenistan is taking specific steps at the national \nlevel. Up to 200 million dollars are annually earmarked \nin the national budget for environmental protection. \nOur country has passed legislation setting standards to \nprevent environmental pollution, and it is introducing \ntechnologies to ensure environmental safety of our key \nsector, the oil and gas industry. Already for over 10 \nyears, Turkmenistan has been implementing a large-\nscale nation-wide programme entitled \u201cThe Green \nBelt\u201d, which has resulted in millions of trees being \nplanted on thousands of hectares all over the country. \n We are fully committed to the goals of the Kyoto \nProtocol, and we are ready to cooperate with all \ninternational partners in implementing its provisions. \n As a full-fledged member of the international \ncommunity, Turkmenistan is developing a genuinely \ndemocratic and legal foundation for its national \nstatehood. The greatest value of our society is the \nindividual, and his or her rights and freedoms. Today, \nthis is at the centre of our State policy. \n Processes aimed at the further democratization of \npublic and political life, the establishment of civil \nsociety, the introduction of modern electoral \nmechanisms and the formation of local government \nbodies are gaining momentum. A constructive \ninnovative search for a reasonable balance between the \nauthority of the State and society at large is under way. \nWe are not trying to speed up the process, and we are \nnot pushing it into some artificial time frame. The most \nimportant thing is that it has become irreversible and is \nreceiving recognition and support both within and \noutside the country. And, in this respect, we highly \nappreciate the assistance provided to us by \ninternational organizations in general and by the \nUnited Nations in particular. \n Today, Turkmenistan is open to the world; it is \nopen to broad-scale partnership in all areas of activity. \nTogether with the rest of the community of nations, our \ncountry is ready to work further to promote the \nprinciples of international law and the ideals of \nhumanism, justice, tolerance and mutual respect as \ndeterminant factors in modern relations among States. \n The status of permanent neutrality not only \nimposes on our country important foreign policy \nobligations but also obliges us to shape our foreign and \nsocial policies accordingly. In that context, I would like \nto emphasize that Turkmenistan\u2019s neutrality is \nirreversible and that our commitment to the resultant \ninternational obligations is firm. We intend to follow \nthis path with resolve, and we will always be open to \ninternational cooperation promoting implementation of \nthe strategic priorities of the community of nations. \n"

        "file_text": "I would like, first of all, \nto join the speakers who have already addressed this \nAssembly in congratulating Mr. Kerim on his election \nas President of the General Assembly at its sixty-\nsecond session.  \n It also gives me great pleasure to welcome the \nappointment of Mr. Ban Ki-moon as Secretary-General \nand to acknowledge the distinct manner in which he \nhas started his activities, as well as his tireless efforts \nto breathe a new dynamism into the United Nations \nwith the purpose of optimizing its functioning. \n The present session is especially meaningful for \nthe Republic of Moldova, marking the fifteenth \nanniversary of its having joined the United Nations \nfamily. As a State Member of the United Nations, the \nRepublic of Moldova has demonstrated faithfulness to \nthe principles and purposes of the United Nations \nCharter by totally supporting the objectives of the \nOrganization and sharing its responsibilities. \n The globalization process is occurring \neverywhere and is of concern to all of us. As members \nknow, those issues are addressed in the Millennium \nDeclaration (resolution 55/2). In our opinion, the \npresent level of aid is not sufficient; the identification \nof innovative sources of financing and an increase in \nthe effectiveness of existing aid are imperative. In that \nvein, we hope that the recommendations in the areas of \ndevelopment contained in the report of the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s High-level Panel on United Nations System-\nwide Coherence (A/61/583) will help us overcome the \nfragmentation of the United Nations so that the system \ncan deliver as one, in partnership with all Member \nStates. \n The high-level event organized under the \nauspices of the Secretary-General that preceded the \ngeneral debates drew attention to climate change, \nwhose fatal effects have been experienced all over the \nworld. We know about that very well as, this summer, \nour country suffered the worst drought in 60 years. We \nhighly appreciate the United Nations institutions, first \nand foremost the Food and Agriculture Organization of \nthe United Nations and the World Food Programme, \nand all Member States which immediately answered \nour request for help. We continue to count on such aid \nin mitigating the consequences of the drought. \n Under these circumstances, we favour the \nadoption of a new international agreement in this area, \nand we hope that the next session of the Conference of \nthe Parties to the United Nations Framework \nConvention on Climate Change will be able to \nnegotiate new arrangements for moving beyond the \nKyoto Protocol. \n Terrorism remains a major threat to the internal \nsecurity of countries and to international security. In \nthat regard, the Republic of Moldova wholeheartedly \nsupports United Nations efforts in fighting terrorism. \nOne example of this is our joining the International \nConvention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear \nTerrorism. Internally, the Government has undertaken a \nseries of concrete actions towards fighting terrorism by \nadopting its national strategy for preventing and \nfighting money-laundering and terrorism financing, as \nwell as by implementing relevant resolutions of the \nSecurity Council. \n We see in the present session of the General \nAssembly an opportunity to finalize the draft of a \ncomprehensive convention on international terrorism \naimed at reaching an international consensus on a \nnormative framework in that area. Heightened attention \nmust be given to the fight against terrorism nourished \nby separatist tendencies that affect the sovereignty and \nterritorial integrity of States. I wish to assure members \nthat our delegation will participate actively in \ncoordinating the negotiating process in the Sixth \nCommittee of the General Assembly.  \n The United Nations has represented for decades \nthe proper forum for tackling varied problems related \nto disarmament and non-proliferation. The Republic of \nMoldova welcomes the new approach to controlling \nsmall arms and light weapons and in that context we \nare in favour of a new agreement in the area of arms \nsales. We support the international community\u2019s efforts \naimed at establishing an efficient security system and \narms control system and remain a faithful supporter of \nimplementing the Treaty on Conventional Armed \nForces in Europe (CFE).  \n I wish to reiterate on this occasion the position of \nthe Republic of Moldova that the withdrawal of the \nRussian troops that remain on Moldovan territory \nagainst our will, in conformity with the obligations \nassumed by the Russian Federation in 1999 in Istanbul, \nwould create the necessary conditions for ratifying and \napplying the adapted CFE Treaty. \n The Transdniestrian conflict remains a continuous \nobstacle to promoting reforms and ensuring the social \nand economic development of our country. A year ago, \nspeaking in the Assembly, we addressed in great detail \nthe problems related to the conflict and expressed hope \nfor a final sustainable solution. Today, I have to state \nregretfully that the negotiations process   suspended \nsince April 2006 because of the rigid and non-\nconstructive position of separatist leaders supported \nfrom outside Moldova   could not be restarted, in \nspite of our constant efforts. That serves as a screen for \npromoting some political and mafia interests foreign to \nthe people of the region. Continuous violations of \nfundamental human rights in the Transdniestrian region \nand the inefficiency of the existing peacekeeping \nmechanism make imperative the need to transform that \nmechanism into a multinational civil mission with an \ninternational mandate. \n In the context of United Nations consolidation, \nthe Republic of Moldova supports the adoption of \ndecisions necessary for the revitalization of the \nGeneral Assembly, reform of the Security Council and \nthe strengthening of the Economic and Social Council. \nIn that respect, we consider that the Security Council \nneeds to be extended in both permanent and non-\npermanent categories, as a result of which the Eastern \nEuropean Group would be offered an additional  \nnon-permanent seat. \n We welcome the adoption of resolution 61/16, on \nthe strengthening of the Economic and Social Council, \nthe major body for coordinating the economic and \nsocial activities of the United Nations. The Republic of \nMoldova presented its candidature for the current \nyear\u2019s elections to the Economic and Social Council, \nand I take this opportunity to thank all the Member \nStates that granted us their trust. \n The Republic of Moldova has constantly \nsupported the maintenance and consolidation of the \nOrganization\u2019s role in resolving crisis and conflict \nsituations, aiding in post-conflict construction and \nproviding humanitarian assistance to affected zones in \nvarious parts of the world, especially to the zones \naffected by conflicts, including the GUAM region. In \nthat respect, we welcome the decision of the General \nAssembly to maintain in the agenda of the current \nsession item 16, entitled Protracted conflicts in the \nGUAM area and their implications for international \npeace, security and development, and the increased \nattention it is paying to the issue. \n I would like in conclusion to reaffirm the will of \nthe State I represent to cooperate in and actively \ncontribute to the common efforts of Member States to \nstrengthen the United Nations as the Organization that \nholds the key role in peacekeeping, security and \nsustainable development. \n"

        "file_text": "Over the 62 years of its \nexistence, the General Assembly has witnessed many \nmoments of historical reckoning. It was one such \nmoment, five years ago, when Afghanistan returned to \nthe Assembly as a country emerging out of a long, dark \nera of war, violence and terror. As I stood before the \nAssembly in September 2002, the challenges of \nrestoring security to the lives of the Afghan people and \nof rebuilding Afghanistan into a stable and democratic \ncountry seemed all but insuperable. The fate of a \nnation swayed between the promise of a safer and more \nprosperous future, on the one hand, and the enormity of \nthe tasks, on the other hand. \n Today, efforts in support of stability and \nreconstruction in Afghanistan are proceeding resolutely \napace. The Afghan people continue to make the best of \nthe new opportunities. Our economy is surging ahead. \nThe legitimacy of our newly founded institutions is \ngradually taking root. Our society is brimming with \nfreedom and activity. \n For too long, Afghanistan was in an unenviable \nposition in terms of most human development \nindicators. That situation is no longer acceptable, and \nis changing rapidly. Today more Afghans enjoy access \nto health and education than ever before in our history. \nWe have very fortunately cut our child mortality rate, \nwhich was one of the highest in the world just two \nyears ago, by 25 per cent. As a result, over 85,000 \nmore children have a chance to live today. \n For the first time in 40 years, Afghanistan is set \nonce again to become self-sufficient in food \nproduction. Already, the fruits of relative stability and \nincreased prosperity in Afghanistan are spilling over \nthe borders to the wider region. Having enjoyed \nunprecedented growth in our regional trade over the \npast six years, we are now moving to consolidate \nAfghanistan\u2019s role in the economic integration of the \nregion. Earlier this year, we assumed membership of \nthe South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation \n(SAARC). The significance of that step lies in the \npotential for Afghanistan to connect South Asia to \nCentral Asia and the Middle East in commerce and \ninteraction.  \n Last month, President Rahmon of Tajikistan and I \nwere joined by the United States Secretary of \nCommerce to inaugurate a transit bridge financed by \nthe United States that connects Afghanistan with \nTajikistan and beyond. That bridge, alongside many \nother infrastructure projects we have completed, is to \nplay a significant role in the further economic \nintegration of the region. \n Make no mistake: despite our achievements, a \nsafer and brighter future for Afghanistan still hinges on \nmany serious challenges. Poverty, underdevelopment, \nclimatic hardships and, above all, the menaces of \nterrorism and narcotics, are challenges of global \nproportions that continue to be shared by Afghanistan \nas a member of the global village. \n To the extent that terrorism remains a threat, \nworld citizens will never be safe. Six years after \nAfghanistan\u2019s liberation from the grip of international \nterrorists, we are still grappling with this threat on a \ndaily basis. Terrorists continue to kill innocent people, \nincluding those who have come from the outside world \nto help. The past two years have witnessed a \nsignificant increase in terrorist attacks carried out with \nnew and brutal tactics such as beheadings, kidnappings \nand the burning of schools and clinics. \n Terrorism can only be overcome if it is addressed \nappropriately across its regional and international \ndimensions. We are monitoring with deep concern the \ncontinued presence of a terrorist infrastructure in our \nregion, and condemn, in equally strong terms, the \natrocities that terrorists are committing in places \nbeyond our borders.  \n Recognizing that constructive regional \ncooperation is vital to a successful counterterrorism \nstrategy, we proposed the holding of a joint jirga, or \ncouncil, between Afghanistan and Pakistan. We are \npleased with the support that that initiative has \nreceived from our friends in the international \ncommunity. The first joint peace council between \nAfghanistan and Pakistan was held in Kabul last \nmonth. It was a promising step in harnessing the \nunequivocal support of civil societies in both countries \nin our common fight against terrorism and extremism. \nWe expect that the outcome of the council will \ntranslate into concrete action. \n While we continue our struggle against terrorism, \nwe will also focus on reconciliation with those that are \nnot part of Al Qaida and other terrorist networks.  \n I also note, with deep concern, the particularly \nheinous use by terrorists of local populations as human \nshields, resulting in the loss of civilian lives. While \ncondemning such deliberate targeting of civilians in the \nstrongest possible terms, I would like to emphasize the \nneed for maximum caution on the part of the \ninternational forces operating in Afghanistan, as well \nas for increased coordination with Afghan authorities, \nin order to avoid civilian casualties. \n Narcotics is another global peril that, like \nterrorism, seriously undermines the stability and well-\nbeing of our societies. In Afghanistan, that scourge is \nthe legacy of the decades of misfortunes that befell our \ncountry \u2014 from the widespread despair induced by war \nand oppression, to drought and climatic hardships. We \nare working with our international partners to tackle \nthe menace. We will prioritize the provision of \nalternative livelihoods to farmers and expedite \nimplementation of other strategies, including poppy \neradication and the interdiction of traffickers. \nHowever, addressing the world\u2019s drug challenge must \ninvolve focus on the far greater dimensions of the drug \ntrade that lie outside Afghanistan, such as fighting the \ninternational drug mafia, ensuring stricter border \ncontrol, and reducing demand in foreign markets. \n Climate change has rightly been recognized as a \nserious challenge facing the entire world. No country, \ndeveloped or developing, is immune to its impact. \nYesterday\u2019s high-level event on that important topic \nwas an essential step forward in strengthening the \nresolve of the international community to address that \nglobal threat with unity. We fully support the \nrecommendations of the Chairman\u2019s summary. \n We are also watching the situation in the Middle \nEast with deep concern. In particular, we remain \nconcerned about the situation in Palestine and call for \nthe full realization of the rights of our Palestinian \nbrothers and sisters, including their right to an \nindependent State, living side by side with its \nneighbours in peace and coexistence.  \n The adoption of the Iraq Compact, sponsored by \nthe United Nations and the international community, \nwas an achievement marking Iraq\u2019s new partnership \nwith the international community to consolidate peace \nand promote social and economic development. We, \nthe Afghan people, wish our brothers and sisters in Iraq \nevery success in achieving their aspiration of a \npeaceful and prosperous Iraq. \n Allow me to thank our partners in the \ninternational community, the United States, Japan, \nmembers of NATO, the European Union, our brothers \nin the Islamic world, our neighbours, China, India, \nAustralia and all other countries for supporting \nAfghanistan during these years of challenge to our \ncountry. We appreciate the role that the United Nations \nand the Secretary-General are playing in coordinating \nthe international community\u2019s role in the development \nprocess in Afghanistan. I am particularly thankful to \nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his initiative, two \ndays ago, of calling a high-level international meeting \non Afghanistan, at which our partners once again \nreaffirmed their commitment to Afghanistan\u2019s \nrebuilding and reconstruction. \n Six years ago, in an unprecedented convergence \nof interests, the international community united behind \nAfghanistan, facing up to the inescapable reality that \nthe world\u2019s security had come to depend on stability \nand progress in Afghanistan. Today, many of the \nnations represented here can rightly take pride in what \nwe have achieved together. I thank them all for their \ncommitment and for the steadfast support they have \nprovided to Afghanistan over the past six years. \nWithout that support, the progress we have made in \nAfghanistan would be simply unthinkable.\n"

        "file_text": "It is an  honour for me to address this gathering today, and on \nbehalf of the Government and people of the Republic \nof Suriname I extend my congratulations to President \nKerim for having been entrusted the task of leading the \nwork of the General Assembly during this sixty-second \nsession. We pledge our full support and cooperation as \nwe collectively continue our work on the many \nchallenges the world is faced with today. \n Allow me to salute your predecessor, Mrs. Haya \nRashed Al-Khalifa, for guiding the ongoing process of \nreform of the United Nations and for her dedication \nand commitment to the strengthening of \nmultilateralism. \n To the newly appointed Secretary-General of the \nOrganization, His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon, we \npledge our support in furthering the ideals of the \nCharter towards sustainable development, international \npeace and security and respect for human rights and \nfundamental freedoms. \n The current international scene predominantly \nspeaks about the devastating effects of climate change, \nand also the recent findings of the Intergovernmental \nPanel on Climate Change have confirmed the warming \nof the climate system and have clearly linked it to \nhuman activities.  \n The effects of climate change will be felt in all \nparts of the world; however, the impact will be worse \nin small and vulnerable States. Suriname is a low-lying \ncoastal country, and the majority of the population is \nconcentrated in the coastal zone, where most economic \nactivities, including fisheries, agriculture and \nindustries, are located. A sea level rise would therefore \nbe catastrophic for our country. \n Taking into consideration the national interest in \nexploiting natural resources, it is imperative for a \ncountry to find a sound balance between economic \ndevelopment and preservation of the environment. \nTherefore, the Government has declared a substantial \npart of our land area as a nature-preserve area, \nincluding the Central Suriname Nature Reserve, which \nhas been designated as a World Heritage site by the \nUnited Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural \nOrganization (UNESCO). Since the majority of our \nland surface is covered by tropical rainforest, Suriname \ncontributes significantly to counterbalancing the effects \nof global warming.  \n A global threat, however, justifies global action, \nand the responsibility to provide an adequate answer \nlies with all of us. We call on the international \ncommunity and development partners to increase their \nefforts and to continue their technical and financial \nsupport to developing countries to safeguard the world \nenvironment for current and future generations.  \n The Government of Suriname remains committed \nto realizing by 2015 the targets set forth in the \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs). This \ncommitment is expressed in our policy documents. Not \nonly do we accept the challenge to achieve the MDGs, \nbut also a commitment towards our people to realize \nsustainable economic and social development in every \npart of the country, including the remote areas in the \ninterior, which are populated mainly by indigenous \npeoples and maroons. \n The Republic of Suriname places great \nimportance on the promotion and protection of human \nrights and fundamental freedoms, including those of \nindigenous peoples. With the historic adoption of the \nDeclaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples \nrecently, Suriname has joined the international \ncommunity in giving recognition to the rights of \nindigenous peoples. I wish to note that in recognition \nof the status of indigenous peoples as natives, the \nRepublic of Suriname has recently declared 9 August, \nInternational Day of the World\u2019s Indigenous People, as \na national holiday.  \n Surinamese society, which is multi-ethnic, \nmultilingual, multicultural and multireligious, attaches \ngreat importance to tolerance and mutual respect. I \ntherefore commend the High-Level Dialogue on \nInterreligious and Intercultural Understanding and \nCooperation for Peace, which will start tomorrow. \n I would like to recall that the slave trade and \nslavery were among the worst violations of human \nrights in human history, particularly given their scale \nand duration. We call on the international community \nto continue supporting the initiative of the Caribbean \nCommunity to honour the memory of all those who \nsuffered as a result of the slave trade and slavery. \n The United Nations is the supreme institution to \nadvance multilateral diplomacy. Suriname will \ncontinue to advocate for the strengthening and \nupdating of the multilateral system, in order to \nadequately address global issues in the areas of the \nenvironment, energy, water, peace and security.  \n Suriname adheres to the rules of international \nlaw. In this context the Government of Suriname \nrespects the award of the arbitral tribunal, which was \nconstituted to establish a maritime boundary between \nSuriname and Guyana, pursuant to Annex VII of the \n1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the \nSea. The award, which includes a finding of \njurisdiction to consider the parties\u2019 maritime \ndelimitation claims, establishes a single maritime \nboundary between Guyana and Suriname that differs \nfrom the boundaries claimed by each of the parties. \nSuriname is pleased that the rules of international law \nhave brought an end to a longstanding dispute.  \n In closing, I reiterate my country\u2019s commitment \nto achieving the objectives of the United Nations, \nupholding the Charter and the rules of international \nlaw, and contributing towards a genuine global \npartnership. \n"

        "file_text": "I  wish to congratulate Mr. Srgjan Kerim on his election \nto the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-\nsecond session.  \n On behalf of my country, Uruguay, I would like \nto pay tribute to Mahatma Gandhi and to all of those \nwho today are paying their respects and are celebrating \nthis International Day of Non-Violence.  \n The Eastern Republic of Uruguay would like to \nbegin by reiterating its ongoing commitment to the \nprinciples and guidelines which are and will continue \nto be at the very core of its international activity: the \nsovereign equality of States, the rejection of the use of \nforce or the threat of the use of force, peaceful \nsettlement of international disputes, attachment to and \nsupport for institutions of international law, support for \ninternational law itself, non-intervention in the internal \naffairs of other States, the self-determination of \npeoples, the promotion of human rights, international \ncooperation in economic and social matters, and \nsupport for multilateralism and for the quest for \ncollective answers based on consensus and respect for \nlaw, and within the framework of the principles of the \nUnited Nations Charter   which means the rejection \nof any attempt to impose the will of one State over that \nof others. \n Achieving these principles is sometimes impeded \nby the attitude of a few dominant States that impose \nillegitimate decisions, provoking conflicts that involve \na large part of humankind and affect the weakest \ncountries. But above all, they weaken the legal and \npolitical authority of the United Nations. It is clear \ntoday that lying behind those attitudes we can discern \nhegemonic economic interests.  \n In accordance with the suggestion of the \nPresident, we will address the proposed agenda, \nbeginning with climate change. \n At the High-level Dialogue here on \n24 September, Uruguay expressed its opinions and \nreferred to various aspects of this problem that lead to \na serious and paradoxical situation for less developed \ncountries: even though they do not contribute \nsignificantly to global warming, they are the ones that \nsuffer the most and are the most vulnerable to its \naffects.  \n Regrettably, as we all know, there are highly \nindustrialized countries responsible for emitting \nmillions of tons of gas that cause global warming and \nclimate change, which, however, do not seem ready to \nreduce their emissions nor to cooperate with the \ninternational community to compensate for these \neffects. We must call upon those countries to sign the \nKyoto Protocol and to contribute, in a way that is \nproportionate to their responsibility in generating this \nproblem, so that this struggle can be carried forward by \nall the nations of our planet in solidarity.  \n For basically agricultural and fishing countries \nsuch as Uruguay and many other undeveloped \ncountries, climate is a decisive factor for development. \nThe dramatic climate variations that are increasingly \nnotorious constitute a serious threat for their \npossibilities for progress and the well-being of their \npopulations. This is why our countries have affirmed \nthat temporary aid and depending on the goodwill of \nrich countries when faced with specific catastrophes \ndoes not accomplish much. Rather, we need effective \nmeasures to be adopted from now on to prevent these \ncatastrophes and commitments that are to be made now \nin order to avoid continuing to create the conditions \nthat produce these catastrophes. \n In considering the topic of financing for \ndevelopment, we should begin with the following \nquestion. What have been the causes of \nunderdevelopment, economic and political dependency \nand poverty for billions of people, most of whom live \nin the southern part of the planet?  \n Looking for such financing, we tend to \nimmediately think of financial organizations like the \nWorld Bank, or those which, in order to maintain \nbudgets   that is, economic and social programmes   \nreflecting fiscal imbalances, have for decades \nprescribed economic formulas, such as those applied \nby the International Monetary Fund, which instead of \nleading to development have destroyed the productive \napparatus of entire regions of the planet, thus \ngenerating unemployment, increasing poverty and \nconcentrating wealth.  \n My country, along with other countries of the \nSouth American region, the Cairns Group and the \nGroup of 22, has been saying for two decades that it is \nimportant to have just standards of trade rather than \npreaching about the unconditional opening of markets \non the pretext of free trade while simultaneously \npractising the crudest and most ruthless protection of \nthe world\u2019s predominant systems of production and \nstubbornly refusing to comply with part V of the \nAgreement on Agriculture, annexed to the Marrakesh \nAgreement, whose objectives include the elimination \nof subsidies and the opening up of markets. \nUnfortunately, we have not managed to convince the \nUnited States and the European Union of this.  \n To put it briefly and concisely, developing \ncountries do not need to be \u201chelped\u201d; they need \nguarantees of free access to markets and, in particular, \nthe elimination of domestic production subsidies, \nwhich violate the competitiveness guarantees, which \nare so highly touted. It is in agriculture that the \nsouthern countries are highly competitive and produce \nconsumer goods of high quality, generally free of \ngenetic modification. Real free trade would not make \nthem turn to international credit and would enable \nthem to generate their own resources to finance their \nown development, integrate their economies, to expand \ntheir markets, create their own multilateral credit \ninstitutions and diversify their products and, as a result, \ntheir markets.  \n Uruguay is the Chairman pro tempore of the \nCommon Market of the South (MERCOSUR) and we \nfirmly believe in the regional integration of all of the \ncountries of South America. That is their strategic \noption in foreign policy.  \n Our South America possesses all of the natural \nresources that we find in the world; we have energy \nreserves for more than 100 years; we have the potential \nto produce food for 4 billion people; we have the \nlargest global freshwater reserves; we have major \nmineral resources. Hence, we can make decisive \neconomic and social progress, with a view to \neliminating poverty.  \n But despite all of that, we face an absurd and \ncriminal situation: out of 400 million people in South \nAmerica, 200 million live under the poverty threshold; \nthere are areas of the continent where there are \nextremely high rates of infant mortality. Life \nexpectancy for part of that population is practically \nhalf of what it is in developed countries.  \n We cannot forget that in today\u2019s world South \nAmerica is a factor of peace and political stability. All \nof the current Governments of South America have \nbeen democratically elected. Both in MERCOSUR and \nin its associated States, we have adopted the so-called \ndemocratic clause that says that a country can belong \nto these integration systems only if it respects \ndemocratic principles.  \n That is why, after 200 years of non-integration, \nwe will tenaciously defend that achievement   so that \nanti-democratic and destabilizing interference will fail \nand so that the continent of hope, as we call it, can \nhave an impact on the world to affirm peace and \nrespect for international law, democratic stability, \nfundamental freedoms and human rights, which with \ngreat sacrifice these people have recovered after \ndecades of a doctrine focusing on national security.  \n Uruguay reaffirms its commitment to the \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs). In order to \nachieve them, we need greater social justice, a better \ndistribution of wealth and the gradual establishment of \nnew criteria that would place the economy at the \nservice of humankind instead of being a factor of \nslavery and poverty for a large part of humankind   a \ntool that is used for the excessive enrichment of \nprivileged groups.  \n Our country knows the difficulties that all \ndeveloping nations face in working towards those \nobjectives. The current Uruguayan Government \ninherited a country that had experienced the worst \ncrisis in its history, with levels of poverty affecting \n1 million people out of a population of 3.5 million \npeople; in tens of thousands of cases poverty reached \nthe levels of abject poverty. All of this was the result of \nthe application of a foreign economic model which was \ncontrary to the interests of the region and its people.  \n Tackling this reality meant not only medium-term \nand long-term productive development measures, but \nalso emergency social measures. Thus, in 2005 we \nimplemented an emergency plan which in two years \nreduced the number of poor by 120,000, eliminated \nabject poverty and helped to socially reintegrate a large \npercentage of those who had been affected.  \n The Government is moving forward with a social \nequity plan, which involves the integration of more \nthan 500,000 people   one seventh of the \npopulation   into the national health system, which is \nalso being substantially modified. It also includes \nbenefits of roughly $40 per month to all children who \ngo to primary school and roughly $45 per month for \nthose who attend secondary or technical school. All of \nthis will help bring about a positive process of social \ninclusion.  \n Likewise, laws are being considered to transform \nthe entire educational sector and which are also aimed \nat achieving the MDGs. At present, school is \nmandatory from the age of 4 and special attention is \nbeing paid to dealing with the problem of dropouts. \n For Uruguay, no type of terrorism is acceptable or \njustifiable: neither State terrorism, which we \nexperienced during the 1970s and 1980s and which \nbecame a national security doctrine, nor the terrorism \nthat is practiced by some groups to further their social, \npolitical, religious or other demands, claiming victims \nwho, in the end, are always innocent people.  \n In the United Nations context, Uruguay is a party \nto all United Nations-system counter-terrorism \nconventions. We have submitted the relevant reports to \nall United Nations committees in this area.  \n Uruguay is concerned both by acts of terrorism \nand by their underlying causes. These include the \npromotion of hate based on cultural, political, racial or \nreligious differences; the talk of a so-called inevitable \nclash of civilizations; military invasions; and the \npersistence of difficult conditions for part of \npopulations living in occupied territories. \nInterventionism and non-compliance with United \nNations resolutions to resolve conflicts are causing an \nincrease in extremism and religious fanaticism among \nsuch peoples and seem to be the factors that have \ncontributed most to the worsening and proliferation of \nterrorist attacks.  \n Uruguay calls for all cultures and peoples to \ncome together in a respectful dialogue so that what is \ndifferent or foreign will not be a reason for aggression, \ndiscrimination, subjugation or hatred. We fully support \nthe initiative of Spain and Turkey: the Alliance of \nCivilizations.  \n In the view of Uruguay, peacekeeping in conflict \nzones is an essential mission not only of the United \nNations, but also of all countries wishing to cooperate \nin building a safer world where peace and cooperation \nare the norm. Our country currently takes part in 12 of \nthe 15 peacekeeping missions of the Organization \ndeployed in Africa, America, Asia and Europe. Despite \nthe fact that we have only 3.5 million people, we are \nthe seventh largest troop contributor to those \noperations and we are the greatest per-capita troop \ncontributor in the world.  \n Uruguay has acquired experience in matters \nlinked to peacebuilding and reconstruction in areas \ndevastated by conflict, and offers electoral assistance \nto States as well. \n With respect to United Nations reform, Uruguay \nbelieves it is a priority to strengthen mechanisms to \neliminate the resort to preventive wars, interventionism \nand unilateral actions that are undertaken without \ntaking into account the opinion of the international \ncommunity. Uruguay also expresses its full support for \nthe new Human Rights Council, in which we have been \nhonoured to serve as one of the Vice-Presidents. With \nrespect to Security Council reform, we hope that in the \ncurrent session we will be able to move forward on the \nbasis of a consensus. Uruguay supports the inclusion of \nBrazil as a permanent member, as well as that of India, \nGermany and Japan, and an increase in the number of \nnon-permanent members.  \n The effectiveness of the United Nations is a topic \nthat concerns us. Uruguay is one of the countries that \nhave been chosen for the \u201cOne United Nations\u201d pilot \nplan, within the framework of the recommendations of \nthe High-level Panel on System-wide Coherence. The \nGovernment of Uruguay has committed itself to \ncarrying out this pilot project in coordination with the \nUnited Nations agencies in Uruguay, defining three \nstrategic areas as the basis of that coordination: State \nreform, especially in health, education and \ndevelopment strategies; decentralized development, \nwith civic participation; and policies to eradicate \npoverty and structural inequities.  \n Lastly, Uruguay believes that all United Nations \nMember States must abandon patterns that date back to \nthe Second World War and develop organizational \nstandards for the General Assembly, the Security \nCouncil and the other principal organs of the United \nNations. Member States should establish conditions \nthat would bring the United Nations into the twenty-\nfirst century, thus guaranteeing peace and providing a \nforum in which to promote a dignified life for peoples \nalong the axis of freedom, which is the basis for \njustice. \n"

        "file_text": "On behalf  of my country, and on my own behalf, I would like to \ncongratulate Mr. Kerim on his election to the \npresidency of the General Assembly at the sixty-second \nsession. I should also like to commend Secretary-\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon for his encouraging message this \nmorning.\nThe Charter of the United Nations has been the \nsubject of revisions almost from the moment it entered \ninto force. Some of those changes were successful and \ntimely. However, today we are acting too slowly in \nadapting United Nations structures to the realities of \nthe twenty-first century, despite the fact that the \nMillennium Development Goals have given it new \nvigour and almost a new raison d\u2019\u00eatre. Although there \nseems to be broad agreement to strengthen the General \nAssembly and to make the Security Council more \nrepresentative and transparent, we are spending too \nmuch time trying to decide how to do it. \n Panama has been very clear in its support for the \naspirations of Brazil, Japan and Germany to become \npermanent members of the Security Council. But we \nhave also deemed it appropriate to offer Member States \nalternatives that would enable us to make progress in \nthis debate. We urge an open mind so that we can \ncomplete this debate and come up with the relevant \nchanges quickly. \n Panama became a Security Council member with \na great feeling of regional solidarity and fiduciary \nresponsibility vis-\u00e0-vis the international community on \nall matters relating to the maintenance of international \npeace and security. We are grateful for the confidence \nthat the General Assembly placed in my country, and \nwe are always ready to seek agreement between parties \nto a conflict and to help remove obstacles that stand in \nthe way of peace and agreements. To that end, we have \nencouraged and supported efforts to advance \ndemocratic institutions and the rule of law, the \npromotion and protection of human rights and \nhumanitarian assistance to refugees and displaced \npersons. \n No conflict in the world has been given greater \nattention by the international community than that in \nthe Middle East region. Although agreements have \nbeen arrived at that have eased tensions, the path \ntowards peace has always been elusive, and new \nobstacles arise all the time. The conflict between Israel \nand Palestine is at the very core of the problems in the \nregion. Panama therefore encourages and promotes \nnegotiations between the parties, geared towards \ncreating a Palestinian State that can live in peace with \nthe State of Israel, with secure borders for both. This \nwill require a cessation of attacks on Israel from Gaza, \nwithdrawal from all the occupied territories in the West \nBank and the achievement of an agreement about the \nstatus of Jerusalem that would satisfy the parties \ndirectly involved and the entire international \ncommunity. \n On the situation in Lebanon, it is important for \nthe international community to realize that a lasting \npeace in the region requires the establishment of a \ngovernment of unity which can end the current \npolitical deadlock. If it is not resolved, this could lead \nto a return to civil war, which is something that we all \nthought was now over and done with. \n From this rostrum, we join in the call for an \nimmediate reduction in tension and peaceful solutions \nin all parts of the world where international peace and \nsecurity are threatened. It is much less costly to invest \nour efforts in avoiding confrontation than to stop it \nonce it has begun. Accordingly, we appeal to this \nOrganization to reconsider its actions vis-\u00e0-vis the \nconflict in the Middle East which, far from being \nresolved, seems to be intensifying. \n Turning to the dispute between Serbia and the \nKosovar Albanians, today we can be cautiously \noptimistic that, after several months of Security \nCouncil debate, which included a visit to the region, \nthe parties have agreed to resume dialogue. Only an \nagreement between them can ensure peace and \neconomic development in the region. \n Panama strongly supports the renewal and \nextension of the mandate of the United Nations \nStabilization Mission in Haiti. We recognize the \nprogress made by the Haitian Government with support \nfrom that mission. However, there are many matters \nthat still require more efforts, and it is essential that the \nmandate not end before that country\u2019s institutions have \nbeen strengthened. \n We welcome the progress made, but we must \ncondemn the violation of human rights in Myanmar \nand the continued detention of Nobel Peace Prize \nlaureate Aung San Suu Kyi. Although every conflict \nhas its own particular causes, we can say that \nviolations of the human rights of certain groups, a \nculture of impunity or the absence of strong institutions \nable to guarantee the human rights of all are the \ncommon denominator of most conflicts. \n In Africa, there are examples of how institutional \nweakness and abuses of human rights become the main \ncauses of conflict. On the initiative of the President of \nFrance, the Security Council is meeting this very \nafternoon to analyse all the problems that afflict that \ncontinent (see S/PV.5749). It is only by strengthening \ninstitutional capacity and building a culture of justice \nthat it will be possible to restore to those peoples the \nrights that this Organization enshrined for all \ninhabitants of the Earth. \n Responsibility for solving disputes and \npreventing conflict lies primarily with the States \nparties to a dispute. However, achieving peace depends \nto a large extent on our commitment to the collective \nsecurity architecture that we have built here in the \nUnited Nations. Since the end of the cold war, the \nUnited Nations has responded to the major challenges \nto international peace and security by increasing the \nnumber and the quality of peacekeeping operations in \ncases where diplomacy has failed. To avoid a return to \nconflict situations, peacekeeping operations cannot be \nconfined to simply separating rival forces. It is \nessential to strengthen the concept of integrated \nmissions to include new responsibilities that cover a \nbroader range of activities. Achieving a lasting peace \nmeans more than simply laying down one\u2019s weapons. \nOne must set off on the path towards development; \nlegal and political institutions must be rebuilt and \nhuman rights must be respected. \n We cannot talk about lasting peace while we live \nunder the threat of terrorism, whose definitive defeat is \nan ongoing challenge for the international community. \nPanama supports United Nations efforts to combat this \nscourge in an integrated manner, such as the adoption \nof the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism \nStrategy (see resolution 60/288). And, because we \nattach high priority to the adoption of a comprehensive \nconvention on international terrorism, we have \nshouldered the responsibility of chairing the Security \nCouncil\u2019s Counter-Terrorism Committee. \n The adoption of the Convention on the Rights of \nPersons with Disabilities (see resolution 61/106) was a \nmajor milestone on the path towards a world without \nexclusionism and reaffirmed the universality of human \nrights. Specific measures have been defined to \nguarantee full participation. Above all, we have \ncategorically said that discrimination against any \nperson on the basis of disability is a violation of the \ninherent dignity and worth of the human person. I \nwould like to say that Panama has made significant \nprogress in this area; inclusive education is a State \npriority. We have signed the Convention, and we are \ncommitted to implementing it. \n Of particular importance to Panama is the recent \nadoption of a declaration on indigenous peoples for the \nLatin American region. It strengthens respect for \ncultural diversity, with emphasis on preserving cultural \nassets. \n A year ago, I told the General Assembly (see \nA/61/PV.12) that my country would hold a referendum \nto decide whether to undertake the work of widening \nthe Panama Canal so that larger ships could transit \nbetween the two great oceans. As I believe is generally \nknown, the people of Panama approved the project, and \nbarely three weeks ago the work began. It will be \ncompleted by the year 2014. \n Panama, which has always contributed to the \ndevelopment of international trade and to \nunderstanding among nations, is especially pleased to \nreaffirm that unifying mission today, as well as its \ncommitment to peace, development and full respect for \nhuman rights. \n I should like to conclude my statement by \nreferring to some words spoken from this same rostrum \nby a Panamanian more than 50 years ago and that are \nstill just as true today. He said that to attempt to \npreserve peace without at the same time improving \npeoples\u2019 living conditions is to leave the task \nunfinished and inconclusive. We should not tire of \nrepeating that the most serious threats to peace and \nfreedom are rooted in human poverty, social injustice, \nignorance and economic backwardness; and that the \nonly peace worth keeping and defending, and which \ncan be lasting, is peace with honour, justice and \nfreedom. \n"

        "file_text": "Echoing  previous eminent speakers at this rostrum, on behalf of \nmy country, the Union of the Comoros, and on my own \nbehalf, it is a genuine pleasure to address our warm \ncongratulations to the President on his brilliant \nassumption of the presidency of the sixty-second \nsession of this Assembly. It is a pleasure likewise to \naddress our warmest congratulations to the Secretary-\nGeneral, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for the effective manner in \nwhich he has carried out his duties in this world \nundergoing vast change, which requires increased \ncommitment by our Organization. May I also extend \nour sincere thanks to the American Government and to \nthe leaders of this magnificent city of New York for the \nfine preparations that they have made to receive and \nwelcome us here. \n The situations of conflict that claim innocent \nvictims   in the Middle East, in Darfur, in Somalia \nand in so many other regions where hotbeds of tension \nerupt   appeal to our collective conscience and call \nfor urgent measures for calm and for the resolution of \nsuch problems. My Government endorses any action \ntaken by the international community, particularly the \nAfrican Union and the United Nations, in seeking \nsolutions to these problems, which are a source of \nconcern for the whole world. \n The world has reason to be concerned. Fear and \nuncertainty have become widespread, within both \ndeveloped and developing countries. Paradoxically, \nscience and technology have never been so effective. \nThe world has never been so rich, nor has it displayed \nsuch great profits.  \n Today, the countries of the South are \noverwhelmed by the burden of debt, civil war, \ninsecurity, destitution, precariousness and endemic \ndisease. Therefore, security and harmony in this world \ncall for greater solidarity and greater humanism. \n The international community should thus \nemphasize development assistance to help the small \ncountries to meet environmental challenges, \nparticularly the effects of climate change, degradation \nof the ecosystem and desertification. Such solidarity \nshould also be forthcoming in combating other \nscourges affecting our countries, most specifically \nHIV/AIDS, malaria and all other diseases that decimate \nour peoples and impede our development. \n In addition, yet another scourge besets the world, \nand that is terrorism, which recognizes no borders. Nor \ndoes it recognize race or religion in its unspeakable \ncowardice and blindness. We should do everything \npossible to ensure that it can no longer flourish on \npoverty and prosper on the weakest links of the world \nchain.  \nAlso, we must ensure that fanaticism and \nintolerance can no longer impose their law on the \nworld and destroy humankind. Indeed, in bolstering \ntolerance and respect for the right to difference and for \nthe dignity of every people, we will avoid possible \nsetbacks, attacks on human rights and the amalgam of \nterrorism and particular religions or regions. In this \nway, we will be successful in guaranteeing lasting \npeace, stability, security and development, because it \nwould be an illusion to speak of such ideals in a world \nof poverty, where economic development and the  \nwell-being of each and every individual have not yet \nbeen achieved.  \n Moreover, at this midpoint on the way to the \ndeadline of 2015 set for the Millennium Development \nGoals, while notable progress has been achieved, full \nachievement of these objectives depend to a large \nextent, on international solidarity and respect for the \nvarious commitments entered into by the wealthiest \ncountries. \n The reform of our Organization is more necessary \nthan ever to ensure that it is fully representative and \nbetter reflects its universal nature. Thus, Africa and all \nother regions of the world should be appropriately \nrepresented within the Organization in order to more \neffectively embody the principle of equality of States \nwithin this great concert of nations. \n The President took the Chair. \n Allow me to take this exceptional opportunity to \npresent some insight into the situation in my country, \nthe Union of the Comoros.  \n Since assuming the highest office, I have \nendeavoured, with my Government, to give effect to \nthe commitments made to the people of the Comoros \nand to the international community in connection with \nrespect for human rights, the rule of law and good \ngovernance, particularly through the restoration of a \nsystem of justice that should serve as a model, the \nstruggle against corruption, the struggle against \ninsalubrious housing and advancing the situation of \nwomen. \n In this certainly very ambitious endeavour, I rely \nlargely on the people of the Comoros themselves to \nestablish at the national level the conditions necessary \nfor the success of the mission and task I have set \nmyself. I am also confident that international solidarity \nwill continue to increase, to support to a small country \nsuch as ours in confronting the numerous problems that \nit encounters daily. Indeed, I would like to express \nfrom this rostrum our gratitude to all the countries and \norganizations that support us in this undertaking of \nbuilding a nation in the Comoros that is peaceful and \nprosperous.  \n But I have to emphasize that there was a time not \nso long ago when the African continent and other \nregions of the world were shaken by endless coups \nd\u2019\u00e9tat. That illegal, antidemocratic and frequently \nviolent form of access to power plunged the countries \nin question into instability.  \n It would appear that that time is now passed, with \nthe advent of democracy and multiparty systems. The \nlarge majority of political forces would appear to \naccept democratic succession through free and \ntransparent consultation of peoples as being the only \nacceptable means for acceding to power. \n However, another mode of violent political action \ncontinues to exist in developing countries and appears \nto be assuming particular importance, namely, the \narmed rebellions affecting many countries, including \nthe Comoros, my country. Armed uprisings are a \nsource of destabilization and an obstacle to \ndevelopment efforts. Such uprisings are frequently at \nthe centre of political and geopolitical interests that \nsupport them, to the detriment of the best interests of \nthe countries themselves. They benefit from the \nexplicit or hidden support of internal or external forces \nwhich use them. \n My country is not free from this phenomenon. \nIndeed, the former Head of the Executive of the island \nof Anjouan refuses to hold free and democratic \nelections at the end of his term. He is leading an armed \nuprising that has attacked the presidency of the Union, \nthe representation of the Government of the Union in \nthe island and the contingent of the National \nDevelopment Army. The uprising jeopardizes the hopes \nfor development of the country by causing delays in \nrepayment of the debt of the Comoros to the \ninternational institutions and hampers the resumption \nof investment from abroad. It is for this reason that I \nstate here our major concern at the political crisis that \nwe are experiencing. \n Therefore, I make a solemn and urgent appeal to \nthe entire international community to assist us in \nestablishing lasting stability in the Union of the \nComoros by settling the problem of the uprising that \ncontinues in the autonomous island of Anjouan. \nIndeed, all the steps taken by the Government of the \nUnion have encountered to date the intransigence of \nthe rebels of Anjouan, who refuse to comply with the \nresolutions of the African Union and the \nrecommendations of the international community \nregarding the organization of free and democratic \nelections in Anjouan, as occurred in the other two \nislands and in respect of the constitutional legality, \nparticularly, the exercise in Anjouan of legitimate \npowers. \n From the bottom of my heart, I would wish to \nthank all our bilateral and multilateral partners for their \nunflagging support in the search for a prompt and final \nsolution to the crisis that we are experiencing. For all \nthese partners, I have always demonstrated our \ngoodwill in seeking to settle the Anjouan crisis by \npeaceful means because the important thing is to save \nnational unity and preserve the people of the Comoros \nfrom anything that might damage our development \nefforts. \n I take this opportunity also to thank the \nauthorities of the African Development Bank and all \nthose instrumental in providing partial debt relief to the \nComoros, with a view to facilitating our economic \nrecovery. \n The Assembly will understand that the Comorian \nGovernment cannot sanction any action that would \nestablish the Balkanization of our country. The \nComorian people remember only too well the \nunfortunate experience regarding the sister island of \nMayotte. Although the one case is a problem within the \nComoros and the other a dispute with France, which is \na friendly country and principal partner of the  \nComoros   and I stress that fact, France is a friendly \ncountry, a friend and principal partner of the  \nComoros   both situations involve the disunion of our \ncountry, and we cannot remain indifferent to them. \n Over 30 years have passed since the independent \nnation of the Comoros was admitted to the United \nNations, within its authentic borders, that is, comprised \nof four islands: Ngazidja, Mwali, Ndzouani and Maor\u00e9. \nDuring those 30 years, all organizations that have \nrecognized our independence have unflaggingly \nsupported the just claim by the Comoros of sovereignty \nover the island of Mayotte, a claim upheld by the \nsuccessive Governments in Moroni. That is a principle \nthat the people of the Comoros will never give up, even \nif the approach has varied from one administration to \nthe next. Today, my Government would like, in a calm \natmosphere, to deal with this matter with France, \ngiving priority to dialogue and consultation. For we \nmust together find a rapid response to the problem of \nthe human tragedies caused by the frequent shipwrecks \nof makeshift boats transporting on virtually a weekly \nbasis dozens of Comorians from the other islands who \nvisit Mayotte to meet with their families. We must \npromptly together deal with the inhuman treatment \ninflicted on Comorians from the other islands residing \nin Mayotte, and we must seek to facilitate the free \nmovement of goods and persons among all the islands \nof the archipelago. Lastly, we must find together a \nmodus vivendi that reflects particularly the social, \ncultural, linguistic, economic, religious and historical \nrealities that shape the life of all Comorians.  \n To that end, I am happy to note the convergence \nof views with Mr. Nicolas Sarkozy, President of the \nFrench Republic, who, during his address to this \nAssembly stated, \n \u201cI want to say, in the name of France, that there \nwill be no peace in the world without respect for \ndiversity, without respect for national identities, \nwithout respect, I venture to say, for religions and \nbeliefs, or without respect for cultures. \nAttachment to one\u2019s faith, to one\u2019s identity, to \none\u2019s language and culture, and to one's way of \nlife, thought and belief in all that is legitimate, \nand profoundly human.\n I thus appeal to the United Nations to take on this \nmatter by working to achieve a closer rapprochement \nbetween the two parties, with a view to a prompt \nsettlement of the question. I truly believe that together \nwith the French authorities we can find the ways and \nmeans to move towards a final, just and lawful solution \nto this problem.  \n In the ongoing quest for peace and freedom, I \nhave a particular thought for those who, throughout the \nworld, are engaged in struggle and are claiming their \nrights to unity and territorial integrity. Thus, from this \nrostrum, I would like to renew to our friend the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China, our commitment to a \npolicy of a single China, single and indivisible. To our \nbrother country the Kingdom of Morocco, I would like \nto reaffirm our support for its legitimate fight to \nrecover its territorial integrity.  \n In conclusion, I hope that peace reigns in our \nworld, that goodness and good faith win our hearts so \nthat the people of the world can live in happiness and \nin greater solidarity than ever.  \n I would like to finish with a few words in Arabic. \n The Israeli-Arab conflict is the source of tensions \nin the Middle East, and the Palestinians in the occupied \nArab territories live in inhuman and tragic economic \nconditions because of Israeli practices. The \ninternational community must deal decisively with this \nsituation by requiring the Israeli authorities to \nimplement relevant Security Council and General \nAssembly resolutions and decisions. Additionally, the \nprovisions of international law, international \nhumanitarian law and human rights must be observed. \nAs we all know, there can be no peace in the Middle \nEast without a just and lasting solution to the \nPalestinian question effected by the withdrawal of \nIsrael from the Arab territories that it occupied in 1967.  \n Without the establishment of a viable Palestinian \nState, with East Jerusalem with its capital, and the \nsettlement of the question of refugees on the basis of \nthe General Assembly resolution of 1949, the conflict \nwill not be settled. Construction of settlements must be \nstopped, the separation wall must be demolished and \nPalestinians must be compensated for damage caused \nby its construction. I also invite our Palestinian \nbrothers to renounce division and disintegration and to \nengage in dialogue. The international community and \nthe United Nations must provide swift humanitarian \nassistance to the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, open \nthe crossings and dismantle anything that hampers \nmovement. \n We also state our solidarity with our brothers in \nLebanon, and we call for full implementation of \nSecurity Council resolution 1701 (2006), the cessation \nof Israeli incursions into Lebanon and withdrawal from \nthe Sheba\u2019a Farms.  \n On the subject of Darfur, we give priority to the \npeace talks to be held in Libya on 24 October this year. \nWe hope that all the parties will attend these talks. The \ninternational community must assume its responsibility \nand urge the parties to participate in those negotiations, \nwhich we hope will be final and decisive. We also hope \nthat the African Union mission and character in Darfur \nwill be respected and that the sovereignty, unity and \nterritorial integrity of the Sudan will be fully respected.  \n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of the President of \nPalau, Tommy E. Remengesau, Jr., and the people of \nPalau, let me begin by offering my congratulations to \nthe General Assembly President on his election and \nassuring him of our cooperation in the coming year. We \nexpress our appreciation to the Group of Asian States \nand the General Assembly for the confidence they have \ndemonstrated by electing a representative of Palau as a \nVice-President. Palau is the smallest country in the \nhistory of the United Nations to have this honour, and \nwe take it very seriously. \n Palau congratulates the Secretary-General on his \nleadership on stopping the genocide in Darfur. We were \nmoved by the calls for immediate action that we heard \nfrom President Bush and others here at the United \nNations. In this respect, I wish to announce that Palau \nwill send peacekeepers to Darfur and will play our part \nin this critical demonstration of international concern. \n Despite our capacity issues, this will not be \nPalau\u2019s first peacekeeping deployment. But while we \nare a responsible and proud Member of the United \nNations, we note the continuing lack of a permanent \nUnited Nations presence in Palau. Last June, the \nUnited Nations Development Programme, the United \nNations Population Fund and UNICEF announced that \neight new joint offices would open in Pacific island \ncountries, including Palau. We welcomed that historic \naccomplishment, but we are concerned at the fact that \nthe offices have yet to open. Existing mechanisms \nappear to have blocked progress on the ground. But we \nbelieve that the original goals and intentions of the \nproject can be salvaged if there is a will to respond to \nthe needs of small island nations like Palau. We would \nwelcome the intervention and assistance of our \npartners, as well as the recommitment of the Secretariat \nto our original shared goals. \n We note the President\u2019s call to ensure that the \nUnited Nations as an organization and we as Member \nStates are properly prepared to confront terrorism. \nPalau has worked to improve its anti-terrorism \ncapacity. We have also met with the Counter-Terrorism \nCommittee Executive Directorate to advance our \nrequests for assistance, particularly in the area of \ncombating money-laundering and terrorism financing. \nUnfortunately, the efforts of the Directorate have been \ninsufficient. Our hope is that during the sixty-second \nsession of the General Assembly, the United Nations \nwill be able to help small countries in addressing this \nthreat and in meeting our Security Council obligations. \n The Pacific is home to some of the world\u2019s \nlargest and most important biodiversity hotspots. Our \nocean ecosystems provide the backbone for Palau\u2019s \nexistence, and we are committed to their preservation. \nLast year, our nations banded together to protect \nvulnerable marine ecosystems from deep-sea bottom \ntrawling, a destructive fishing practice responsible for \n95 per cent of worldwide damage to seamounts. As a \nresult, the South Pacific Regional Fisheries \nManagement Organization adopted interim measures \nthat took a substantial step towards eliminating this \nunsustainable practice. We encourage all other regional \nfisheries management organizations and flag States to \nfollow this example, and we remind them of the \ndeadlines to take action. \n Palau has been vocal in its crusade to end bottom \ntrawling because of its effects on ocean ecosystems. \nThe North Pacific is home to some of the world\u2019s best \nfisheries. Their diversity is the key reason for the \nMicronesia Challenge, an initiative launched by \nPresident Remengesau, whereby countries and \nterritories of Micronesia have joined together to \nconserve 30 per cent of near-shore marine resources \nand 20 per cent of land resources by the year 2020. \nThis project is the first of its kind in the world. It \ncovers 6.7 million square miles of ocean, and it will \nhelp protect 10 per cent of the world\u2019s coral reefs, \nincluding more than 60 threatened species. \n While eliminating bottom trawling and \nestablishing protected areas are certainly important \nactions, they will be fruitless if rapid progress on \nclimate change cannot be made at the international \nlevel. We are no longer in total control of our destiny. \nWhen temperatures increase, our corals bleach, the \nseas rise and the oceans acidify, threatening to \ndemolish our marine biodiversity, jeopardizing our \nlivelihoods and eventually destroying our identity. \n In the light of the high vulnerability of small \nisland developing States to the impact of climate \nchange, we stress the absolute need to reach an \nagreement on a set of quantified emission reduction \ntargets for the second commitment period of the Kyoto \nProtocol. These emission reduction targets must be \nambitious, must reflect the urgency of our collective \ncircumstances and must be consistent with a mitigation \nframework that protects the most vulnerable parties to \nthe Convention, in both the short and the long-term. It \nis imperative that the effectiveness of the post-2012 \nregime address the issue of mitigating the impacts of \nclimate change on small island developing States, as \nthe key benchmark of its adequacy and effectiveness.  \n We note too the ongoing debate on General \nAssembly reform and join our voices with others who \nnote the need for concrete results on Security Council \nreform. Without Security Council reform, there can be \nno genuine United Nations reform. The early \nconclusion of the discussion is essential. Japan has \ndemonstrated its concern for and commitment to the \nPacific and the international community. It should be a \npermanent member of the Security Council. That is \ntrue too of India, the largest democracy among \ndeveloping nations, whose contributions to global \nsecurity have earned it the right to a permanent seat on \nthe Security Council. We have supported and continue \nto support the draft resolution of the Group of Four and \nhope that the Assembly will address the resolution this \nyear. \n We also note our disappointment that Taiwan \ncontinues to be excluded from this Hall. The world \nwould benefit from Taiwan\u2019s membership in the United \nNations and other international institutions. We were \ndisappointed that the Secretary-General failed to \nfollow the Charter and the rules of the Security Council \nby refusing to transmit and circulate Taiwan\u2019s \nmembership application to the Security Council and \nthe General Assembly. Ultimately, legitimate \ndemocracies must be recognized and supported across \nthe breadth of our planet no matter how large or small \nthe country. \n On behalf of Palau, a small and peaceful island \nnation in the wide Pacific Ocean, let me thank all of \nyou in my country\u2019s native language: Kom Kmal \nMesulang. \n"

        "file_text": "It gives me  great pleasure once again to address this body where \nwe unite our goals and labours for a better and brighter \nfuture. I wish to wholeheartedly congratulate you, \nSir   our good friend the former Minister for Foreign \nAffairs of the Republic of Macedonia, Mr. Srgjan \nKerim   on your election to preside over this global \nforum. \n I would also like on this occasion to pay tribute to \nthe Secretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, and to wish \nhim success in his current position. \n Our world today needs, more than ever before, \neffective cooperation to find common solutions to our \nglobal problems, to replace desperation with hope, \npoverty with prosperity, injustice with justice and \nviolence with peace around the world. The United \nNations, created precisely for that mission, is the only \ninternational forum that can possibly, with our \ncollective resolve, lead us to those objectives. The \nUnited Nations is also the source of international \nlegitimacy for our actions to those ends. But, it is \nincumbent on us, the Member States, to make the \nOrganization stronger and more effective and to furnish \nit with the means and structures it needs to tackle \ncompetently the many challenges of our century. \n Here, I believe we need to be more resolute and \nbold in our actions while adopting more forthcoming \nand creative approaches. Although significant \nstructural reforms have been realized, the process is far \nfrom completed. The reform process must continue, \nand structural and functional adjustments should be \nmade to respond to needs that may arise. \n We must bear in mind that reforming the Security \nCouncil in a way that would command the widest \npossible consensus would also reflect positively on the \nlegitimacy, credibility and effectiveness of the United \nNations itself. \n I wish on this occasion also to confirm Turkey\u2019s \ncandidature for a seat on the Security Council at the \nelections to be held next year. My country, which is \ncommitted to the ideals enshrined in the Charter and \nwhich constructively contributes to the maintenance of \nglobal peace at a strategic crossroads where different \ncontinents and cultures meet, has not been represented \non the Council for almost half a century. I genuinely \nbelieve that with the valuable support of its fellow \nMember States, Turkey, with its European and Asian \nidentity, can assume a distinctive and constructive role \nin harmonizing and reconciling differing views within \nthe Security Council, just as it does in its efforts to \nfacilitate harmony among cultures. \n We have reached an important stage in the \nimplementation phase of the Alliance of Civilizations \ninitiative under the auspices of the Secretary-General; \nwe are co-sponsoring this initiative together with \nSpain. We are determined to make our vision of global \nharmony become a reality through the implementation \nof concrete projects under the strong leadership of the \nHigh Representative, the former President of Portugal, \nMr. Jorge Sampaio, and with the support that I am \nconfident the international community will not deny \nthis initiative. The meeting held at the United Nations \nwith the Alliance Group of Friends earlier this week \nserved to renew our hope and confidence in the \npromising future of the initiative. \nThe vast majority of international problems of \nhigh priority on the agenda of the United Nations are \ntaking place in our immediate surroundings, the scene \nof major tension and transformation. We are exerting \nevery effort to constructively contribute to the \nresolution of all these disputes   which directly \nimpact Turkey, although we are not party to any of \nthem. In doing so, we seek to utilize the many \npossibilities offered by our strategic position, our \naccumulated knowledge of and insight into the region, \nour cultural and historical ties and our vast experience \nin peacekeeping. \n Our highest priority is to restore stability in our \nregion. In that connection, Turkey will resolutely \npursue its efforts to serve as an important factor for \npeace and stability and to promote multidimensional \nrelations with all its neighbours. The encouraging level \nwe have achieved in our relations with Greece today as \na result of the process of rapprochement that we have \nbeen pursuing for nearly 10 years is the tangible \noutcome of that resolve. \n Likewise, ensuring a dignified place within the \ninternational community for a territorially intact, \nnationally unified and democratic Iraq at peace with \nitself and with its neighbours is at the top of our \npriorities for restoring stability in our region. \n In line with our desire to realize this common \nvision, we continue to diversify our cooperation with \nthe Iraqi Government and support the process of \npolitical dialogue and national reconciliation in this \ncountry. The group of neighbouring countries of Iraq, \ncreated upon Turkey\u2019s initiative and later expanded at \nthe meeting held in Sharm el-Sheikh to include the \npermanent five members of the Security Council and \nthe Group of Eight, is similarly intended to serve such \na purpose. The next ministerial meeting of the \nexpanded group of neighbouring countries will be \nhosted by Turkey at the beginning of November this \nyear. \n Another major source of instability in our region \nis the Middle East problem. We regard the question of \nPalestine, with wide repercussions both in and beyond \nthe region, as the crux of all ills in the Middle East. \nThe political rift within Palestine has further \ncomplicated the situation. Therefore, a lasting political \nsolution to the question of Palestine and peace with \nIsrael on the basis of a two-State solution will have \nimportant implications for regional as well as global \nstability. We believe that a negotiated settlement to this \nlong-standing dispute will also reflect positively on the \nresolution of other problems in the region. We stand \nready to support in every way possible the parties in \nthe efforts to revive the peace process and to contribute \nto the prospective international meetings to be \nconvened for this purpose. \n We hope to see the ongoing political crisis in \nLebanon promptly overcome through dialogue among \nthe different factions. We will continue our intense \nefforts, including our contributions to the United \nNations Interim Force in Lebanon, to assist in restoring \nstability in that country. \n We will also continue to invest in the democratic, \nfree and prosperous future of the friendly people of \nAfghanistan. Our commitment to the security of the \ncountry by assuming the command of the International \nSecurity Assistance Force twice since its inception and \ncurrently of the Regional Command in Kabul, together \nwith our contributions to the reconstruction effort \nthrough significant infrastructure projects, are the \nconcrete expression of the challenging mission we \nhave undertaken in Afghanistan. The activities of the \nTurkish Provincial Reconstruction Team in the \nprovince of Wardak, carrying out its functions under \ndangerous security conditions, are also part of this \neffort. \n Moreover, the process of tripartite summits that \nwe have initiated, with the participation of Afghanistan \nand Pakistan, in the desire to enhance peace and \nstability in the region is helping to restore confidence \nbetween these two neighbouring countries. \n On the other hand, frozen conflicts pending a \nresolution continue to jeopardize regional peace and \nstability in the South Caucasus. Solutions to be found \nthrough peaceful means to existing frozen conflicts \nshould be based on the territorial integrity and \nsovereignty of Azerbaijan and Georgia. \n In order to realize our vision of peace, stability \nand economic prosperity for the region, we not only \nseek to contribute to the resolution of these frozen \nconflicts, but at the same time continue to invest in the \ninfrastructure of regional cooperation through \nsignificant energy and transportation projects, such as \nthe Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan and Baku-Tbilisi-Erzurum oil \nand natural gas pipelines and the Baku-Tbilisi-Kars \nrailroad. \nAt this juncture where uncertainty regarding the \nfinal status of Kosovo persists, we continue to maintain \nour view that we must mobilize all efforts to find a just \nand sustainable solution to this question. Turkey has \ncurrently assumed the command of the Kosovo Force \nMultinational Task Force South in the region. \n Turkey performs noble duties from the \nperspective of peacekeeping in almost all the regions \ncited above. Through its participation in various \npeacekeeping operations conducted under the banner of \nthe United Nations, the North Atlantic Treaty \nOrganization, the European Union and the \nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, \nTurkey has proven its capacity to significantly \ncontribute to the maintenance of international peace \nand security. In this connection Turkey is also \nfavourably considering participation in the African \nUnion-United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur, \nestablished in accordance with Security Council \nresolution 1769 (2007), whose adoption we highly \nwelcomed. \n To the extent that we can stop and prevent the \nrecurrence of conflicts that exhaust our energy and \nresources, we will be better able to focus on global \nproblems that will define the common fate of \nhumankind. At the top of these problems is the issue of \nclimate change, which you, Mr. President, have in a \nvery timely manner designated as the main theme of \nthe General Assembly this year. \n We discussed this issue requiring urgent \ncollective action in all its aspects during the high-level \nmeeting that I also had the opportunity to attend earlier \nthis week. The most conclusive outcome of this \nmeeting was that we must all assume our fair share of \nresponsibility in effective international cooperation to \nfind solutions to global warming and climate change, \nwhich pose, as never before, a grave threat to \nhumankind\u2019s survival. \n Another grim reality in this context is that the \ndeveloping world, bearing the least responsibility for \nclimate change, will be the most adversely affected by \nits consequences. It is therefore incumbent on us all to \nassist, to the best of our ability, the developing \ncountries in overcoming the many overwhelming \nchallenges that they confront. \n To this end, Turkey is rapidly becoming a donor \ncountry with the significant development, technical and \nhumanitarian assistance it has been providing in recent \nyears. The development aid provided by Turkey \nthrough official and private sources reached 1.7 billion \ndollars last year. We intend to continue our \ncontributions to the relevant United Nations funds, as \nwell as assistance at the bilateral level. \n The Ministerial Conference of the Least \nDeveloped Countries hosted by Turkey in Istanbul in \nJuly this summer is another concrete expression of our \nresolve to assist the developing countries and enable \nthem to take full advantage of the benefits of \nglobalization. We are already taking steps to follow up \non the outcome of this conference. \n Our commitment to peace and development in \nAfrica also finds expression in our development \nassistance to the continent coordinated through the \nbranch offices of the Turkish International Cooperation \nand Development Agency, which have been established \nsince 2005 in Ethiopia, Sudan and Senegal. The \nTurkey-Africa Cooperation Summit, which we will \nhost in 2008, and our participation in seven different \nUnited Nations and European Union peacekeeping \nmissions in Africa are other concrete examples to this \neffect. \n Turkey also seeks to diversify and expand its \nnetwork of political and commercial cooperation with \nthe countries of South Asia, the Far East and the \nPacific region, as well as Latin American countries and \nthe Caribbean. \n Terrorism continues to threaten the security of all \nfree nations. An act of terror committed in any part of \nthe world in essence targets us all, as it constitutes a \nheinous crime against humanity. We condemn in the \nstrongest terms this scourge that recognizes no national \nboundaries. As the Prime Minister of a nation that has \nexperienced first-hand the bitter consequences of \nterrorism, I renew from this rostrum my appeal to the \ninternational community for an enhanced collective \ncommitment and cooperation in the combat against this \nthreat to humanity. \n Considering the sophisticated new technologies \nterrorist elements are utilizing today, effective \ninternational cooperation to prevent the proliferation of \nweapons of mass destruction takes on a whole new \nmeaning and urgency. Turkey strongly supports the \nUnited Nations and the United Nations-led efforts to \nintensify international cooperation aimed at preventing \ntheir proliferation. \n Finally, Turkey and the Turkish Republic of \nNorthern Cyprus have been supporting the efforts to \nfind a comprehensive settlement to the Cyprus problem \nunder the good-offices mission of the United Nations \nSecretary-General on the basis of well established \nUnited Nations parameters. The United Nations \nremains the sole forum for a solution. \n It should be recalled that the comprehensive \nsettlement plan of the former United Nations \nSecretary-General emerged in 2004 as a result of \nextensive negotiations between the parties and was \nsubmitted to a simultaneous referendum on both sides \nof the island. The Turkish side overwhelmingly voted \nin favour of the Secretary-General's plan, whose \nimpartiality cannot in any way be called into question. \nThe Greek Cypriots, however, were misled by their \nleadership to reject the plan. \n Despite the constructive attitude displayed by the \nTurkish side since then, no progress has been achieved \ntowards a settlement owing to the intransigence of the \nGreek Cypriot side. It is our hope that the Annan \nreport, which has not been endorsed yet by the Security \nCouncil, will be endorsed soon. \n"

        "file_text": "I am honoured to take part in \nthe general debate of the General Assembly for the first \ntime since taking office as President of the Federated \nStates of Micronesia in May this year. On this \noccasion, I am honoured to express to Mr. Srgjan \nKerim my respect and congratulations on his election \nto the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-\nsecond session. I have every confidence that he will \nlive up to the high standards of his esteemed \npredecessors. I wish to also convey my congratulations \nto the Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Ban \nKi-moon, as he takes the helm of the Organization. I \npledge to the Secretary-General my Government\u2019s \nstrong support. I wish to reaffirm our commitments and \nthe importance that my country attaches to \nmultilateralism and the purposes and principles of the \nUnited Nations. \n A few days ago, on 24 September, we met in this \nvery Hall to take stock of a global threat which \nprobably is the single most important challenge facing \nour planet today: climate change. Long before it \nbecame fashionable for climate change to be \nmainstreamed into the global agenda, Micronesia was \nin the forefront of those speaking out for action against \nwhat is now recognized as a global emergency. For \nyears, we have argued that, as a small island \ndeveloping State, we are among the most vulnerable, \nand that climate change threatens our very existence. \n We have come a long way in a short time. \nConsider where we were just 15 years ago when the \nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate \nChange (UNFCCC) was signed: climate change was \nthen considered by most as hypothetical and as a threat \nthat was more imagined than real. Now, climate change \nis accepted as a reality and its adverse impact seen as \ninevitable and life-threatening, most especially to small \nisland developing States like Micronesia. The current \nsense of urgency paid to climate change by the world \ncommunity, as evidenced by high-level meetings \naround the world, is truly encouraging, but we are still \nfar from reaching the objectives of the United Nations \nFramework Convention on Climate Change and its \nKyoto Protocol. \n We need to take collective action now and act \nresponsibly to save our planet, while taking into \nconsideration the principle of common but \ndifferentiated responsibility. If our actions are to be \neffective, it is imperative that we pursue the climate \nchange agenda both with a sense of urgency and within \nthe framework of the United Nations. It is important \nthat acknowledgment of the threats of climate change \nbe accompanied by provision of adequate and \nadditional financing by the developed countries to the \nmost vulnerable to assist us in coping with our \nadaptation and mitigation requirements. We therefore \nsupport an appropriate institutional arrangement for the \nAdaptation Fund that is responsive to the needs of \nsmall island developing States. \n Adaptation and mitigation have many faces, one \nof which is the pressing need for small island \ndeveloping States to have increased access to \nrenewable sources of energy, so that we can move \naway from our long dependence on fossil fuels. In that \nregard, I must acknowledge with gratitude the kind \nassistance extended by the Governments of Italy, India \nand others to small island developing States of the \nPacific. \n In March, Micronesia presented its proposal for \nadjusting the Montreal Protocol in order to enhance its \neffectiveness. Although our proposed adjustment was \naimed at improving the effectiveness of the Protocol\u2019s \nozone mandate, Micronesia has a special interest in the \nsignificant climate benefits associated with the \nMontreal Protocol. We welcome the positive outcome \nof the historic nineteenth Meeting of the Parties. We \nhope that other relevant multilateral environmental \nagreements will also make similar efforts to produce \nclimate benefits. \n Two years ago, at the eighth Conference of the \nStates Parties to the Convention on Biological \nDiversity, which was held in Curitiba, Brazil, the \nFederated States of Micronesia and Palau showcased \nthe Micronesia Challenge. A collaborative effort among \nthe island States and territories of the North Pacific, \nthe Micronesia Challenge exemplifies the best of the \nMicronesian spirit of working together towards a \ncommon objective and with shared concerns. In effect, \nthe Micronesia Challenge sets aside for conservation at \nleast 30 per cent of our marine and 20 per cent of \nterrestrial biodiversity across the Micronesian region \nby 2020. \n We are grateful to the regional and international \norganizations and non-governmental organizations that \nhave provided support to realize the objectives of our \ninitiative. We are seeking international partnership and \nassistance to overcome the many obstacles that inhibit \nthe implementation of the Micronesia Challenge. My \nGovernment urges the Global Environment Facility to \njoin with others   such as the Government of \nTurkey   in providing assistance to that end. \n I cannot overemphasize the critical role that \ninformation and communication technologies play in \nthe socio-economic development of developing \ncountries, particularly that of small island developing \nStates. Given that the islands of the Federated States of \nMicronesia are widely dispersed in the north-west \nPacific Ocean, and owing to our limited resources and \nhigh transportation costs, we face many monumental \nchallenges. To confront those challenges, Micronesia \nbelieves that access to affordable and reliable \ninformation and communication technologies offers us \na solution that not only addresses our infrastructure \ndeficiencies but also enables us to meet the aims of the \nMillennium Declaration, the Millennium Development \nGoals (MDGs) and the objectives relating to \ninformation and communication technologies \nemanating from the World Summit on the Information \nSociety.  \n It is a high priority of my country to bring \nbroadband connectivity to the islands. The Economic \nand Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, the \nUnited Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and \nthe United Nations Office of the High Representative \nfor the Least Developed Countries, Landlocked \nDeveloping Countries and Small Island Developing \nStates are collaborating on the development of a \nPacific Ocean connectivity project that will address the \nneed for developing information and communication \ntechnologies infrastructure in the Pacific. We hope that \nthe project will allow our region to establish an \neffective partnership with the international community \nand help produce the kind of benefits that will help \nsupport our sustainable development goals. We will \nnot, however, be able to implement the project without \nthe financial support of the international community. \n I commend the progress on the United Nations \nPacific Presence Initiative, which in the case of my \ncountry is being represented by the United Nations \nPopulation Fund (UNFPA). For the past several years, \nwe have voiced our concern over the lack of an \nadequate United Nations presence in Micronesia to \nassist us in addressing our development challenges. \nThis much-anticipated initiative will be translated into \nreality for Micronesia later this year. It is an initiative \nthat we will not fail to utilize to the fullest. It is \ntherefore essential that, in keeping with the objective \nof the joint office to be situated in my country, the \noriginal intent with regard to staffing must be adhered \nto if the Initiative is going to make a difference, both in \nterms of the effective implementation of United \nNations programmes on the ground and in enhancing \nmy country\u2019s capacity to access its fair share of other \nsources of assistance and services provided by the \nUnited Nations system.  \n As one of the countries identified by UNDP as \nbeing among those more challenged in meeting the \nMillennium Development Goals, my country places \nhigh value on an appropriate level of United Nations \npresence in the joint office located in my country to \nassist us in implementation and effectively utilizing \nexternal assistance towards achieving the MDGs. My \nGovernment commends UNDP and UNFPA for \ndeveloping a plan for the next five-year programme \ncycle that will provide financial assistance to help my \ncountry address issues of poverty and institutional \ncapacity. The joint United Nations office will be an \nimportant vehicle and will certainly play a pivotal role \nin the implementation and achievement of the specific \nobjectives of the programme. We look forward to the \nimplementation of the programme. \n As custodian of a vast ocean area whose bounty \nwe share with the international community, I would be \nremiss if I did not make a few comments on the issue \nof oceans and seas. First, I would like to express our \ngratitude to the Government of Norway and others that \nhave contributed to the trust fund created to assist \nsmall island developing States in claiming their \nextended continental shelves in compliance with the \nUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. We \nare, however, concerned about the obstacles that \ncontinue to inhibit access to the fund. There are far too \nmany institutional barriers that need to be immediately \nrectified to enable use of the fund to allow island \ndeveloping States to fulfil their obligations under the \nConvention on the Law of the Sea. \n As a people, Micronesians are highly dependent \non their marine resources for their livelihood. We take \ngreat interest in the conservation and sustainable use of \nour marine and fisheries resources. We cannot help but \nraise concerns with regard to the issue of collateral \ncatches or discards in commercial fisheries. While they \nmay be considered discards to others, they are a critical \nresource that our people depend upon for their \nsubsistence living. The international community should \nvigorously seek ways to address this issue to minimize \nand eliminate the incidence of catching untargeted fish. \nAnother significant and troubling issue continues to be \nthat of bottom-trawl fishing. It would be tragic to our \nmarine ecosystem and biodiversity if that destructive \nfishing practice were to continue unabated. We renew \nour call, made from this rostrum years ago, for a \nmoratorium on bottom trawling. \n I wish to refer favourably to the long-standing \neffort by Italy and many others to encourage this body \nto take a consensus position against the imposition of \nthe death penalty. Last year, my country signed the \nstatement delivered by Finland on this important \nsubject (see A/61/PV.81). We steadfastly maintain our \nsupport for this cause. \n Turning to the drawn-out discussion over United \nNations reform, I should like to reiterate our concern \nthat the reform of the United Nations will not be \ncomplete without the reform of the Security Council. \nWe also reaffirm our support for Japan and India, from \nthe Asia-Pacific region, as permanent members of the \nCouncil. At the same time, greater representation needs \nto be given to developing countries, including island \nStates and small States. \n While we continue to stand by our position on \nSecurity Council reform, we will support any \ninnovative ideas that can lead to further progress on the \nissue, such as the proposal for an intergovernmental \nnegotiation process. At the sixty-second session of the \nGeneral Assembly, we must continue the process \nalready begun and make every effort to achieve results. \n I should like to close by expressing a sense of \noptimism about what the nations gathered here can \nachieve in advancing the admittedly ambitious agenda \nof the United Nations. Given the challenges that we \nface, it is only through optimism and determination \nover time that we can overcome them. We in the \nFederated States of Micronesia will be here to do our \npart. \n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of the Government and the people of the \nDominican Republic, it is a pleasure to extend our \nwarmest congratulations to Mr. Srgjan Kerim of the \nformer Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia upon his \nrecent election as President of the General Assembly. \nWe would also like to take this opportunity to greet the \nmembers of the General Assembly. \n During the four years following the Millennium \nSummit of 2000, the Dominican Republic went through \na crisis, during which our national currency was \ndevalued by 100 per cent. Our working class had to \ndouble its efforts simply to meet their basic subsistence \nneeds. Drug trafficking and high levels of crime gained \na foothold, and our credibility went down worldwide. \nAccording to the statistics of the World Bank, the \nUnited Nations Development Programme and the \nEconomic Commission for Latin America and the \nCaribbean, more than 1.5 million out of the 9 million \nDominicans sank into the lowest levels of poverty. At \nthat time, we were facing one of the most dramatic \ncrises in the modern history of the Dominican \nRepublic. \n Since we took the reins of administration in 2004, \nthe Dominican Republic has managed to recover the \nconfidence of investors and entrepreneurs. We have \nbeen able to reactivate economic growth. We have been \nable to reduce inflation. We have increased jobs and \nimproved social conditions and quality of life for the \nDominican people. \n However, exactly when we began, just like the \nphoenix rising from its own ashes, a gloomy \ninternational picture threatened to darken our prospects \nfor future growth. In recent weeks, for example, the \nprice of oil on the international market has reached an \nunprecedented rate, and projections point towards \ncontinued increases. These price increases are \nasphyxiating our economies. \n Similarly, in recent times, as a result of changes \non the international stage, free zone companies in the \nDominican Republic, alongside those in Mexico and \nCentral America, have been losing their competitive \nedge to Asian countries. This drop in competitiveness \nhas resulted in the loss of jobs, production stagnation \nand a shortage of new investment. \n Moreover, while the price of oil is rising, and \nwith the prices of goods in the global economy \nfluctuating, we also find ourselves unexpectedly \naffected by price increases for food. All of a sudden we \nare surprised by the news that owing to the elimination \nof export subsidies in Europe, the price of milk has \nincreased on the international market. The same has \noccurred, although for different reasons, with the cost \nof corn, soybeans and wheat as well as with other \nproducts that comprise the basic nutrition of the family. \nBecause of the climbing prices of those products, the \ncost of chicken, turkey, bread and eggs have also risen. \n As will be appreciated, we are facing a dangerous \nsituation which could lead our people towards \nwidespread famine and, consequently, a plunge into \nextreme poverty. Those factors have led to a vicious \ncycle that is spreading throughout the global food \nchain, while, in spite of the plea for free trade, \nproducers in the world\u2019s most powerful countries \nremain protected. As an example, while a United States  \nfarmer has access to state-of-the-art farming \nequipment, the most modern facilities and \ntechnologically proficient staff, that farmer also \nreceives government subsidies of approximately \nUS $750,000 per year. Furthermore, the farmer might \nproduce a pound of corn for a mere 7 cents. \n At the same time, F\u00e9lix David Garc\u00eda Pe\u00f1a, also a \ncorn farmer, who belongs to the Association of Farmers \nin San Juan de la Maguana in the southern part of the \nDominican Republic near our border with Haiti, is \nstruggling alone to make ends meet and to lead a \ndecent life. His farming equipment is outdated. His \ntractor emits clouds of smoke every morning when he \nattempts to turn it on. His facilities are dilapidated. He \nreceives no government subsidies since the \nGovernment is in no financial position to help him, and \nhis production cost for one pound of corn is 12 cents, \nalmost double the production cost of the subsidized \nUnited States farmer. When we asked Felix how we, as \nthe Government, could help him, he stated, \u201cI don\u2019t \nwant anything. All I want is fair trade to be able to sell \nmy corn.\n The fact is that the challenges of globalization are \nhaving a marked impact on countries like the \nDominican Republic. What we are experiencing is the \ninterdependent character of current international \ntrends. What seems to be a distant or remote event \nnevertheless has a direct impact on the daily lives of \nour peoples. \n Another example that illustrates the undeniable \ninterdependence of all nations on earth is climate \nchange. That topic is not new to our discussions in this \nOrganization, but with each year that passes we find \nourselves closer to the predicted disasters. \n In the Dominican Republic, we are already \nexperiencing the impact of climate change in various \nways: an increase in the volatility and frequency of \nfloods, droughts and hurricanes that destroy our \necosystem, our biodiversity and our infrastructures. \nAlso, we are experiencing increased coastal erosion \nand loss of beaches as well as frequent bleaching of \nour coral reefs, thus reducing our marine biodiversity \nand making tourism less attractive. \n Given all those challenges presented by \nglobalization, a country like the Dominican Republic \nasks itself: where is international solidarity, where is \ncooperation between peoples, how are we going to \naddress together all of those challenges which affect \nmost of the peoples of the world? \n The truth is that there cannot be solidarity when \nthere are those in the world who seek to accumulate \nwealth even while others suffer. There cannot be \ncooperation when there are people who think only of \nconducting business without taking into account the \npain and anguish of others. \n The United Nations system was created to \npromote solidarity and cooperation, and it is only fair \nto recognize that there is no other organization at the \nworld level that has the prestige, capability and \nvocation of the Members of this world Organization. \nHowever, this grand forum of humanity, established \nafter the enormous sacrifices of the Second World War, \nmust also reform itself, if it intends to fulfil the ideals \nthat inspired its creation, as enshrined in the Charter at \nthe San Francisco Conference. \n The current structure of the United Nations is no \nlonger adequate today. The structure still corresponds \nto the cold-war period, even though humankind has \nadvanced beyond an era when all events of importance \nwere determined by the rivalry of two super-Powers. \n Now, in the twenty-first century, we in the \nDominican Republic do not truly comprehend why the \nPresident of the World Bank must be an American and \nthe Managing Director of the International Monetary \nFund, a European and why major global decisions are \nthe responsibility of only five countries. \n As one of the founding Members of the United \nNations, the Dominican Republic aspires to a position \non the United Nations Security Council as a \nnon-permanent member. In that position, we would \nstrive to be a voice in favour of the weak, those \nwithout protection or shelter, the forsaken of the world. \nThat is our sole aspiration. The Dominican Republic \nwill uphold, responsibly and with conviction and \ndetermination, the values and principles the \nOrganization has pledged to represent, as a beacon for \npeace, human dignity and the civilized coexistence of \nall inhabitants of the Earth. \n"

This Assembly has recognized the \nEthiopian Millennium as a world event. On 15 June \n2007, it adopted resolution 61/270, designating the \nyear from 12 September 2007 to 11 September 2008 as \nthe year of the Ethiopian Millennium. The Assembly of \nthe African Union also declared the Ethiopian \nMillennium as a part of African heritage and a unique \noccasion. We thank you all for that honour and for that \nexpression of solidarity. \nThose who have witnessed how Ethiopians of all \nwalks of life have received the new Ethiopian \nMillennium could not have missed the new spirit that \nhas been on display in the country. This is a spirit of \nrenewal and commitment to stand in unity for a better \nfuture for the country. The new Millennium was \ngreeted by all Ethiopians with a pledge to do more for \nnational harmony and for durable peace and stability \nand to prevail against the poverty that has been the \nhallmark of the country in recent decades. \n Two thousand years ago, Ethiopia was the home \nof one of the great civilizations of the world, at Aksum. \nA thousand years ago, we could still produce two of the \nworld\u2019s greatest heritage sites. One is the city of Harar, \nthe fourth holiest city of Islam, which by happy \ncoincidence also celebrates its own millennium this \nyear. The other is the city of churches built by Lalibela, \na saint, priest and emperor in the town that still bears \nhis name today. \n But Ethiopia\u2019s fortune began to change, \ncommencing in the second half of the last Millennium. \nThough a survivor of colonialism and a representative \nof the greatness of Africa\u2019s past, Ethiopia also \nunfortunately came to represent and symbolize the \npoverty, dearth and destitution of Africa\u2019s more recent \nhistory. \n Despite the formidable challenges we have faced, \nall of this has begun to change in the last decade. \nHopelessness and frustration growing out of a lack of \nconfidence in the future is no longer an image \nreflecting the reality of Ethiopia. That is perhaps the \nexplanation for the exuberance displayed by all sectors \nof Ethiopian society in welcoming the new \nMillennium. A new and strong national consensus is \nbeing created in Ethiopia today. It is a consensus \naround conviction and the resolve to make the opening \nof our third Millennium a symbol of Ethiopian \nrenaissance. \n That overwhelming optimism displayed by all \nEthiopians at the opening of the new Millennium rests \non a tangible foundation. The political, social and \neconomic realities in Ethiopia have been changing over \nthe past decade. We are making meaningful progress. \nIndeed, we have no shortage of detractors. These are \nnon-Ethiopians determined to scuttle the progress we \nare making in all areas. Their attempts include efforts \nto undermine national unity and to micromanage \nEthiopia\u2019s internal affairs. We have seen this, including \nover the past few days.  \n Despite all this, however, we continue to make \nprogress. For five consecutive years now, our real \ngross domestic product growth rate has averaged over \n10 per cent. Our per capita income growth has \naveraged nearly 8 per cent for the last seven years. \n More tangible perhaps, in terms of the progress \nwe have been making to change the life situation of our \npeople, is the advance we have registered towards \nachieving the Millennium Development Goals. We are \nset to attain universal primary health care by 2010. We \nare well on the way to achieving the goals set for \nreducing child and maternal mortality well prior to \n2015. We have made much progress in combating \nHIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases. We have \nmanaged to halt and stabilize the spread of HIV/AIDS \nand reduce the incidence of malaria. \n What we have been able to achieve in the area of \neducation has been quite remarkable as well. There is \nnow little doubt that we are on our way to achieving \nuniversal primary education by 2015. Primary school \nenrolment at present is 91.6 per cent. Sixteen years \nago, it stood at 19 per cent. We have also begun to \nensure that the education available will, in fact, be \nquality education. \n We have also committed ourselves to \nenvironmental sustainability in a tangible manner. Our \nNew Ethiopian Millennium celebrations and the \npreparations leading to them have underlined practical \nexpressions to this commitment. The slogan \u201cTwo \nTrees for 2000\u201d has been enthusiastically taken up \nthroughout the country. Popular enthusiasm has led to \nthe acceleration of the process that began earlier, \nculminating, after just three or four months, in the \nopening of the New Millennium and the planting of \nclose to a billion trees. This is a process that will \ncontinue throughout the year and beyond. \n Nor are we oblivious to the spectre of global \nwarming and the threat of climate change. Africa is \nexceptionally vulnerable to the effects of climate \nchange: so many of us live on the margins that the \nsmallest difference in climate can mean the difference \nbetween sufficient food and famine, survival and death. \nIt is a global challenge that requires a global response.  \n However, the need for speedy economic \ndevelopment in countries such as Ethiopia, and in \nAfrica as a whole, should not be compromised simply \nin order to reverse dangerous climatic situations for \nwhose creation we have no responsibility. It should, \nnonetheless, be possible, through effective \ninternational collaboration, to ensure that the \ndevelopmental process in countries such as Ethiopia is \nenvironmentally friendly.  \n In this regard, we welcome the proposal of Brazil \nfor a new United Nations conference on the \nenvironment and development to be held in 2012. We \nare also appreciative of the European Union's (EU) \ncommitment to further cut its greenhouse gas \nemissions and to introduce more responsible and \nsustainable energy policies. We endorse the EU's \nsupport for reforming the institutional framework of \nUnited Nations environmental activities. \n The economic and social progress Ethiopia has \nmade over the past decade has, no doubt, been \nunderpinned by the real and concrete advances we have \nmade in building democratic institutions and fostering \nthe rule of law. In this regard as well, we are entering \nour New Millennium with even greater and renewed \ncommitment to deepening the democratic process in \nEthiopia and strengthening a culture of tolerance and \nmutual understanding among our people. There is a \nnew spirit of tolerance, dialogue and inclusiveness and \nof commitment to peace among our people. \n The further democratization of the country and \nthe nurturing of the rule of law is a pledge that every \nEthiopian is making as we enter our New Millennium. \nThis commitment is rooted in the conviction that \ndurable peace in our country and the successful \nachievement of our objectives in the economic and \nsocial spheres can only be viable if we succeed in \nadvancing towards achieving the democratic \naspirations of our people. We urge those who wish to \nmeddle in our affairs to remember that they will be \nheld accountable for their action and that they should \ndesist from seeking to place a trojan horse in our \nsociety. \n It is that same spirit of the New Ethiopian \nMillennium that must guide our foreign policy. We \nhave, over the last decade and a half, worked in good \nfaith for peace in our region. We are more prepared \nnow than ever and, in the spirit of the New \nMillennium, to contribute our share to achieving peace \nand understanding among peoples and countries, most \nparticularly in our own subregion. \n We are indeed fully aware that the basis for the \nrenaissance of Ethiopia, to which we are committed in \nour New Millennium, cannot be limited to what we do \nin Ethiopia alone. To be true to the new spirit and to \nsucceed in the rejuvenation of Ethiopia, we feel we \nhave the obligation to stretch a hand of friendship to all \nof those, near and far, who see wisdom in a positive \nresponse to this gesture. We are well aware of the need \nfor a regional atmosphere conducive to the \nrejuvenation of our region and of ourselves. It is not \njust the absence of conflict and dispute, but the reality \nof peace and cooperation, which is, we know, an \nabsolute necessity. Without this we cannot achieve our \naims, whether in Ethiopia, our region, or in Africa. \n Allow me to express our profound appreciation to \nall those who have helped us make the progress we \nhave made over the past decade. There are those who \nhave been steadfast in their support for our endeavours \nand who have stood with us through thick and thin. We \nare indebted to them. Our obligation is to be true to the \nprinciples that underpin those expressions of solidarity. \n Ethiopia, a founding Member of the United \nNations, will continue to be devoted to multilateralism \nand the fullest cooperation with the United Nations. \nTherefore, as I conclude, I wish to reiterate, once \nagain, our readiness to cooperate fully, and without \nreserve, with our Secretary-General in all areas where \nour contribution is needed and to seek friendship with \nall nations in the spirit of our New Millennium. \n"

        "file_text": "At the outset, I would like to congratulate \nthe President on his election as President of the \nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-second session. I am \nconfident that, thanks to his experience and wisdom, he \nwill lead the work of this forum to the best results. I \nwould also like to take this opportunity to express our \nsatisfaction with the manner in which Sheikha Haya \nRashed Al-Khalifa conducted the deliberations of the \nGeneral Assembly at its previous session and the \nefforts she made for United Nations reform and, with \nregard to several controversial issues, to arrive at \nsolutions acceptable to all. I also wish to express our \ngratitude for the efforts exerted by His Excellency \nMr. Ban Ki-moon, since his appointment as Secretary-\nGeneral, to implement the resolutions of the United \nNations and to achieve the purposes of the Charter. \n The reform of the United Nations has been the \ncentral issue in our deliberations in the General \nAssembly and in a number of other forums over the \npast two years. We were able to move forward towards \nachieving our goals on some aspects of the reform \nprocess. However, there is still a long way to go, \nespecially in the absence of real progress towards \nreforming the Security Council and enhancing the role \nof the General Assembly. \n That issue has been the subject of intensive \nconsultations in which many ideas were put forward, \nsome of which were realistic and based on the \nprinciples of equal sovereignty for all nations and \nequitable geographical representation. Other ideas, \nhowever, involved consolidating the control of the \npowerful States over the United Nations bodies and the \nconcept that those with privileges in the Security \nCouncil should maintain those privileges and reject any \nactive role for other actors in that respect. That latter \nattitude cannot lead to any true reform contributing to \nthe realization of the purposes embodied in the Charter \nof the United Nations. \n A realistic assessment of progress made in the \nprocess of United Nations reform, especially in light of \nthe impasse in negotiations regarding Security Council \nreform, leads us to the conviction that there is an \nurgent need for a new world summit conference that \nwould push forward the reform process and bring to a \nconclusion the work that we began two years ago. \n In order to achieve this, Libya calls, from this \npodium, for a high-level summit meeting to be held at \nthe United Nations in Geneva within the framework of \nthe sixty-third session of the General Assembly, in \n2008. Such a meeting would be devoted to the reform \nprocess of the United Nations and the expansion of the \nSecurity Council. Holding such an important meeting \nin Geneva, a city that lies at the centre of the world, \nwould provide the opportunity for all world leaders to \nattend, to present constructive proposals and to \nparticipate in decision-making regarding this thorny \nissue that concerns the entire world. \n True reform of the United Nations means putting \ndecision-making powers in the hands of all of its \nMembers, that is to say, in the hands of the General \nAssembly, where all countries have equal vote. The \nSecurity Council would thus become an instrument for \nimplementing General Assembly resolutions and we \nwould overcome the obstacles caused by the veto, \nwhich puts international decision-making power in the \nhands of the permanent members of the Security \nCouncil and greatly encourages selectivity and double \nstandards in dealing with international problems. \n In our efforts to reform the Security Council, we \nmust consider a new formula for permanent \nmembership in which membership would be awarded \nto geographical groups and not to specific countries. In \nthis regard, we demand that the African Union   since \nAfrica is the only continent which has no \nrepresentative among the permanent members   be \ngranted permanent membership in the Security Council \nwith all the privileges enjoyed by other permanent \nmembers. \n While we encourage the current negotiations \nregarding reform of the Security Council, we stress the \nfact that Libya adheres to the Common African \nPosition, issued at the fifth African Union Summit, \nheld in Sirte on 4 and 5 July 2005. This position was \nconfirmed at subsequent African Union summit \nconferences. It calls for the African continent to be \ngranted five non-permanent seats and two permanent \nseats with all the privileges that other permanent \nmembers enjoy, including the right of veto. \n Libya seeks the support of all Member States for \na seat on the Security Council so that it may continue \nto carry out its efforts to achieve the objectives of the \nUnited Nations, building on its experience of non-\npermanent membership in 1976 and 1977. Libya has \ntherefore submitted its candidature for non-permanent \nmembership for the coming period 2008-2009. This \ncandidature enjoys the support of the African Union as \nexpressed in its resolution EX.CL/DEC. 308 (IX) \nissued in Banjul on 29 June 2007, of the Organization \nof the Islamic Conference in its resolution ORG 33/2 \nissued in Baku on 21 June 2006 and of the Arab \nLeague in its resolution on 6 September 2006. \n Libya\u2019s firm commitment to the purposes and \nprinciples of the United Nations Charter, its notable \ncontribution to international peace and security and its \nsupport for development, especially in Africa, \ndemonstrate that Libya is highly qualified for \nmembership in the Security Council. \n As a member of the Council, Libya would strive \nto emphasize the central role played by the United \nNations in achieving international peace and security; \nto strengthen respect for international law and the \nprovisions of the United Nations Charter; to enhance \npluralism in international relations through the United \nNations; to strengthen cooperation between the United \nNations and regional organizations in solving \ninternational problems; to contribute to United Nations \nreform; to work to increase cooperation and \ncoordination between the Security Council and the \nother organs of the United Nations, particularly the \nGeneral Assembly; to encourage swift and effective \ninternational cooperation and coordination in disaster \nmanagement and in the protection of human rights; to \ncontribute to the creation of permanent solutions to \ninternational problems based on justice, equity, and \nrespect for the principles of international law and to \nencourage further cooperation between the United \nNations and the African Union in the areas of conflict \nresolution, consolidation of peace and support for \ndevelopment in Africa. \n Libya strongly believes in the objectives of the \nUnited Nations and consistently meets its obligations \nto the Organization. Among Member States, Libya was \nthe second-largest African contributor to the United \nNations budget and to the budget of peacekeeping \noperations in the biennium 2004-2006. Furthermore, \nLibya provides a large share of voluntary contributions \nto serve the goals of the United Nations. \n Moreover, Libya is one of the countries that have \nmost often resorted to the mechanisms of the United \nNations to resolve international disagreements. For \nexample, it resorted to the International Court of \nJustice to resolve its border problems with Chad, \nTunisia and Malta and has accepted and implemented \nthe rulings of the Court. \n Libya has been a key mediator in the resolution \nof a number of conflicts and disputes, especially in \nAfrica, and has dispatched peacekeeping forces to the \nCentral African Republic, monitored the border \nbetween Chad and the Sudan and taken part in the \nUnited Nations mission in Darfur. Libya has also \nbegun to nominate personnel from the Libyan police \nforce to serve in United Nations missions in a number \nof African places. \n Libya has established partnerships with a number \nof countries, in the field of development, particularly \nin Africa. Additionally, in cooperation with the Food \nand Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, \nLibya is implementing numerous projects that provide \nfood in a number of African and Arab States. \n In cooperation with Cuba and Nigeria, Libya \nestablished the South-South Programme for health care \nin Africa and, in 2006, launched the Gaddafi \nProgramme for African women, children and young \npeople, which provides health care and educational \nservices in Africa. \n Libya has provided humanitarian aid to numerous \ncountries in order to alleviate the effects of disasters. \nRecipient countries have included Niger, Chad, the \nSudan, Somalia, Palestine, Indonesia, Pakistan and \nMauritania. Libya has also provided substantial aid to \nseveral African countries to combat desert locusts. \n In the field of disarmament, Libya believes that \ncomprehensive and complete disarmament, beginning \nwith the elimination of weapons of mass destruction \n(WMDs), is an essential prerequisite for the \nconsolidation of international peace and security. For \nthis reason, Libya initiated its voluntary abandonment \nof all programmes related to WMDs and their means of \ndelivery. Libya hopes that all nations that possess such \nweapons or related programmes will follow its \nexemplary behaviour. \n International cooperation, under the auspices of \nthe United Nations, has achieved good results in the \nfight against terrorism. However, concentrating on the \nfight against this phenomenon, while ignoring its root \ncauses, will not bring terrorism to an end. Libya was \namong the first countries that called for coordination of \ninternational efforts to fight global terrorism. Since \n1992, Libya has called for a special session of the \nGeneral Assembly to study this phenomenon and to \ntake the necessary measures to combat it by eradicating \nits root causes. \n We believe that the time has come to heed this \ncall and establish a precise definition of terrorism that \nwould protect human rights and halt the practice of \nconfusing terrorism with the legitimate right of people \nto fight against foreign occupation and to exercise self-\ndetermination and attain independence. \n Ending terrorism will require practical measures \nto eliminate its root causes, including effective action \nto promote human rights for all peoples, putting a stop \nto acts of aggression and the occupation of the land of \nothers, fighting poverty and encouraging democracy. \n Foreign occupation is the worst form of \nterrorism, because occupation forces subject entire \npeoples to measures which violate the most basic \nprinciples of human rights and commit daily crimes \nagainst those peoples in order to maintain their \noccupation. In our campaign to fight terrorism, it is \nimperative that we coordinate our efforts to finally put \nan end to foreign occupation, enable peoples to \nexercise their right to self-determination and prevent \ninterference in internal affairs.  \n We urgently need to implement the pledges that \nwe adopted in the Millennium Declaration, the Doha \nDeclaration and the outcomes of the Monterrey and \nJohannesburg conferences so that we can make ideal \nuse of our planet\u2019s resources, end conflict, poverty, \nilliteracy and disease, provide all people with safe \ndrinking water, safeguard the environment and achieve \nsustainable development.  \n It falls upon the shoulders of the United Nations, \nin particular the Economic and Social Council, to \nestablish international partnerships for development \nwhich can achieve the Millennium Development Goals. \nSuch partnerships should facilitate dialogue between \nNorth and South on the basis of respect for \nsovereignty, equality and sharing of benefits, and \nshould ensure that we reach the agreed goal of \ndevoting 0.7 per cent of the developed countries\u2019 gross \nnational income to official development assistance \n(ODA) to developing countries. Such partnerships must \nlikewise ensure the appropriate application of all \nmultilateral free trade principles and must strengthen \nWorld Trade Organization measures regarding \npreferential treatment for developing countries, \nincluding making it easier for developing countries to \njoin that organization.  \n Countries with a colonial past bear the largest \nshare of responsibility to provide aid to developing \ncountries and to compensate them for the damage they \nsuffered during the colonial era. Similarly, countries \nthat waged war on the territories of other countries \nhave a responsibility to remove the mines, unexploded \nordnance and explosive remnants of war they left in \nthose countries. They must provide the necessary maps, \nequipment and technical know-how to reclaim and \nrehabilitate damaged land in those developing \ncountries.  \n I call upon all Member States to aid the African \nUnion in its efforts to ensure that all African countries \nachieve the Millennium Development Goals.  \n The Palestinian people have lived in great misery \nfor more than half a century, since their land was \nseized. More than half of them were displaced to \nvarious parts of the world and those who remain have \nbeen subjected to a bloody and vicious Israeli \noccupation and to systematic violations of international \nhumanitarian law: houses are demolished, lands are \nconfiscated and Palestinian agricultural land is \nbulldozed. Under siege and denied food and medicine, \ninhabitants are expelled and unarmed citizens killed \nwhile the building of an apartheid wall continues. The \noppression to which the Palestinian people are \nsubjected and the failure of the United Nations to \nprotect them and to aid them in attaining their rights  \nthe right of return, the right to self-determination and \nthe right to establish an independent State on all \nPalestinian land   are factors that prevent the \nrestoration of peace and security in the region. It is \ntime to address the issue of Palestine more seriously \nand to refrain from attempts to impose a fait accompli \non the Palestinian people, depriving them of their \nlegitimate rights.  \n The tragedy that has befallen brotherly Iraq and \nthat has resulted in hundreds of thousands of Iraqi \ndeaths, injuries and refugees, requires an urgent United \nNations initiative to stop the bleeding, resolve the \ncrisis, ensure the withdrawal of the occupation forces, \nrestore Iraq\u2019s stability and sovereignty, maintain Iraq\u2019s \nterritorial integrity and empower the Iraqis to control \ntheir own resources and freely decide their own \ndestiny, while enabling all citizens to participate in the \nadministration of their country without the \nmarginalization of any group by any other group, so \nthat peace, security and prosperity may prevail in that \ncountry.  \n"

        "file_text": "I congratulate \nthe Secretary-General on his assumption of such a high \noffice within the international system. I welcome his \ndecision to encourage high-level debate on the \nextremely grave issue of climate change. It is most \nappropriate that that discussion take place here at the \nUnited Nations.  \n Let us not delude ourselves. If the groundwork of \nglobal development is not rebuilt, the risks of \nunprecedented environmental and human catastrophe \nwill grow. We must overcome the apparently pragmatic \nand sophisticated notion   which is actually \nanachronistic, predatory and senseless   that profits \nand wealth can grow forever, at any cost. There are \nprices that humanity cannot afford to pay at the risk of \ndestroying the material and spiritual foundations of our \ncollective existence   at the risk of self-destruction. \nThe preservation of life must prevail over mindless \ngreed. \n The world will not correct its irresponsible \nrelationship with nature, however, until we change the \nway development relates to social justice. If we want to \nsalvage our common heritage, a new and more \nbalanced distribution of wealth is needed, both \ninternationally and within each country. Social equity \nis our best weapon against the planet\u2019s degradation. \nEach one of us must do our part. It is unacceptable that \nthe cost of the irresponsibility of a privileged few be \nshouldered by the dispossessed of the Earth. \n The most highly industrialized countries can and \nmust set the example. Full compliance with their \ncommitments under the Kyoto Protocol is \nindispensable. That is not enough, however. We need to \nset more ambitious goals for 2012 onwards and we \nmust take strong action to ensure universal accession to \nthe Protocol. Developing countries must also help in \ncombating climate change. We need clear national \nstrategies to hold Governments accountable to their \npeoples. \n Brazil will soon launch its own national plan to \ncombat climate change. The Amazon forest is one of \nthe areas most vulnerable to global warming, but the \nthreats cover all continents. They range from greater \ndesertification to the outright disappearance of \nterritories or even of entire countries lost to rising sea \nlevels. Brazil has undertaken major efforts to minimize \nthe impact of climate change. Suffice it to say that, in \nrecent years, we have halved the rate of deforestation \nin the Amazon region. \n Results like that should come as no surprise. \nBrazil will under no circumstance abdicate either its \nsovereignty or its responsibilities in the Amazon. Our \nrecent achievements derive from an increasing \npresence of the Brazilian State in the region, fostering \nsustainable development with economic, social, \neducational and cultural benefits for its more than \n20 million inhabitants. \n I am convinced that our experience can enrich \nsimilar endeavours in other countries. In Nairobi, \nBrazil proposed the adoption of economic and financial \nincentives to reduce deforestation on a global scale. We \nmust also increase South-South cooperation while \npromoting innovative modalities of joint action with \ndeveloped countries. That is how we can materialize \nthe principle of shared but differentiated \nresponsibilities. \n It is very important to adopt an integrated \npolitical approach to the environmental agenda as a \nwhole. Brazil hosted the United Nations Conference on \nEnvironment and Development   the Earth Summit. \nWe need to review what has been achieved since then, \nand set a new course of action. I therefore propose that \nwe hold a new Conference, in 2012, the \u201cRio +20\u201d \nConference to be hosted by Brazil. \n We will not overcome the terrible impacts of \nclimate change until humanity changes its patterns of \nenergy production and consumption. The world \nurgently needs to develop a new energy matrix in \nwhich bio-fuels will play a vital role. Bio-fuels \nsignificantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions. With its \nincreased and more efficient use of ethanol, Brazil has \nkept 644 million tons of carbon dioxide from being \nemitted into the atmosphere over the past 30 years. \n Bio-fuels can be much more than a clean-energy \nalternative. Ethanol and bio-diesel can open up \nexcellent opportunities for over 100 poor and \ndeveloping countries in Latin America, Asia and, \nespecially, Africa. They can enhance energy autonomy, \nwithout costly investments. They can create jobs and \nincome and promote family farming. They can help \nbalance trade deficits by reducing imports and \ngenerating surplus exportable crops. \n Brazil\u2019s experience over three decades has shown \nthat bio-fuel production does not affect food security. \nSugarcane crops cover just 1 per cent of the country\u2019s \narable land, and yields continue to rise. People do not \ngo hungry around the world for lack of food, but rather \nfor lack of income, which afflicts almost 1 billion men, \nwomen and children. \n It is entirely possible to combine bio-fuels with \nenvironmental protection and food production. We will \nensure that bio-fuel production complies with all social \nand environmental guarantees. Our Government has \ndecided to implement a complete agro-ecological \nzoning of the country in order to identify farmland best \nsuited to producing bio-fuels. Brazilian bio-fuels will \nreach the world market with a seal of assurance for \ntheir social, labour and environmental quality. \n In 2008, Brazil is set to host an international \nconference on bio-fuels that will lay the foundations \nfor wide-ranging global cooperation. I hereby invite all \ncountries to participate. \n Sustainable development is not just an \nenvironmental issue; it is also a social challenge. We \nare making Brazil less unequal and more dynamic. The \ncountry is growing again, creating jobs and distributing \nincome. This time, opportunities are being created for \nall. We are paying off a centuries-old social debt, while \nat the same time investing heavily in quality education, \nscience and technology.  \n We have honoured our commitment to \u201czero \nhunger\u201d by sweeping away that scourge from the lives \nof over 45 million people. We achieved the first \nMillennium Development Goal 10 years ahead of \nschedule, cutting extreme poverty in our country by \nmore than half. Fighting hunger and poverty should be \nthe concern of all peoples. A global society held back \nby growing income disparities is simply not viable. \nThere will be no lasting peace if we do not \nprogressively reduce inequality. \n In 2004, we launched the global Action against \nHunger and Poverty. Early results are encouraging, \nparticularly the creation of the International Drug \nPurchase Facility (UNITAID). UNITAID has already \nachieved 45-per-cent price cuts in drugs used against \nAIDS, malaria and tuberculosis for the poorest \ncountries of Africa. The time has come for us to give it \na new push. We cannot allow ideas that so mobilized \nour countries to fade because of bureaucratic inertia. \n However, the final defeat of poverty demands \nmore than international solidarity. It depends above all \non new economic relations that no longer penalize poor \ncountries. The Doha Round of the World Trade \nOrganization should promote a true pact for \ndevelopment by adopting fair and balanced rules for \ninternational trade. Farm subsidies that make the rich \nricher and the poor poorer are no longer acceptable. We \ncannot accept agricultural protectionism that \nperpetuates dependency and underdevelopment. Brazil \nwill spare no effort for a successful conclusion of those \nnegotiations, which must, above all, benefit the poorest \ncountries. \n Building a new international order is no \nrhetorical turn of phrase; it is a matter of common \nsense. Brazil is proud of its contribution to South \nAmerican integration, particularly through the \nCommon Market of the South. We are working to bring \ntogether peoples and regions. We seek to enhance \npolitical dialogue and economic links with the Arab \nworld, Africa and Asia, and we do so without \nsacrificing our traditional partners. Brazil has set up an \ninnovative cooperation mechanism with India and \nSouth Africa. Together we are working on specific \nprojects to help in various countries, including Haiti \nand Guinea-Bissau. \n We all agree on the need for increased \nparticipation by developing countries in the major \ninternational decision-making bodies, in particular the \nSecurity Council. The time has come to move from \nwords to action. We appreciate recent proposals by \nPresident Sarkozy to reform the Security Council, with \nthe inclusion of developing nations. A review of \ndecision-making processes within international \nfinancial institutions is also required. \n The United Nations is our best tool to deal with \ntoday\u2019s international challenges. It is through \nmultilateral diplomacy that we find the way to \nfostering peace and development. Brazil\u2019s role \nalongside other Latin America and Caribbean nations \nin the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti \nhighlights our efforts to strengthen multilateral \ninstitutions. In Haiti, we are showing that peace and \nstability are built with democracy and social \ndevelopment. \n Walking into this building, representatives to the \nUnited Nations can admire a work of art that Brazil \npresented to the United Nations 50 years ago. I am \nreferring to the murals that portray war and peace \npainted by a great Brazilian artist, C\u00e2ndido Portinari. \nThe suffering so expressively portrayed in the mural \ndepicting war brings to mind the United Nations \ncrucial responsibility in containing the risk of armed \nconflict. The second mural reminds us that peace is \nmuch more than the absence of war. It evokes well-\nbeing, health and harmonious coexistence with nature. \nIt calls for social justice, freedom and overcoming the \nscourges of hunger and poverty. It is not by mere \nchance that those who enter the building face the mural \nportraying war, while those who leave see the mural \ndepicting peace. The artist\u2019s message is simple but \npowerful: transforming suffering into hope, and war \ninto peace, is the essence of the United Nations \nmission. Brazil will continue to work to realize those \nhigh expectations. \n"

        "file_text": "We are at the middle \nof the road, halfway towards the 2015 deadline for \nachieving the Millennium Development Goals. Eight \nyears are left   is that much? Are we keeping the \npace? Measured against the history of the human race \nit is but a sand particle in an hourglass. But measured \nagainst the hopes and expectations of millions of \npeople living in abject poverty with no access to clean \nwater, for children with little prospect of gaining an \neducation and reaching their full potential in life, for \nwomen dying in childbirth, for infants who will never \nlearn how to walk or talk or read and write, who are \ntaken away by preventable diseases   that surely \namounts to much more than a sand particle. \n By 2015 our peoples will judge whether the \npledges and commitments made by their leaders and \nthe international community as a whole were genuine. \nThey shall ascertain whether the conferences and \nillustrious gatherings of the world leaders stand for \nactual deeds or whether they simply equal empty words \nand hollow promises. The eight years towards 2015 are \nthus a litmus test of our credibility. To pass the test or \nnot is, therefore, upon us. We must deliver what we \npledged. We must achieve the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) and other internationally \nagreed development goals. We must exert our best \nefforts individually as nations and we must exert them \ncollectively as the international community. \n In order to do this, we must now look back at our \nindividual progress so far. We must take stock of what \nhas already been achieved and what is yet to be done to \nachieve the Goals on time. My country, Mongolia, is \nintimately monitoring its own progress on the path \ntowards achieving the MDGs. The second national \nreport on MDG implementation in Mongolia has only \nrecently been considered by the national Government. \n Implementation of the MDGs is about meeting \nthe basic needs of the people and securing their social \nand personal welfare, and my Government is very \nserious about delivering them for our people. \nUnfortunately, despite the considerable efforts made, \nsuccess is still far from assured on a number of goals \nand, first and foremost, on the goal to halve poverty. \n On a global scale, the MDG progress report of \n2007 revealed the same mixed picture. The report made \na strong case for concerted additional action to be \ntaken immediately and sustained until 2015 if the \nworld is to attain the MDGs. It argued that the lack of \nany significant increase in official development \nassistance since 2004 makes it impossible, even for \nwell-governed countries, to meet the MDGs. \n Against that backdrop, I lend my full backing and \nsupport to the proposal of the President of the General \nAssembly to have an MDG leaders\u2019 meeting here at the \nUnited Nations. Such a meeting must, in our view, not \nonly serve as a midterm review mechanism, but also \ncoin concrete proposals and recommendations on the \nway forward. \n We are fully aware of our primary responsibility \nfor our own development, yet there are factors well \nbeyond our control that impede progress, and climate \nchange figures prominently among them. Climate \nchange is definitely no longer a subject of pure \nscientific and academic discourse. Nations large and \nsmall, coastal and landlocked alike, are feeling its \neffects on their economies and the livelihoods of their \npeoples. The recent report of the Intergovernmental \nPanel on Climate Change indicated that poor countries \nwill be the hardest hit by climate change, in spite of the \nfact that they contribute the least to the phenomenon. Is \nthat fair? \n The contribution of my country to global \nwarming is negligible at best, yet Mongolia is severely \naffected by the negative consequences of climate \nchange. To give but a few examples, over the past 60 \nyears the average temperature in Mongolia has risen by \nalmost 2\u00b0C, compared to a rise in the global mean \ntemperature of about 1\u00b0C over the last century. Some \n80 per cent of the land surface has been degraded, \n mostly by wind erosion combined with human \nactivities, including mining and overgrazing by \nlivestock. Desertification is rampant. Pastures that \nsupport the semi-nomadic lifestyle of Mongols have \ndecreased and become more fragile. Over the past 40 \nyears, soil fertility has decreased by a factor of two to \nthree. The country has been subject to the ever-more \nfrequent occurrence of natural disasters, such as \ndrought and dzud   cold winters with heavy  \nsnowfalls   in recent years, which have had a severe \nimpact on the pastoral economy of the country. \n Fair or not, no country can stand aside or afford \ninaction in the face of such truly global challenges like \nclimate change. We all must carry our share of the \ncommon endeavour, yet it is only natural that those \nwho contribute the most to global warming bear the \nbulk of the burden. Hence, the industrialized countries \nshould fulfil their commitments to taking the lead in \nreducing their greenhouse gas emissions and to \nproviding financial resources and transferring clean \ntechnologies to developing countries. \n The comprehensive implementation of the United \nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change \n(UNFCCC) and the Kyoto Protocol remains a priority \neven as the international community embarks on the \nroad towards shaping the post-Kyoto framework. The \npost-Kyoto framework should be flexible and diverse, \ntaking into consideration circumstances in each \ncountry. It must include all the major emitters and \nachieve compatibility between environmental \nprotection and economic growth by utilizing advances \nin technologies to the greatest extent possible. \n The United Nations Climate Change Conference \nto be held in Bali in December will have a crucial role \nin shaping such a future framework. We must seize the \nopportunity and fully utilize the current session of the \nGeneral Assembly to build the groundwork for the Bali \nConference. \n Regional and subregional mechanisms should \nalso be mobilized as complementary and \nsupplementary instruments to global efforts. Mongolia, \na North-East Asian country, attaches particular \nimportance to developing environmental cooperation \nmechanisms in the subregion, as dust and sand storms \noriginating in the expanding Gobi desert have become \na familiar phenomenon for inhabitants of Beijing, \nSeoul, Tokyo and beyond. \n North-East Asia is one of the most dynamic and \ndiverse regions of the world. It contains some of the \nworld\u2019s major economic powerhouses, such as China, \nJapan, the Republic of Korea and the Russian \nFederation, along with the smaller and more vulnerable \neconomies of Mongolia and the Democratic People\u2019s \nRepublic of Korea. The subregion is also home to a \nquarter of the world\u2019s population. The sheer size and \ndiversity of the subregion mean that climate change \nmanifestations are wide-ranging, yet intimately felt in \neach and every country. \n Mongolia has therefore come up with an initiative \nto hold a North-East Asian summit on climate change \nin the nearest future. We hope that such a high-level \nevent will achieve a breakthrough in regional \ncooperation on climate change and serve as a tangible \ncontribution to global efforts. \n Nationally, Mongolia has been making \ncontinuous efforts to address the challenges posed by \nclimate change by appropriately improving its legal \nenvironment and actively implementing various \nprogrammes and projects. In 1996, a national action \nplan to combat desertification was adopted. In 1999, \nwe established a national climate change committee \nentrusted with formulating national policy on \nadaptation to climate change and reduction of \ngreenhouse gases, preparing reports on national \ngreenhouse gas inventories, policies and measures. In \n2000, the Government of Mongolia launched its \nnational action programme on climate change aimed \nnot only at meeting UNFCCC obligations, but also at \nsetting priorities for action and integrating climate \nchange concerns into other national and sectoral \ndevelopment plans and programmes. \n Furthermore, our MDG-based national \ndevelopment strategy, the draft of which was recently \nsubmitted to Parliament for its consideration and \napproval, contains a separate chapter on environmental \npolicy. It identifies the protection of nature and the \nenvironment, the reasonable use of natural resources, \nand climate change concerns among national priority \ngoals. The draft strategy is expected to be approved by \nParliament this autumn. \n On a more practical side, in 2005 my Government \nlaunched a major programme on agroforestry \ndevelopment, entitled Green Belt, in an attempt to \ncombat desertification, stop sand movement, and  \nreduce dust and sand storms. Upon its completion, a \ngreat green wall will extend for 2,500 kilometres from \nthe East to the West of the country, shielding the \nsteppes from the Gobi desert. \n In the energy sector, which is mostly based on \nfossil fuels, particularly coal, the Government is \nmaking continued efforts to introduce an alternative or \nrenewable source of energy. To that effect, the \nconstruction of hydro-power plants has started, along \nwith the implementation of the 100,000 Solar Ger \nprogramme. \n The landlocked geographical situation of my \ncountry is an additional hurdle for our development \nefforts and MDG implementation. Indeed, our lack of \nterritorial access to the sea, remoteness from world \nmarkets, and subsequent high transportation costs and \nundue delays are major impediments to the trade of \nlandlocked developing countries. Higher trade costs \nreduce a country\u2019s welfare and inhibit economic \ngrowth by making imports expensive and exports \nuncompetitive. \n Hence, Mongolia, together with other like-\nminded countries, has endeavoured to raise the \nawareness of the international community of the need \nfor support and assistance for land-locked developing \ncountries and to promote the common position and \ninterests of the group at both the United Nations and \nthe World Trade Organization. Here, I wish to highlight \nthe importance of the meeting of trade ministers of \nland-locked developing countries and the thematic \nmeeting of land-locked developing countries and their \ntransit neighbours on trade and trade facilitation issues, \nheld last month in Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of \nMongolia, for setting the priorities of the group in the \ncontext of the Doha Round of multilateral trade \nnegotiations and in the lead-up to the midterm review \nof the Almaty Programme of Action. \n Security concerns continue to affect global \ndevelopment. Despite our best efforts, the world \naround us is still not a safe place for many. Millions \nsuffer on a daily basis from hunger, illness, insecurity \nand the threat of violence. Thousands and thousands \nperish in sectarian violence, terrorist attacks and \ninternal conflicts, with thousands more having fled \nviolence, thus augmenting the growing ranks of \nrefugees and internally displaced persons. All this \ninvariably takes a heavy toll on the development \naspirations of the affected countries. \n Many of us come from countries not ravaged by \nconflicts or from regions that lie thousands of miles \nfrom conflict zones, yet, in this age of globalization, \nnone of us remains unaffected. Record-setting oil \nprices triggered by the situation in the Middle East \nhave a profound impact on the world economy. Small, \nvulnerable and commodity-dependent economies, such \nas that of Mongolia, are hit hardest, along with other \noil-importing developing countries. However, it is \nordinary people in the Middle East who bear the brunt \nof the suffering. The international community must \ndeliver a promise of peace and security to the peoples \nof Iraq, Israel, Palestine, Darfur and other conflict \nzones. \n We must continue our global fight against \nterrorism, with the United Nations at the helm of that \ncollective effort. The recent hostage crisis in \nAfghanistan came as a sobering reminder of the threat \nstill posed by the Taliban. It proved once again that \nterrorists prey on those who cannot fight back. Thus, it \nis our solemn duty to offer protection to those who \ncannot defend themselves. \n Mongolia, a country with internationally \nrecognized nuclear-weapon-free status, is pleased with \nthe progress achieved in the six-party talks on the \ndenuclearization of the Korean peninsula, the latest \nround of which took place last week in Beijing. As its \ncontribution to advancing the six-party talks, on 4 and \n5 September Mongolia hosted a bilateral working \ngroup session on the normalization of relations \nbetween Japan and the Democratic People\u2019s Republic \nof Korea this year, and stands ready to continue such \nefforts in the future. \n Mongolia is heartened at the news about the \nforthcoming inter-Korean summit meeting, to start \ntomorrow. We are hopeful that it will contribute to the \ncause of bringing about peace, security, and eventually \na peaceful reunification of the Korean peninsula. In \nlight of the promising political dynamics in the \nsubregion, Mongolia is optimistic that its early call for \na multilateral security cooperation mechanism in \nNorth-East Asia will gain support in the subregion and \nbeyond. \n With scores of countries having embarked in \nrecent decades on a path towards establishing modern \nand functioning democratic societies built upon the \nprinciples of pluralism, respect for human rights, \nfreedom of the press and democratic governance, \ndemocracy has been firmly established as a truly \nuniversal value. \n We in Mongolia believe that democracy is the \nbest possible environment for sustained economic \ngrowth. Democracy and respect for human rights have \nbeen, in our view, inherently woven into the MDGs. \nProceeding from that premise, in 2005 Mongolia was \nthe first country to adopt a ninth MDG on \nstrengthening human rights and fostering democratic \ngovernance. \n We are proud of its successful democratic \ntransition, with major gains in the political, economic, \nsocial and spiritual areas of our societal life. Yet, as a \nyoung democracy, my country is also intimately aware \nof the complex challenges faced by countries in \ntransition. We believe in international cooperation and \nsupport for democratization efforts. In that regard, \nMongolia applauds the increased role of the United \nNations in fostering democracy and good governance, \nnot only through assistance in holding credible \nelections, but through a wide range of activities to \npromote democratic institutions and practices. The \nUnited Nations Democracy Fund, which has already \nfunded over 100 projects around the globe, is a notable \nexample. The United Nations has also been an \nimportant stakeholder in the success of the new or \nrestored democracies process. \n Global challenges require global approaches, and \nno other body is better equipped to serve as the \nsteering house of the collective efforts of the \ninternational community than the United Nations. The \nUnited Nations is the world\u2019s most universal, \nlegitimate and authoritative organization. It is a true \npolitical centre of global cooperation. It gives us \nlegitimacy. It gives us legality. \n Our world Organization has embarked on a \nprocess of reform in order to better respond to the \nmultifaceted challenges, both existing and emerging, in \nthis era of rapid globalization and its ensuing growing \ncomplexities. Progress has been made in several reform \nareas, yet greater efforts, combined with stronger \npolitical will, are needed to follow through with \nreforms related especially to the system-wide \ncoherence of the United Nations and the Security \nCouncil. Mongolia has full confidence in Secretary-\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon and supports his efforts aimed at \nimproving the management, efficiency and internal \ncohesion of the United Nations system. \n Our success as a community of nations in \ntackling the challenges of climate change, achieving \nthe MDGs and other internationally agreed \ndevelopment goals, countering terrorism, preventing \nconflicts, promoting democracy and human rights, and \neffectively addressing other pressing issues of today \nlargely depends on the success of that transformation. \n The clock is ticking. We cannot afford to pursue \nbusiness as usual. If we are to honour, in good faith \nand on time, the pledges and commitments we made to \nour peoples, we must redouble our concerted efforts to \nwin this historic race. \n"

        "file_text": "At the  outset, it gives me pleasure to extend to the President \nand his friendly country, the former Yugoslav Republic \nof Macedonia, my country\u2019s warmest congratulations \non Mr. Kerim\u2019s assumption of the presidency of the \nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-second session. We are \nconfident that his vast diplomatic experience will help \nus to achieve desired objectives and will steer the \nAssembly to a successful conclusion. Let me also pay \ntribute to his predecessor, Sheikha Haya Al-Khalifa, \nfrom the sisterly Kingdom of Bahrain, for the optimal \nmanner in which she so ably and wisely conducted the \nwork of the General Assembly at its sixty-first session. \n I would also like to take this opportunity to \ncongratulate Mr. Ban Ki-moon on his appointment as \nSecretary-General of the United Nations. We are \nconfident that he will render valuable services to this \nOrganization, with his vast experience in both political \nand diplomatic fields. I assure him of my delegation\u2019s \nreadiness to offer all the necessary assistance to help \nhim discharge his responsibilities. We wish him every \nsuccess. I would like also to commend Mr. Kofi Annan \nfor all the efforts he made to promote the work of this \nOrganization during his tenure as Secretary-General. \n The annual session of the General Assembly \nprovides us with the opportunity to address various \nregional and international issues and to express our \nconcerns and interests. I would like to point out here \nthat the efforts exerted by the United Nations have \nhelped us to understand the process of addressing many \ninternational problems, including the important \nquestion of the Middle East. \n Despite the fact that efforts made to address the \nsituations in Palestine, Iraq, Darfur, Somalia and other \nareas have so far failed to provide conclusive solutions, \nthey are nevertheless positive indications demonstrating \nthe willingness and determination of the international \ncommunity to shoulder its responsibilities in order to end \nthe Arab-Israeli conflict on the basis of establishing a \nPalestinian State living in peace side by side with the \nState of Israel. \n The withdrawal of Israel from the Palestinian \nterritories occupied since 1967, the establishment of \nthe State of Palestine and the withdrawal of Israel from \nthe Syrian Golan Heights and Lebanese Shaba\u2019a farms \nwill promote security and stability in the Middle East \nregion. This will encourage the development of \ncooperation among the countries and peoples of the \nregion. We sense that there are positive trends and new \nconvictions among Israeli political leaders, and in \nIsraeli society at large, on the need to reach a peaceful \nsolution based on the relevant resolutions of the United \nNations, in order to put an end to decades of conflict in \nthe Middle East region. \n It is necessary to point out here that Arab States \nhave on many occasions stressed their conviction that \n the achievement of a just and equitable peace with \nIsrael depends on the withdrawal of Israel to the \nborders of 1967. Establishing such a peace is the Arab \nStates\u2019 strategic choice. \n We call upon the international community, \nespecially the major Powers, to promote this positive \nconviction within Israel and the Arab States in the \ninterest of achieving peace. \n Iraqi blood continues to be spilled. We believe \nthat the extension of the new responsibilities of the \nUnited Nations in Iraq, in accordance with Security \nCouncil resolution 1770 (2007), is a positive step that \ncommands our full support. In this respect, we urge our \nbrothers in Iraq, especially the Iraqi Government, to \nmove from a stage of discord to a stage of problem-\nsolving in the national interest of Iraq. \n We are optimistic about the sincere efforts \nexerted by the Sudanese Government and the African \nUnion to reach a political settlement among the various \nSudanese parties in Darfur. We support the tripartite \nagreement signed by that Government, the United \nNations and the African Union, on providing support to \nAfrican forces and on deploying more troops in Darfur \nto restore security and achieve success in the \nnegotiations between the Sudanese Government and \nthe opposition groups in Darfur. \n Somalia is still suffering the consequences of a \ncivil war that has claimed the lives of thousands of \npeople and displaced hundreds of thousands more. We \nbelieve that accord among the different Somali factions \nis the only way out. We also believe that the \ninternational community has a major responsibility to \nhelp Somalia restore its unity and security. To \nguarantee the effectiveness of the assistance given by \nthe international community, we urge all tribes and \nfactions in Somalia to be decisive and to help those \nwho are trying to help them. \n We have always welcomed the continued \ncooperation between the friendly Islamic Republic of \nIran and the International Atomic and Energy Agency \n(IAEA). There are hopes and opportunities that augur \nwell for a peaceful solution guaranteeing the right of \nIran to benefit from peaceful nuclear technology and \nassuages the concerns of the international community.  \n We as human beings are all partners on this \nplanet and we have to work together to build it and \ndevelop and preserve its resources. Therefore, it is \nimportant for the international community to observe \nthe extraordinary weather conditions such as \nhurricanes, floods and the erosion and loss of arable \nland that are taking place in different continents. These \nphenomena have inflicted human and economic losses, \ndisplaced hundreds of thousands of people from their \nhomes and have damaged the necessary sources of \nhealth and livelihood, in addition to other essential \nservices.  \n In this context, we commend the vital role played \nby the United Nations and recognize its efforts in \norganizing the High-level Event on Climate Change \nthat was held on 24 September. We also urge the \ninternational community to develop specific measures \nand identify steps and solutions to face these \nchallenges. \n More than ever before, the international \ncommunity is called upon to commission \nenvironmental and scientific studies to face the dangers \nposed by such phenomena, in order to maintain \necological balance and diversity, which both are \nnecessary if life is to continue on this planet. Hence, \nwe must harness the new technological and electronic \ndevelopments in order to combat pollution and \npreserve the environment and biological diversity. In \nthat regard, we welcome and are pleased to be among \nthe many States that have endorsed the special \ninitiative on the Millennium Development Goals with \nregard to the call for action that was adopted recently. \n We also welcome the convening of the high-level \ndialogue on cooperation between religions and \ncultures, scheduled to be held during this session in \nOctober. We hope that the meeting will succeed in \nadopting a futuristic view that focuses on the positive \naspects, based on understanding between religions and \ncultures. Such understanding must be based on mutual \nrespect for all religious beliefs and cultures. \n In closing, we wish this session every success and \nwe hope that we may be able to leave it with a vision \nthat defines the road for the future in the service of \nmankind with renewed commitments among Member \nStates to United Nations resolutions and to respect for \nthe provisions of the Charter. \n"

        "file_text": " To all the  peoples represented here, I convey the brotherly \ngreetings of France. Mr. Secretary-General, you have \nan enormous responsibility, and you have the trust of \nFrance. \n This is the first time that I address this Assembly \non behalf of France. It is a solemn and moving moment \nfor me. I cannot help thinking of all of those men and \nwomen who, at one of the most tragic moments in the \nhistory of humanity, as the world stood on the brink of \nbarbarity, finding that prospect intolerable, succeeded \nin countering force and violence and barbarity with \njustice and peace. Thus was the United Nations born. \n The United Nations is not a mere political \nconstruct. It is not a mere legal construct. It is an \nawakening of the human conscience against everything \nthat threatens to destroy humanity. \n I have never believed that the United Nations \ncould one day root out the violence that lies within \nhuman beings. But what I do know deep down inside \nme, what we all know deep down, is that in spite of all \nits failures, without the United Nations it would have \nbeen impossible to put an end to conflicts that seemed \nto be insoluble. Remember the genocide of the \nCambodian people, remember the suffering inflicted \nupon them; remember the independence of Namibia; \nremember the independence of Timor. Look at the \nGreat Lakes region, or West Africa. Without the United \nNations, the world might have experienced a third \nworld war, doubtless even more terrible than the two \nprevious ones. \n France is convinced that the United Nations is the \nonly remedy we have for the blindness and folly that \nsometimes take hold of human beings. \n The message I wish to bring to you in the name \nof France is a simple one: in this world where the fate \nof each of us depends on the fate of others, the United \nNations should not be weakened; the United Nations \nmust be strengthened. Reforming the United Nations so \nas to adapt it to the realities of our world is an absolute \npriority for France. We cannot afford to wait any \nlonger. The world\u2019s problems must be addressed and \nresolved globally. No one on this Earth can alone \nprotect themselves from the consequences of climate \nwarming, the clash of civilizations, major epidemics. \nAgainst selfishness, against fanaticism, against hatred, \nit is our duty to renew that appeal to the universal \nconscience by virtue of which, for the first time in the \nhistory of all the peoples of the world, all nations \nagreed to meet within a common forum in order to set \naside what divides us and talk to one another. \nThis appeal to the universal conscience is an \nappeal for peace. It is an appeal for open-mindedness. \nIt is an appeal for diversity. And it is an appeal for \njustice. France has always sought greatness for the sake \nof men and women, not for its own sake. Like all \nnations, France, in the course of its long history, has \nmade mistakes, and has sometimes been at fault. But \nits people, the people of France, have always chosen to \nbe on the side of freedom and democracy. France is \nloyal to its friends and to the values it shares with \nthem. But this loyalty is not submission. This loyalty is \nnot a shackle. And France intends to draw on that \nloyalty in the cause of openness to others, of openness \nto the world. I want the world to know that France is \nwilling to talk to everybody in the world, in every \ncontinent. \n But I would also like to say that openness is not \nrenunciation. Understanding is not weakness. \nWeakness and renunciation are not factors of peace; \nthey are factors of war. France and Europe in the past \nexperienced the tragic consequences of such an attitude \nfor themselves and for the whole world. When you are \nweak and submissive, you get ready to accept war. We \nall have a duty to ensure that that never happens again. \nThere will be no peace in the world if the international \ncommunity compromises with the right of peoples to \nself-determination and if it compromises with human \nrights. \n There will be no peace in the world unless the \ninternational community is unshakeable in its \ndetermination to fight terrorism. There will be no peace \nin the world unless the international community stands \nunited in its resolve to put an end to the wars in the \nMiddle East, to put an end to the horror in Darfur, to \nthe tragedy of Lebanon or to the humanitarian disaster \nin Somalia. And I weigh my words carefully. There \nwill be no peace in the world if the international \ncommunity falters in the face of the proliferation of \nnuclear weapons. \n Iran is entitled to nuclear power for civilian \npurposes. But if we allow Iran to acquire nuclear \nweapons, there would be an unacceptable risk to \nstability in the region and in the world. I want to say \nhere, in the name of France, that we can only resolve \nthis crisis by combining firmness with dialogue. It is in \nthat spirit that France will act. \n I want to say here, in the name of France, that it \nis the duty of the international community to confront \nthose who seek power and constantly threaten the \nfragile balance of peace and to do so by bringing to \nbear its unwavering unity and its determination to \nuphold the law. I want to say, in the name of France, \nthat there will be no peace in the world without respect \nfor diversity, without respect for national identities, \nwithout respect, I venture to say, for religions and \nbeliefs, or without respect for cultures. Attachment to \none\u2019s faith, to one\u2019s identity, to one\u2019s language and \nculture, and to one\u2019s way of life, thought and belief   \nall that is legitimate, and profoundly human. To deny \nthat is to sow the seeds of humiliation. It would stoke \nthe fires of nationalism, fanaticism and terrorism. We \nwill not avert the clash of civilizations by forcing \neveryone to think and to believe the same things. \nFrance intends to pursue, together with all people of \ngoodwill, this battle to build a new world order of the \ntwenty-first century. \n We want a Lebanon living independently, and we \nsay that France will always stand shoulder to shoulder \nwith Lebanon in its desire for independence. Tomorrow \nwe hope that Israelis and Palestinians will find within \nthemselves the strength to live in peace. Peace is \npossible. It is possible now. And we will devote all of \nour energies to that. \n We want to see the peaceful coexistence of the \nmain religions to vanquish fundamentalism and \nfanaticism. But I want to say, with all due gravity, that \nthere is too much injustice in the world for the world to \nhope to live in peace. \n The founding fathers of the United Nations knew \nthat the world\u2019s future could be read in the eyes of a \ntortured child; a hungry child; children who watch their \nparents being humiliated; children who since birth have \nknown nothing but war; children torn from their \nhomes, their lands, their families. Because in those \nchildren\u2019s desperate eyes there is not only suffering, \nbut also all the wars and revolts that will drench the \nworld in blood tomorrow. \n Let us look at the world as it is. Let us look at \nwhat we have made of it. Have we wanted enough to \nmake it more just? The answer is no. Have we done \nenough to achieve that end? The answer is no.  \n When the Berlin wall fell, we all dreamed that \nhistory would cease to be tragic. Let us look at our \nworld as it is so that we can make it better. Let us \njudge our world by the yardstick of justice. Justice \nmeans that the Palestinian people can regain a country \nand build a State. Justice means that the Israeli people \ncan enjoy the right to live in security. Justice means \nthat the Lebanese people can regain their freedom. \nJustice means that the Iraqi people, in all their \ndiversity, can find within themselves the path to \nreconciliation and democracy. Justice means that a \ndeveloping country on which we wish to impose \nenvironmental rules, even though its inhabitants have \nbarely enough to eat, can be helped to put such rules in \nplace. Justice means that we cannot tap a country\u2019s \nresources without paying a fair price for them. \n Let us look squarely at our world. Never before \nhas there been so much easy money, with so much \nwealth concentrated in the hands of a few large groups. \nThroughout the world, even in the richest countries, \nthere are many men and women who no longer have \neven a hope of emerging some day from their material \nand moral distress.  \n In conclusion, I appeal to the conscience of all \nthose who have a responsibility for the conduct of \nworld affairs. Because if we do nothing, the poor and \nthe exploited will one day rise up against the injustice \ndone to them. \n What the world needs is a new mindset: a \ngenuine New Deal on a global scale, an ecological and \neconomic New Deal. On behalf of France, I call on all \nStates to join together to found the new world order of \nthe twenty-first century, predicated on the key idea that \nthe common goods of humanity must be the \nresponsibility of all of humanity.  \n On behalf of France, I solemnly appeal to the \nUnited Nations to provide itself, in this era marked by \nthe return of scarcity, with the means to guarantee that \nall people throughout the world have access to vital \nresources: water, energy, food, medicine and \nknowledge. I solemnly appeal to the United Nations to \nconcern itself with the issue of fairer distribution of \nwealth and of the income derived from commodities \nand technology. I solemnly appeal to the United \nNations to concern itself with the moralization of \nfinancial capitalism. I solemnly appeal to the United \nNations to go further in combating corruption, which \nsaps countries that are suffering and all too poor. \n Things must change. Mindsets must change. \nBehaviour must change. This is our responsibility now, \nbecause tomorrow it will be too late. If we fail to act, \nwe will see a resurgence of all the threats that the \npeople of the post-war world believed they had \novercome. Let us not take this risk lightly.  \n Peoples of the world, we can, together, build a \nbetter future for all people. It is up to us alone; it is up \nto our capacity to remain faithful to the values that \nhave brought us together here today. You have \nunderstood. France believes that we have no more time \nto wait. France calls for action. France urges action. \nFrance is committed to action in the service of world \npeace. \n"

        "file_text": "I would like first to \ncongratulate you, Mr. President, on your election to \nyour prestigious office. Your vast political experience \nand diplomatic skills will undoubtedly guide the \nGeneral Assembly towards success in dealing with its \nimportant agenda. I wish to express our deep \nsatisfaction and pride at the significant achievements \nof your predecessor, Her Excellency Sheikha Haya \nRashed Al-Khalifa, during her presidency. Her stature \nand accomplishments symbolize the prominent role \nthat women are playing in the Muslim world. \n Let me also express our high appreciation to \nMr. Ban Ki-moon for the distinctive and assiduous \nmanner in which, as our new Secretary-General, he has \nengaged himself to address crises and humanitarian \nsituations. We support the Secretary-General\u2019s \ncommitment to improving the United Nations so that it \ncan respond to contemporary challenges and \nopportunities. \n The end of the cold war at the dawn of the \ntwenty-first century gave rise to hopes for a better \nfuture. A decade later, the world is in the grip of \ndeepening uncertainty and rising turbulence. There are \nnew threats of terrorism, violence and widening \ndivisions among cultures and societies, driven by \nsuspicion and prejudice. At the heart of that growing \nmalaise is not a clash of values or civilizations; it is the \nfailure of the international community to address \nfestering disputes and our collective inability to \nuniversalize the opportunities and benefits offered by \nthe phenomenal advances of technology and \nglobalization for the betterment of all peoples. \n Conflicts continue in Palestine, Iraq and \nAfghanistan. In South Asia, the Kashmir dispute is yet \nto be resolved. Old disputes are compounded by new \nconfrontations. Also, serious challenges are emerging \nin the shape of climate change, energy security, and \nfinancial and trade imbalances.  \n In this complex world, the United Nations \nprovides a critical and indispensable role. The United \nNations is at the apex of expanding international \ninteraction and remains the only acknowledged \ninstrument for regulating global affairs on the basis of \nagreed principles and norms. \n Terrorism is a grave and pervasive threat. \nTerrorism destabilizes societies. It must not be \nassociated with any faith or culture. It must be \ncountered and rejected, addressing both its \nmanifestations and its root causes. \n Equally disturbing are trends to malign other \ncultures and faiths and reinforce divisions, especially \nbetween the West and the Islamic world. Tolerating \nIslamophobia in the guise of freedom of expression is \ndangerous. More than ever before, in this globalized \nworld we need understanding, harmony and the \nbuilding of bridges among all cultures and peoples \nthrough such initiatives as the Alliance of \nCivilizations, interfaith dialogue and enlightened \nmoderation. \n Conflict and violence in the Middle East are \nfundamentally linked to the Palestinian issue that has \nagitated two generations of Palestinians and Muslims \naround the world. Essentially, Palestine is an issue of \nfreedom. Security cannot be ensured by denying the \nPalestinians their freedom. Salvation lies in what the \nArab nations proposed in Beirut five years ago. \nPakistan supports that position. The world has a \nhistorical responsibility to end the tragedy of the \nPalestinian people by enabling them to establish their \nown State in Palestine, consistent with Security \nCouncil resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) and the \nArab peace plan. Israel must also withdraw from the \nother occupied Arab territories and fully respect the \nterritorial and sovereign integrity of Lebanon. Efforts \nthat deflect from those basic imperatives will only \nprolong agony and turmoil in the region. \n Pakistan is deeply concerned over the grave \nsituation in Iraq. We deplore the internecine bloodshed. \nPeace in Iraq can emerge only through dialogue, \nmutual cooperation and tolerance. It is vital both for \nthe Iraqi people and for the region to ensure the \npreservation of the unity and territorial integrity of Iraq \nand full respect for its sovereignty. \n Pakistan is also disturbed by the ominous \nconfrontation over Iran\u2019s nuclear issue. We have \ninsisted on recourse to diplomacy because resort to the \nuse of force could lead to incalculable consequences \nfor that already inflamed and highly sensitive region. \n In our region, violence and the rise of terrorism \nand extremism are due to the developments of the \nnearly three decades when neighbouring Afghanistan \nbecame the last front of the cold war. Ironically, in the \n1980s the struggle in Afghanistan helped the \nconsolidation of freedom movements that culminated \nin the surge of freedom signified by the fall of the \nBerlin wall. In the 1990s, however, Afghanistan \nsuffered international neglect and indifference until the \nshock and horror of 9/11 refocused international \nattention on that war-ravaged country. \n The unfortunate happenings in our \nneighbourhood impacted on our own society, giving \nrise to terrorism and extremism, especially in the tribal \nregions bordering Afghanistan. We are fighting \nAl-Qaida and other terrorist elements with resolve and \ndetermination. We have deployed nearly 100,000 \ntroops for that purpose. A large number of our troops \nhave sacrificed their lives. In the tribal regions, we \nhave taken political and administrative measures and \nhave plans to bring about socio-economic \ntransformation. As part of a comprehensive strategy, \nwe have introduced reforms to counter extremism. \n We are cooperating internationally and reject \nirresponsible comments and insinuations, especially in \ncertain sections of the international media, casting \naspersions on our intentions and efforts. It must be \nappreciated that the challenge is enormous and requires \na sustained and protracted endeavour both locally and \nat the international level. \n Pakistan desires a peaceful environment in the \nregion. No country stands to gain as much as Pakistan \nfrom peace and stability in Afghanistan. We therefore \nsupport every initiative that could help the Afghans to \nachieve national reconciliation and to rebuild their \ncountry. The recently convened Grand Jirga in Kabul \noffers hope. A great deal will depend on the \neffectiveness of the follow-up mechanisms, especially \nthe 50-member joint council that is mandated to reach \nout to the opposition to promote peace in the area. The \ninternational community also has an important \nresponsibility to help Afghanistan with a Marshall \nPlan-like programme for reconstruction. \n Pakistan is engaged in a peace process with India \nthat has led to significant improvement in bilateral \nrelations. The two countries must now seize the \nopportunity provided by the propitious international \nand regional environment to address problems, \nespecially the Jammu and Kashmir dispute that has \nbeen at the heart of conflict and tension in South Asia. \nBoth sides will have to demonstrate political will, \ncourage and flexibility. We are pursuing a solution that \nwould be acceptable to India, to Pakistan and, above \nall, to the people of Jammu and Kashmir. \n President Pervez Musharraf has offered important \nideas that have resonated with the Kashmiri people, \nwho must be involved in the process. At the same time, \nit is essential to create an environment free of human \nrights violations in Kashmir if there is to be a \nsustainable peaceful solution. A peaceful settlement \nresponding to the aspirations of the Kashmiri people \nwill usher in a new era of mutual trust and cooperation \nin South Asia. \n In our region, the incipient United States-India \nnuclear deal injects a new element. We have concerns \nover strategic stability, which we will maintain despite \nour firm opposition to an arms race in South Asia. \nMoreover, we also have a strong interest in developing \ncivil nuclear power generation under international \nsafeguards. Our nuclear and strategic assets are solely \nfor defensive purpose. We started pursuing the nuclear \noption only after 1974, when the strategic balance was \ndisrupted by the first Indian nuclear test. Our initiatives \nto keep South Asia free of nuclear weapons received \nscant response internationally. In 1998, we were again \nfaced with a dilemma and had to respond to the Indian \ntests to establish deterrence. Our failure to do so would \nhave created a dangerous ambiguity about our \ncapability, with the risk of miscalculation. \n I wish to reaffirm that our strategic capability is \nsolely for deterrence and defence. We are opposed to \nan arms race and want to maintain minimum credible \ndeterrence. We will not be the first to test in our region. \nWe will never use our nuclear capability against \nnon-nuclear weapon States. We remain fully committed \nto the objective of general and complete disarmament \nand nuclear non-proliferation. We want to be treated as \na partner rather than as a target of the global nuclear \nnon-proliferation regime. We are committed to \ndeveloping nuclear power generation under \ninternational safeguards to meet our growing energy \nneeds. \n It is evident that global consensus on \ndisarmament and non-proliferation has been seriously \neroded. There are several reasons for that, including \nthe disavowal of nuclear disarmament by the nuclear-\nweapon States signatories to the Treaty on the \nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT); the \nemergence of de facto nuclear-weapon States not \nparties to the NPT; the failure to address the security \nconcerns of non-nuclear-weapon States; and \ndiscrimination in the conduct of peaceful nuclear \ncooperation. There is an obvious need for a new and \nuniversal consensus on non-proliferation, disarmament \nand peaceful nuclear cooperation that eliminates \ndangers and risks and establishes cooperation on an \nequitable basis. In the coming months, the Nuclear \nSuppliers Group States have a heavy responsibility, as \nany endorsement of a selective or discriminatory \napproach could fatefully damage the existing \nconsensus on disarmament and non-proliferation. \n The world is slowly recognizing the existential \nthreat posed by climate change. The special event held \non 24 September has been useful in crystallizing the \nissues that must be addressed. Environment is a \nresponsibility and an opportunity. The responsibility is \nto heal the Earth, which is scarred and degraded. The \nchallenge goes far beyond Kyoto. Collectively, we \nneed to restrain our avaricious and extravagant living. \nOpportunity lies in developing the environment as an \nemployment sector to absorb a part of world human \nresources in meaningful activity. We must realize that \nwith technological advances it will no longer be \nfeasible to rationally utilize the entire global work \nforce in the production, manufacturing and service \nsectors. \n Against the backdrop of the new challenges, large \nparts of humanity continue to suffer from hunger, \npoverty and disease. That is tragic in these modern \ntimes, where the miracle of technology has empowered \nthe world to effectively overcome the vestiges of our \nprimitive existence. The Group of 77 has therefore \ninsisted on a broad endeavour for sustainable \ndevelopment based on economic growth, social \ndevelopment and environmental protection. We should \nadopt coherent and mutually reinforcing policies and \nactions to advance in those three directions with the \nsame degree of political and legal commitment. The \nUnited Nations has a central role in the realization of \nthe Millennium Development Goals and other \ninternationally agreed development goals. \n Pakistan, as the current Chair of the Group of 77 \nand China, has suggested steps to enable developing \ncountries to coordinate and enlarge their national \ndevelopment cooperation effort. In accordance with the \nmandate adopted at the Second South Summit, we will \nconvene a panel of eminent experts of the South to \nfurther develop common positions for developing \ncountries in critical areas like trade finance, \ntechnology, energy and climate change. \n Pakistan agrees that the management and \nSecretariat of the United Nations should be reformed \nand modernized, especially to improve the coherence \nand effectiveness of the system. Prime Minister \nShaukat Aziz is the Co-Chair of the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s High-level Panel on System-wide Coherence. \nThe reform process must, however, remain sensitive to \nthe fundamental principle of the sovereign equality of \nStates in the decision-making process. That applies \nespecially to the issue of the expansion of the Security \nCouncil. Security Council reform must enlarge the \nrepresentation of all Member States rather than expand \nthe circle of the privileged. The Security Council \nfunctions must also be developed in a manner so that \nthese do not eclipse the Charter responsibilities of the \nGeneral Assembly or those of the other principal \norgans of the United Nations. \n In Pakistan, our aspirations are the same as \nelsewhere: to accelerate our socio-economic \ndevelopment, to build a knowledge-based society and \nto contribute to peace and development in the world \nconsistent with the deeply held values of our faith and \nour vision for a modern progressive Islamic state. That \nhas been the orientation of the Government of \nPresident Musharraf for setting priorities and \nintroducing reform programmes. There have been \nsignificant accomplishments in strengthening \ninstitutions, promoting democratic polity and building \na sound economy. \n To give a few examples, today we have robust \ngrass-roots level democratic institutions with \nmandatory one-third representation by women. Our \nminorities have been integrated into the political \nmainstream. Our media is free, vibrant and assertive. \nOur economy has seen stable growth over the past \neight years, and in that period, Pakistan\u2019s national \noutput and per capita income has doubled. We are now \npreparing for elections, as our elected national and \nprovincial assemblies will soon complete their full \nterm of office. As we enter this important phase in our \npolitical life, we do so with the deep awareness that a \nstrong and stable Pakistan is pivotal for the peace and \nprogress of our region. \n"

        "file_text": "Allow me at the outset to congratulate Mr. Kerim most \nwarmly on his outstanding election to the presidency of \nthe General Assembly at its sixty-second session. We \nare convinced that his professional qualities and his \nvast and rich academic, diplomatic and business \nexperience will lead to the success of our work. I \ntherefore assure him of my delegation\u2019s fullest support \nin the discharge of his mandate. \n With respect to outgoing President Sheikha Haya \nRashed Al-Khalifa, I wish to express our great \nsatisfaction at her dynamic and skilful handling of the \nwork of the previous session. \n As to the Secretary-General, I take this \nopportunity to reiterate the Niger Government\u2019s \nadmiration and encouragement on his assumption of \nthe leadership of our collective Organization. \n Two years after the 2005 World Summit, which \ngave our leaders an opportunity to address the \nchallenges and threats confronting humankind, we \ncannot help feeling optimistic   despite the \npersistence of such scourges as international terrorism \nor the slow progress towards fulfilling the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals   as we consider the unflagging \nwillingness of the international community resolutely \nto seek solutions consonant with the threats that have \nbeen identified. \n In the field of international peace and security, \none element of the significant developments in certain \nparts of the world is, without a doubt, the positive \nimpact of the Peacebuilding Commission, in particular \nin Burundi and Sierra Leone. That alone makes the \ncreation of that new body worthwhile. In Africa, such \npositive and encouraging trends can be witnessed in \nthe hope raised by developments in certain conflict \nareas.  \n In West Africa, Liberia continues to move ahead \nwith national reconstruction and consolidation of \npeace.  \n In C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, the peace process has shown \ngreat promise since the Ouagadougou agreement was \nsigned in March 2007 and a \u201cflame of peace\u201d \nceremony took place. Those two major events bear \nwitness to the parties\u2019 will to put a permanent end to \nthe crisis that exploded in that country five years ago.  \n Sierra Leone, for the first time, and after a long \nperiod of instability, has organized free and transparent \nlegislative and presidential elections, bearing witness \nto the resolve of the suffering people of that country to \nmove beyond tragedy and to resolutely build a bright \nfuture.  \n In Central Africa, the adoption by the Great \nLakes countries of the Pact on Security, Stability and \nDevelopment leads us to expect, in the medium term, a \nmeaningful improvement in the troubled situation that \nhas prevailed there for some years now. It is \nencouraging to note that Burundi is already at the point \nwhere it can do without the international community\u2019s \nsupervision in peacekeeping efforts within its borders \nand to devote itself fully to the task of economic and \nsocial development.  \n The Democratic Republic of the Congo is another \ncase in which we will allow ourselves to have great \nhopes if all the parties join in the peace movement and \ntake part in the ongoing democratic process.  \n In Darfur, the situation remains worrisome to be \nsure, but thanks to the agreement between the \nGovernment of the Sudan and the United Nations and \nthe adoption of Security Council resolution 1769 \n(2007) on 31 July, we hope that there will soon be a \nreturn to peace and security in that part of the Sudan.  \n In Western Sahara, we are gratified by the \ninitiation of direct negotiations between Morocco and \nthe POLISARIO Front, including the two meetings \nheld under the aegis of the Personal Envoy of the \nSecretary-General subsequent to the adoption of \nSecurity Council resolution 1754 (2007).  \n Finally, with regard to Somalia, we earnestly \nhope that the national reconciliation conference and the \nefforts of the international community will yield \npositive results and enable that brother country to \nemerge forever from the crisis that has prevailed there \nfor years. \n The situation in the Middle East, dominated by \nthe Israel-Palestine conflict, requires more focused \nattention by the international community. My \ndelegation feels that the resumption of the political \nprocess remains the only way to move towards a just \nand lasting solution, on the basis of the relevant United \nNations resolutions and the principle of two viable \nStates living side by side in peace and security. The \nQuartet Road Map and the Arab Peace Initiative remain \nframes of reference in this regard.  \n Generally speaking, the coherent subregional \napproach employed by the United Nations and the \nsubregional organizations seems well suited to \nhandling conflicts, and also to responding to other \nconcerns, such as international migration, trafficking in \nhuman beings, trafficking in drugs, transnational crime \nand the proliferation and spread of small arms and light \nweapons. From this perspective, in particular as \nregards the African continent, the capacity of \nsubregional organizations and the African Union \nshould be reinforced.  \n The United Nations Ten-year Capacity-Building \nProgramme for the African Union is to be commended, \nas it opens new possibilities for conflict prevention and \nthe maintenance of lasting peace on the continent, in \nparticular through the creation of an African \nintervention force. Along these lines, the open debates \nof the Security Council on strengthening the role of the \nCouncil in conflict prevention and resolution, in \nparticular in Africa, are of great importance.  \n Conflicts are not the only threats to international \npeace and security. Other phenomena, sometimes more \ndevastating and unforeseeable, threaten the ability of \npeoples around the world to enjoy their legitimate right \nto peace and security. Those phenomena include \ninternational terrorism, transnational crime and all \ntypes of trafficking.  \n In this connection, the Sahara, a geographical \nzone that the Niger shares with several other African \ncountries, is becoming a den of drug and arms \ntraffickers, fuelling and perpetuating insecurity in the \nregion. The Niger intends to participate intensively in \nany effort to enhance the international community\u2019s \nefforts to eradicate that scourge, which undermines the \neconomies of the countries concerned and threatens the \nfoundations of democracy.  \n In that regard, my delegation considers \ninternational cooperation and assistance for affected \ndeveloping countries to be indispensable if we are to \nsucceed in combating drug trafficking and trafficking \nin small arms and light weapons, including anti-tank \nand anti-personnel mines. These are used by armed \ngroups to continue to inflict untold suffering on \ninnocent civilians, obstruct trade and hinder all \ndevelopment activities in infested areas. The scope and \ngravity of the phenomenon truly require that the \ninternational community give it all due attention and \nfirmly condemn the criminal acts being carried out by \nthese networks of traffickers, in particular in our \nregion. \n The linkage between peace, security, \ndevelopment and human rights, spelled out in the 2005 \nWorld Summit Outcome (resolution 60/1), has lost \nnone of its relevance and continues to fuel our \nthinking. That is why the Niger continues to feel a \nsense of solidarity for all initiatives, present or future, \ndesigned to give new momentum to development \nefforts.  \n Niger welcomes the initiative of the informal \nthematic debate entitled \u201cPartnerships towards \nachieving the Millennium Development Goals: Taking \nstock, moving forward\u201d, held on 27 November 2006 \nand the first in a series of three debates organized by \nthe General Assembly in the context of its \nrevitalization process. On that occasion, some \ndevelopment partners were able to undertake concrete \ncommitments, such as that of the Islamic Development \nBank, which announced the creation of a poverty \nmitigation fund endowed with a $10 billion budget. \nThe Government of the Niger, through me, would like \nto commend that exemplary initiative, which is part of \nan ever more effective development partnership.  \n The Niger sees the General Assembly\u2019s adoption \nof resolution of 61/16 on strengthening the role of the \nEconomic and Social Council as a great step forward. \nThe resolution names the Economic and Social Council \nas a principal body responsible for economic and social \ndevelopment and, in particular, for the implementation \nof the international development goals agreed at the \nmajor United Nations conferences and summits, \nincluding the Millennium Development Goals.  \n We congratulate the State of Qatar on having \nhosted the preparatory meeting for the Monterrey \nConsensus review conference, to be held in Doha in \n2008. Moreover, the unparalleled commitment of the \nGovernment of Qatar to international development led \nit to host the Conference on Consolidating Food \nSecurity in Niger, which was held in Doha with the \nsupport of the Organization of the Islamic Conference \nand proved most successful. I therefore take this \nprivileged moment at the rostrum of the General \nAssembly at its sixty-second session to reiterate the \nprofound gratitude of the people and Government of \nthe Niger to that friendly country, the entire Islamic \nummah and all other partners who kindly supported \nthat initiative. \n The international community should pay \nparticular attention to one category of countries that is \neven more vulnerable. I am referring to land-locked \ndeveloping countries, whose geography puts them at a \ngreat disadvantage. In 2003, the Almaty Conference, \nhaving considered their situation, adopted a \nDeclaration and Programme of Action, the \nimplementation of which is soon to be reviewed. The \ntime has therefore come to launch an urgent appeal to \nall development partners to resolve to take the \nnecessary measures not only to help those countries to \nachieve the Millennium Development Goals, but also \nto enable them to mitigate the negative impacts of \ndesertification, environmental degradation and climate \nchange.  \n Desertification and the deteriorating environment \nare two problems that seriously affect the countries of \nthe Sahel, including mine. The combined efforts of the \ninternational community effectively to combat those \nscourges should be stepped up. The action taken by the \nNiger, based on the experience gained through the \nspecial programme launched by the President of the \nRepublic, has allowed us to achieve spectacular \nsuccesses that deserve to be consolidated and \nstrengthened. \n Thanks to the work to restore degraded soil, \nremove sand and reforest the landscape undertaken \nover the past few years and stepped up in the \nframework of that programme, 3 million hectares have \nbeen reclaimed from the desert, according to satellite \nmonitoring undertaken in 2006 and transmitted by the \nregional Agrimet centre. Large expanses that were \ndesperately arid have now become productive  \nagricultural areas and pasture land thanks to water-\nretention and infiltration activities that have raised the \nwater table. It is worth noting that such activities are \nbeing carried out by several thousand young people \nbeing paid through a cash-for-work programme.  \n The public debate in the Security Council and the \nthematic debate in the General Assembly dedicated to \nclimate change highlighted the scope and gravity of the \nphenomenon by emphasizing the need for urgent \ncollective action. The eloquent statements made at the \nhigh-level meeting organized by the Secretary-General \non 24 September lead us to believe that the parties are \nwilling to move to achieve essential objectives, which \nis the only way to secure a wholesome and reliable \nenvironment for present and future generations. The \nNiger resolutely supports that momentum and, within \nits national strategy and plan of action for climate \nchange and viability, has drafted a national programme \nof action for adaptation to climate change. \n All such questions, which fall within the context \nof a comprehensive vision of sustainable development, \nare covered in our revised poverty reduction strategy, \nwhich is the reference framework for my country\u2019s \noverall economic and development policy. I take this \nexceptional opportunity solemnly to invite all our \ndevelopment partners to participate in the international \nconference on the Niger\u2019s revised poverty reduction \nstrategy, to be held in Brussels in October. The \nconference has been called, inter alia, to harmonize and \ncoordinate the contributions of our development \npartners. \n Harmonization and coordination are topical \nissues in the United Nations. They are essential to \nincreasing the Organization\u2019s effectiveness in \ncollective action to address global challenges and \nthreats. My delegation agrees that system-wide \ncoherence in United Nations activities should be a \nprincipal focus for the implementation of reforms \nadvocated in the Outcome Document of the 2005 \nWorld Summit. We must therefore find the means to \nimplement them. I note that we see such reforms as a \nway of better helping developing countries to achieve \nlasting economic growth, develop sustainably and \neradicate poverty.  \n That is the vision that leads me to reaffirm the \nNiger\u2019s conviction that coherence and coordination \nmust be inspired by the cardinal principles of \nownership, national leadership and respect for national \ndevelopment priorities. \n"

        "file_text": "May I, on behalf of \nmy delegation, and in my own name, extend our \nsincere congratulations to Mr. Srgjan Kerim on his \nelection to preside over the General Assembly at its \nsixty-second session. I assure him of our fullest \nsupport and cooperation in the daunting tasks that lie \nahead of us. His election is a personal tribute to his \nengagement and rich experience in international \npolitics and diplomacy. Allow me also to convey our \nsincere appreciation and thanks to his predecessor, Her \nExcellency Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa, for the \neffective and efficient manner in which she conducted \nthe business of the sixty-first session. May I also take \nthis opportunity to pledge my delegation\u2019s support to \nthe new Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Ban \nKi-moon, in his efforts and approach in charting out a \nvision for the Organization that will respond to the \nneeds and aspirations of the twenty-first century. \n International peace and security constitute the \nbedrock of the Organization. We have come a long way \nsince 1945 in securing peace and security in many \nparts of the world. However, a lot remains to be \naccomplished in order to have a conflict-free world. \nWe are seriously concerned about what is happening in \nthe Middle East. Conflicts in some parts of Africa \ncontinue to be a major source of concern to us. The \ntrail of violence and death continues to plague the \nMiddle East. In order to give peace a chance and allow \nit to take root in those regions and manifest its positive \neffects in the day-to-day lives of citizens, we need to \nredouble our efforts and explore all possible avenues to \nachieve peace, stability and security, in the larger \ninterests of the citizens of those countries. \n The fragility of the Middle East situation, and in \nparticular the question of Palestine, needs a holistic \napproach that, inter alia, includes linkages embedded in \nthe socio-cultural, political, economic and security \nissues of the region. I should also once again like to \nreiterate our full support for the establishment of an \nindependent and sovereign Palestinian State side by \nside with the State of Israel. \n With regard to Darfur, we welcome the African \nUnion-United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur \nwhich is expected to assume the peacekeeping and \npeacebuilding operations there. We call on all the \nparties concerned in the conflict to demonstrate their \nreal commitment and resolve to engage fully in the \nsearch for lasting peace. \n In Somalia, despite the serious efforts to contain \nviolence during the past six months, the situation \nremains highly volatile. In that context, I would like to \nadd my voice to the call made by the Chairperson of \nthe African Union Commission, Mr. Konar\u00e9, to the \nSecretary-General to consider the possibility of \ndeploying a United Nations force to assist the African \nUnion Peace Support Mission in Somalia. \n The President returned to the Chair. \n The world today is confronted with growing \nthreats of terrorism   be it home-grown, cross-border, \nregional or international in nature. That scourge should \nbe confronted with all the means at the disposal of the \ninternational community. We also believe that more \neffective and efficient mechanisms should be put in \nplace to capture the financiers of terrorist \norganizations. \n The United Nations remains the cornerstone of \nthe fight against terrorism. Mauritius has lent, and will \ncontinue to lend, its fullest support to the numerous \ninitiatives and resolutions of the United Nations on \ncounter-terrorism. We are happy to note that the \nInternational Convention for the Suppression of Acts of \nNuclear Terrorism entered into force in July of this \nyear. \n The world of the twenty-first century is a world \nof interdependence, with the national frontiers between \npeoples and countries falling faster than we had \nenvisaged. This has brought about the interphase and \ninteraction between peoples from different parts of the \nworld. We are today living in a world intertwined with \ninterreligious and intercultural predicaments. \n Mauritius, as the Assembly is aware, is a multi-\nethnic and multicultural society. Unity in diversity is \nthe solid foundation on which we have built the \nframework for the peaceful coexistence of peoples of \ndifferent faiths and cultures. Cultural diversity, \nunderstanding and respect for different faiths and \nreligions are today part and parcel of Mauritian society. \n We warmly welcome the convening of the High-\nlevel Dialogue on Interreligious and Intercultural \nUnderstanding and Cooperation for Peace, which is to \nbe held in October 2007 at United Nations \nHeadquarters, for the promotion of tolerance, \nunderstanding and universal respect on matters of \nfreedom and religion. We will certainly be part of the \nDialogue.  \n Furthermore, we reaffirm our determination to \nsupport all initiatives that promote a culture of peace \nand tolerance. We are also happy to note that the \nGeneral Assembly recently adopted resolution 61/271 \nto observe and celebrate the International Day of \nNon-Violence on 2 October each year in recognition of \nthe great apostle of peace and non-violence, Mahatma \nGandhi. \n Mauritius is a strong advocate of all human rights \nand fundamental freedoms   so much so that the \nfounding fathers of our constitution ensured that \nhuman rights figured prominently therein. Since our \nindependence, in 1968, we have persistently \nendeavoured to place our citizens at the core of all \nforms of human rights and have ensured that they \nenjoy all political and civil rights irrespective of their \nstatus, colour or creed. We have enacted several pieces \nof legislation and we continue to enhance our \nlegislative and institutional framework for the further \nprotection and promotion of human rights and \nfundamental freedoms. We have set up the National \nHuman Rights Commission, the Sex Discrimination \nDivision, the Office of the Ombudsperson for Children \nand the Human Rights Centre to ensure and promote \ncompliance with fundamental rights and freedoms of \nthe individual and the international instruments on \nhuman rights. \n Mauritius is party to all major international and \nregional human rights treaties. We continue to extend \nour unwavering support to the United Nations in the \npromotion and protection of human rights. As a \nmember of the Human Rights Council, we are lending \nour fullest support to make it more effective, efficient \nand relevant in the eyes of the world. Our quest for \nuniversal respect for human rights demands that the \nperpetrators of massive violations be brought to justice \npromptly. Impunity gives rise to violations.  \n We cannot but admire the Buddhist monks of \nMyanmar and the courage of Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, \nwhose party won a democratic and fair election in \n1990, only to be removed from office by a military \ncoup. She has now spent 11 of the last 17 years under \nhouse arrest. And now the legitimate stirrings of the \npeople\u2019s will are being brutally repressed in blood, as \nwe are speaking here at the United Nations. It is our \nduty to let the people of Myanmar know that the free \nnations of the world stand by them. But we need to do \nmore than just stand by them. The time has come for \nthe most stringent sanctions to be taken against the \nmilitary junta that has proved again and again that it is \ntotally impervious to good sense and common \nhumanity. \n I am proud to say that in 1997, in my first term as \nPrime Minister, I took the decision to stop buying rice \nfrom Myanmar. I applaud the decision of the President \nof the United States of America to apply sanctions. All \nof us should do the same. The military junta must be \nsent a clear message: that the free world will not \ntolerate gunning down people who are demanding \nfreedom and justice. \n While the Assembly has made responding to \nclimate change the thrust of the general debate, \nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon has qualified climate \nchange as the defining issue of our era. We cannot \nagree more with that. Climate change affects all of us. \nIndeed, if it is not addressed head on, it will have \nirreversible consequences and devastating effects on \nthe survival of human beings and the habitability of our \nplanet Earth. We all have a stake in addressing climate \nchange and global warming. \n We commend the laudable initiative of the \nSecretary-General in convening the High-level Event \non Climate Change on 24 September. We remain \nconfident that the strong message that has emanated \nfrom the High-level Event will provide the necessary \nimpetus and political will and act as a catalyst to the \nBali meeting later this year. However, in our approach \nto finding a global solution to climate change we \nshould avoid making those who bear the least \nresponsibility for greenhouse gas emissions and who \nare yet the hardest-hit, pay the price on the same scale \nas others who have led to the increase in global \nwarming as early as the eighteenth century. Mauritius, \nfor its part remains committed to the principle of \ncommon but differentiated responsibilities. \n The rise in sea level constitutes a danger that \nthreatens most of the low-lying island developing \nStates. Those States have limited capacity to withstand \nthe negative effects of natural disasters and external \neconomic shocks. Their sustainable development \nbecomes more trying and rigorous in the light of their \ninherent vulnerabilities. Mitigation and adaptation \ncapabilities of countries may vary depending on the \nlevel of their economic development. Small island \ndeveloping States (SIDS) face, in their adaptation \nchoices, fundamental constraints of inadequate data \nand technical capacity, weak institutional capacity and \nlimited financial resources. \n In that respect we call for the full and effective \nimplementation of the commitments, programmes and \ntargets adopted in the Barbados Programme of Action \nand the Mauritius Strategy for the Further \nImplementation of the Programme of Action for the \nSustainable Development of Small Island Developing \nStates. A special SIDS fund to assist the development \nand implementation of adaptation measures in the same \nmanner as the special fund for the least developed \ncountries under the umbrella of the Global \nEnvironment Facility (GEF), and regional climate \nobservational systems to better monitor climate \nvariations associated with global warming and \nsea-level rise, need to be set up. \n While it is true that if the present pace of climate \nchange goes unchecked, the face of the world may \nchange dramatically in the next hundred years with \ndevastating effects for future generations, it is equally \ntrue that underdevelopment, poverty, hunger and \ndiseases such as HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis \nin the developing world are the present challenges that \nrequire the immediate and undivided attention of the \nworld as laid down in the Millennium Development \nGoals (MDGs). \n The 2007 Millennium Development Goals \nmidterm report underscores that \u201cthe MDGs will be \nattained only if concerted additional action is taken \nimmediately and sustained until 2015\u201d (Millennium \nDevelopment Goals Report 2007, p. 4). Africa, \nunfortunately, in spite of serious and strenuous efforts, \ncontinues to lag far behind on the MDGs. \n Mauritius for its part, is on track to meet the \nMDGs by the year 2015. Nonetheless, since my \nGovernment took office in 2005, we have allocated \nconsiderable resources in our national budget for the \nempowerment of the poor and the social uplifting of \nvulnerable groups. The development challenges of \nMauritius go well beyond the achievement of the \nMDGs. \n In order to improve the prospects for attaining the \nMDGs, it is essential for donors and development \npartners to honour their undertakings and commitments \nmade at the 2002 Monterrey International Conference \non Financing for Development. In that respect, we \nhope that the follow-up International Conference on \nFinancing for Development in 2008 will provide the \nmuch-awaited response from the concerned parties to \nadequately address international commitments on \nfinancing for development. \n In our efforts to find ways and means to alleviate \nand ultimately eliminate poverty in our subregion, \nMauritius, jointly with the Southern African \nDevelopment Community will be hosting an \nInternational Conference on Poverty Alleviation and \nDevelopment in April 2008. \n While there is no denying the fact that \nglobalization has led in its wake to economic growth in \nthe world including developing countries, it is also true \nthat many countries, especially the most vulnerable \nones, are unfortunately not reaping the benefits of \nglobalization. This is particularly true of LDCs, lower- \nand middle-income countries and countries in \ntransition, which continue to face huge difficulties in \nintegrating the globalizing economy. \n We call for a new global strategy that would \ncreate an enabling economic environment for \ndevelopment. It would require greater coherence \nbetween the international trading, monetary and \nfinancial systems. We therefore reaffirm our dedication \nto the establishment of a new international economic \norder which emphasizes globalization with a human \nface whose benefits will be more widely shared. \n More than six years after the 2001 Declaration of \nCommitment on HIV/AIDS \u201cGlobal Crisis   Global \nAction\u201d, the pandemic still remains a global crisis \nrequiring global action. The negative impact of \nHIV/AIDS on human resources in the 25-45 age group, \nparticularly in sub-Saharan Africa is simply \noverwhelming. The alarming rate with which the \nHIV/AIDS pandemic is ravaging innocent lives in our \nsocieties has far-reaching implications for our socio-\neconomic development. It undermines the efforts \ntowards the achievement of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals. \n The prevalence of HIV/AIDS in Mauritius is \nmerely 0.2 per cent, with between 20 and 30 per cent \nof the cases affecting vulnerable groups, such as prison \ninmates and intravenous drug users. Our policies are \ngeared towards containing the level of contamination, \nin particular by combating transmission via the sharing \nof contaminated needles. We are providing substantial \nfunds for the development of a needle exchange \nprogramme and a public awareness information and \ncommunication campaign on HIV/AIDS. \n I wish here to put on record our appreciation to \nthe Clinton Foundation for having included Mauritius \namongst the countries that can benefit from the Clinton \nFoundation HIV/AIDS Initiative.  \n Every year at this time heads of State and \nGovernment meet here in this Assembly, because we \nbelieve in the virtues of multilateral diplomacy. All of \nus here are sincerely concerned about the multiple \ntensions across the world. I am convinced that we all \nwish to make our full contribution to the search for \npractical, viable and long-term solutions. We are all \ninspired by the same will to manage our differences in \ndialogue and understanding. We want to call attention \nto the problems of globalization and participate in \nlaunching and strengthening the economies of our \ncountries. \n We recognize and welcome the enormous role \nthat the United Nations plays on the international \nscene, a role that needs to be considerably enhanced. \nThe scope of diplomacy has considerably widened in \nrecent years. Through the lever of international \nrelations, the United Nations has the means and the \nduty to promote cooperation based on conflict \nprevention and the efficient management of natural \ndisasters. But the United Nations still needs \nimprovement in its structure and functioning, and we \nhope that reform will soon be brought about. \n We continue to follow with keen interest and \nparticipate actively in the ongoing reform process of \nthe United Nations, particularly on the question of the \nreform of the Security Council, the revitalization of the \nGeneral Assembly, system-wide coherence, the \nmandate review and the management reform.  \nFor us, meaningful reform of the United Nations \nmust first pass through a comprehensive reform of the \nUnited Nations Security Council. At the 2005 World \nSummit, we expressed our resolve to support early \nreform of the Security Council with a view to making \nit more broadly representative, efficient and \ntransparent. There has been enough talk on this subject \nand it should not remain as mere words and intentions. \nMy Government welcomes the decision of the Open-\nended Working Group dealing with the reform of the \nSecurity Council, which has decided, inter alia, to start \nintergovernmental negotiations on the reform of the \nSecurity Council. We are convinced that the \nintergovernmental negotiations should be results-\noriented. \n Mauritius remains committed to the African \ncommon position, which calls for two permanent seats \nand five non-permanent seats for Africa in a reformed \nSecurity Council. We continue to support the legitimate \naspirations of the Latin American and Caribbean \ncountries for a permanent seat. Mauritius reiterates that \na permanent seat for India in the Security Council is \nlong overdue. As the largest democracy and a secular \nstate, India is a living example of the peaceful \ncoexistence of major religions, cultures and faiths. \nIndia can be a source of inspiration as well as a testing \nground for the outcome of the forthcoming United \nNations High-level Dialogue on Interreligious and \nIntercultural Understanding and Cooperation for Peace. \n In 1965 at the Constitutional Conference for the \ngranting of independence to Mauritius, the Chagos \nArchipelago, among many other islands, formed an \nintegral part of the territory of Mauritius and should \nhave remained as such in accordance with the Charter \nof the United Nations and General Assembly \nresolutions 1514 (1960) and 2066 (1965). Resolution \n1514 (1960) states, inter alia: \nAny attempt aimed at the partial or total \ndisruption of the national unity and the territorial \nintegrity of a country is incompatible with the \npurposes and principles of the Charter of the \nUnited Nations. (para. 6) \n The excision of the Chagos Archipelago by the \ncolonial Power at the time of our independence \nconstitutes a dismemberment of our territory in total \ndisregard of resolutions 1514 (1960) and 2066 (1965). \nFurthermore, it is also a violation of the Charter of the \nUnited Nations itself. We therefore, once again, \nreiterate our request to the United Kingdom to engage \nin bilateral dialogue with us as soon as possible with a \nview to enabling us exercise our sovereignty over the \nChagos Archipelago. \n Equally, on the question of our sovereignty over \nTromelin, we note the progress registered at the recent \nMauritius-French joint commission. The United \nKingdom and France, two permanent members of the \nUnited Nations Security Council, are two major and \nimportant economic, trade and development partners of \nMauritius. We fully appreciate their continued support \nin the development of our country. We have been \nstriving to reach an amicable agreement on these issues \nbut we cannot   and will not   compromise on our \nterritorial integrity and our sovereignty over those \nislands. \n To conclude, I should like to reaffirm my \ncountry\u2019s full faith in the United Nations. It remains \nthe only organization that offers us hope for peace and \nsecurity for a better world for future generations. \n"

        "file_text": "First of all, Mr. President, \nmay I congratulate you on your election and wish you \nwell in the months ahead. \n Upon its formation earlier this year, the Irish \nGovernment set itself the goal of becoming a model \nMember State of the this great Organization. We have \nset out an ambitious programme to be a world leader in \ndevelopment assistance, rapid response to humanitarian \ndisasters and conflict resolution. \n This is because our own history shows that there \nis a path from famine to plenty and from conflict to \npeace. And from that history has grown a \ndetermination, in ordinary Irish men and women, to \nstand in the vanguard of the fight against conflict, \nhunger and the denial of human rights, a fight best \nfought by a strong and equally determined United \nNations   a fight we cannot afford to lose. \n It is also because after six decades, the core goal \nof the United Nations   universal peace and \nsecurity   unfortunately still eludes us. Today, in spite \nof all our efforts, violent conflict remains all too \ncommon. \n The causes of conflict are many. But very often, it \nis in the persistence of poverty and in the denial of \nhuman rights that we find the causes of conflict, the \nenduring results of conflict and the seeds of future \nconflict. In making peace, we must be as creative and \nas determined as those waging war. \n The range of instruments now available \nstrengthens our collective capacity to resolve conflict. \nWe must use that full array with determination now. \nWe must ensure that the United Nations Peacebuilding \nCommission and Peacebuilding Fund are organized and \nresourced to fulfil their important mandate. We must \nmaintain our support for United Nations-mandated \npeacekeeping operations, which today are at an all-time \nhigh in terms of their size, scope and complexity. We \nmust also support strengthened United Nations efforts \nin the fields of conflict prevention and resolution. We \nin Ireland will play our part. \n My Government has decided to significantly \nincrease its commitment to conflict resolution, \nincluding through the establishment of a designated \nunit in the Foreign Ministry, the creation of an \nacademic Centre for Conflict Resolution, a system of \nroving ambassadors to affected regions and an annual \nfund of \u20ac25 million to assist conflict resolution in the \ndeveloping world. \n In the years ahead, we will also work to \nstrengthen the capacity of the African Union and \nsubregional organizations to make and build peace for \nthemselves. We will focus our efforts on peacemaking \nduring conflict and peacebuilding after conflict. We \nwill also work on identifying, distilling and sharing the \nlessons of conflict resolution. We will be particularly \nactive in Africa, including through working with our \npartner Governments under our Irish Aid programme. \nWe will explore the links between climate change and \nconflict, because climate change directly threatens not \nonly the most vulnerable but all of our shared goals of \nprogress, peace and development. \n The focus of our foreign policy on rights, \ndevelopment and now conflict resolution underlines \nonce again Ireland\u2019s commitment to the global agenda \nof the United Nations. But this convergence is also \nunderscored by our own national experience of \npeacemaking. Speaking here in New York in April \n1969, before the appalling escalation of violence in \nNorthern Ireland, one of my distinguished \npredecessors, Frank Aiken, said \u201cI think there is \nsufficient wisdom if it can only be energized in our \nsection of the world, in these islands off the North \nWest of Europe, to settle the problem.\u201d For far too long \nthat sufficient wisdom eluded us. \n For almost 40 years it has been my duty and that \nof my predecessors as Minister for Foreign Affairs to \nbrief this Assembly on the search for peace on the \nisland of Ireland. I am particularly delighted to report \nthat perhaps, save for general updates on progress, this \nwill no longer be necessary. \n The conflict in Northern Ireland lasted for more \nthan three decades and was made apparently insoluble \nby issues of national, cultural and religious identity, \ncontested historical narratives and claims of \nsovereignty, all hardened by the direct experiences of \ndivision, inequality and violence. \n Since the ceasefires of the mid-1990s and the \nnegotiation of the Good Friday Agreement in 1998, \nthere has been much better news to report. But the final \nsteps to the full implementation of that Agreement \nwere not completed until earlier this year. With the \nformation of the power-sharing Northern Ireland \nExecutive, bringing together historic opponents from \nacross the political divide, we have opened an \nextraordinary new chapter in the history of the island \nof Ireland. \n Legacies of separation and distrust remain, and \nthe inevitable challenges and difficulties of normal \npolitics will need wise and sensitive management. But \nthere is an overwhelming consensus that this new \nbeginning can be nurtured and sustained. \n The task is no longer to find peace, but to \nmaintain and build on the peace we have found. I do \nnot believe our success offers a universal, transferable \nformula, but I do believe that our experience of failure \nand then success over 40 years provides insights and \nlessons worth sharing. One of the specific tasks of our \nconflict resolution initiative is to codify those insights \nand lessons. But today I will offer just a few. \n First, in the end, those who are part of the \nproblem must be part of the solution   not because we \napprove of their actions or beliefs, but because without \nthem it is all too easy for an agreement among others to \nbe destroyed. \n Secondly, inclusive dialogue must, however, take \nplace on the basis of clear and guaranteed principles. In \nIreland, these were consent, non-violence and parity of \nesteem. \n Thirdly, partnerships between Governments and \ninvolving sympathetic third parties   in our case the \nUnited States and the European Union   can develop \ncomprehensive frameworks within which enduring \nsettlements can be reached. \n Fourthly, it is often necessary to take risks for \npeace   but those risks must be carefully calibrated. \nTiming is of the essence and so is patience, and there \nare times when contacts must be private and at arm\u2019s \nlength. \n Fifthly, our experience demonstrates the need to \naddress all issues, all of the causes of conflict, \ncomprehensively, no matter how difficult and \nintractable they may be, and even if they have to be \nresolved in different time frames. \n Sixth, popular endorsement of an agreement \nthrough the ballot box makes it immensely more \nlegitimate and durable. \n Finally, without effective and faithful \nimplementation, again often with external assistance, \nan agreement\u2019s viability and credibility can quickly ebb \naway. \n On a more practical and operational level, we \nhave devised and implemented innovative \narrangements for dealing with many of the issues that \ndominate peacemaking and peacebuilding in our case: \nconstitutional change, power sharing, cross-border \ncooperation, transitional justice, policing and security \nreform, equality and human rights, conflict over \nsymbols, arms decommissioning and prisoner release. \n In our own process, we have learned much from \nothers, particularly from the instance of South Africa. \nTogether, I hope we can, in Frank Aiken\u2019s term, \ndevelop both sufficient wisdom and sufficient will to \nresolve enduring and complex conflicts. \n Working with a strengthened United Nations and \nsharing lessons with one another, I passionately hope \nwe can advance the day when political leaders from \nother regions of the world blighted by conflict can \nannounce in this forum that peace has come to them \ntoo. \n Northern Ireland has been added to the list of \nconflicts resolved. But the road to universal peace is \nstill blocked by conflicts old, new and threatened. \n Today, across the world we stand with the people \nof Burma. The courage of the Buddhist monks and \nnuns and their supporters has won universal \nadmiration. The efforts of its regime to conceal its \nbrutality behind a wall of silence have failed. It has \nbeen rightly condemned for its violent response. I call \non its leaders at long last to respond constructively to \nthe wishes of the people, to stop their violence and to \nrelease Aung San Suu Kyi and all other political \nprisoners. The process of national reconciliation and \ndemocratization must begin in earnest, and we hope \nthat the Secretary-General\u2019s Special Envoy will be able \nto report progress on his return here in a few days. \n We look to the Security Council to respond \neffectively to the compelling calls of the international \ncommunity. It is neither acceptable nor true to argue, as \nsome of its members have, that the situation in Burma \nis not a question of international peace and security. \nThe potential regional consequences of the crisis are \nevident to all. This places a particular onus on the \nGovernments of China, India and of the countries of \nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). I \nwelcome the encouraging recent signs of positive and \nconcerned engagement and urge them to redouble their \nefforts. \n Within the European Union, Ireland has long \ntaken a strong and principled position on Burma. We \nare looking urgently at how to increase the pressure on \nthe regime, including through further European Union \nrestrictive measures, without harming the ordinary \npeople, whose suffering is already so great. \n As it is for people across the world, Darfur is a \nmatter of grave concern in Ireland. We have made it a \npriority for our diplomacy and our Irish Aid \nprogramme. We must solve the humanitarian and \nsecurity crisis while simultaneously establishing the \nfoundations for longer-term peace and development. \nWe urge the full, effective and speedy deployment of \nthe African Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in \nDarfur. Khartoum must actively cooperate and at last \ndesist from all obstruction. Rebel groups must also \nplay their part. The recent attack on peacekeepers in \nDarfur was an outrage and was rightly condemned \nhere. I would like to express my sympathies and those \nof the Irish Government to the families of those killed. \n In keeping with our proud tradition of \npeacekeeping, Ireland expects to make a substantial \ncontribution to the United Nations-mandated mission \nto Chad and the Central African Republic to help aid \nrefugees and address the regional dimension of the \nDarfur crisis. \n All those who are party to the conflict must \ncommit to the political talks in Libya next month. I \nwelcome the Secretary-General\u2019s establishment of a \ntrust fund to support these talks, and I pledge Ireland\u2019s \nsupport in that respect. If commitments are not fulfilled \nand progress does not materialize, Ireland will support \nfurther sanctions against non-cooperating parties. \n I am particularly and gravely concerned at the \nincreasingly serious humanitarian situation in \nZimbabwe. The current Southern African Development \nCommunity initiative, led by President Mbeki, offers \nthe best hope for progress and I would encourage all \nthose involved to redouble their efforts to agree on a \nnew political dispensation offering real political reform \nand economic recovery for all Zimbabweans. \n The situation in the Middle East is always high \non our agenda. There has been a collective \ninternational failure to establish a credible political \nprocess leading to a two-State solution. But today there \nare possibilities for change. The outlines of a viable \nsettlement are clear to everyone, even if it will require \ndifficult and painful compromises. Ireland strongly \nsupports the dialogue between Prime Minister Olmert \nand President Abbas. We are also encouraged by the \ndetermination of the Arab States to pursue the historic \nArab Peace Initiative. We share the hope that the \ninternational meeting now in preparation under \nSecretary Rice\u2019s leadership will indeed be serious and \nsubstantive and set in train a transformation of the \npolitical landscape and the lives of its people. \n Ireland\u2019s historic commitment to nuclear \ndisarmament and non-proliferation continues. We are \nalso active in seeking a comprehensive response to the \ncurse of cluster munitions, the appalling effects of \nwhich are all too evident in Lebanon and elsewhere. As \na contribution to the collaborative effort launched in \nOslo last February, Ireland will host a diplomatic \nconference in May 2008, which we hope will finalize \nthe first-ever international agreement on cluster \nmunitions. \n The establishment of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) spurred our efforts to \ntackle poverty and its consequences. I greatly welcome \nthe Secretary-General\u2019s establishment of the MDG \nAfrica Steering Group to lead a determined push to \nachieve our targets for 2015. \n Ireland is doing its part. We are currently \nspending more than 0.5 per cent of our gross national \nproduct on overseas development aid and will reach \n0.7 per cent by 2012. We have substantially increased \nour support to humanitarian relief operations and to \ntackling HIV/AIDS. \nBut we know that more needs to be done. The \ndonor community is failing the test set by the MDGs. \nOverseas aid has fallen by 5 per cent in real terms. It is \nnot acceptable in today\u2019s world that there are still 980 \nmillion people living in abject poverty, that half of the \ndeveloping world has no access to basic sanitation or \nthat half a million women will die in pregnancy or \nchildbirth each year. Perhaps the most damning fact is \nthat one in seven people on this Earth today do not get \nenough food to eat to have a healthy and productive \nlife. That figure jumps to one in four in sub-Saharan \nAfrica. \n To help meet that most basic of challenges, \nIreland has established a Hunger Task Force to \nexamine the root causes of that enduring source of \nmisery, disease and death. It will help us contribute to \nthe MDG goal of halving hunger and poverty. I am \ndelighted that the experts on the Hunger Task Force \ninclude Jeffrey Sachs, the Special Adviser to the \nSecretary-General on the MDGs. \n Ireland will maintain and increase its \ncommitment to the work of the United Nations in the \nfields of peace and security, development and human \nrights. There is no mystery to the challenges facing us, \neven if they are formidable. Our generation is uniquely \nequipped to know what it will take to deal with them. \nWe have the scientific knowledge, the experience, the \nresources and, through this Organization, the \nmechanism for cooperation to rise to these challenges. \nWe must summon sufficient wisdom and will to do so. \n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, at the \noutset, permit me to extend to you my warmest \ncongratulations on your election as President of the \nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-second session. I believe \nthat with your immense competence, you will lead this \nsession to a successful conclusion. I highly commend \nMr. Ban Ki-moon for his important contributions as the \nSecretary-General of the United Nations. I respectfully \nconvey to all delegates and, through them, to the \npeople of all Member countries, the greetings of \nfriendship from the Vietnamese people. \n When humankind entered the new millennium, \nwe all wished for a more peaceful world, more friendly \ninternational relations and a better life. Nearly a decade \nhas elapsed, but that wish has not come true. We are \nstill living in a world blessed with numerous \nopportunities and at the same time beset with \nadversities and challenges. It is a blessing that since \nthe establishment of the United Nations, humankind \nhas not experienced any more world wars. However, \nlocal wars and conflicts, international terrorism and the \ncontinuing arms race, including the nuclear arms race, \nremain daunting threats to our world today. \n Thanks to the miraculous scientific and \ntechnological achievements, human living conditions \nhave improved continuously. However, there remains a \nbitter reality that the gap in living standards between \nnations and population groups is increasing. Nearly \n1 billion people are still living in extreme poverty. At \nthe same time, many pressing global issues have \nemerged, of which epidemics, environmental pollution \nand climate change have proved to be serious threats to \nhuman life.  \n We note with satisfaction the rapid proliferation \nof regional and global cooperation arrangements. In the \nmeantime, the world is yet to be free from tense \nconfrontation, acts of unilateral imposition, violations \nof national independence and sovereignty, inequality \nand unfair treatment in international relations. \n All these require that together we make greater \nefforts to maintain peace and stability in all parts of the \nworld, promote equal cooperative relations between \nand among States, and ensure an international \nenvironment conducive to the development of each and \nevery nation. \n In the face of enormous challenges in the new \nmillennium, peoples of the world had high expectations \nof the United Nations and, in that connection, Viet \nNam fully associates itself with the orientations \ncharted by the United Nations summits in 2000 and \n2005 for the work of the Organization in consolidating \npeace, security, cooperation and development. \n We hope that the United Nations will, together \nwith Member States, intensify efforts to establish long-\nlasting peace in the Middle East - including efforts \naimed at an appropriate solution to the Israel-Palestine \nconflict  - put an end to conflicts and violence in a \nnumber of African countries, restore stability in Iraq \nand Afghanistan and control and prevent the \nproliferation of nuclear weapons. Viet Nam supports \nthe settlement of the Korean Peninsula issues through \ndialogue, in conformity with international law, and \nshares the Korean people\u2019s desire for peaceful \nreunification. \n The United Nations Millennium Declaration of \n2000 and its policy of promoting sustainable \ndevelopment and ensuring the harmonious combination \nof economic growth with social equity and \nenvironmental protection have elicited practical \nresponses from Member States. Viet Nam hopes that \nthe United Nations will play a more active role in that \nprocess in order to create further opportunities for \nunderdeveloped countries to escape poverty and \nadvance with the mainstream countries of the world. In \nthat light, Viet Nam hopes that the Doha Round will be \nconcluded soon to facilitate a fair international trading \nsystem. \n Viet Nam strongly supports development \ncooperation between countries and the establishment of \nequal international relations in economic, financial and \ntrade areas with special attention paid to the needs of \ndeveloping and least developed countries, including the \nremoval of imposed economic blockades and \nembargoes. We hope that the United Nations will have \nmore resources for development cooperation, with \npriority given to the implementation of programmes of \naction on poverty reduction, advancement of women, \nchild care, population planning and HIV/AIDS \nprevention. Viet Nam strongly supports common \nefforts, especially the efforts of the United Nations, to \nprotect the environment and to better respond to \nclimate change. \n For the United Nations to fulfil its noble mandate \nin a vastly changed world, the question of United \nNations reform has been raised and keenly discussed. \nViet Nam holds that the process of reform should be \nintensified and goes along with the common \nunderstanding that the reforms should ensure the broad \nparticipation of all Member States and should be \ncarried out in a transparent manner. Reform should also \nbuild upon past experience and, at the same, have a \ncomprehensive forward-looking vision. \n In 1945, the United Nations was founded, right at \na time when the Vietnamese people had just gained \ntheir independence. Stemming from the belief in the \npurposes and principles of the United Nations and the \ndesire to contribute to the work of that new \ninternational organization, as early as in January 1946, \nPresident Ho Chi Minh, the founder of the new \nVietnamese State, wrote to the first session of the \nUnited Nations General Assembly, stating clearly, \u201cOur \nnation has gained independence and earnestly requests \nthat you recognize our independence and admit our \nnation into the United Nations\u201d. \n Regrettably, it was not until 1977 that Viet Nam \nbecame a full Member of the United Nations. Over the \npast 30 years in its capacity as a United Nations \nMember, Viet Nam has always worked actively for \npeace, stability, cooperation and development in the \nworld. Viet Nam has made significant contributions to \nturning South-East Asia from a war-divided region of \nconfrontation into one of peace, friendship and \ncooperation, which is now moving towards an \nAssociation of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) \nCommunity based on the three pillars: political and \nsecurity matters, economic matters, and cultural and \nsocial matters. \n It is our consistent position to support efforts \ntowards the peaceful settlement of conflicts, upholding \nnational independence and state sovereignty, promoting \ndevelopment programmes, tackling global social issues \nand establishing equal international political and \neconomic relations for mutual benefit. \n Viet Nam will continue with its policy of being a \nfriend and reliable partner to all countries, striving for \npeace, independence, cooperation and development. \nWe have established diplomatic relations with 174 \ncountries and economic and trade ties with almost all \ncountries and territories in the world. Viet Nam is an \nactive member of many other regional and global \norganizations and forums. Most recently, Viet Nam \njoined the World Trade Organization as its 150th \nmember. Viet Nam has been elected to the governing \npositions of many United Nations bodies and is now \nworking closely with United Nations development \norganizations to implement the \u201cOne United Nations\u201d \ninitiative in Viet Nam as a pilot country. \n We highly appreciate the assistance and support \nextended by United Nations organizations to Viet Nam. \nOur significant achievements in socio-economic \ndevelopment have enabled Viet Nam to fulfil a number \nof Millennium Development Goals ahead of schedule, \nespecially in poverty reduction. That is also \nattributable to the support of the international \ncommunity. \n We consider it important to promote South-South \ncooperation. Despite being a poor country, we \nparticipated actively in the tripartite cooperation \narrangement between Viet Nam and a United Nations \nagency to support African countries in the agricultural \nsector. So far, that programme has produced \nencouraging results. \n With the desire to make further contributions to \nthe work of the international community, in 1997 Viet \nNam decided to run for a non-permanent seat on the \nSecurity Council for the 2008-2009 term. I take the \nopportunity to sincerely thank the Asian Group for \nendorsing Viet Nam as the only candidate of the \ncontinent. We are also grateful to other Member States \nfor their broad support. \n Viet Nam is fully aware of the great honour and \nheavy responsibility of being a non-permanent member \nof the Security Council, a body entrusted with the \nprimary mission of maintaining international peace and \nsecurity. If elected, Viet Nam will fully adhere to the \npurposes and principles enshrined in the United \nNations Charter and will do its utmost to cooperate \nwith other members to fulfil that important task. \n Viet Nam will work closely with other countries \nto reduce tension and to prevent and peacefully settle \nconflicts in different parts of the world. We will fulfil \nour obligations as a party to all major international \nconventions and treaties on the non-proliferation of \nweapons of mass destruction. We condemn, and are \nalso committed to the elimination of, international \nterrorism in all its forms and manifestations and in \naccordance with international law. \n Viet Nam welcomes and is willing to participate \nin mechanisms both within and outside the Security \nCouncil to increase assistance aimed at the national \nreconstruction and development of conflict-ridden \ncountries. As a nation that has experienced post-war \nreconstruction and has accomplished important \nachievements on its development path, Viet Nam also \nwishes to share its experiences with other countries \nthroughout the world. \n Mindful of the active role played by United \nNations peacekeeping operations, Viet Nam has made \nfinancial contributions to and participated in a number \nof United Nations activities to restore peace in various \ncountries. We are completing the preparatory process \nfor our effective participation in United Nations \npeacekeeping operations, in keeping with our \ncircumstances and capacity. \n We share the view that, if the Security Council is \nto work more effectively, it must be further reformed to \nachieve greater representativeness and greater \ndemocracy in its working methods. We also support \nstrengthening the Council\u2019s relationships with regional \norganizations. It is therefore encouraging that, at the \npresent session, the Association of Southeast Asian \nNations and the United Nations just signed a \ncooperation agreement. \n I believe that, as a result of its open and \nconstructive foreign policy and its active contributions \nto international peace and security and development \ncooperation, Viet Nam will receive full support from \nall Member States for its candidature for a \nnon-permanent seat on the Security Council for the \nterm 2008-2009. We will do whatever we can to fulfil \nthat important aspiration.  \n Viet Nam will always be an active, constructive, \ncooperative and responsible member of the \ninternational community, living up to the expectations \nof all Member States. On behalf of the Government and \nthe people of Viet Nam, I express the sincere hope that \nthe sixty-second session of the General Assembly will \nbe successful, meeting the expectations of the peoples \nof the world in the service of peace, security, \ncooperation and development. \n"

        "file_text": "First of all, we would like to extend to Mr. Srgjan \nKerim our warmest congratulations on his unanimous \nelection as President of the General Assembly for the \ncurrent session and to say that the delegation that I \nhave the honour of leading is greatly pleased to see \nhim presiding over the work of the Assembly. We \nwould like also to pay a well-deserved tribute to the \noutgoing President, who conducted the work of the last \nsession with great wisdom and distinction. \n We would also like to convey to the Secretary-\nGeneral, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, the great appreciation and \nencouragement of His Excellency Mr. Pierre \nNkurunziza, President of the Republic of Burundi, and \nof our Government, for the tireless efforts that he has \nbeen making since he took office to defend and \npromote the noble ideals of our Organization. \n Building a viable world for humanity is a task \nthat is incumbent upon the international community \nand every one of its members. Our position in Burundi \nis that, in strengthening peace and justice within our \nborders, we are also contributing to the harmonious \ndevelopment of this world. It is in this context that the \nGovernment of Burundi is sparing no effort both within \nthe country and at the regional level to establish an \nenvironment conducive to the strengthening of peace \nand security, the rule of law and development. \n We are pleased to state that the signing of the \nComprehensive Ceasefire Agreement, which took place \non 7 September 2006 between the Government and the \nForces nationales de lib\u00e9ration (FNL) rebel movement \ngreatly contributed to a return to peace and stability in \nour country. That paved the way for talks on specific \naspects concerning the implementation of the \nAgreement in a calm setting. Some weeks ago, the FNL \nmovement unilaterally decided to suspend the talks \nwithout offering any truly convincing reasons. \nHowever, we are not discouraged because we believe \nthat this is simply a hitch that will not have a lasting \nimpact on the gains which everyone wants to preserve. \n Efforts are currently being made for a prompt \nresumption of the talks. A regional summit on the issue \nshould take place shortly to encourage the FNL \nmovement to return to the negotiating table, which is \nthe only acceptable way to achieve a lasting peace. In \nany case, the Government of Burundi remains open to \nall proposals that would bring together the necessary \nconditions for this effort. \n The return to peace has also favoured the \nimplementation of programmes that are priorities for \nthe Government in areas such as national \nreconciliation, education and health for all, \nreconstruction and economic recovery. Issues related to \ngood political and economic governance, once taboo \nbecause of their sensitive nature, are now openly and \nregularly discussed, and concrete action is being taken \nto improve the situation. \n To achieve greater success in the delicate task of \nnational reconciliation, the people of Burundi have no \nchoice but to review together the history of their \ncountry which, in several ways, is characterized by \nsome dark periods. Indeed, the Government has begun \nnegotiations with the Secretary-General in order to set \nup a truth and reconciliation commission. We are soon \ngoing to begin national consultations on this question; \nthe outcome should provide a solid basis for the \nestablishment and operation of such a Commission. \nThe civil war which ravaged our country greatly \nimpoverished the Burundian population. We are eager \nto gradually resolve the problem of poverty and to \nreach the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), we \nhave taken measures to offer free health care to \nchildren under the age of five and to pregnant mothers \nin public health clinics, and also to provide free \nprimary school education. \n The Government has also set up the Strategic \nFramework for Accelerating Economic Growth and \nReducing Poverty, which was adopted at the national \nand international levels and which was submitted to \nour development partners at the Bujumbura round table \nheld in May 2007. Our country\u2019s appeal to the \ninternational community had a positive reception: \nfunding for our priority programmes for the period \n2007-2010 has been pledged.  \n We take this opportunity to reiterate the gratitude \nof the Government and the people of Burundi to all of \nour partners for their generous contributions at the \nround table. We would be sincerely grateful if their \npledges could be redeemed so that we can satisfy the \nmost urgent needs of our population as soon as \npossible.  \n Working with the Peacebuilding Commission, my \nGovernment has also set up a Strategic Framework for \nPeacebuilding in Burundi. This is a framework that \ninvolves all of the national and international socio-\npolitical partners in contributing to strengthening the \nreturn to peace and ensuring that the resurgence of \ndeadly crises will be a thing of the past. \n We would also like to take this opportunity to \nexpress our gratitude to the Commission for the \npositive results we have already achieved together, as \nwell as for the support of the Peacebuilding Fund, from \nwhich my country has generously benefited. \n We are convinced that peace and security can be \naffirmed only in one\u2019s house and in one\u2019s immediate \nenvironment. Burundi is playing an active role within \nthe regional framework in the work of the Tripartite \nPlus Joint Commission, including the Democratic \nRepublic of the Congo, Rwanda, Uganda and Burundi. \nThis Commission is a suitable forum for us to discuss \nour security issues in a straightforward fashion \u2014 \nnamely, the presence of many armed groups that are \ncirculating and dangerously jeopardizing the \ndemocratic gains made in the development of our \nmember countries. Moreover, on 15 December 2006, at \nthe International Conference of the Great Lakes region, \nheads of State and Government of 11 member \ncountries, including our own country, Burundi, signed \na Pact on Security, Stability and Development in the \nGreat Lakes Region, with the ultimate objective of \nmaking this zone an area of peace, economic growth \nand sustainable and shared growth. Burundi had the \nhonour of being elected by its peers to host the \nheadquarters of the Executive Secretariat of this \nConference. \n Furthermore, in re-launching the Economic \nCommunity of the Great Lakes countries (CEPGL), \nalong with Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of the \nCongo, and in joining the East African Community, \nwhich includes the United Republic of Tanzania, \nUganda, Kenya and Rwanda, we are motivated by a \ndesire to build a peaceful, prosperous and united world. \n There are still tensions that mark the international \nsituation and new sources of instability and uncertainty \nhave emerged. It is undeniable that remarkable work \nhas been achieved in recent years within the framework \nof our Organization, as well as in continental and \nregional organizations. Pockets of tension have now \nbeen eliminated, and others are on the verge of being \nso. However, we are concerned by the continuation of \nbloody conflicts in Somalia and Darfur, in Iraq, in the \nMiddle East, to mention but a few. Despite the efforts \nthat have been made and the means that have been \ndeployed, there is still a great deal to be done. Burundi \ndecided to lend its modest contribution to resolving \nsome of these crises by providing military observers \nand police personnel for Darfur and military \npeacekeeping contingents in Somalia within the \nframework of operations set up by the African Union. \n We know full well that conflict prevention is an \nongoing concern of the international community. \nStabilization efforts and peacekeeping operations are \nan eloquent testimony to this. We must accompany this \nprocess by strengthening the prerogatives of the \nSecretary-General in the area of preventive diplomacy \nto prevent minor conflicts from becoming larger, open \nconflicts. In this respect, conflict prevention can be \neffective only if we take into account the nagging \nquestion of the proliferation of small arms and light \nweapons, which is a dangerous, destabilizing factor. \n We would like to launch a vibrant appeal to the \ncountries that produce small arms and light weapons to \nadopt responsible export policies that would truly help \nto curb illicit flows of these weapons. The same applies \nto the question of disarmament, which our country \nconsiders crucial if we want a rapid return to security, \npeace and development. We say this from experience, \nbecause in Burundi, the proliferation of small arms and \nlight weapons, as well as in other countries of the \nGreat Lakes region, continue to cause destruction in \nterms of human lives and social and economic \ninfrastructure, and it always un-does any reconstruction \nand development effort that we are trying to achieve. \n International terrorism is another major challenge \nto global peace and security. This phenomenon can be \nseen on all continents, thus proving very clearly that \nterrorism knows no borders. The absence of a suitable \nand effective strategy to eliminate this scourge places \nus at its mercy. These situations should be one of the \ntop challenges for the United Nations family. Our \nOrganization, therefore, must be a tool at everyone\u2019s \nservice in all countries, a tool capable of raising hopes, \nof dispelling concerns and of restoring respect for the \nrule of international law. \n In this context, we must all agree and decide to \nmake our Organization more operational, more \npragmatic, more democratic and capable of fulfilling \nits mission, a mission that is to be accomplished in full \ncooperation with the regional organizations whose \neffectiveness in the area of conflict prevention and \nintervention is well known, despite often insufficient \nresources. Thus, we express the hope that Security \nCouncil reform, which has long been advocated and \ndiscussed, will finally become a reality, with a \ncomposition that respects the representation of \ncontinents that, until now, have been excluded from the \ncategory of permanent members, such as Africa, our \ncontinent. \n Although the cold war is over, we are forced to \nacknowledge that social relations have crystallized into \ntwo blocs with almost antagonistic and diverging \ninterests \u2014 that is to say, the rich on one side and the \npoor on the other. It is high time to humanize relations \nbetween the two blocs and to encourage specific \nmeasures through respect for commitments that have \nbeen taken. Otherwise, we will see the continuation of \nnew societal phenomena, such as the brain drain, \nworsening crime, sex industry and international \nmigratory pressure, which stir up passions and spark \ncontroversy. \n To conclude, Sir, the gathering of such a large \nnumber of high-level officials makes it possible to take \nthe pulse of the political situation as well as of the \ninternational social and economic situation. It makes it \npossible for us to observe our weaknesses and our \npotential. We believe that solutions to the different \nproblems that have been mentioned in the course of \nthis debate are always possible, as long as there is a \nminimum of political will. It is that minimum, which is \nrequired of every member of our Organization, that we \nshould all try to obtain together. \n"

        "file_text": "Each opportunity to \nspeak from this rostrum is a humbling experience, \nbecause I know that all the countries of the world listen \nto one another and try to discern and understand where \nour common approaches and interests lie. Those of us \nwho represent small countries have a sense that this \nforum is a place where large nations address the ills of \nthe world and that we smaller ones ought to stick to \nissues and topics that are specific to us and to our \nregions, as if addressing overarching, global issues \nwere pretentious and best left to those with the power \nto do something about them. \n Today marks my tenth year here, and I risk \nbreaking the rule. This year, as financial calamities \nhave compounded political and natural disasters, it has \nbecome very clear that, although our common \nproblems and challenges threaten us all equally, they \naffect us unevenly. The small nations, which have less \nof everything \u2014 diversity, resources, manoeuvrability, \nmeans and options \u2014 are at greater peril and have \ngreater susceptibility than those with bigger territories, \nlarger populations and greater potential. \n At the same time, the issues on the agenda of the \nGeneral Assembly \u2014 such as peace and security, \neconomic growth, sustainable development, human \nrights, disarmament, drugs, crime and international \nterrorism \u2014 know no borders, and none of us can \naddress them individually if we want to see effective \nsolutions. Finding solutions to these problems is in our \ncommon interest, for they are issues that affect all of \nhumanity. And because these problems cannot be \nsolved within our own borders, no one has either the \nright to abdicate responsibility for the consequences or \nthe luxury of doing so. \n When the speculative market drives the price of \noil to $80, those who are too small to have significant \nreserves are the ones who are affected most, and large \ncountries with large appetites for fuel sometimes make \ndeals on energy matters that are not consistent with \ntheir policies. So do we, because energy security is not \nonly a matter of global arithmetic; it is also a matter of \nlife and death. \n When climate change causes serious changes in \nthe environment, it does not take much for a prolonged \ndrought or an excessive rain to harm our agriculture \nand damage our economy or for rising sea levels to \nreach our cities. But we do not have the space or the \ndiversity to cope and adapt. \n When it is news that there have been no \nexplosions in Iraq and when daily calamities are \ncommonplace, we in the small countries begin to sense \nthat we are vulnerable and susceptible to the will and \nthe capacity of other members of the international \ncommunity and, most important, to their tolerance of \ndistant acts of violence and humiliation. \n When development is dependent on the absence \nof bad weather, disease and war, and when the capacity \nto ward off at least two of those three ills lies in the \nhands of those who have the ability to bring peace and \nto heal, we in the small nations feel at risk and \nhelpless.  \n When disarmament and arms control cease to be \ninstruments for peace and security and instead become \na means to reap political dividends, we in the small \ncountries turn to our own means for self-protection. In \nother words, we become part of the problem, because \nthe solution is not straightforward or visible.  \n Finally, when \u201cDarfur\u201d becomes shorthand for \n\u201chelplessness\u201d, we in the small nations of the world \nrealize that power has replaced responsibility. The \nubiquitous language of human rights cannot and will \nnot compensate for a lack of political will to act. \nGenocide must be prevented, not commemorated.  \n Generation after generation, we find new places \nfor appalling human tolerance of inhuman \nmachinations and names for places of slaughter, mass \nkillings and massacres of those who belong to a \nparticular sector, ethnic group, race or religion. For \nArmenia, it was, for 100 years, the desert of Der el \nZor; for the next generation, it was Auschwitz; later, it \nwas the killing fields of Cambodia; and, more recently, \nit was Rwanda. If each one of those names, together \nwith the word \u201cgenocide\u201d, evokes ignorance, \nhelplessness and the covering up of war crimes, \n\u201cDarfur\u201d today is synonymous with expediency, \nevasion and simple inconvenience. \u201cDarfur\u201d is \nsynonymous with shame. \n My appeal to the international community, on \nbehalf of the small countries, is that it address each of \nthese issues on its own merits and for its own sake, not \nas a piece of the global power puzzle. When tension \nrises between global Powers, it leads to polarization, \nand that in turn leads to a decrease in the capacity of \nsmall nations to carry out hard-earned policies of \ncomplementarity and balance. Our ability to be part of \nthe process diminishes. \n Let me state the obvious: we count on the \nwillingness of the great Powers in the international \ncommunity to set aside their disputes and to try to \naddress these issues collectively. We also expect that \nthey clearly understand that their power and influence \ndo not make them immune from the consequences of \nthe processes and problems that afflict us. \n Last month, Armenia celebrated its sixteenth year \nof independence. During this period, we have \nweathered sea changes that have swept us up in \nregional and global processes that affect us in our daily \nlives. But we can only take pride in what we have \naccomplished during the same period: an open and \ndiverse economy, high growth and strong financial \nsystems, as well as improved elections, stronger public \ninstitutions and a population that is increasingly aware \nof its rights. All of that gives us the confidence and \ndetermination to address other ills facing our society \u2014 \nuneven growth, a high poverty rate, low pay \u2014 and to \nstrengthen our human institutions and deepen our \nexperience with democracy.  \n We have accomplished all of this under difficult \ncircumstances. We still have a conflict to resolve with a \nneighbour; there are artificial limitations on Armenia\u2019s \nability to act; and regional cooperation is lacking.  \n The agenda of the General Assembly this year \nincludes an item on protracted conflicts. Lumping all \nthose conflicts together is an inherently flawed \napproach. Our own conflict in Nagorny Karabakh does \nnot belong there. The United Nations is not the place to \naddress it, because that issue is being addressed within \nthe Organization for Security and Cooperation in \nEurope. Additionally, Karabakh is not a frozen conflict. \nWe are negotiating with Azerbaijan and are inching \ntowards a resolution.  \n Second, during this time, there has been an \nevolution of the process. We have a balanced, solid \ndocument in our hands that addresses not only the core \nissues but also consequential issues, and the two \ntogether add up to a reasonable solution. \n Third, at the core of our process lies the right of \npeoples to self-determination. Indeed, the people of \nKarabakh do not want anything more than that which is \ntheirs. They want to live in peace and security on their \nown territory. In other words, they would like to \nexercise the very right that every single nation in this \nHall has exercised at some time in their history.  \n Speaking of conflict, we also follow very closely \nthe events in Kosovo. We hear the international \ncommunity loud and clear when it is said that Kosovo \nwill not be a precedent for other conflicts. We are not \nattempting to make Kosovo a precedent for our \nconflict, because that contradicts our own principle that \nall conflicts are different. At the same time, however, \nwe will not accept or understand the reverse logic, \nwhich holds that because Kosovo has been given \nindependence, other peoples cannot achieve \nself-determination. No one should tell us that there is a \nquota for liberty and freedom. \n At the end of the day, the willingness and \nunderstanding of small nations and their involvement \nin global processes cannot be a substitute for what \nmajor Powers with greater capacities and political will \nto act can do. In this age of openness and inclusion, \nthere is no room for the old instruments of coercion \nand exclusion. Instead, we need new instruments of \ncompromise and consensus so that we can achieve \nhumanity\u2019s enduring goal of living in peace and \nprosperity. \n"

        "file_text": "Permit me first to \ncongratulate you, Sir, on your election as President of \nthe General Assembly at its sixty-second session. The \nAssembly is certainly the richer for the wealth of \ndiplomatic experience that you bring to the job. \n Yesterday there was a vibrant debate in this Hall \non the critical issue of climate change, which is a main \ntheme of this year\u2019s session. The phenomenon of \nconsensus among contributors portends catastrophic \nimpact on the whole globe, but more especially on poor \ncountries, which are least equipped financially and \ntechnologically to adapt in a sustained manner. Since it \nis generally accepted that the threat is universal, it is \nGhana\u2019s considered view that the United Nations \nshould be vested with the authority to fashion a full-\nfledged agency equipped with the necessary scientific \nand technological resources to study the problem \nglobally and to focus on where and when it is going to \noccur so that, through the organization, such places can \nbe prepared, with due warning and relief, to adapt to \nthe impact. \n Leaving the problem to individual nations, \nespecially in the developing world, cannot be the way \nforward. There should be shared responsibility, even if \nvarious solutions are sought. In any case, this menace \nmust be tackled on an emergency basis by the \nOrganization and all its Member nations, individually \nand collectively, for humanity\u2019s survival. \n On 6 March 2007, Ghana celebrated the fiftieth \nanniversary of its independence as a sovereign nation. \nGhanaians were overwhelmed by the incredible level \nof goodwill from well-wishers around the world. \nPermit me to use this occasion to convey Ghana\u2019s \nheartfelt thanks and appreciation to the members of the \nAssembly and, indeed, to the rest of the world for the \nsingular solidarity displayed to us on that occasion. \nMay all the peoples of the world become one and be at \npeace with each other. \n In line with its independence ideal of freedom of \njustice and a jubilant spirit of renewal, Ghana has \nrededicated itself to respect for human rights, \ndemocracy, good governance and sound economy to \nenable its people to develop their full potential for \nsustained national development.  \n Again, recalling its role in Africa\u2019s liberation \nstruggle against colonialism and apartheid, Ghana has \nonce more committed itself to working in harmony and \nunion with sister African nations and also in \npartnership with the global community, as far as it is \nfeasible, to end years of impunity, exploitation and bad \ngovernance, which have undermined the economic \ngrowth and development of the continent. Henceforth, \nall energies should be directed at empowering the \ncontinent through accountable and transparent \ngovernance, economic growth and sustainable \ndevelopment to enable it to tackle the myriad problems \nthat afflict it and to facilitate its launching into \nmainstream globalization. \n In July this year, Ghana had the honour of hosting \nthe ninth Ordinary Session of the Summit of the \nAfrican Union in Accra. The sole agenda of the \nSummit was to stage a grand debate in search of a \ncontinental union government to accelerate the growth \nand development of Africa and its peoples in a \nsustained manner. After very frank and fruitful \ndeliberations, the Summit firmly resolved to launch \ncertain necessary steps towards achieving that laudable \nobjective. \n To pave the way, the Summit continues to place \nhigh priority on the resolution and prevention of \nconflicts within and among member nations. The \nAfrican Union Peace and Security Council is tasked to \ndevelop a robust and dependable security architecture \non the continent, including the setting up of an African \nstandby force as soon as possible. Those initiatives, \nwhich are supported by the international community, \nhave already helped to reduce significantly the high \nincidence of armed conflicts, which have been common \non the continent over the past four decades.  \n In line with our concerted efforts to restore peace \nand stability in Africa, the prevailing crises in the \nDarfur region of the Sudan and in Somalia and the \nEthiopia-Eritrea conflict must be resolved. Similarly, \nmeasures to consolidate peace in countries that are \nemerging from conflict, such as Burundi, Guinea-\nBissau, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Liberia, Sierra Leone and the \nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, must be \nsubstantially supported by the Organization and the \ninternational community to avoid a relapse. \n To that end, we commend the efforts of the \nPeacebuilding Commission, whose first annual report \n(A/62/137) highlights the challenges associated with \npost-conflict reconstruction and development of \ncountries such as Sierra Leone and Burundi. As a \nmember and a Vice-Chair, Ghana will work diligently \nwith other members to achieve the goals of the \nCommission.  \n We also welcome Security Council resolution \n1769 (2007), authorizing the deployment of a hybrid \noperation in Darfur, with the consent of the \nGovernment of the Sudan, and call for its speedy \nimplementation within the agreed time frame. Here, we \nacknowledge the tireless joint efforts of the African \nUnion and the Security Council, which finally got the \nGovernment of the Sudan and the Darfur warring \nfactions to resume dialogue. \n We also recognize the special initiative being \ntaken by Secretary-General Ban and the Libyan leader, \nBrother Muammar Al-Qadhafi, to get the remaining \nwarring factions to join the dialogue in order to \nachieve full-scale and rounded negotiations.  \n Meanwhile, the ongoing peace initiative in \nSomalia is proving extremely challenging and well \nbeyond the capacity of the African Union alone. We are \ntherefore calling for the concerted and timely support \nof the United Nations. In that respect, we urge the \nOrganization to consider the African Union\u2019s request \nfor financial, logistical and technical support towards \nthe full and effective deployment of the African Union \nMission in Somalia (AMISOM). That will be within \nthe letter and spirit of Security Council resolution 1772 \n(2007), adopted in August 2007. It will enable Member \nStates, such as Ghana, which have pledged to \ncontribute troops to do so. A contingency plan for the \npossible deployment of a United Nations force to \nreplace AMISOM by next February must also be \ndeveloped. \n Decidedly, Africa is making progress, with \nimprovement in the macromanagement of many \nAfrican economies. Average gross domestic product \ngrowth has increased steadily, from 5.2 per cent in \n2005 to 5.7 per cent in 2006 to the current 6 per cent, \nwhich is expected to be sustained or even exceeded in \ncoming years. Africa is therefore more than ready for \ngood business. This is evidenced by the increasing \ninterest shown by both local and foreign investors. In \nthe mean time, the African Union\u2019s agency, New \nPartnership for Africa\u2019s Development (NEPAD), is \nseriously engaged in studying viable projects that \nshould prove strategic to opening up the entire \ncontinent and its economy for accelerated \ndevelopments. Energy, communications and \ninfrastructure development rank highly in this.  \n The African Peer Review Mechanism (APRM) is \nalso a NEPAD creation. The Mechanism has already \nproven helpful in deepening respect for human rights \nand democracy, as well as transparent and accountable \ngovernance. Indeed, as more countries voluntarily \nsubscribe to it, the Mechanism\u2019s real value as a \ncreative and ingenious process for addressing many of \nthe root causes of conflict is becoming evident. The \nGeneral Assembly\u2019s decision to endorse NEPAD as a \nframework for cooperation with the African Union is, \ntherefore, timely and appreciated.  \n There has been a general improvement in the \nrelationships between Africa and the various developed \nparts of the world and regional blocs. This is reflected \nin various initiatives including the Millennium \nChallenge Account and the African Growth and \nOpportunity Act of the United States of America; the \nAfrican, Caribbean and Pacific agreements with the \nEuropean Union; the Tokyo International Conference \non African Development with Japan; the Forum on \nChina-Africa Cooperation; the Indo-Africa Forum for \nCooperation and the Africa-Brazil forum, among many \nothers.  \n Despite this trend, however, there is still a serious \ngap in official development assistance. This must be \nbridged quickly to enable struggling African nations to \nattain the Millennium Development Goals. The \ndeveloped partners are, therefore, urged to fulfil their \npledges.  \n On the world trade talks, we urge them to commit \nseriously to the aid-for-trade appeal as a critical \nprinciple in the Doha Round. Similarly, on the \nproposed economic partnership agreement, the \nEuropean Union should agree to relax the timeline for \nconclusion. They should also agree to review timelines \nfor trade barriers and procurement, given that the \nrather weak economies of many African, Caribbean and \nPacific nations might not be able to withstand the \nshocks of implementation in the short to medium term \nwithout some adjustment.  \n The Secretary-General\u2019s proposal to establish the \nOffice for Disarmament Affairs within the Secretariat \nto be part of the decision-making process is timely, \nowing to the proliferation of small arms and light \nweapons and the menace of terrorism. In many places \nin the world, these dangers together constitute the real \nweapons of mass destruction. Ghana welcomes \ninitiatives like the restructuring of the Department of \nPeacekeeping Operations and the establishment of the \nDepartment of Field Support. The latter initiative will \nnot only reduce the work of the Department of \nPeacekeeping Operations but will also help to promote \nits efficiency, accountability and transparency.  \n The General Assembly's approval of the overhaul \nof the system of administration of justice at the United \nNations, for the first time in 60 years is also long \noverdue and commendable. However, Ghana urges the \nOrganization to reflect also on mechanisms for the \nenforcement of the judgments of the International \nCourt of Justice.  \n Conflicts, particularly those in the developing \nworld, have consistently undermined policies to \nimprove the circumstances of our peoples. Sustainable \ndevelopment can be achieved only in an international \nenvironment of peace and security. The United Nations \nremains the main and the best multilateral instrument \navailable for guaranteeing such an environment and for \npromoting fruitful international cooperation, especially \nin this era of globalization. All its Member States \nshould, therefore, be committed unequivocally to its \nideals and purposes.  \n To conclude, permit me once again to wish the \nSecretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, Godspeed during \nhis tenure and to assure him of Ghana\u2019s continued \ncooperation and support.  \n"

        "file_text": "Samoa would like to  congratulate the President on his election as President \nof the General Assembly. We fully support the agenda \nthat will guide our work during his tenure. In the same \nspirit, Samoa would like to extend its best wishes to \nthe new Secretary-General as he leads our Organization \nthrough new and uncharted waters during these \ndifficult times. \n The High-level Event on Climate Change held \nearlier this week underscored two fundamental truths, \nnamely, that climate change is solvable   with the \nsolution firmly in our hands   and that the United \nNations continues to be an indispensable institution in \nour search for answers to the global challenges \nconfronting humankind. From all accounts, the  \nHigh-level Event was a considerable success; but \nsuccess is measured not in the number of statements \ndelivered, nor in the level of participation, but in the \npolitical will to translate undertakings into concrete \nresults on the ground to usher in an effective and \ncomprehensive post-Kyoto agreement. The time for \nrhetoric is over. We need to convert our good words \ninto deeds. \n Climate change, like many other global \nchallenges, crosses borders uninvited. It has no respect \nfor national sovereignty and does not discriminate \nbetween countries   whether rich or poor, large or \nsmall, resilient or vulnerable. Its dire consequences are \nreal and everywhere for all to see, including those who \nwould prefer to remain unconvinced. Climate change \ncannot be wished away. Even those countries that have \nbeen in denial to date must surely now accept the \nweight of scientific evidence and concede that climate \nchange, facilitated largely through human-induced \nactivities, poses one of the gravest threats to \nhumankind and to the continuation of life in our world \nas we know it today. \n Obviously, we have failed badly as custodians of \nthe planet and its future. But apportioning blame for \nthe present state of our environment is itself yet \nanother human failing. It serves no useful purpose. \nBeing judgmental will not restore our environment. \nThose who exploit the traditional divide between \ndeveloped and developing countries, and ideological \nand political differences, do so conveniently to mask \ntheir unwillingness to be part of the solution to an \nimpending catastrophe. \n Climate change is a societal problem that requires \na decisive response from the world community. It is a \nglobal challenge that should unite us. In division there \nis little we can do. But as a truly united world \ncommunity there is a great deal that could be achieved \nto at least arrest, and even reverse, the threat of climate \nchange. A timely example of what can be achieved \nwhen the political commitment to cooperate is present \nis the Pacific Alliance for Sustainability, an innovative \napproach by the Global Environment Facility (GEF) \nfor expedited access to GEF resources by Pacific island \ncountries to meet some of the adaptation and \nmitigation needs associated with climate change. \n The United Nations remains our last best hope to \nprovide the political will and the necessary \ncommitment to turn the tide against climate change. \nSamoa calls upon those Member States of the \nOrganization in a position of world leadership to lead \nthe charge in finding and implementing solutions to the \ncauses of climate change. As present custodians of our \nworld\u2019s environment, we owe it to our children and to \nfuture generations to do what needs to be done quickly \nand decisively, before we run out of time. It is \ntherefore imperative to complete a post-2012 climate \nchange agreement that is effective, binding, capable of \nbeing swiftly implemented and universally owned and \nrespected by the 192 Member States of the United \nNations. \n In the global work that needs to be done to \naddress climate change, and indeed in any of the other \nweighty challenges facing our world, we of course look \nto nations in positions of leadership to lead by good \nexample. In the all-important pillars of the United \nNations   concerning economic development, human \nrights, peace and security   nations in leadership roles \nmust as a matter of principle protect the interests of the \nweak and vulnerable. They should accord priority and \ngive their full attention to finding solutions to issues of \nglobal concern.  \n In the same way that nations in leadership roles \nare called to account in doing the right thing for our \nworld, so must all the Member States of the United \nNations uphold their part of the bargain in the work \nthat needs to be done. Without that cooperation from \nall Member States, reaching the objectives we all know \nshould be achieved will continue to elude us. Solutions \nto liberate our world from the tyranny and futility of \nwar, the social and economic inequalities that we are \ntrapped in and the uncontrolled and wild spread of \nepidemic diseases have all been mapped out. They \nhave been discussed, debated, negotiated and, in most \ncases, agreed to over the life of the Organization. \n As with climate change, global long-term \nchallenges that continue to remain unsolved should be \napproached collectively and positively within the \nframework of the United Nations. An integrated \napproach is desirable, given the interconnectedness and \nthe mutually reinforcing nature of the issues. That calls \nfor visionary and far-sighted leaders, statesmen and \nstateswomen who are not deterred from making the \nright decisions. \n That is much to ask for in a world of unequal \nresource endowments, size, status and strength   \nwhere national interests take precedence over the \nglobal good and where policies are selected, not \nbecause they are the right and correct thing to do, but \nbecause of their acceptability to the voting \nconstituents, how much they cost and who pays the bill \nat the end of the day. But times are changing. \n The world is one global family, and no country \nexists in isolation. Interdependence is the norm, and \nnone is immune from the reaches of the global \nproblems challenging our very existence. As history \nhas shown, no one country, however powerful and \nwilling, can remain aloof and be able to solve all those \nproblems on its own. The United Nations therefore \nremains the best means to achieve multilateral \ncooperation in so many important areas. With unity of \npurpose and mind among the membership of the United \nNations, we would have every reason to be optimistic \nabout finding solutions to the problems that beset our \nworld. \n That is why Samoa supports the efforts to \nstrengthen and reform the United Nations and its \nconstituent parts to make them cost-effective and \nefficient when responding to the needs of stakeholders. \nCentral to the reorganization is a revitalized General \nAssembly as the primary policy- and  \ndecision-making organ of the United Nations. It should \nalso include a functioning Security Council, whose \nmembership should be increased in both categories to \nmirror present day realities, including those with the \ncapacity and the disposition to contribute to the \nCouncil\u2019s work and its legitimacy. Moreover, we \nencourage the efforts under way to streamline the work \nof the different United Nations agencies to eliminate \nwastage of resources and unnecessary duplication of \ntime and effort. \n In the Pacific region, the long-promised United \nNations presence in island States where the \nOrganization is not represented has yet to materialize. \nThat is unfortunate, given the time that has passed and \nthe importance island leaders attach to the enhanced \nvisibility of the United Nations to assist in forging \npartnerships and building capacity to help sustain the \ndevelopment efforts of island nations. \n Samoa recently hosted the largest-ever South \nPacific Games in the event\u2019s 43-year history. The fact \nthat Samoa was able to successfully stage that largest \nof the Pacific regional events notwithstanding the \npaucity of its resources demonstrated the importance to \nsmall island developing States of working successfully \nwith their development partners. In the particular case \nof the South Pacific Games, Samoa needed to \ndemonstrate the importance of sports to the  \nsocio-economic development of our young people, \nboth at the national and at the wider Pacific regional \nlevels, in making submissions for assistance to its \ndevelopment partners.  \n The People\u2019s Republic of China was able to \nrespond positively to the call to provide critical \ninfrastructure to meet the requirements of the Games. \nSimilarly, in other key sectors such as education and \nhealth, Samoa\u2019s other development partners have \naccepted our requests and agreed to work with us in \nour efforts to improve those vital areas. \n The decision by the Economic and Social Council \nearly this year to graduate Samoa from the status of \nleast developed country is a clear reflection of the \nimmense value to Samoa of the contribution of its \ndevelopment partners   including Australia, China, \nthe European Union, Japan, New Zealand and a host of \nmultilateral institutions, such as the United Nations, \nthe World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, the \nInternational Monetary Fund and the Commonwealth, \nto name some. \n As is well known, we argued strongly at the \nEconomic and Social Council debate and at the \nGeneral Assembly the case of the continued \nvulnerability of our small, isolated island economy, \nwith all its attendant disadvantages, its lack of natural \nresources and its vulnerability to devastating natural \ndisasters. None of those conditions and risks will \ndisappear after Samoa graduates from the group of \nleast developed countries. We therefore ask our \ndevelopment partners for their continued understanding \nand support of Samoa\u2019s development efforts in the \nfuture. \n People trapped in the different troubled spots of \nthe world will not be able to experience true peace \nunless they are consulted and have a voice in any \nnegotiated solution conducted in a spirit of genuine \ngoodwill to find outcomes that create conditions for \nharmonious coexistence. Samoa therefore welcomes \nthe recent attempt to resume the Middle East peace \nprocess and the new hope it rekindles that perhaps a \ndurable solution may finally be achieved, where \nPalestinians live in a permanent and an independent \nState of their own alongside a secure and safe Israeli \nState. \n The Sudan\u2019s agreement to the African Union-\nUnited Nations Hybrid Operation is a courageous first \nstep towards solving the humanitarian situation in \nDarfur and deserves full support. Hopefully, it will \nsignal the end to the long and horrific suffering of \ninnocent people caught in the midst of that tragic \nconflict. \n Iraq\u2019s early gains through its democratically \nelected Government are being eroded daily by \ndisruptive elements bent on derailing the process to \nreturn the country to normalcy. Ultimately, it is the \nIraqi leadership that should promote and manage any \nnational reconciliation process to guarantee its long-\nterm sustainability. However, it is also clear that, with \nthe wider international community now able to play a \nmore active role in Iraq, their understanding and \ncontributions will be critical in helping with the efforts \nto bring peace to Iraq. \n I have on previous occasions from this rostrum \nexpressed Samoa\u2019s unwavering support for the \npeacekeeping work of the United Nations. I again \nreaffirm that support, which is underpinned by my \ncountry\u2019s contribution and involvement in the United \nNations peacekeeping missions in Timor-Leste, Liberia \nand the Sudan. Additionally, Samoa continues to be an \nintegral part of the Regional Assistance Mission to the \nSolomon Islands under the umbrella of the Pacific \nForum. \n Terrorist acts committed the world over, under \nwhatever pretext or purpose, are deplorable and \nmorally unjustified. In its various forms and \nmanifestations, terrorism is responsible for the \npermanent scars of horror and fear that have gripped \ninternational attention in recent years. Terrorism should \ntherefore be condemned in the strongest way possible, \nto send out the clear and unequivocal message that it is \nneither accepted nor condoned and that perpetrators \nshould not expect any sympathy for their actions. \n Samoa strongly supports the anti-terrorism \nresolutions of the United Nations. We have put in place \nthe relevant legislative framework and have \nimplemented measures in line with intergovernmental \nefforts to combat international terrorism. \n In concluding my statement, I wish to again \nemphasize the important role of nations in key \npositions of leadership in the achievement of the \nobjectives of the Organization, whether in \npeacekeeping, the environment, poverty alleviation, the \nfight against terrorism or the many other challenges \nthat threaten our world. They must lead by good \nexample, make decisions and take action based on the \nwell-founded conviction that what they do is morally \nand ethically correct for the ultimate benefit and \ngreater good of the world. When nations with \nleadership roles and responsibilities are able to do that, \nthey will find ready support from the rest of the \nOrganization\u2019s membership. \n"

        "file_text": "We \nlive in an increasingly complex world of ever more \ndiverse challenges. Actions taken in isolation are no \nlonger enough. Given such complexity, the United \nNations should not only be a bulwark against arbitrary \nactions in international relations but also, above all, the \nvehicle for effective responses. I am pleased to note \nthat there is growing consensus on this issue. \n Climate change was the topic of a recent high-\nlevel event. A Security Council summit meeting has \njust addressed the situation in Africa. In addition to \npeace and international security, the United Nations \nmust also tackle a wide array of issues. The fight \nagainst terrorism, pandemics, human rights, \ndisarmament, migration and the environment are \nexamples of the diverse subjects requiring a \nmultilateral approach. \n Multilateralism has been reinvigorated, especially \nin the areas of peacekeeping and security. The current \n18 peacekeeping missions and the 100,000 Blue \nHelmets now in the field clearly attest to that. Belgium \nhas witnessed that evolution up close since becoming a \nmember of the Security Council at the beginning of \n2007. We shall continue to strengthen multilateralism \nin that body. \n In Africa, working through the United Nations, \nthe international community has been actively engaged \nin the search for solutions to the issues of Darfur, \nChad, the Central African Republic, the Democratic \nRepublic of Congo and C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire. \n The efforts of the United Nations Organization \nMission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo \n(MONUC) have been crucial to re-establishing peace \nand setting up democratic institutions in that country. \nNow is not the time to scale back our efforts. The \ntenuous situation in the eastern part of the Democratic \nRepublic of the Congo and the resumption of fighting \nin North Kivu pose serious risks to the process of \nstabilizing the country. They also have tragic \nhumanitarian consequences. Moreover, the scourge of \nthe recruitment of child soldiers takes on new \nproportions. As pointed out by the Secretary-General, \nwe urgently need a global solution, including a \nregional dimension that will allow us to make better \nuse of MONUC\u2019s input. While the Congolese \nauthorities are preparing for local elections, which will \nstrengthen democratic culture across the country, they \nneed our full support. Belgium will continue to \nmobilize the attention of the international community \non this important matter. \n In Sudan, it is imperative that we make progress \nin our search for a political solution for Darfur. I \nencourage all parties to take advantage of the Tripoli \nconference in order to identify the elements of the \nconflict, such as the distribution of resources and \npower-sharing, and to establish the foundation for a \nlasting settlement. We need to speed up the deployment \nof the peacekeeping force, with the full cooperation of \nthe Sudanese Government. Moreover, we will have to \ncontinue to consolidate reconciliation between north \nand south of the country. \n Furthermore, the role of regional organizations in \nmanaging crises has significantly increased over the \npast year. The African Union has invested its efforts, \nboth in Somalia and in Darfur, where new ways of \ncooperation with the United Nations are developing. \nThe hybrid force is an example of this new form of \ncooperation.  \n As for the European Union, it has supported \nMONUC\u2019s efforts in the Democratic Republic of the \nCongo. It will also contribute to curbing the \nhumanitarian crisis in Chad and in the Central African \nRepublic by sending a military force to support the \nUnited Nations missions in the region. Belgium will \nparticipate in this effort. The European Union has also \ndeveloped a close cooperation with the African Union \nby supporting its efforts in crisis management, while \npaying close attention to the strengthening of its \neffectiveness. On the whole, we welcome this regional \ninput and the increasing synergies among the United \nNations, the African Union and the European Union. \n Regarding Kosovo, it is, on the other hand, \nregrettable that the Security Council was unable last \nJune to assume its responsibility on a matter for which \nthe solution is essential for peace and stability in \nEurope. I urge both parties to seize this present \nopportunity to come to a compromise. This is a matter \nof urgency. The status quo is not an option, as we are \nall aware. Absent an agreement between the parties, \nEurope will then have to shoulder its responsibilities. \n In the Middle East, the international community \nhas mobilized in order to contribute to a solution to the \ncrisis in Lebanon. By extending for one year the \nmandate of the United Nations Interim Force in \nLebanon (UNIFIL), in which Belgium participates with \nclose to 400 troops, it has recognized UNIFIL\u2019s role in \nthe solution of the crisis.  \n But the current political stalemate is alarming. All \nparties should demonstrate a sense of responsibility. \nThe institutions should be allowed to function normally \nagain, beginning with the election of the president in \naccordance with the constitutional process, in the \nassigned timetable and without foreign interference. \nThe latest attack that claimed the lives of member of \nParliament Antoine Ghanem and nine other people \nshows how impunity threatens the stability of the \ncountry. The establishment of the Special Tribunal for \nLebanon is clear evidence of the support that the \nmultilateral system is willing to provide to the fight \nagainst this impunity. \n In the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, neither the \ncontinuation of firing rockets at the Israeli population, \nnor the deterioration of the living conditions of \nPalestinians in the Gaza Strip, is acceptable. Regular \nmeetings between the Palestinian and Israeli leaders \nconstitute an encouraging development after so many \nyears of misunderstanding and lack of true dialogue. I \nhope that these steps will be bear fruit at the \ninternational meeting slated for before the end of this \nyear. Belgium actively supports any progress in the \npeace process. \n The Security Council has recently reinforced the \nmandate of the United Nations in Iraq. The United \nNations can, in fact, play an important role in \nhumanitarian emergency matters, in regional \ncooperation and in national reconciliation. But its \naction will depend on the security conditions and will \nhave to be able to rely truly on the support of the \ninternational community, the Iraqi Government and the \nneighbouring countries, as expressed at the \n22 September meeting. \n In dealing with the nuclear issue in Iran, Belgium \nhas, from the outset, supported a multilateral approach. \nWe have to resolutely use the multilateral mechanisms \nsuch as the International Atomic Energy Agency \n(IAEA) and the Security Council, in order to obtain \ntangible results. In the past, Iran has not fulfilled its \nobligations regarding the transparency of its nuclear \nactivities. In order to restore confidence and to make \nthe best use of the objective verification capacities of \nthe IAEA, Iran will have to fully respect the \nregulations of the Comprehensive Safeguards \nAgreement and the Additional Protocol. However, the \nmeasures prescribed in Security Council resolutions go \nbeyond those regulations and aim at creating the \nconditions for restoring international confidence in the \nIranian nuclear programme. Complete and immediate \ncompliance with these resolutions by Iran is a \ncondition to resume the dialogue that had to be \ninterrupted in 2005. The credibility of the Security \nCouncil is also at stake. \n In Asia, the mission of good offices of the \nSecretary-General has made it possible for us to follow \nclosely the situation in Myanmar. The latest \ndemonstrations show the determination of the \npopulation and should finally incite the Government to \ninitiate an inclusive dialogue with a view to restoring \ndemocracy in Myanmar. Use of violence will not be \ntolerated. \n Beyond crisis resolution, progress has also been \nmade in the area of peacebuilding. The international \ncommunity must remain vigilant. The cost of leaving a \ncountry too quickly is always higher than investing in \npeacebuilding. The true success of the Peacebuilding \nCommission will be judged by the long-term stability \nof the countries currently on its agenda, namely, \nBurundi and Sierra Leone. \n The recent adoption of concrete recommendations \nfollowing the deterioration of the political situation in \nBurundi illustrates its increasing capacity to react \nquickly to events that could jeopardize the stabilization \nof the countries with which it is dealing. In Burundi, \nthe dialogue must definitely be pursued in order to \nsolve the political stalemate, which impedes the normal \nfunctioning of the State\u2019s institutions. Every effort \nmust be made in order to bring the Forces nationales de \nlib\u00e9ration (FNL) back to constructive negotiations with \nthe Government as soon as possible. \n Three of the most recent and expensive \npeacekeeping operations have been deployed in \ncountries where conflicts were fuelled by the illegal \nexploitation of natural resources, namely, the \nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, Liberia and Sierra \nLeone. That clearly illustrates the urgent need to \ndevelop mechanisms that break the link between the \nillegal exploitation of natural resources and conflict.  \n This issue was the central theme of our \npresidency of the Security Council last June. We \nidentified several courses of action. For example, we \nmust reinforce the capacity of the Secretariat to deal \nwith such issues; define more precisely, as necessary, \nthe mandates of peacekeeping operations; cause the \nsanctions committees to operate in a more targeted \nmanner; and consolidate the methods of the work of \nexperts groups. In the coming months, it is our \nintention to pursue our efforts in these areas, which \nrelate to both security and development. We hope that \nwe can rely on the support of Member States. \nOur attention to crisis management and \npeacebuilding must not diminish the importance that \nwe accord to preventive diplomacy. I welcome the \ninitiatives of the Secretary-General in this area, such as \nstrengthening United Nations mediation capacities and \nupgrading the mandates concerning prevention of \ngenocide and mass atrocities and concerning \nresponsibility to protect. We also have to make this \nconcept operational. \n Conflict affects civilian populations long after the \nend of hostilities. The prevention of conflict should not \noverlook human security. That is why our country is \nworking to promote an international instrument on \ncluster bombs; that is why it supports negotiations on a \ntreaty on arms trafficking, and that is also why we are \npursuing action against the recruitment and use of child \nsoldiers. \n Crisis prevention also entails development. \nEveryone should have the opportunity to choose his or \nher way in life with dignity. The alternative is \nfrustration that often leads only to violence. The \nMillennium Development Goals and the fight against \npoverty therefore remain a major challenge.  \n In this context, Belgium pays special attention to \ngood governance. Last March, in cooperation with the \nWorld Bank and the Organization for Economic Co-\noperation and Development, we organized in Brussels \nan international conference on good governance and \nthe fight against corruption. That conference illustrated \nthe potential in this area \u2014 triangular partnerships \namong donor countries, recipient countries and the \nprivate sector \u2014 which needs to be explored, including \nwithin the United Nations. \n Poverty also forces many migrants to leave their \ncountry, having no other choice. In July 2007, Belgium \norganized, in the presence of the Secretary-General, the \nfirst Global Forum on Migration and Development. \nThat was a new opportunity to demonstrate our firm \nmultilateral commitment. It emerged that legal \nmigration can be an opportunity for both the countries \nof origin and the countries of destination. In addition, \nwith good cooperation between the countries involved, \ndevelopment can also foster migration by choice rather \nthan by necessity. Belgium will contribute to the \nfollow-up of this initiative with the Philippines, which \nwill organize the second Global Forum in 2008. \n Human rights are one of the pillars of our \ncollective security. We must ensure respect for those \nrights under all circumstances. That is why in 2005 we \nemphasized the need for in-depth reform of the former \nCommission on Human Rights. At this stage, however, \nI regretfully note that the new Human Rights Council \ndoes not meet our expectations. An institutional \nagreement that was reached between the members of \nthe Human Rights Council in Geneva in June came at \nthe expense of difficult concessions. The capacity of \nthe Council to react promptly to human rights \nviolations will thus be compromised. \n Multilateralism is back. Nevertheless, it is only a \nmethod, not an end in itself, and this method can be \ndisappointing if it does not bring results. We therefore \nneed an instrument that will animate multilateralism \nand adapt the United Nations to the current \nenvironment. Achieving our common objectives \ndepends on developing a modern organization that is \nwell adapted, well equipped and well managed. We \nwill therefore need to consolidate the bases for a \nresponsible and professional Secretariat. \n System-wide coherence in the United Nations is \nalso indispensable from this standpoint. In order to \nfoster coherence of development activities by the \nUnited Nations in the field, the current reform effort \nhas as its main objective to reinforce its efficiency for \nthe benefit of developing countries. \n After years of discussion, it is unfortunate that we \nhave not been able to make progress on the \nindispensable reform of the Security Council. We \nundoubtedly need a new working method that would \nallow us to get the technical working group out of New \nYork, where it is bogged down, and to involve the \ncapitals and the political levels more. I therefore \nsuggest appointing a high-level special envoy for \nSecurity Council reform, who would be responsible for \nleading these consultations and for presenting us with a \nproposal. \n As far as I am concerned, my clear preference \ngoes to a formula that would consist initially of an \naddition of new, semi-permanent seats, without \nmodifying the current balance between permanent and \nnon-permanent members. Later on, permanent \nmembers would accept to give up their right of veto. \n The United Nations must serve the general \ninterest of the community of Member States, as well as \nof the populations they represent. The United Nations \nwill succeed only if those States manage to transcend \nthe sum of their particular interests. It is the shared \nresponsibility of each of us to display the necessary \nvision in order to put our Organization in the service of \nthe common good. \n"

        "file_text": "All \nof us seated in this Hall witnessed the collapse almost \ntwo decades ago of a seemingly invincible \ninternational system based on the antagonism of two \npoles of power. It collapsed instantly. The system that \nensued, based on the antagonism of one powerful pole \nto the rest of the world, is already splitting apart before \nour very eyes and creating strains that will inevitably \nlead to its collapse. Simple logic, which does not aspire \nto explain the laws of the universe, tells us that systems \nbased on confrontation are short-lived. They are \ndoomed. But this is not the end of history: this is a \nprocess of history. As the twenty-first century begins, \nsystems based on antagonism and confrontation are \nbecoming a thing of the past. The sands of time are \ninexorably flowing out of them. New international \nsystems based on partnership must replace them. \n Those thoughts are not a digression into the \nabstract. Though still split by the old paradigm of \nNorth-South confrontation and the imposed myth of \nconfrontation between developed and developing \nStates, and the myth of a clash of civilizations, the \ninternational community should through its actions \ntoday build a practical partnership that will lay the \nfoundations of new systems for the world order. When \nwe succeed in working together, we will be able to \ntackle the most serious problems. \n Let us take the subject of terrorism. Force alone, \neven the most powerful and the most sophisticated, \ncannot overcome terrorism. Its use instead causes a \nfurther spiral of terror. We have all painfully come to \nrealize this. Instead, we have understood the true \nimpact of poverty, inequality, social vulnerability and \nilliteracy on the rise of extremism and terrorism and \nhave taken up the fight against terrorism through joint \nand comprehensive efforts, and have thus started to \nundermine the very foundations of terrorism. The \ndecisive role in this, in our opinion, belongs to the \nUnited Nations. \n The United Nations must also reassert its leading \nrole in the fight against such growing evils as \ntrafficking in human beings and bring about \ncooperation between the countries of origin and \ncountries of destination of modern-day slaves. Having, \nin 2006, taken the first steps towards coordinating the \nefforts of the international community in this sphere \n(see resolution 61/180), the General Assembly should \noffer to its intergovernmental and non-governmental \npartners a practical vision of a global partnership in \nthis fight. As an optimal form of such a partnership, \nBelarus would opt for a United Nations plan of action \nor strategy to counter human trafficking and other \nmodern forms of slavery. Let us determine the optimal \nformat for our cooperation through a thematic General \nAssembly debate and begin this without delay during \nthe current session. \n We are certain that it is time for our common \nOrganization, the United Nations, to begin looking for \nways, obviously based on cooperation, to deal with \nwhat is de facto the most topical problem facing \nhumankind: the energy problem. Antagonism between \nsuppliers and consumers of energy resources and a \nprice race will not resolve the energy problem. Such \nantagonism is itself a superficial phenomenon. At the \nend of the day, we are all energy consumers, and this, \nin principle, is where we have common interests. How \nare we to solve this problem, given the rapid pace of \ngrowth of the world economy and the consequent rush \nfor energy sources? It is clear that the future belongs to \nalternative and renewable sources of energy. This \nmeans that today the United Nations must work out \npractical arrangements for the transfer and distribution \nof alternative and renewable energy technologies on a \nglobal scale. That is a fundamental prerequisite for the \nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals.  \n Such practical measures should include the \nmethods of dealing with the obvious problem that these \ntechnologies are concentrated in the hands of a small \ngroup of States. Otherwise, the pricing for these \ntechnologies tomorrow will emulate today\u2019s exorbitant \nprices for traditional energy resources. If a few decades \nago the international community drew on the \nenlightened minds of researchers and managed to \ndecide that a future controlled fusion technology, as a \nperpetual source of energy, should belong to all \nhumanity, why can the United Nations today not take a \nsimilar decision with respect to alternative and \nrenewable sources of energy? It would probably be \nright to hold, during the next session of the General \nAssembly, informal thematic debates on technologies \nfor alternative and renewable energy resources as the \ncommon property of humankind. \n The problem of global climate change   a key \ntopic for this year\u2019s general debate   is becoming \nincreasingly acute. At present, the Kyoto Protocol is \nthe most important international instrument for \naddressing this issue. In 2006, with an eye to full-\nfledged participation in the Kyoto Protocol, Belarus \nbecame the first and so far the only country to initiate \nan amendment to annex-B of the Protocol. In view of \nthe worsening problem of climate change and \nincorporating the wishes of our partners, we have \nundertaken the most stringent commitments on the \nreduction of greenhouse gas emissions in the \nCommonwealth of Independent States (CIS) region. \nThrough joint efforts by the parties to the Kyoto \nProtocol, let us ensure prompt ratification of the \namendment and its entry into force, thereby setting a \nmajor practical precedent by enlarging the circle of \nparticipants in the Kyoto Protocol.  \n The fact that Belarus takes climate change and \nenvironmental protection issues so seriously is not \naccidental. Like our neighbours, the Russian \nFederation and Ukraine, for the past two decades now \nBelarus has had to deal with the consequences of the \ndeadliest man-made disaster of the twentieth century, \nthe accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant. \nThanks to great effort and at tremendous cost the most \nurgent problems of providing emergency assistance to \nthe population today have been dealt with. In the years \nto come we will face an equally challenging task, \nnamely, to restore the economic potential of the \naffected areas and to create a viable environment for \npeople and pollution-free production. As before, we \nwill bear the main burden ourselves. However, we hope \nthat the proposed proclamation by the United Nations \nof a decade of rehabilitation and sustainable \ndevelopment of Chernobyl-affected areas, which was \nendorsed by the 2006 Minsk Chernobyl International \nConference, will have the support of the Assembly and \nthat a new resolution of the General Assembly will \nofficially announce the beginning of the decade of \nChernobyl, thus ensuring the cooperation and solidarity \nof the international community. \n From this rostrum much has been said about the \nproblems of the Doha round of negotiations on \ninternational trade. There is one more aspect of this \nsubject, the unacceptable practice of certain countries \nthat use the process of accession to membership of the \nWorld Trade Organization (WTO) as a convenient \ninstrument of pressure on candidate countries. This has \ninvolved not only economic pressure, in order to \nreceive coerced and unilateral additional benefits from \nWTO expansion, but also political pressure. The \nUnited Nations must take a firm stand in favour of \nestablishing, with the participation of all interested \nStates, fair conditions for WTO accession that take into \naccount the trade and financial needs of the acceding \ncountries and their genuine development needs. \n Belarus rejects the use of unilateral coercive \nmeasures in international relations as an instrument of \npolitical and economic pressure on sovereign States. \nSuch measures not only contradict the principles of the \nUnited Nations Charter and international law but breed \nalienation, mistrust and hostility among nations. We \nend up dealing with simply absurd situations when \neconomic sanctions are imposed under the pretext of \npromoting workers\u2019 rights but lead ultimately to job \nlosses. By applying increasingly unilateral coercive \nmeasures of economic pressure, including \nextraterritorially, the well-known world centre of \npower has assumed de facto the rights of the United \nNations Security Council. We have all witnessed this \nduring the current general debate in the General \nAssembly. \n We wish to draw the attention of the General \nAssembly to a particular aspect, the abuse by the \nUnited States of the right to be the world reserve \ncurrency manager and its deliberate creation of \nobstacles to the lawful economic activity of legitimate \ncompanies and banks from countries that are not \ndeemed acceptable by the United States. This is a \nwake-up call for the entire international community. By \ndesignating States at will as acceptable or \nunacceptable, as good or bad, the United States is \ncreating an atmosphere that suppresses dissent and \ndiversity in international relations. That not only brings \nideology and politicking into international relations but \nis an act of confrontation with each and every one who \ndares to have an independent opinion or who has the \ncourage to pursue an independent foreign policy. The \nmajority in this hall are member States of the \nNon-Aligned Movement (NAM). They are non-aligned \nto confrontation. Five decades ago the creation of the \nMovement was a protest against confrontation and a \nglobal response to the global challenge of \nconfrontation. Today it is within our power to stop \nconfrontation and to reject the solutions that it seeks to \nimpose. Tomorrow belongs to positive ideas and \nactions and to interaction and cooperation for peace in \nthe common interest of the entire international \ncommunity. \n"

        "file_text": "At the outset of my \nstatement, I wish to offer the President and our  \nnewly appointed Secretary-General my warmest \ncongratulations and best wishes for the success of the \nsixty-second session of the General Assembly, which \nhas as its main focus the impact of climate change on \nglobal peace and development. \n As the recently concluded High-level Event \nrevealed, there is now a greater awareness of that issue \nand of the need to address them with greater urgency. \nLike the legendary Rip Van Winkle, we appear to have \nfinally awakened from a long and deep slumber, only \nto find that the world around us is in serious danger of \ndegradation. Our environment has become frightening. \nAs a result of the increased consumption of fossil fuels \nin past decades, the amount of carbon dioxide in the \natmosphere has increased by more than 25 per cent, \nwhich will, if unmitigated, eventually lead to a rise in \nthe Earth\u2019s temperature of more than 5 degrees in the \nyears ahead. Such warming is likely to produce an \nincrease in sea levels of almost 2 metres. Since one \nthird of the world\u2019s population lives close to coastlines, \nsuch an elevation will have a disastrous impact on the \nliving conditions of many millions. At the same time, \nthe world\u2019s forests are said to be vanishing at a rate of \n15 million hectares a year, threatening the loss of \nalmost 50 per cent of the forest cover in developing \ncountries. Altogether, those climatic changes will take \na heavy toll on the economic and social growth of \nmany countries, through a higher incidence of drought, \ndesertification, flooding and other natural disasters. \n The primary responsibility for this environmental \ndegradation has been laid   quite rightly   at the \ndoor of those developed countries whose \nindustrialization policies and programmes have shown \nscant regard for preservation of the global ecosystem. \nBy piggybacking on the natural assets of developing \ncountries, those States have achieved astonishing \neconomic and social progress and have created \nconsumerist societies whose appetites for ever-greater \nextravagance know no bounds and must be satisfied at \nall costs. \n In the face of mounting evidence that climate \nchange does in fact imperil the Earth and its resources, \nsome developed States appear willing to accept   \nalbeit reluctantly   that carbon emissions must be \nsignificantly reduced to preserve the ozone layer as a \nshield from the effects of greenhouse gases. Even so, \nthey do not seem prepared to accept primary \nresponsibility for protecting the environment. Instead \nof \u201ccommon but differentiated responsibility\u201d, they \nspeak of \u201cshared responsibility\u201d, clearly demanding a \ngreater contribution by developing countries to the \ncampaign against climate change. This demand often \nbecomes a conditionality for any development \nassistance they offer. \n For the many developing countries which suffer \nfrom a chronic lack of resources, this imposition is \nclearly unequal and unfair. These States, including \nmany in sub-Saharan Africa, small islands in the \nCaribbean and the Pacific, and low-lying coastal States \nlike my own, are especially vulnerable to climatic \nchanges and, consequently, disaster prone. The \nBarbados Programme of Action and the subsequent \nMauritius Strategy were both devised for the purpose \nof alleviating the destructive impact of the many \nnatural disasters faced by these disadvantaged \ncountries. However, despite their initial promise, these \nagreements have yet to yield the measure of assistance \nneeded by small States to overcome the consequences \nof climate change. Invariably, these affected countries \nmust rely on their own limited resources to protect \ntheir environment from harm. \n Guyana fully understood and responded to the \nchallenges of climate change when, more than a decade \nago, it made available to the international community \nalmost one million acres of its pristine forest for the \nstudy of bio-diversity and the sustainable development \nof forestry. However, the future of this project is now \nthreatened, since financial support from the \ninternational community has become increasingly \nscarce. At the same time, as our President stated at the \nHigh-level Event, the Kyoto Protocol rewards   quite \nperversely, I might add   those States which burn and \npillage their resources but punishes others like Guyana \nwhich are committed to preserving their standing \nforests. This inequity should no longer be tolerated. \n It is very important that any post-Kyoto \nagreement be endowed with the resources necessary for \nits full implementation. Development assistance \nstatistics have shown a marked diminution in levels \nfrom past years, with little promise of the additional or \nnew financing needed for environment-related projects. \nThere, therefore, needs to be what has been called a \npartnership for additionality which, in return for a \ncommitment by countries to the preservation of the \nenvironment, will provide adequate and predictable \nfinancing to allow them to pursue a path of accelerated \nand sustainable development. It is high time to honour \nthe commitments made at the Monterrey International \nConference on Financing for Development. \n As a country which is below sea-level, Guyana \nhas been further sensitized to the threat of climate \nchange as a result of frequent floods that wreak \neconomic havoc on our coastal population. The last \nmajor inundation was in 2005, when the economic loss \nsuffered was, according to the estimate of the \nEconomic Commission for Latin America and the \nCaribbean, nearly 60 per cent of the country\u2019s gross \ndomestic product. Unfortunately for us, the tragedy, \noccurring as it did around the same time as the tsunami \ndisaster, did not feature prominently on the \ninternational radar screen and, therefore, received little \nnotice in the wider community. However, thanks to the \nassistance of a few friendly countries and the resilience \nof our own people, we are on the road to recovery. That \nexperience, however, impels us to renew our call in \nthis Assembly for the strengthening of multilateral \nfacilities to provide all victims of such natural disasters \nwith prompt and adequate relief. \n As both the outcome of the High-level Event and \nthe statements heard so far in this Assembly make \nclear, the battle against climate change cannot be won \nunless a truly global effort is made to save the planet. \nIn the words of my country\u2019s national poet, Martin \nCarter, in his poem entitled \u201cAll are involved\u201d: \n Like a jig \n shakes the loom; \n Like a web \n is spun the pattern; \n all are involved \n all are consumed (All are involved) \n Therefore, unless all of us, both Governments and \npeoples, accept in a deep and meaningful way the \nimperative of prudent environmental management, our \ncivilization, such as we know it, will disappear. \n In this new era of globalization, humankind has \nbeen made acutely aware of the deep interdependence \nof nations and the concomitant need for cooperation \nwith one another to ensure our common survival. This \nawareness notwithstanding, many in the developed \nworld continue to practise their misguided \u201cbeggar-thy-\nneighbour\u201d policy, which effectively precludes \ndeveloping countries from satisfying the aspirations of \ntheir people. \n Take, for example, the area of trade and economic \ncooperation, the main pillar on which globalization has \nbeen built. The developed countries continue to \npropagate the thesis that free trade will guarantee \nprosperity for all. The reality is that most countries, \nincluding my own, simply cannot compete successfully \nin fully liberalized markets unless they are assisted in \nmaking a gradual transition. Instead of assistance, \nhowever, some of the preferences that we enjoyed \nhitherto in some markets are being summarily \nwithdrawn. \n Witness the unilateral denunciation last week by \nthe European Union of the Sugar Protocol, a legally \nbinding instrument of indefinite duration, which \ngoverns the sugar exports of many African, Caribbean \nand Pacific countries to Europe. This step comes in the \nmidst of negotiations on this issue and is clearly a sign \nof bad faith. It has been taken without adequate \nconsultation and clarification and contradicts the \nEuropean Union\u2019s own lectures to us on partnership \nand good governance. As a result of this action, \nthousands of our citizens, especially the rural poor, \nwhose lives depend upon the sugar industry, will likely \nface great hardship. It is, therefore, imperative that in \nthe negotiation of future trade arrangements, including \nthe Doha Round, due regard be paid to the \ndevelopment challenges of small States. \n Similarly, in the area of peace and security there \nis continuing blatant disregard of the rule of law by \nmany States that, in pursuit of their own selfish \nnational interests, do not hesitate to fan the flames of \nconflict in various parts of the world. As a \nconsequence, millions in Darfur, in Palestine, in the \nMiddle East and elsewhere are forced to endure \nunspeakable pain and suffering   pain and suffering \nwhich, in today\u2019s world of instant communication, we \nnot only hear about but also actually see and feel in \nreal time. Our common humanity obliges us to call \nonce again for a return to the purposes and principles \nof the United Nations Charter, and in particular the \npeaceful settlement of disputes, wherever and \nwhenever they occur. \n In this context, I am pleased to announce that last \nmonth on 20 September an arbitral tribunal of great \neminence under the presidency of Judge Dolliver \nNelson, distinguished former President of the \nInternational Tribunal for the Law of the Sea, sitting \npursuant to Annex VII of the United Nations \nConvention on the Law of the Sea, handed down a \ndecision regarding the maritime boundary between \nGuyana and neighbouring Suriname. The President of \nGuyana described the decision as just and erudite; the \nPresident of Suriname called it fair and equitable. It \nwas another feather in the crown of international law, \nanother blow struck against the resort to force and \nanother victory for lawful and peaceful processes in the \nsettlement of disputes.  \n Guyana had initiated recourse to the dispute \nsettlement provisions of the Convention, which, I am \nhappy to recall, was brought into force by our \ncountry\u2019s ratification in 1993. Under the aegis of a \nUnited Nations regime created by internationalism and \nthe rule of international law, our two small countries \ncan now pursue the development of their maritime \nspace without the encumbrance of a dispute. It is an \nexample of the peaceful settlement of a dispute that \nothers might emulate.  \n In further demonstration of its commitment to the \nCharter of the United Nations, my Government has \nplaced before the General Assembly an initiative \ncalling for a new global human order based on the \nprinciples of equity and social justice. It is born out of \nour conviction that, given the failure of our past \nefforts, the world now needs to formulate a \nqualitatively different and more holistic strategy, \nleading to a stronger political consensus and broad-\nbased partnership before the General Assembly. The \ndraft resolution now enjoys the sponsorship of forty-\nnine States and will in time, we hope, command the \nsupport of the entire international community. \n As this new era of globalization unfolds, with its \nmany challenges and opportunities, I invite this \nAssembly to support fully our appeal for the firm \nestablishment of a more enlightened and \ncompassionate model of multilateralism as the \ncornerstone of future international relations. \n"

        "file_text": "May I start by expressing to \nyou, Mr. President, my Government\u2019s congratulations \non your election as the President of the General \nAssembly at its sixty-second session. \n Let me also use this occasion to thank the \noutgoing President, Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa, \nfor the excellent manner in which she presided over the \nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-first session. \n Every year the General Assembly provides the \nworld\u2019s leaders with an excellent opportunity to focus \nour attention on the challenges we commonly face. \nWhile some of the challenges can be addressed \nnationally, the most critical are often not confined to \nnational borders and therefore require a concerted \nglobal effort. Hence the centrality of the United \nNations in providing the leadership and platform to \naddress global challenges. \n That is why it is vital that the United Nations \ncontinues to undergo comprehensive reforms to render \nit more versatile, effective and efficient. As the \nSecretary-General correctly observed in his report on \nthis subject, the United Nations is \u201cnot optimally \nconfigured. \n Some of the ongoing reforms such as the \nimplementation of \u201cone programme, one budgetary \nframework and one office\u201d at the country level is a \ngood start for rendering this international body more \nresponsive. We are pleased that Rwanda was selected \nas one of the eight first pilot countries for this reform.  \n In the same context of the ongoing reforms, the \nproposal to restructure the gender portfolio is most \nwelcome. We agree with the findings of the High-level \nPanel that the United Nations contributions to gender \nissues have been incoherent, under-resourced and \nfragmented. The proposed reforms will assist in \novercoming those shortcomings. \n However, we still eagerly await the reform of the \nSecurity Council to render it more representative of the \nworld community and more transparent in its \noperations and decision-making processes. We believe \nthat this would equip the United Nations with greater \nlegitimacy and capacity to maintain world peace and \nsecurity. \n Let me briefly touch on a number of pressing \nchallenges the global community currently faces. \nWhile our continent has been consolidating peace and \nsecurity, there are persistent problem areas that need \nattention. Today in the Great Lakes region, those who \ncommitted genocide in Rwanda in 1994 continue their \ndestructive activities. Almost 14 years after their deeds \nin our country, they are still sowing mayhem in the \nregion. They rape, murder, terrorize and plunder with \nimpunity. Their leaders are active in Africa, Europe, \nAmerica and other places, where they continue to \npromote the ideology of genocide. There can be no \ndoubt that those terror groups constitute a threat to \ninternational peace and security. The presence of the \ncostly United Nations peacekeeping mission in the \nDemocratic Republic of the Congo has not diminished \ntheir activities. \n I once again call upon the international \ncommunity, in collaboration with the Government of \nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo, to end the \nthreat posed by those negative forces once and for all. \nRwandans and the region as a whole need peace and \nstability so that we can concentrate on the business of \neconomic growth and development. \n For our part, we pledge renewed commitment to \nmaking our contribution to the restoration of peace and \nstability in the Great Lakes region and in other parts of \nour continent. In that respect, we express our solidarity \nwith the long-suffering people of Darfur and commit \nourselves to contributing to peace efforts in that part of \nthe world, in close cooperation with the Government of \nthe Sudan, the African Union (AU) and the United \nNations. Rwanda welcomes Security Council \nresolution 1769 (2007) authorizing the creation of the \nUnited Nations-AU hybrid peacekeeping force in \nDarfur, and calls for its speedy deployment. In the \nsame spirit, we urge the international community to \nsupport peacebuilding efforts in Somalia. It is critical \nthat resources be made available on an urgent basis to \nenable the deployment of the pledged peacekeeping \nforces by African countries. \n Through the United Nations, we express our \ncollective determination to promote socioeconomic \ntransformation for greater and more rapid wealth \ncreation, which in turn will permit improved lives. On \nthat note, we also join the many other countries that are \nputting forward the suggestion of a moratorium on the \ndeath penalty as a way of improving those lives and \nvaluing them. That challenge remains daunting in the \ndeveloping world, where extreme poverty still affects \nmillions of people. \n The solutions include increased productive \ncapacities on the part of the developing world, side by \nside with the opening of global markets to the \ndeveloped world to permit greater trade and \ninvestment. A fair global trading system is central to \nwealth creation. Improving the quality of development \naid would supplement that effort, based on a shared \nunderstanding that aid is most effective when it is \naligned with national development priorities. \n Our ultimate goal of improving lives globally \ncannot be realized if the challenge of climate change \nand the associated widespread environmental \ndegradation is not sufficiently tackled. Rwanda \nappreciates the convening of the high-level meeting on \nclimate change by the Secretary-General earlier this \nweek. We also look forward to the United Nations \nclimate change conference scheduled to take place in \nBali, Indonesia, this December, which should provide a \nclear road map of how we are to consolidate our gains \nand gather pace in protecting our environment. \n The global challenges of poverty, ignorance, \nterrorism, conflict and climate change require us to act \ncollectively in a manner that the founders of this \nOrganization captured eloquently in the words We the \npeoples of the United Nations. As we begin this sixty-\nsecond session of the General Assembly, let us \nrecommit to our common aspirations and \nresponsibilities for realizing peace, prosperity and \nfreedom above any narrow interests. Only then can we \nhope to realize the ideals contained in the Charter of \nthe United Nations \u201cto save succeeding generations \nfrom the scourge of war\u201d and to \u201cpromote social \nprogress and better standards of life in larger freedom.\n"

        "file_text": "First, let me \njoin other speakers in congratulating you, Sir, on your \nassumption of the presidency of the General Assembly \nat its sixty-second session. I should also like to pay \nhigh tribute to Her Excellency Sheikha Haya Rashed \nAl-Khalifa for her leadership during the previous \nsession. My great appreciation goes as well to \nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his dedication and \ninitiative in addressing the many challenges \nconfronting the United Nations.  \n In the face of new challenges, the United Nations \nneeds to transform itself from forum to actor. The \ndemands of the twenty-first century call for the \ncreation of a United Nations that is proactive. I \ncommend the Secretary-General\u2019s determination to \nbring about this change. It is no coincidence that, given \nthe current international environment, Japan also has \nembarked on a proactive foreign policy. With our \napproaches thus in harmony, Japan and the United \nNations can and must work together. In my remarks \nthis evening I will emphasize two areas in which the \ncooperation between the two actors may be optimized: \nclimate change and African development. I will also \ntouch on the need for United Nations reform, notably \nthe reform of the Security Council, so that the United \nNations may address those missions effectively. \n In the era of globalization, the international \ncommunity has come to face new challenges that reach \nacross borders. In particular, climate change will be a \ncrisis for all humanity, not only the people of today but \nalso the generations of the future. Now is the time for \nall of us to take action for future generations, giving \nspecial consideration to vulnerable countries. Let us \nleave behind discord and division among nations and \nshift gears to combine our efforts in order to face this \ncommon challenge. The Intergovernmental Panel on \nClimate Change (IPCC) has indicated that the fact of \nglobal warming is unequivocal, so world leaders have \nthe responsibility to make bold new political decisions \nto address this growing challenge. With such \nresponsibility in mind, Japan presented a new proposal \non climate change in May and has proposed that we \ncollectively embrace a long-term vision for developing \ninnovative technologies and building a low-carbon \nsociety. Japan has also called for a mid-term strategy \nfor a new framework that includes all major emitters of \ngreenhouse gases.  \n We need to tackle climate change without pause \nup to and beyond 2012. In this regard, I highly \ncommend the political commitment expressed by world \nleaders at the high-level event held on 24 September \nunder the initiative of the Secretary-General. Japan for \nits part will contribute to the negotiations for an \ninternational agreement through the Group of Eight \n(G-8) Hokkaido-Toyako Summit to be held next year, \nand will feed the results back into the United Nations \nprocess. \n Japan has gained in international competitiveness \nby improving energy efficiency and decreasing oil \nconsumption during a period in which its gross \ndomestic product (GDP) doubled. We are ready to \nshare our technologies and experience, which hold the \nkey to achieving environmental preservation, energy \nsecurity and economic growth in tandem. At the same \ntime, each and every one of us needs to move forward \nfrom mere ideas and reconfigure our own way of life. \nJapan is promoting a new national campaign aimed at \nreducing the carbon dioxide emissions of individual \nhouseholds, in addition to the introduction of the Cool \nBiz   casual dress code   initiative. The spirit of \nmottainai   rejecting wastefulness   and the Three \nRs initiative to reduce, reuse and recycle waste also \ncontribute to this aim. It is my intention to globally \nbroaden the campaign to restructure our lifestyles. To \nthat end, my Government values exchanges with \ncorporations, academics, non-governmental \norganizations and various other actors in public \nforums, while at the same time cooperating with the \nUnited Nations Global Compact. \n Another priority area for Japan is African \ndevelopment. Africa as a whole is now undergoing \npositive change. Peace is being consolidated in several \nformer conflict areas. Meanwhile, many countries, both \nwith and without natural resources, are growing \nrobustly.  \n For Africa to become a more vibrant continent, a \ncontinent of greater hope and opportunity, three things \nare particularly important in addition to the prevention \nand resolution of conflicts. First and foremost, \neconomic growth must be enhanced and sustained. \nSecondly, human security needs to be ensured through \nthe achievement of the Millennium Development Goals \n(MDGs), the consolidation of peace and the \nestablishment of democratic governance. Finally, the \nissues of the environment and climate change must be \naddressed.  \n Japan will host the fourth Tokyo International \nConference on African Development (TICAD IV) in \nYokohama in May 2008. TICAD, whose first meeting \nwas held in 1993, is a process open to all. The TICAD \nprocess places particular importance on African \nownership and true partnership with the international \ncommunity. The three areas that I have just mentioned \nwill be the focus of the discussion at TICAD IV, which \nwill be a fresh opportunity to mobilize the knowledge \nand resources of the international community for \nAfrican development. South-South cooperation \nbetween Asia and Africa will remain a key feature in \nthe TICAD process.  \n Without peace in Africa, the world at large will \nnot enjoy peace and prosperity. Japan cannot ignore the \nsituation in Darfur. Faced with the world\u2019s worst \nhumanitarian crisis, Japan has provided assistance \namounting to approximately $85 million. Japan also \nwelcomes the establishment of the African Union-\nUnited Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur and looks \nforward to its early deployment as well as to steady \nprogress in the political process in Darfur. Japan \nintends to further enhance its contribution for the \nconsolidation of peace and stability in Africa. \n Peace paves the way for development and human \nsecurity. However, achieving peace is not an easy task. \nIraq, for example, is struggling to achieve security and \nreconciliation, and the foundation for peace remains \nweak. Japan has been assisting the reconstruction \nefforts of the Iraqi people by measures such as \ndispatching its Self-Defence Forces and providing \nofficial development assistance of up to $5 billion.  \n To help in the reconstruction of Afghanistan, \nJapan has played a leading role in the field of \ndisarmament, demobilization and reintegration and the \ndisbandment of illegal armed groups, working in close \ncooperation with the United Nations Assistance \nMission in Afghanistan. Japan hosted the Conference \non Disbandment of Illegal Armed Groups in Tokyo in \nJune this year to contribute to the rebuilding of \nAfghanistan through joint efforts with the United \nNations. \n To build peace, it is essential for the international \ncommunity to ensure a seamless and comprehensive \neffort to fulfil tasks ranging from resolving conflicts to \nassisting reconstruction. As current Chair of the \nPeacebuilding Commission, Japan is resolved to make \na significant contribution to such international efforts. \nOne concrete measure that has been taken is the launch \nof the Hiroshima Peacebuilders Centre to train civilian \nexperts in Asia to better respond to various needs on \nthe ground.  \n Free and fair elections and democracy are also \nessential for the consolidation of peace. Japan spares \nno effort to provide assistance in order to promote \ndemocratization. Japan has dispatched election \nobserver missions to a number of countries, including \nTimor-Leste and Sierra Leone. Japan has also provided \nelection-related support and dispatched arms monitors \nto Nepal.  \n It is extremely regrettable that the crackdown on \nthe demonstrations in Myanmar has caused casualties, \nincluding the death of a Japanese citizen. Japan calls \non the Government of Myanmar to exercise utmost \nrestraint and to refrain from the use of oppressive \nforce. Japan demands that the Government of Myanmar \nmake every effort to resolve the situation through \ndialogue. \n Along with democracy, the rule of law helps to \nlay the groundwork for peace and prosperity. To \npromote the rule of law in the international community, \nJapan will accede to the Statute of the International \nCriminal Court next month, and is helping to improve \nlegal systems in developing countries. In February, in \norder to give proactive support to the norm-setting role \nof the United Nations, Japan signed the International \nConvention for the Protection of All Persons from \nEnforced Disappearance and today I have signed the \nConvention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. \n Behind those endeavours lies the conviction that \nthe international community must cooperate in \naddressing international challenges based on such \nfundamental principles as freedom, human rights, \ndemocracy and the rule of law. The primary pillar of \nsuch fundamental values is respect for human dignity. \nThe issue of abductions by the Democratic People\u2019s \nRepublic of Korea poses a serious challenge to human \ndignity. It is essential that the international community \nsend a strong message calling for the earliest resolution \nof the abduction issue so that the victims and their \nfamilies may be reunited and have an opportunity to \nrecapture their former happiness. Japan will continue \nto work towards the resolution of this issue as well as \nthe settlement of the issues of the unfortunate past \nthrough dialogue in accordance with the Pyongyang \nDeclaration. With hope for an improvement of the \nhuman rights situation, Japan will also pursue the \nadoption of a draft resolution on the situation of human \nrights in the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea at \nthis session of the General Assembly. \n The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction \nand their means of delivery is another challenge that \nrequires the undivided attention of humankind. From \nthat point of view I welcome the Security Council\u2019s \nadoption by consensus of a series of resolutions on the \nDemocratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea and Iran. It is \nnow up to all of us to translate the will of the \ninternational community into concrete action through \nfull implementation of the relevant resolutions. Japan \nwill continue its efforts to achieve the denuclearization \nof the Korean peninsula through the Six-Party Talks. \nJapan will also continue to urge Iran to heed the \nunanimous voice of the international community and \nsuspend its enrichment-related activities.  \n Nuclear disarmament should receive no less \nattention. I reiterate here the determination of my \ncountry to reinforce international efforts for nuclear \ndisarmament, as the only country in the world that has \nsuffered nuclear devastation. Japan will again submit a \ndraft resolution at this session of the General Assembly \nto map out concrete measures towards the total \nelimination of nuclear weapons. \n The issue of terrorism also requires sustained \nefforts as it becomes increasingly complex. In that \nregard, Japan welcomes the adoption of Security \nCouncil resolution 1776 (2007). For our own part, we \nwill make efforts to continue our refuelling activities in \nthe Indian Ocean to fulfil our role as a responsible \nmember of the international community. Japan also \nsupports the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism \nStrategy (resolution 60/288). Furthermore, to \nstrengthen the legal counter-terrorism framework I call \nupon every State to exercise the utmost flexibility for \nan early conclusion of the negotiations on a draft \ncomprehensive convention on international terrorism. \n In the face of a variety of threats to international \npeace and security, the Security Council has come to \nplay a more relevant role than ever before. For the \nSecurity Council to live up to its expected \nresponsibilities, we need to make it more \nrepresentative and effective. I therefore renew Japan\u2019s \ndetermination to pursue early reform of the Security \nCouncil, with the expansion of both the permanent and \nnon-permanent membership. As has been reiterated \ntime and time again, no reform of the United Nations \nwill be complete without reform of the Security \nCouncil. The momentum for such reform, renewed by \nformer Assembly President Al-Khalifa, must be \nstrengthened as we enter the sixty-second session. All \nMember States must work together so that we can \nachieve concrete results through intergovernmental \nnegotiations during this session. \n What is required today is not to wait for change, \nbut to bring it about. The question is not what to expect \nof the United Nations, but how we may revitalize the \nOrganization. We need to enhance the capacity of the \nUnited Nations to deal with new challenges. \n In addition to striving to implement Security \nCouncil reform, Japan will actively engage in efforts to \nstrengthen the ability of the United Nations to maintain \ninternational peace and security. Japan also supports \nthe ongoing endeavours to enable the United Nations \nsystem to work more coherently and effectively in the \nareas of development, humanitarian assistance, the \nenvironment and human rights. At the same time, we \nneed to achieve concrete results in management \nreform. \n In connection with reform, let me remind \nMember States that world leaders took a major step \nforward in 2005 by resolving to delete the long-\nobsolete \u201cenemy States\u201d clauses from the United \nNations Charter at the earliest opportunity (see \nresolution 60/1, para. 177). Next year, Japan will take \ncentre stage in international efforts. At TICAD IV in \nYokohama and the G-8 Summit at Tokyo, Japan will \nset forth principles for dealing with imminent \ninternational challenges. I hope to bring back solid \nresults to New York a year from now.  \n Let me conclude my remarks by renewing Japan\u2019s \nunwavering commitment to work, in close cooperation \nwith the United Nations, to change the world for the \nbetter. \n"

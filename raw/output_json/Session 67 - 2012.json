        "file_text": "\ufeffAllow me,\nat the outset, to extend my warmest congratulations to\nHis Excellency Mr. Vuk Jeremi\u0107, Minister for Foreign\nAffairs of Serbia, on his election to the presidency of\nthe General Assembly. I should like to express to him\nthe pleasure of the Union of the Comoros at seeing him\npreside over our work and to assure him of the full\nsupport of the Comorian delegation in discharging his\nnoble task.I should also like to pay tribute to his predecessor,\nMr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser, former Permanent\nRepresentative of the State of Qatar, who presided over\nthe General Assembly with such wisdom, skill and\ndetermination and who was successful in working to\nstrengthen its role.\nFinally, I wish to congratulate the Secretary-\nGeneral, His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for the\nvision with which he has led the Organization and for\nthe worthy initiatives he has ceaselessly undertaken to\npromote respect for the purposes and principles of the\nCharter of the United Nations, especially peacebuilding\nand stability for greater development.\nAs was the case last year, the General Assembly\nis meeting in a context of global uncertainty. It is a\nclimate marked by multifaceted crises, all of them\nmajor challenges for our institution. It is meeting at\na moment when one of the Members of our United\nNations family, Syria, is being rent asunder by a steadily\ndeterioraiting fratricidal war, which poses a serious\nthreat to peace both for the region and for the world,\ndue to that country\u2019s strategic geopolitical position.\nThe resignation of the Joint Special Envoy of the United\nNations and the League of Arab States, former United\nNations Secretary-General Kofi Annan, demonstrated,\nwere there any need for such, the complexity of\nmanaging the Syrian conflict. It therefore behoves us to\nact without delay to put an end to the terrible suffering\nof the brotherly Syrian people and to save what can be\nsaved of its various infrastructures.\nJust as important is the Palestinian cause. For\ndecades now, it has awaited a fair and lasting solution,\none found through our shared desire to establish\ntogether the solid foundations for a world of peace and\nprosperity. The Union of the Comoros reiterates its full\nsupport for the Palestinian people and associates itself\nwith the formula of a Palestinian State as a full-fledged\nmember of the community of nations, living side by\nside and in perfect security with the State of Israel.\nThe situation in northern Mali is also alarming.\nThe attacks carried out against the civilian population\nof the region, the serious violations of human rights,\nthe obstacles erected to humanitarian access, and\nthe destruction and looting of holy places and other\nreligious, historical and cultural sites are barbarous acts\nthat are contrary to the principles of Islam. That is why\nmy country supports the commitment of the Economic\nCommunity of West African States, alongside the African Union and the United Nations, to put an end to\nthose violations, which have gone on for much too long.\nOne should not, however, lose sight of the fact\nthat while some advocate fanaticism and extremism,\nIslamophobia is also taking on alarming proportions.\nIndeed, the dissemination of the video Innocence of\nMuslims has led to waves of indignation and many\ndemonstrations throughout the world. Several million\nbelievers have felt their faith insulted and harmed.\nHowever, the protests against the unspeakable\ninsults to Islam, Muslims and the Prophet\nMuhammad \u2014 peace be upon him \u2014 cannot justify the\nviolence against Western missions in many countries.\nMy country therefore condemns the terrorist attacks\nthat in Benghazi, Libya, caused the death of the\nAmerican Ambassador, Chris Stevens, and a number\nof his colleagues. I take this opportunity to reiterate\nto the American people and to the grieving families of\nthe victims the most heartfelt condolences of the people\nand the Government of the Comoros.\nThe ongoing existence of many hotbeds of tension\nthroughout the world, the violation of fundamental\nhuman rights, and the growth of piracy and terrorism\nall speak to the need for urgent and in-depth reform of\nthe Security Council. My country therefore reiterates\nits support for the African Union\u2019s position regarding\nthe need to reform the Council for better representation\nof the international community and for greater\neffectiveness in the settlement and management of\nconflicts.\nA few decades ago, my country resolutely\ncommitted itself to the path of democracy. It wishes\nto make its contribution to the promotion of a world\nof peace, security, justice and fairness. That is why\nI have committed myself, since my accession to the\npresidency, to spare no effort in promoting the rule of\nlaw and good governance in the Union of the Comoros.\nAbove and beyond the setting up of all institutions\nprovided for under our Constitution, including the\nSupreme Court, I have given major priority to the\nfight against corruption. An anti-corruption law has\nalready been promulgated, and a national commission\nto combat and prevent corruption has now been set up\nand made operational. I thank the European Union for\nits assistance and expertise in this area, which enabled\nus to develop the document for our national strategy to\ncombat corruption.This year once again, the global economic and\nfinancial crisis is at the heart of the Assembly\u2019s general\ndebate. That crisis has made evident the urgent need\nfor a global form of economic governance based on the\nvalues of responsibility, fairness and solidarity. It has\nalso placed before the eyes of the world the urgency\nof an in-depth reform of the international financial\ninstitutions.\nThe repercussions of the crisis are becoming\nincreasingly palpable, particularly in developing\ncountries, where the rising price of staples threatens\npeace and stability. The crisis has also intensified\nproblems linked to energy, which powers all\nsocioeconomic development, limiting our ability to\npromote development through investments.\nClimate change is another major challenge our\ncountries face. We must respond effectively to that\nphenomenon, which affects the entire planet, especially\nsmall island developing States such as the Union of the\nComoros.\nI wish to stress that last April my country\nexperienced two weeks of unusually violent torrential\nrains that hammered our islands, causing damage that\nhad disastrous consequences for our population and the\nnational economy. Ten per cent of the population was\naffected, a high percentage for a country as sparsely\npopulated as the Comoros. In the name of the whole\nComorian people and of my Government, I would\ntherefore like to thank all the partners and friends who\noffered us urgent humanitarian aid to help us address\nthat dramatic situation.\nThe unprecedented storms led my Government\nto draw up a rapid recovery plan, with the aid and\nsupport of the international community. It will enable\nus to better help those affected and to restore destroyed\ninfrastructure throughout our territory. That plan, which\ncontains procedures aimed at restoring the situation\nwithin a period of six to 12 months, was launched at\na round table held on 5 September in Pretoria, with\nthe fraternal support of our friendly brother country,\nthe Republic of South Africa. I would therefore like to\nappeal to all here to help finance the rapid recovery\nplan, whose cost has been estimated at $18 million.\nThat will allow my country to better face the current\nsituation and to better prepare for the future.\nThe time has come to relaunch with greater\ndetermination a number of pending international issues,\nin particular those regarding measures to mitigate or adapt to climate change and to make operational the\nCopenhagen Climate Fund. We need to honour the\ncommitments made to the countries of the South by\nimplementing, inter alia, the agreements on emissions\nlinked to deforestation and forest degradation, as well\nas a comprehensive agreement on climate change. We\nmust also respect the Kyoto Protocol on the reduction\nof greenhouses gases within the framework of the\nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate\nChange. Finally, we must do our utmost to achieve the\nMillennium Development Goals.\nFaced with all those equally important challenges,\nI urgently call on the most developed countries to apply\nto the most fragile countries the same mechanisms that\nhave been implemented to reduce the impact of the\ncrisis in Europe, in order to prevent more unfortunate\nconsequences, knowing that our countries depend on\nthe financial contributions of our people abroad. In that\ncontext, my country, which is currently a beneficiary\nof the Extended Credit Facility of the International\nMonetary Fund, hopes by December to have reached\nthe completion point of the Heavily Indebted Poor\nCountries Initiative. In other words, the new world\neconomic order, based on the shared principles of\nfairness, transparency and prosperity that we have\nwillingly embraced, requires a real and dynamic easing\nof the crisis that has struck the world. Africa impatiently\nawaits the advent of that new order to realize economic\nand social integration and to embark resolutely on the\npath of sustainable development.\nIn conclusion, with respect to my country\u2019s\nstability, before the General Assembly, I once again\nappeal to France that a frank and sincere dialogue\nfinally be set up between our two closely linked nations\non the question of the Comorian island of Mayotte. It\nhas grown increasingly clear that the fact that Mayotte\nremains under French administration constitutes a threat\nto the peace and stability of the three other Comorian\nislands \u2014 the peace that remains the foundation of\nfreedom and prosperity.\nIt is true, and a secret to no one, that that island has\nalways served as a rear guard for the detractors of the\nComoros, those who would prefer not to see our country\nmove forward despite its great potential. Moreover, the\nyear 2012, now drawing to a close, proved particularly\ndramatic for my people. Men, women and children\naboard f limsy boats known as kwassa kwassa perished\nin the narrow waters that separate the Comorian islands\nof Anjouan and Mayotte because of the visas that France imposed on the Comorians of the other islands. Surely\nthat painful, unacceptable situation, which has lasted for\ndecades, cannot fail to move this worldwide Assembly,\nwhose chosen theme for this year is \u201cBringing about\nadjustment or settlement of international disputes or\nsituations by peaceful means\u201d, including the rule of law\nat the national and international levels.\nI therefore hope that France will honour its\ncommitments as a country that respects international\nlaw. Finally, I hope it will respond positively to our\nurgent call so that together we may find a positive\nway for Mayotte to return to its natural home, which\nremains the Union of the Comoros. That is how to put\nan end to the humanitarian tragedy and to guarantee\nlasting stability for my country. It is through a definitive\nsolution to this conflict, which has lasted far too long,\nthat France can contribute to the ongoing efforts to\nenhance regional integration, and thus to safeguard the\ninterests of this region of the Indian Ocean that we hope\nto build together in stability and peace."

        "file_text": "\ufeffAs we speak today, the world\nis being shaken by the depravity of fanatics who\nhave committed acts insulting the faith of more than\n1.5 billion Muslims. We strongly condemn such\noffensive acts, whether they involve the production\nof a film, the publication of cartoons or indeed any\nother insults and provocations. Such acts can never\nbe justified as manifestations of freedom of speech\nor expression. Equally, they cannot become a reason\nfor genuine protests to be used to incite violence and\nterrible losses of innocent lives.\nIt is a matter for grave concern that our world\nremains strewn with daily outbreaks of violence, hatred\nand injustice. In particular, the menace of Islamophobia\nis a worrying phenomenon that threatens peace and\ncoexistence among cultures and civilizations. I call on leaders in the West, both among politicians and in the\nmedia, to confront Islamophobia in all its many forms\nand manifestations. It is incumbent on us all to advance\nthe cause of dialogue and cooperation, to fight the\nforces of division and hatred and to fulfil the promise\nof a better and brighter future for future generations.\nWe must work to defeat the forces that foment conflicts\namong civilizations, and to support the voices of\ntolerance and understanding.\nMy country, Afghanistan, is testament to the\nbenefits of multilateral cooperation and international\nsolidarity. It was a little over a decade ago that many\ncountries from around the world joined the Afghan\npeople in our struggle for peace and against the forces\nof extremism and terrorism. At the time, Afghanistan\nwas a country decimated in every way. For decades we\nhad suffered, unnoticed, from violence, deprivation\nand sinister foreign intervention. Long before terrorism\nbecame a security threat to the whole planet, Afghans\nwere victims of atrocities inf licted by terrorist\nnetworks from various parts of the world that had made\nAfghanistan their haven.\nLooking back 10 years, Afghanistan has undergone\na remarkable transformation. Democracy has taken\nroot; health services are accessible to the majority of\nthe population in every corner of the country; millions\nof students, boys and girls, are enrolled in primary and\nhigher education. Our achievements have not come\nabout easily, though. The aspirations of the Afghan\npeople for security and peace have yet to be realized. As\nthe global fight against terrorism continues unabated,\nthe Afghan people continue to pay a bigger price than\nany other nation, in both life and treasure.\nTerrorism is not rooted in Afghan villages and\ntowns; it never was. Its sources and support networks\nall exist beyond Afghanistan\u2019s borders. Thus while\nthe security of the international community is being\nprotected from the threat of terrorism, the people of\nAfghanistan must no longer be made to pay the price\nand endure the brunt of the war. It is in deference to the\nimmense sacrifices of the Afghan people, and to the\nprecious lives lost from the international community,\nthat the campaign against terrorism must be taken to\nthe sources of terrorism and be results-oriented.\nToday in Afghanistan, we are pursuing the cause of\npeace and an end to violence as a matter of great urgency.\nSince peace is the greatest desire of the Afghan people,\nand since we are convinced that military efforts alone\nare not an adequate strategy for ensuring security, we have initiated a peace and reconciliation process, which\naims to induce all elements of the armed opposition to\ntake up peaceful lives in our country.\nAt this time last year, my visit to the General\nAssembly was cut short by the tragic assassination of\nProfessor Burhanuddin Rabbani, the then Chairman\nof the High Peace Council. A terrorist posing as a\npeace emissary took his life, and by doing so dealt our\npeace process a serious blow. This year, however, and\nfortunately, the late Professor\u2019s son, Mr. Salahuddin\nRabbani, who stepped up to take the Chair of the High\nPeace Council, is part of the Afghan delegation and\npresent in the Assembly today.\nI have often said that our hand of peace and\nreconciliation remains extended not only to the Taliban\nbut also to all other armed opposition groups who wish\nto return to dignified, peaceful and independent lives\nin their own homeland. What we ask of them in return\nis simple: bringing an end to violence, cutting ties\nwith terrorist networks, preserving the valuable gains\nof the past decade and respecting the Constitution of\nAfghanistan. To help facilitate the peace process, I am\nasking the Security Council to give its full support to\nour efforts. In particular, I urge the Security Council\nCommittee established pursuant to resolution 1988\n(2011), the Taliban sanctions committee, to make more\nactive efforts to delist Taliban leaders, as a step towards\nfacilitating direct negotiations.\nIn pursuing the path of peace, we remain hopeful\nabout the critical role that our fraternal neighbour the\nIslamic Republic of Pakistan has to play. Over recent\nyears, we have engaged our brothers in Pakistan in a\nclose dialogue in support of the Afghan peace process.\nIt is a dialogue that we believe is critical for Pakistan\u2019s\nown security and for the security of the wider region\nand beyond. We are deeply committed to our brotherly\nrelations with Pakistan, but we are aware of the\nchallenges that may strain our efforts to build trust\nand confidence. Such incidents as the recent shelling\nof Afghan villages risk undermining the efforts of both\nGovernments to work together in the interest of our\ncommon security and prosperity.\nFor the past two years, our national priority has\nbeen to have Afghanistan\u2019s own security forces assume\nfull responsibility for the security of our country and\nour people. The transition process will be completed\nby mid-2013 and NATO and International Security\nAssistance Force forces withdrawn from our country\nby the end of 2014.\n\nApart from advancing transition and pursuing the\npeace process, the past year has been one of significant\nprogress for consolidating international commitment\nand partnership. In Chicago in May, we received the\nlong-term commitment of NATO and other countries to\ntraining, equipping and ensuring the sustainability of\nthe Afghan National Security Forces. In Tokyo this past\nJuly, the international community reaffirmed its strong\ncommitment to Afghanistan\u2019s social and economic\ndevelopment during the transformation decade, for\nwhich we are grateful.\nThe Mutual Accountability Framework adopted in\nTokyo sets in place a clear structure for a more results-\noriented partnership and cooperation. We welcome the\ninternational community\u2019s readiness to align aid with\nour national priorities and channel assistance through\nthe Afghan budget. For our part, we have reiterated our\ndetermination to improve governance and to collaborate\nwith our international partners to wipe out the cancer of\ncorruption, whether it is in the Afghan Government or\nthe international aid system.\nWe recognize that Afghanistan\u2019s destiny is tied to\nthe region that surrounds it, with respect both to our\ncommon threats, such as terrorism, extremism and\nnarcotics, and to the opportunities we must grasp to\ngrow and prosper. In that context, the Istanbul Process\npresents a new agenda for security, confidence-building\nand cooperation across the region of which Afghanistan\nis the centre. We will spare no effort to build strong and\nlasting relations with our neighbors near and extended.\nTurning to the international arena, Afghanistan\nviews the situation in Syria with much concern.\nOver the course of the past year, thousands of our\nSyrian brothers and sisters have lost their lives due\nto an escalating cycle of violence. We welcome the\nappointment of the new Joint Special Representative\nfor Syria of the United Nations and League of Arab\nStates, Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi. We know him very well.\nMr. Brahimi is well respected in Afghanistan, and he\nbrings vast experience and a unique ability to the task\nbefore him. Here, I say to the people of Syria that we\nAfghans have experienced violence ourselves, and we\nknow what it takes to rebuild a country. I hope very\nmuch, on behalf of the Afghan people, that the Syrians\nwill sit down together as soon as possible and find a\nway to end the violence, since it will be not easy to\nrepair.\n\nThe continuing plight of the Palestinian people\nhas been a source of deep distress for Afghanistan and\nthe rest of the international community. The people of\nPalestine have suffered immensely for far too long. We\nremain in full support of the realization of the rights\nof our brothers and sisters in Palestine, including their\nright to an independent Palestinian State. The time has\ncome for an end to the occupation and for realizing the\njust aspirations of the people of Palestine.\nFinally, reform of the United Nations remains an\nimportant item on the international agenda. Since its\ninception in 1945, the United Nations has exercised\na key role in promoting a safer and more secure\nworld, improving the lives of citizens worldwide,\nand safeguarding and promoting human rights.\nNevertheless, in view of our ever-changing world, we\ncannot deny the fact that the Organization is in dire\nneed of comprehensive reform, enabling it to better\nreflect the new challenges and realities of our time.\nThe reform of the Security Council is long overdue.\nAchieving a reformed Council that is more inclusive,\nrepresentative and transparent must remain a priority.\nWe welcome the ongoing progress within the framework\nof the intergovernmental negotiations."

        "file_text": "\ufeffAt the\noutset, I would like to congratulate Mr. Vuk Jeremi\u0107\non his election as President of the General Assembly at\nits sixty-seventh session and to wish him every success\nin that highly honourable and important role. I am\nconvinced that his rich experience will contribute to the\nachievement of significant results in our work together.\nI convey my appreciation as well to his predecessor,\nMr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser, for the exemplary\nmanner in which he led the sixty-sixth session. I also\nwish to pay tribute to Secretary-General Ban Ki-\nmoon for his ongoing efforts to revitalize the global\nrole of the United Nations and to bring reforms to the\nOrganization.\nIt is a great honour for me to speak from this\nrostrum for the first time on behalf of the people of\nthe Republic of Moldova. Twenty-one years ago, my\ncountry broke away from the Soviet empire, and today\nit is undergoing a process of democratic transformation,\nwith membership in the European Union as its ultimate\ngoal. After a period of several years marked by political\nturmoil, my country now enjoys political stability,\nwhich allows it to develop and modernize. We have\nfirmly defined European integration as our objective\nand have revived the economic and social reforms. Our\npriorities are the establishment of the rule of law and\ncomprehensive judicial reform, with an emphasis on\nfighting corruption, modernization of the economy and\nreintegration of the country.\nThe support and assistance provided by our\nEuropean partners from Brussels and United Nations\nMember States are extremely important for us and\nassure us that we are on the right path. Two decades\nago, on the very day the Republic of Moldova joined the United Nations, the peace in my country was shaken.\nThe armed conflict in the Transnistrian region of the\nRepublic of Moldova lasted for five months and caused\nthe loss of many lives. It was a tragic period that, while\nnow past, continues to pose a serious challenge in\nthe present. Since the end of the hostilities, Moldova\nhas firmly embarked on the road towards a peaceful\nsettlement of that conflict. Twenty years of negotiations\nhave strengthened our belief that that is the only viable\npath to follow in order to reach a political settlement.\nIt is obvious that the perpetuation of the conflict\ndoes not offer any real benefit to the majority of the\npeople on either bank of the Nistru river. It undermines\nour national security and territorial integrity, hampers\neconomic development and divides our society.\nMoreover, the conflict keeps the population of the\nTransnistrian region in isolation, incites human rights\nviolations and generates economic stagnation on\nthe left bank of the Nistru. The current political and\neconomic trends show that preserving the status quo is\nnot a viable scenario anymore. All of our international\npartners share the view that there is no alternative to\na reunified Moldova. Our message in that regard is\nfirm \u2013 20 years are enough to overcome the mistrust of\nthe past and it is time to start building a shared future.\nThe key elements in the approach of the Moldovan\nauthorities to resolving the conflict are also clear.\nOur ultimate goal is to reintegrate the Republic of\nMoldova within its internationally recognized borders\nas a functional State with a clear European perspective.\nThe Transnistrian region should be granted a special\nstatus within Moldova, which will provide the region\nwith a comfortable level of self-governance. Defining\nthe special status is the core task of the political\nnegotiations in the \u201c5+2\u201d format. That negotiation\nprocess should lead to a reasonable compromise based\non the principles of the sovereignty and territorial\nintegrity of the Republic of Moldova.\nIn parallel, we will continue to implement\nconfidence-building measures aimed at bringing\ncommunities from both banks of the Nistru River\ncloser to each other. By promoting business links,\nensuring freedom of movement, protecting human\nrights, improving security and combating criminality,\nwe will prepare a better ground for a political solution.\nTransformation of the existing military peacekeeping\nmechanism into an international civilian mission aimed\nat building confidence rather than separating the sides\nhas also become an imperative. Our international partners provide an essential\ncontribution to bringing that conflict to an end. Growing\nassistance from the European Union is an encouraging\nexample in that regard. The negotiation process now\nneeds a strong stimulus, and we believe that our\ninternational partners can demonstrate the necessary\npolitical will to that end. We call on the 5+2 format\nnegotiators, namely, the Organization for Security\nand Cooperation in Europe, the Russian Federation,\nUkraine, the European Union and the United States of\nAmerica, to pool their efforts and work together towards\nthe final resolution of the Transnistrian conflict and\nreintegration of the Republic of Moldova.\nIt is also important to reiterate that Russian forces\nare still present on the territory of the Republic of\nMoldova, without the consent of the host country and in\nbreach of the Moldovan Constitution and international\ncommitments, and they should be finally withdrawn.\nThe universal character of the United Nations and\nits unique role in managing international relations\nare widely recognized. There is no alternative to\nthis Organization. Yet, globalization and the global\nfinancial crisis have demonstrated the need to reform\nthe Organization in order to ensure the progressive\nand sustainable strengthening of the United Nations. I\nam referring in particular to Security Council reform,\nto which a compromise solution should be found. We\nbelieve that any proposal for its reform should take into\naccount the legitimate aspirations of all regional groups,\nincluding granting an additional non-permanent seat to\nthe Eastern European States.\nIn its capacity as a member of the Human Rights\nCouncil, the Committee on Conferences, the Policy and\nProgramme Coordination Committee, the Committee\non Information, the Commission for Population and\nDevelopment and other United Nations elective bodies,\nthe Republic of Moldova will continue to support\nefforts towards the comprehensive reform of the\nUnited Nations system and its main bodies and organs,\nincluding the revitalization of the General Assembly\nand the reform of the Security Council aimed at\nenhancing the efficiency, transparency, accountability\nand representativeness of the system.\nThe relationship between the United Nations and\nregional organizations is of paramount importance for\nthe maintenance of international peace and security. In\nmany instances, all those organizations have unique\nand complementary capacities that, when properly\ncoordinated, can contribute decisively to the prevention and management of conflicts, including protracted\nones. From that point of view, during this session we\nwill strongly support the consideration by the General\nAssembly of the issue of cooperation between the\nUnited Nations and regional organizations, particularly\nthe Organization for Security and Cooperation in\nEurope, the Council of Europe, the Black Sea Economic\nCooperation Organization and other organizations.\nIn the same context, considering the distinct\nobjective devoted to democracy and economic\ndevelopment, the increased potential and role in economic\ndevelopment and regional integration, as well as the\nstrong determination of the countries of the Georgia,\nUkraine, Azerbaijan, Moldova (GUAM) Organization\nfor Democracy and Economic Development to actively\ncontribute to international security, stability and peace,\nthe delegations of its member States have decided to\nadvance for consideration of the General Assembly\nduring its current session a draft resolution on\ncooperation between the United Nations and GUAM.\nAt this stage, the process of development and\nintegration of our States is still burdened by some\noutstanding problems, including unresolved conflicts\nin the territories of the Republic of Azerbaijan,\nGeorgia and the Republic of Moldova. We reaffirm our\nunswerving commitment to finding peaceful solutions\nto those conflicts on the basis of respect for the\nsovereignty and territorial integrity of our countries.\nPromoting the rule of law at the national and\ninternational levels is at the heart of the United Nations\nmission and is fundamental to achieving durable peace,\nsupporting openness in Government, the effective\nprotection of human rights and sustained economic\ngrowth and development. We emphasize the importance\nof the High-level Meeting of the General Assembly on\nthe Rule of Law at the National and International Levels\n(A/67/PV.3), held on 24 September, and will continue\nto support efforts in that direction during the sixtyseventh\nsession. In our view, strengthening the rule of\nlaw will help to maintain peace, promote development\nand enhance cooperation, and is therefore conducive to\nthe achievement of the goal of building a harmonious\nworld.\nThe non-proliferation of weapons of mass\ndestruction, disarmament and the efficient control of\narmaments remain vital topics on the international\ncooperation agenda, which need the common\nunderstanding, political will and engaged efforts of all\nStates and international organizations. The Republic of Moldova fully supports the international community\nin exerting continuous control of and applying the\nnecessary preventive measures against unlawful\nattempts to develop weapons of mass destruction and\ntheir means of delivery, which pose a real threat to\ninternational security and are often used to challenge\nthe existing world order.\nThe Republic of Moldova established significant\nobjectives and is undertaking tangible steps in\naccomplishing its priorities in the field of arms control.\nIn cooperation with our partners, the Government of\nthe Republic of Moldova is in the process of adjusting\nto the best international standards, adopting dual-use\ngoods export control legislation, improving small arms\nand light weapons management for civilians and the\nmilitary, ensuring proper border management, and\nactively cooperating at the regional and international\nlevels.\nMilitary conflicts in different regions of the planet\nand the global economic crises have brought human\nrights issues once again to our attention. The principles\nof international law and human rights standards can\nbe promoted only by joint efforts and decisions. Acts\nof aggression, including attacks against the personnel\nand integrity of diplomatic facilities, represent a\nviolation of international norms and deserve our firm\ncondemnation. The relevant bodies of the United\nNations, including the Human Rights Council, have\nsufficient instruments to take action on behalf of States\nin order to prevent human rights violations, conduct\ncountry evaluations and provide tailored solutions.\nAs a member of the Human Rights Council for the\nterm of 2010 to 2013 and, as Vice-Chair of the Third\nCommittee at its previous session, the Republic of\nMoldova continuously pledges to keep an open mind\nin furthering the cause of promoting and protecting\nhuman rights worldwide.\nThe world economic crisis is an incentive\nfor putting into practice the idea of sustainable\ndevelopment, which could simultaneously provide\nsolutions for maintaining the pace of economic growth\nand prevent climate change. We support the renewal\nof the global commitment made at the United Nations\nConference on Sustainable Development, held in Rio de\nJaneiro, Brazil, and the agreement on establishing the\nsustainable development goals (see resolution 66/288,\nannex). We believe that promoting a green economy\nmodel will help enterprises to reconfigure in order to\nstreamline natural, human and economic investments. Finally, I would like to reiterate that the Republic\nof Moldova is a strong supporter of the United Nations\nrole in global governance and the management of\ninternational crises. We believe in the potential and\ncapacities of the United Nations to find adequate\nresponses and take concrete actions aimed at resolving\nthe ever-increasing global challenges. The Republic of\nMoldova is definitely contributing to that activity."

        "file_text": "\ufeffOn behalf of Mr. Desir\u00e9\nDelano Bouterse, President of the Republic of Suriname,\nI avail myself of this opportunity to extend to Mr. Vuk\nJeremi\u0107 my congratulations on his election as President\nof the General Assembly at its sixty-seventh session.\nThe wealth of experience that he brings to this body\nwill certainly assist him in successfully discharging his\nduties. We pledge our full support and cooperation.\nAllow me to salute his predecessor for his skilful\nleadership at the sixty-sixth session. We wish him\nwell in his future endeavours. To Secretary-General\nBan Ki-moon we pledge our support for his valuable\ncontribution in advancing the purposes and principles\nof the Organization.\nIn his annual statement last week, in which he\nintroduced the 2013 national budget, the President of\nSuriname highlighted Suriname\u2019s strengths and the\nopportunities and challenges we are facing as a young,\nvibrant member of the international community. As\nrefiners and exporters of crude oil and its derivatives, as\nwell as producers and exporters of gold, a combination\nof windfalls in earnings related to the trade of those\ncommodities and the application of prudent fiscal\npolicies, have resulted in a politically and economically\nstable environment. That stability in turn has become\nconducive to solid domestic and foreign investments\nin the more sustainable sectors, in which agriculture and tourism score high. The design and construction\nof relevant infrastructure demonstrate Suriname\u2019s\npotential to be a player on the supply side of strategic\ncommodities.\nPresident Bouterse also presented a social package\nin which education and health care figure prominently.\nHe made the point that strong international ratings are\nencouraging indicators for investors. However, the\ncitizens of Suriname who lack the right opportunities\nwill share in the achievements only if the Government\nis able to present them with a package comprising job-\noriented education at an academic as well as a vocational\nlevel, adequate health services, sports facilities, access\nto potable water, information and communications\ntechnology facilities and proper waste disposal. The\nchallenge of financing such an improved social package\nmakes it necessary to empower our production and\nservice sectors by providing funds and know-how to\nour entrepreneurs.\nSuriname, as a young nation, is experiencing an\nongoing decolonization process that involves both its\nstructure and its mindset. Building a nation of half a\nmillion people constitutes an enormous challenge when\nat least seven different ethnic and cultural traditions\noriginate from the Americas, Africa and Europe, while\na considerable part of the population traces its roots to\nIndia, Indonesia, China and the Middle East. .\nSuriname is known for the presence of a synagogue\nlocated next to a mosque in the heart of the capital\nParamaribo, while Christian churches coexist with\nHindu temples and places of worship with a strong\nAfrican affinity. We are proud to state that we have\nbeen able to convert that challenge into a unique and\nexemplary benefit and that the divide-and-rule policy\nof colonial days is gradually disappearing, making way\nfor mutual respect, tolerance and peaceful coexistence,\nwhich redound to the advantage of all our citizens.\nSuriname is a country blessed with an exuberant\narray of biodiversity. That splendid gift of the Almighty\nmust be cherished and protected to the fullest extent.\nIt needs to be mapped out in a way that allows for\nresponsible use. The challenge we face is responding to\nthe genuine developmental needs of our people, while\nat the same time respecting and preserving biodiversity\nfor future generations, and indeed for humankind.\nMy country has committed itself to that cause\nby, among other actions, creating a nature reserve of\n1.8 million hectares. We have accepted the obligation to educate our small gold miners in the use of modern\ntechnology that will not only prove more lucrative and\nsafe but also respect the need for a clean environment,\nallowing for potable water and profitable agriculture.\nSuriname must remain green and smart.\nSuriname is very much aware of the fact that\nwhile we have solid advantages as a nation, we can\nonly survive and prosper by adapting to a world that is\nbecoming more and more interdependent. Having been\nblessed with oil reserves, trillions of cubic metres of\nfossil water reserves, along with hundreds of rivers,\nswamps, creeks, arable land and minerals, including\ngold, copper, granite, rare earth and more, Suriname\nhas become a focal point in view of the ever-growing\nscarcity of those commodities.\nIn order to maintain and enhance our political\nstability, we must deepen and widen our eco-commercial\nposition and be able to keep our country and people\nsafe from any outside intervention and interference.\nSuriname has engaged in a serious quest for integration\nwith its immediate neighbours \u2014 Guyana, France\nand Brazil \u2014 at a bilateral and, wherever possible,\ntripartite level. Suriname is also a devoted participant\nin the historic movement of regional integration that is\ngrowing in form and substance. We are active members\nof the Union of South American Nations, the secretariat\nof which will be based in Suriname as from July 2013.\nWe are committed to the creation of a Caribbean\nCommunity multinational corporation, giving a more\nmeaningful basis to the single market and economic\ngoals put in place since 2006. As one of the founding\nmembers of the Community of Latin American and\nCaribbean States, we continue to be dedicated to the\nintegration mechanism of the Americas, remaining\ncommitted to the principles and objectives of the\nOrganization of American States.\nAlthough our region is making enormous strides in\nfurthering democracy and development, we must draw\nthe attention of the international community to the lack\nof progress in assisting one of the most disadvantaged\ncountries in the Western Hemisphere, namely Haiti.\nWe call on the international community to honour its\npledges to assist the Government and people of Haiti in\ntheir efforts to rebuild their beloved country.\nFurthermore, our quest for integration will never\nbe complete if we continue to accept the isolation of our\nsister nation, Cuba, as a consequence of the unjustly\nimposed economic and trade embargo. Once again, we firmly call for an immediate end of those coercive\nmeasures, which cause so much suffering to the people\nof Cuba.\nWhen Suriname became a Member of the United\nNations 36 years ago, we were little aware of the\nimportance of a number of issues not specifically\ndealing with decolonization. Now we have grown\nin our understanding. We realize that a properly\nfunctioning United Nations, including a democratically\nbased Security Council, has the potential to become\nthe single most important stabilizing factor in a world\nthat has moved from bipolarity to multipolarity. In the\nworld of ever-shifting economic, political, diplomatic\nand military Powers, the themes of the sixty-seventh\nsession of the General Assembly were appropriately\nchosen.\nWe specifically want to draw the Assembly\u2019s\nattention to the need for dialogue in situations of\nconflict. In our understanding, it is not easy for Powers\nthat have grown accustomed to controlling other\nnations to grasp fully what it means to move away from\ndominance and dependence to interdependence and the\nneed for dialogue in solving real or alleged conflicts.\nBoth the United States of America and the Federative\nRepublic of Brazil clearly endorsed the concept in their\nstatements at the opening of our general debate.\nWe urge all Member States in general and the\nformer colonial Powers in particular to accept the new\nreality of our world by categorically refraining from\napplying their own standards in judging the outcome of\nother countries\u2019 democratic structures and aspirations,\ndisrespecting the internationally accepted principles of\nterritorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of\nnations all over the world.\nIt is within that framework that I quote the closing\nremarks at the presentation of the 2013 national budget\nby Mr. Desir\u00e9 Delano Bouterse, President of the\nRepublic of Suriname:\n\u201cAs regards the sovereignty of our beloved\nSuriname as an independent nation, our principal\ntask is none other than to respect and to defend the\nsovereignty of our nation against all violations and\nattacks from outside.\n\u201cWhenever and by whomever our sovereignty\nis being challenged, our legitimate Government\nhas no other duty than to defend and safeguard the\nentrusted sovereignty of the country\u201d. The United Nations was built on the ashes of the\nSecond World War, and we pledged to save successive\ngenerations from the scourge of war. The peaceful\nsettlement of disputes is the only avenue through\nwhich we can ensure that the planet will be saved from\nannihilation. That principled stand must be applied\nto all areas of conflict, whether the conflict is in the\nMiddle East, Africa, the Americas or anywhere else in\nthe world.\nThe target date for achieving the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals is fast approaching. The year\n2015 will be a decisive year when world leaders will\ngather once again to assess the implementation of the\ncommitments made. We underscore the importance\nof creating well-being for all and providing greater\nopportunities for the vulnerable in our society by giving\nfull access to high-quality education at all levels and\naffordable and high-quality health care and services, as\nwell as realizing the commitments to gender equality\nand the empowerment of women.\nIt is necessary to increase the ability of women all\nover the world to bring about change, to ensure that\nthey can exist in an environment free from violence\nand conducive to their well-being, including access to\ndecent employment, services and housing.\nWe acknowledge the global burden and threat of\nnon-communicable diseases. In moving towards the\nfull implementation of the Political Declaration of the\nHigh-level Meeting of the General Assembly on the\nPrevention and Control of Non-communicable Diseases\n(resolution 66/2, annex), as well as other commitments\nwe have made, we stress the importance of multisectoral\nactions, strengthening health systems, ensuring the\navailability of adequate and sustained resources, as\nwell as enhanced international cooperation through\neffective partnerships. Suriname has increased its\nefforts in the fight against those often overlooked silent\nkillers.\n\nThe United Nations Conference on Sustainable\nDevelopment concluded without an agreement on a\nclear commitment with regard to the financing of\nsustainable development. That is a very serious matter,\nconsidering the threat of climate change, among others,\nto a successful outcome of the efforts of small States\nlike Suriname to achieve sustainable development. The\ninternational community cannot abandon its obligation to provide the necessary means to combat the serious\nconsequences of overconsumption, pollution and carbon\nemissions, which threaten to undo our achievements\naimed at protecting the environment and securing the\nwell-being of our peoples. We continue to expect the\nUnited Nations to spearhead the efforts for technical\nassistance and to advance continued dialogue.\nSuriname is deeply concerned with regard to the\nbasis on which countries in development are classified\nin the international financial institutional framework.\nSuch classifications, without due consultations,\nnegatively affect the type and level of assistance that\na country can receive from international financial\ninstitutions. We can only characterize those decisions\nas undemocratic and as a virtual punishment of\nour achievements in improving our socioeconomic\nsituation.\nIn conclusion, I wish to solemnly declare that\nSuriname will always put its faith in multilateralism\nthrough its unwavering support for the principles\nand objectives enshrined in the Charter of the United\nNations."

        "file_text": "\ufeffOn\nbehalf of the Eastern Republic of Uruguay, I would\nlike to congratulate my friend Ambassador Vuk\nJeremi\u0107 on his election to preside over the work of the\nGeneral Assembly during its sixty-seventh session. His\nexperience, competence and reliability will be crucial\nin ensuring that the most representative body of the\nUnited Nations effectively fulfils its duties. We assure\nhim of the full support of Uruguay.\nThe focus of the General Assembly this year\non the promotion of the rule of law at national and\ninternational levels is extremely relevant, and I take\nthis opportunity to welcome the declaration adopted\nby the General Assembly on Monday on that matter\n(resolution 67/1). Respect for and promotion of the rule\nof law at the national and international levels are two\nsides of the same coin, which has the well-being of the\nindividual as its raison d\u2019\u00e9tre. It means also that neither\nindividuals nor States are above the law, but are subject\nto it. Uruguay considers rule of law a constitutive element\nof the social contract that sustains its democratic system\nand that stands out as a pillar of its foreign policy. It\nis important to stress that this was not motivated by\nforeign influence, nor did it come through the adoption\nof an abstract political model from outside. Rather, it\nwas the result of a profound internal process of building\nand organizing the free coexistence of our people.\nThe principle of juridical equality of States,\nlike equality among individual people, is one of\nthe fundamental principles of our Organization,\nguaranteeing to all the same right to participate in\nthe responsibilities of the international community,\nindependent of the power possessed by each nation. It\nis precisely in respect of this principle that our country\nrejects any coercive unilateral or extraterritorial\nmeasure that contravenes the rules of international law\nand the principles of the Charter of the United Nations.\nThe clearest contemporary example of such a measure\nis the embargo unfairly set against the Republic of\nCuba.\nThe principle of the self-determination of\npeoples \u2014 understood as a collective right that must be\nobserved in a manner analogous to respect for freedom\nof the individual at the domestic level \u2014 is also an\nessential pillar of the rule of law. That freedom, which\nincludes freedom of expression and other fundamental\nfreedoms, is closely related to the effective operation of\ndemocratic institutions.\nIn that respect, and without prejudice to reaffirming\nthat any attempt at the partial or total disruption of the\nnational unity or territorial integrity of a country is\nincompatible with the purposes and principles of the\nCharter of the United Nations, Uruguay has always\ndefended the right to self-determination of peoples\nas a key principle for the international coexistence\nof States. It reiterates its desire for a peaceful, just,\nsustainable and mutually accepted solution of the\nquestion of Western Sahara, based on international law\nand resolutions of the General Assembly and Security\nCouncil and respectful of the human rights and the will\nof the Saharan people.\nAn independent judicial system, to which all\npersons have access on the basis of the principle of\nequality before the law, is necessary for the genuine\nrule of law. Projecting this concept of the State and\nof the law beyond our borders is a vocation for peace\nand the peaceful settlement of disputes, of which my\ncountry was an early promoter. My country showed its firm commitment to those values and principles\nalready at the Hague Conference of 1907, where it tried\nto introduce compulsory international arbitration, and\nalso in 1921, when it became the first country to legally\naccept the compulsory jurisdiction of the Permanent\nCourt of International Justice, under only the condition\nof reciprocity.\nThe strenuous efforts of the international\ncommunity to build a fair system and to achieve greater\nbalance among countries and greater well-being for\ntheir societies have not yet achieved the necessary\nethical and policy solutions.\nRecently we have seen what appears to be an era\nof change in some regions of the world. Peoples are\nseeking their freedom with the means they have at\nhand, with a legitimate desire to achieve democracy\nand greater well-being. Political actions of peoples\nseeking new alternatives of power have come up\nagainst those who are better organized politically and\nwho thus will prevail, as they have always prevailed.\nThose who have now assumed power must be aware of\ntheir responsibilities towards those peoples.\nEradicating tyranny, consolidating peace and\nmaking social benefits available to everyone are\nenormous challenges. The task is to build real\ndemocracies, and to build them with all of the\ncontradictions, differences and difficulties that exist\nwithin a society.\nEven in our region we have received threats with a\nmajor ideological component. The attempted coup d\u2019\u00e9tat\nin Ecuador and the breakdown of the democratic order\nin Paraguay have shown that Governments of change\nhave been affected in the development of their policies.\nThe rule of law and democracy are not acquired values;\nrather, they must be defended each day as precious\ngoods.\nRecent events such as what happened in Paraguay\ndemonstrate that the rule of law is still threatened and\nthat despite progress in terms of democratic institutions\nin all our nations, threats to the full exercise of\nfundamental rights and democratic values persist.\nThat represents a great challenge to our aspiration\nto strengthen the integration and development of our\ncountries, making the defence of the rule of law and\nthe democratic order a necessary and unavoidable\ncondition.\nDespite the great changes that have afflicted\nhumanity, the international system continues to work hard, yet it does not resolve the problems, or resolves\nthem unfairly. It has been unable to create equal\nfinancial or commercial opportunities. Even today, it\nis not a priority to invest in countries\u2019 human resources\naccording to their specific needs. The political system\nhas acted to control or decide political destinies, rather\nthan to ensure the security or well-being of the people.\nThose who suffered before are suffering now. Powerful\ncountries still threaten or intervene in other countries.\nWe have written about values and principles and\nhave incorporated them in our constitutions. We have\npreached in many ways about what is good for everyone.\nBut we have not succeeded in meeting the basic needs\nof billions of poor people, nor have we guaranteed\nthem programmes for health, education, housing or\nemployment.\nThe basis of social justice has not changed. It is\npeace, it is freedom, because without that we cannot be\nactively aware of noble causes that require that one not\nbe dominated or oppressed \u2014 and without that, there is\nnothing. It is dignified housing that protects a family,\nwork with dignity at a fair wage, the right to education\nand the responsibility of each individual. It is the health\ncare that can save the 7 million children under 5 years\nof age who die each year around the world and that\ncares for the elderly, for women and for the destitute.\nWhat is truly revolutionary is to change the\nconditions of life for those who cannot fully enjoy their\nrights, because our political ideal must be, essentially,\nthe human dimension. The solution requires that the\nsystem provide each person the greatest guarantees of\nhis political rights and that it be fair with regard to the\nobligations and responsibilities in that respect.\nThe greatest freedom implies the greatest\nresponsibility. Each person, as both an individual\nand part of the community, must receive, possess and\nenjoy the rights that are fundamental to ensuring the\nwell-being of all as a way to transform solutions into\nreality. The struggle for transformation determines\nthe struggle of each person to find a solution for his\nproblems. Resolving the issues inherent in poverty,\nlack of freedom or impediments to the enjoyment of\neconomic, social and cultural rights requires concrete,\nurgent and immediate action.\nAlmost 200 years ago, someone declared that\nthe most unfortunate would be the most privileged.\nHis thinking was truly revolutionary, but there was\nsomething in it even more revolutionary, because he took on the task of orchestrating and executing\nthe changes that would provoke the redistribution of\nresources. He took his solutions to the most needy:\nwidows with children, children, and poor blacks,\nzambos and creoles.\nDevelopment requires change. The present day has\ngiven us, as a fundamental condition of our projects,\ninsoluble problems such as poverty, malnutrition,\novercrowding, unemployment, child mortality and\nother socioeconomic scourges that still afflict most of\nhumanity. Therefore, this system requires a change,\nand the only way to carry it out is to transform reality.\nOur responsibilities as a community of nations\ncannot be avoided, as some of those problems occur as\na natural result of the conditions and characteristics of\nrelations among States. The international context tends\nto concentrate wealth, efficiency and competitiveness\nand has no mechanisms to redistribute the resources in\na fair and efficient manner that would provide a roof to\nevery homeless person, a plate of food to every hungry\nperson or break the chains of the oppressed. The\ninternational system is based on the struggle of national\ninterests for a more powerful position, and that means\nthat the concentration of power becomes ever greater.\nEveryone is aware that countries such as ours\noperate within highly competitive international markets,\nthat we do not determine prices, that commodity prices\nf luctuate thus altering our national export matrix, and\nthat we are exposed to successive financial crises.\nContinuing with this line of thought, it is essential to\nprioritize Uruguay\u2019s involvement in the international\ncommunity, integrating international aspects of the\ncountry\u2019s issues in the areas of agriculture, industry,\ncommercialization and financing, all with the purpose\nof eliminating poverty, achieving social justice and\nfirmly establishing primary education. Among other\nthings, this requires reducing or eliminating the\ndistortions that pose obstacles to commercial exchange,\nparticularly agriculture subsidies, internal supports and\nother protectionist measures that prevent international\ntrade from becoming a factor that contributes to solving\nthe financial crisis that is currently affecting the global\neconomy.\nEconomic and social development requires the\nstability and predictability that the rule of law ensures.\nThe United Nations has grasped that reality, and it is\nencouraging to see that strengthening the rule of law,\nand the institutions whose job it is to implement that rule of law, is central to the tasks of the Organization\u2019s\nvarious peacekeeping, peacebuilding and special\npolitical missions, including the United Nations\nStabilization Mission in Haiti, to which Uruguay is a\nprincipal contributor.\nOur historical belief that a national society must be\nruled by law means that we believe that the community\nof sovereign nations should regulate itself in conformity\nwith international law. In that context, it is Uruguay\u2019s\nhope that the international community can take\neffective steps towards eliminating nuclear weapons\nand focus its efforts on eliminating this terrible threat\nstill hanging over humankind. Similarly, we call for\nredoubled efforts to enable us finally to conclude a\ntreaty regulating the arms trade, which has a serious\nimpact on Latin American and Caribbean countries and\nother developing regions of the world.\nRegarding the promotion and protection of human\nrights, Uruguay\u2019s coordination with the international\nsystem has reached a very high level. Our country is\nparty to all legal instruments relating to human rights\nand international humanitarian law. It offers an open\ninvitation to all universal and inter-American special\nprocedures to visit the country and recognizes the\nbinding jurisdiction of all monitoring committees for\nreceiving individual complaints and communications.\nAt the same time, Uruguay has expressed its preference\nfor establishing international jurisdictional bodies\nand institutions. Our country\u2019s longtime goal in this\narea was realized at the regional level through the\nestablishment in 1969 of the Inter-American Court of\nHuman Rights under the San Jos\u00e9 de Costa Rica Pact.\nUruguay has been a member of the Human Rights\nCouncil since its creation in 2006 and is its President\nfor the period 2011-2012. During our mandate, we\nhave advocated for a new culture of dialogue, for the\nprogressive and incremental utilization of special\nprocedures and other instruments for action before\nresorting to coercive or confrontational measures, for\na two-way cooperative model between States and the\nUnited Nations system, for greater regional coordination\nand for the importance of civil society\u2019s participation.\nWe have promptly, clearly and constructively expressed\nour position on situations involving serious violations\nof human rights, ethnic cleansing, crimes against\nhumanity and war crimes.\nUruguay has been a party to the Rome Statute since\n2002 and has enacted a law that can be seen as a model\nof cooperation with the International Criminal Court. Seven years ago, when the Assembly was\nconsidering the concept of the responsibility to protect,\nwe committed to ending mass atrocities, giving priority\nto prevention and aiding States that so requested to\ncomply fully with their responsibilities to protect their\npeoples from such scourges and to respond speedily\nand decisively in accordance with the provisions of the\nUnited Nations Charter.\nWe firmly condemn the serious violations of\nhuman rights that are taking place in Syria. The\nsituation has deteriorated and the suffering of the\ncivilian population has become intolerable. We support\nthe work of the independent international commission\nof inquiry established by the Human Rights Council,\nwhich in its most recent report (A/HRC/21/50) states\nthat there is reason to believe that Government forces\nare committing crimes against humanity. All violence\nin Syria must cease immediately; it is essential that\nwe establish a process of dialogue aimed at reaching a\npeaceful solution. Uruguay supports the mediator role\nof the United Nations within a framework of a strict\nrespect for international law and the principles of the\nCharter. The protection of civilians is a multifaceted\ntask, of which the most sensitive and important aspect\nis protecting those facing imminent danger of physical\nviolence.\nThrough its firm commitment to peacekeeping\noperations, Uruguay has played and will continue to play\na proactive and constructive role both at Headquarters\nand on the ground. Nevertheless, we must make greater\nefforts and work for better coherence among all the\nactors involved in order to eliminate or minimize as\nfar as possible the numbers of civilian victims of armed\nconflicts.\nHuman rights are universal, interdependent and\nindivisible. Ensuring that they are enforced, protected\nand promoted is possible only through a firmly\nestablished rule of law and well-functioning democratic\ninstitutions, democracy, good governance and a more\neffective multilateral system.\nIt is essential that the United Nations adapt to\nglobal challenges, guarantee its presence on the ground\nand respond to all the challenges faced by developing\ncountries in accordance with their priorities and\nneeds. It is thus imperative that development processes\nemphasize one of the greatest threats to the rule of\nlaw and democracy \u2014 poverty, particularly extreme\npoverty, which causes instability and insecurity. Our country has given absolute priority to combating that\nscourge purposefully and head on. In the past year\nalone, Uruguay was able to reduce the percentage of\npeople living in poverty from 18.6 to 13.7 per cent, and\nof those in extreme poverty from 1.1 to 0.5 per cent.\nCombating the adverse effects of climate change, a key\nchallenge to achieving sustainable development, is also\none of our priorities.\nNow more than ever, we must revitalize our global\nalliance for development and increase international\ncooperation.\nFinally, if the strength and sustainability of the\nrule of law at the national level depend on the active\nparticipation of citizens in defending the standards\nthat ensure every society\u2019s continued coexistence and\ndevelopment, at the international level it requires full\ncompliance with the principles of international law and\nthe provisions of the Charter of the United Nations and\nstrong commitment to the causes of peace, the peaceful\nsettlement of disputes and multilateralism. That is the\nmain goal that Uruguay has pursued during the process\nof building the United Nations, both as a founding\nMember and through its participation in the activities\nof the General Assembly. It is our ambition to continue\nthose efforts from within the Security Council should\nour country be elected, as we hope, to that body as a\nnon-permanent member for the period 2016-2017."

        "file_text": "\ufeffI congratulate the President on his election to preside\nover this session of the General Assembly. I respectfully\noffer him the support of the Panamanian delegation\nduring his tenure. We welcome his proposal to focus\nthis high level debate on the theme \u201cBringing about\nadjustment or settlement of international disputes or\nsituations by peaceful means\u201d. That theme is based\non Chapter VI of the United Nations Charter, which\naddresses the peaceful settlement of disputes.\nSince its establishment, the United Nations\nhas played an essential role in the prevention and resolution of international conflicts. The commitment\nof the United Nations continues to be to protect future\ngenerations from the scourge of war and to ensure that\npeace and respect among nations are the permanent\nconditions for global coexistence.\nInternational conflicts have always been and will\nremain a challenge for the international community\nand a grave threat to freedom and the right to enjoy a\npeaceful coexistence among all the nations and peoples\nof the world. That is why all the countries of the world\nhave the responsibility to ensure the maintenance of\ninternational peace and security.\nThe Panamanian people possess the strong\nconviction and the commitment to use all existing\npeaceful means to solve international conflicts on the\nbasis of the United Nations Charter and international\nlaw. Those are simple truths that are easily forgotten,\nbut which we all must defend. They are the basic\ncondition for our existence in full peace, freedom and\nindependence.\nPanama advocates for the solution of all international\nconflicts by peaceful means. We support the promotion\nand defence of multilateralism and of all multilateral\norganizations as ideal frameworks for solving, through\ndialogue and cooperation, the problems that afflict\nhumankind so that we may thereby maintain peace and\ninternational peace and security.\nThe search for mediation and dialogue has\nbeen the stance that Panama has historically always\nmaintained with regard to the conflicts that disturb\npeace and international political stability. That search\nmust include legitimate representatives of the parties\nin conflict, who must make efforts to recognize the\nrights of their counterparts and comply with their own\nobligations, with sincerity and a generous spirit, to\nreach just and permanent solutions.\nFor that reason, the Government of the Republic\nof Panama considers that Palestine has the right to be\nrecognized as a nation-State. However, it must resolve\nits differences with its neighbour, Israel, recognizing\nthat Israel has the right to a peaceful and safe existence\nwithin its national territory \u2014 a right that has already\nbeen recognized historically and legally by the\ninternational community.\nPanama expresses its concern at the escalating\nviolence that has been developing in the Middle East\nand calls upon the international community to propose and attempt to enforce plans and solutions oriented\ntowards peace, contributing to ending violent acts that\naffect the most vulnerable populations.\nThe Government of the Republic of Panama\nexpresses is concerned about the severe crisis that has\naffected the fraternal Syrian Arab Republic for over\na year. We therefore respectfully remind all parties\ninvolved that peaceably resolving conflicts is the only\nmeans acceptable to the community of nations and\npeoples of the world for achieving a just and permanent\nsolution.\nThe Panamanian people deeply deplore the\nmurder of His Excellecy Mr. J. Christopher Stevens,\nAmbassador of the United States of America to Libya,\nas well as the Foreign Service personnel who were\nvictims of the nefarious attack against the American\nConsulate in Benghazi. Our prayers and thoughts are\nwith their families. Panama energetically condemns\nsuch actions, which cause sorrow and grief to a friendly\nnation and which violate the fundamental principles of\ninternational law, particularly the Charter of the United\nNations and the Vienna Conventions on Diplomatic and\nConsular Relations.\nThe recent attacks on the diplomatic missions of\nthe United States, Germany, the United Kingdom,\nSaudi Arabia, Turkey, Israel and France are absolutely\nunjustifiable. We reiterate that host States have an\nobligation to ensure the principle of the inviolability of\nthe diplomatic and consular missions of the world and\nto safeguard international peace and security, as they\nare the source of communication and understanding.\nWe call loudly and clearly for tolerance, dialogue and\npeaceful coexistence,\nThe Republic of Panama is convinced that all\ninternational conflicts should be settled by peaceful\nmeans, using the instruments and mechanisms that\nhave been created for those purposes. For that reason,\nPanama formally joined the Group of Friends of\nMediation, demonstrating its historic commitment to\nthe peaceful solution of conflicts, which is the central\ntopic of this debate at the current session of the General\nAssembly.\nAs a firm believer that dialogue is a powerful tool\nfor facilitating peace and the international political\nstability so necessary to ensure economic and social\ndevelopment for our peoples, Panama wishes to reiterate\nits call, as it has done on other occasions, to support the\nChinese people in Taiwan so that they may have greater  participation as observers in international forums,\norganizations and initiatives and may cooperate and\nsupport the development and maintenance of peace\nboth in Asia and other parts of the world.\nPanama is a multicultural country where people\nof diverse ethnicities, cultures and religions coexist\nin peace and harmony and which has historically\nmaintained friendly relations with States of different\npolitical and ideological orientations. I am speaking\nof a demilitarized country, one that by virtue of its\ndomestic law adheres to the doctrine of human security\nand that possesses a canal that is neutral. In addition,\nPanama has tradition and experience as a participant\nin efforts for the peaceful solution of international\ncontroversies. Those conditions are our guarantee and\nasset in advocating for a world that is peaceful and\nrespectful of international law.\nPanama continues to be committed to\nmultilateralism, dialogue and negotiation among States\nas the only way to seek and achieve just solutions in\nglobal affairs. As a part of this commitment, in 2013 we\nwill host a series of important international meetings at\nthe global and regional levels.\nPanama will welcome the International Congress\nof the Spanish Language, an event of a universal\ncharacter and a forum for the ref lection on the status\nof the Spanish tongue, which shapes our identity as\na nation and unites the peoples of Hispanic America.\nIn 2013, Panama will also host the Conference of the\nStates Parties to the United Nations Convention against\nCorruption. That demonstrates that the fight against\ncorruption and the promotion of transparency are\nessential elements of the modern rule of law to which\nmy Government is fully committed.\nWe will also host the fifty-fourth annual meeting\nof the Board of Governors of the Inter-American\nDevelopment Bank, at which ministers of economy and\nfinance, central bank presidents and representatives of\nvarious multilateral financial institutions will discuss\ntopics related to their financial appointments.\nIn addition, we will host the Americas\nCompetitiveness Forum, which will address the issue\nof the development of the region\u2019s competitiveness\nagenda on the basis of the 10 general competitiveness\nprinciples of the Americas.\nWe will also host the Ibero-American summit,\nwhich will bring together the 22 States of Latin\nAmerica and those of the Iberian peninsula. That\nsummit represents an effort, involving dialogue and\ncooperation, to foster the development of our countries\nby opening up new markets and new opportunities\nfor trade and cooperation with the peoples and the\ncountries of Europe.\nThe international meetings set to take place in 2013\nwill be held in the context of the celebration of a historic\nevent that marks Panamians to this day. I note that\ntoday is the anniversary of that event \u2014 the discovery\nof a passage, through our country, to the Pacific Ocean.\nToday \u2014 25 September \u2014 marks almost 500 years since\nthe so-called discovery of the South Sea, later known as\nthe Pacific Ocean, a feat that changed the geography of\nworld navigation and the history of humanity.\nWith the discovery of a passage from the Atlantic\nto the Pacific, we saw the beginning of a process of\neconomic and demographic globalization around the\nworld. From that moment on, Panama began to play\nan important role in global navigation and trade that\ncontinues today. Since then, Panama has become the\nprimary hub of the Americas. Indeed, it is one of the\nmost important telecommunications and navigation\nroutes in the world.\nWe continue to make good progress in the expansion\nof the Panama Canal and Tocumen international\nairport, which will become the largest airport in Latin\nAmerica. Both of those projects will make it possible\nto further develop the Panama Canal route and will\nhave a tremendous impact on international trade and\non tourism.\nThe feat accomplished by Vasco N\u00fa\u00f1ez de Balboa\non 25 September 1513 helped to forge Panama\u2019s\ncharacter as a country dedicated to the global transit of\ngoods, and, with the construction of the Canal, it was\nconsolidated as the hub of worldwide maritime trade.\nThere is no magic formula for the resolution of\nconflicts. Nor do the global conditions exist for the\ncomplete fulfilment of Chapter VI of the Charter of the\nUnited Nations, on the peaceful settlement of disputes.\nThe world still has some important steps to take in\norder to ensure that dialogue is always the means of\nadjudicating differences. There must be a commitment\nat the State level for meeting that goal.\nOne of the major steps forward we must take is\nin the area of education. Education not only sets us\nfree: it makes us free thinkers. It helps us understand and respect different ideas. It provides us with an\nopportunity to be dreamers. Through education we can\nlearn to value cultures that might seem strange to us;\nbeing different does not make us enemies. But in order\nto understand this in an all-encompassing way, we need\na good and objective education.\nAccess to information through the Internet and\nsocial networks is an indispensable tool to raise the\nlevel of knowledge and discernment among all peoples.\nWhile I advocate for the responsible use of those\ntools, I think that we have to go further. I believe that\nwe must also address the issues of equality and self-\nesteem, which help distance us from resentment and\nviolence. Once again, education is the answer.\nSuch intangible wealth leads us to honest\ncompetition. The substitution of competition for\nviolence can be achieved only through a modernization\nprocess in which our principles are preserved. A good\neducation is one that is built upon a foundation of ethics\nand values. Money is not the best type of assistance\nwe can give our children. The best assistance we can\ngive them is an education that is divorced from politics,\npassions and paradigms. That is the only way to achieve\nexcellence.\nWe must focus our educational efforts on young\nchildren. Good, balanced primary education is the base\nof a solid pyramid. Educating our children properly\ntoday is the best guarantee of a better future for all\ntomorrow.\nWithout education, there is no possibility of\ndialogue and vice versa. That is the reason for my\nGovernment\u2019s focus on the well-being of Panamanian\nchildren through the improvement of our schools\nand classrooms; the creation of a free national\nInternet network; the provision of free computers; the\nimplementation of a universal scholarship, without any\ndistinction on the basis of class or politics; and, finally,\nthe transformation of our educational curriculum.\nHowever, access to information must be provided\nto children in keeping with their developmental stage,\nrespecting the fact that they are children and requiring\nthat they do the best they can for their age. To respect\nchildren is to harvest peace.\nAs I stated at the recent Connect Americas Summit,\nheld in our country in July, we must continue to harness\nour respective wills to reduce the digital divide and to\nmaximize Internet access around the world. Every step in that direction will be key to the achievement of the\nMillennium Development Goals by 2015.\nNevertheless, I remain uneasy about the risks\nposed by the misuse of cyberspace for boys, girls and\nadolescents.\nOur job will not be finished if we do not assume the\nresponsibility of facing up to one of the most significant\nethical and moral challenges of our time: the protection\nof children and young people from the threat posed to\nthem by the misuse of cyberspace.\nFor that reason, we support the initiative promoted\nby the International Telecommunications Union in that\nrespect. I also invite all States represented here to share\ntheir experiences in order to establish and harmonize, on\nthe basis of international telecommunications criteria,\nnorms that will allow us to ensure that minors are no\nlonger exposed to the risks and dangers disseminated\nthrough cyberspace. That should in no way be\ninterpreted as a means of limiting or distorting freedom\nof expression or the universal use of the Internet, which\nwe defend firmly and with great conviction.\nPanama is preparing draft legislation in order\nto establish minimum regulations geared towards\nprotecting our children and adolescents from the\ndangerous content spread through the Internet and\nother electronic media. We are currently working\nto pass that legislation based on consensus with all\nof Panamanian society. We must become allies and\nclose ranks against Internet sites that promote child\npornography and pornography in general, obscene and\nlascivious conduct, and physical, sexual and emotional\nviolence.\nLet us combine efforts and take concerted action\nagainst sites that facilitate the making of weapons or\nexplosives, that incite illegal drug use, and that promote\nracism, xenophobia or any other type of discrimination\nthat runs contrary to human dignity.\nLet us take measures against those who dedicate\nthemselves to making public, using and disseminating\nminors\u2019 personal information and to making threats of\nall kinds against our boys, girls and adolescents. Let us\nharness information and communications technology\nfor the benefit of development and to ensure a better\nquality of life for our children, and let us not allow the\nbenefits of accessing the Internet to put them at risk.\nThe Government of the Republic of Panama\nsupports the international community and the United Nations through two large-scale projects. The first is\nthe United Nations Regional Centre for Latin America\nand the Caribbean in Panama, which will host the 16\nUnited Nations subregional offices already established\nin our country. That Centre will contribute to greater\ncoordination and synergy within the United Nations\nsystem, thereby contributing to its operational process,\nas outlined in the report of the High-level Pannel on\nUnited Nations System-wide Coherence, \u201cDelivering as\nOne\u201d (see A/61/583). We invite friendly nations who are\ncommitted to those reforms to financially contribute to\nthat project, which will soon be open to international\nbidding. The other project is the regional humanitarian\nassistance logistics centre for the Americas for the\ndelivery of humanitarian aid in the event of disasters in\nthe region. Panama is committed to being a responsible\nhumanitarian actor in the region, and we place our\nadvantages as an international logistical platform at the\ndisposal of the international community.\nPanama\u2019s economic growth is widely recognized\nthroughout our region. From 2012 to 2013, Panama\nmoved up nine places \u2014 from 49 to 40 \u2014 in the Global\nCompetitiveness Index, which represents our biggest\njump in that ranking since 2005, when our country\nbegan to be monitored by the World Economic Forum.\nSuch an increase indicates we are doing things well.\nPanama\u2019s economic growth is the greatest in\nLatin America. It is based on free market principles,\nis respectful of the environment, social standards and\nfree enterprise initiatives, and is strongly committed\nto social inclusion. That has made it possible for us to\nsignificantly reduce unemployment in our country to\n4.6 per cent and to reduce poverty, including extreme\npoverty, from 33.4 per cent to 25.8 in just three years,\nwithout compromising the riches of our environment.\nAt the same time, our economic growth allows us to\nallocate resources to confront the threats of climate\nchange, which is affecting and will continue to affect\nlarge and small nations without regard for their level\nof development. We all need to be more responsible in\nthat regard.\nPanama will continue to advocate for the\ninternational community to work on an institutional and\nmultilateral structure that would reinforce the rights of\nall people to a planet with an environment suitable for\nthe development of a healthful and peaceful life. We\nwill insist on a new high-level discussion forum on\nthe protection of the environment in the context of the\nGeneral Assembly.\n\nFinally, Panama reaffirms that it is a country that\nfavours peaceful and respectful coexistence among\nall the peoples and Governments of the world. We\nPanamanians believe that humankind will always be\ncapable of fighting for that cause, united by the hope\nthat we can all build a better tomorrow. There is still\ntime to share, as brothers, in the feast of existence on a\npeaceful planet that truly belongs to all."

        "file_text": "\ufeffOn behalf of my delegation\nand myself, may I extend to Mr. Jeremi\u0107 our warmest\ncongratulations on his election as President of the\nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-seventh session. His\nextensive experience in both regional and international\naffairs will undoubtedly enrich the debate and the\nproceedings during this session. I wish to assure him of\nthe full cooperation of Zimbabwe as he discharges the\nonerous duties of that high office.\nIf I may be allowed, I would like to preface my\nspeech with a reference to the most glowing and moving\nspeech that we heard from the President of the United\nStates yesterday (see A/67/PV.6), the significance of\nwhich was to get us to condemn the tragic death of the\nUnited States Ambassador to Libya. I am sure that we\nwere all moved and that we all agree that it was, indeed,\nan appalling event that we all condemn.\nA year ago, we saw the barbaric and brutal death\nof the Head of State of Libya, which is a member of\nthe African Union. His death occurred in a context in\nwhich NATO was operating supposedly in order to\nprotect civilians. As we join the United States in spirit\nin condemning the Ambassador\u2019s death, will the United\nStates also join us in condemning the barbaric death of\nthe Head of State of Libya, Al-Qadhafi?\nThat great and tragic loss to Africa occurred in\ncircumstances in which NATO had sought the authority\nof the Security Council under Chapter VII to operate\nin Libya in the protection of civilians, who were said\nto be at the mercy of the Government of Libya, led by\nColonel Al-Qadhafi. The mission was strictly to protect\ncivilians, but it became a brutal hunt for Al-Qadhafi\nand his family. NATO caught up with them. Al-Qadhafi\nand some of his children suffered the brutal deaths\nabout which we know.\nAs the United States President spoke, I am sure that\nthat he was aware that his country, as a NATO Power,\nhad, alongside the other NATO Powers, the authority\nunder Chapter VII to operate in Libya in order to protect\ncivilians. But is that what the operation turned out to\nbe? In a very dishonest manner, we saw the authority\nentrusted under Chapter VII being used as a weapon in\norder to rout a whole family and to commit the murders\nthat occurred in that country. Bombs were hurled in a\ncallous manner. Quite a number of civilians died. Was\nthat the protection they had sought under Chapter VII\nof the Charter? So the death of Al-Qadhafi must be seen\nin the same tragic vein as the death of Chris Stevens.\nWe condemn both. Let me begin by reaffirming the rightful and\nimportant role of the United Nations in the management\nof issues affecting international peace and security. In\nthe quest for a more just and equitable international order,\nZimbabwe remains strongly opposed to unilateralism\nand committed to multilateralism. We would therefore\nlike to see a United Nations that continues to be a\nguarantor of world peace and security and a bulwark\nin the fight for justice and equality among nations. It\nbehoves us all, therefore, to take the necessary steps to\nensure that the United Nations is not marginalized on\ninternational issues.\nEqually important, the United Nations must, in\nfuture, never allow itself to be abused, as it was in the\ncase I referred to earlier, when NATO sought under\nChapter VII authority to protect civilians, but it did not\nturn out to be that. In the future, the Security Council\nmust never allow itself to be abused by any Member\nState or group of States that seeks to achieve parochial,\npartisan goals. The Charter of the United Nations\nclearly stipulates that it is an international body that\nshould work for the good of all the peoples of the world,\nbig and small.\nWe recognize that there are existing and emerging\nthreats and challenges that continue to frustrate our\nindividual and collective efforts to attain greater\neconomic development and social progress, as well\nas peace and security. But the increasing trend\namong the NATO member States, inspired by the\narrogant belief that they are the most powerful\namong us \u2014 demonstrated in their recent resort to\nunilateralism and military hegemony in Libya \u2014 is\nthe very antithesis of the basic principles of the United\nNations. In the case of Libya, the African Union and its\npeacemaking role was defied, ignored and humiliated.\nThe African Union sought dialogue between the Libyan\nauthorities and the so-called revolutionaries. May we\nurge the international community to collectively nip\nthis dangerous and unwelcome aggressive development\nin the bud before it festers.\nIn that regard, the theme that the President has\nchosen for this session \u2014 \u201cBringing about adjustment\nor settlement of international disputes or situations by\npeaceful means\u201d \u2014 is very appropriate. This is what we\nin the African Union stress \u2014 the settlement of disputes\nin a peaceful way, through dialogue. The warmongers\nof our world have done us enough harm. Wherever they\nhave imposed themselves, chaos in place of peace has\nbeen the result. One example was the situation created by the Bush-Blair illegal campaign in Iraq \u2014 an illegal\ncampaign undertaken because it was alleged that\nSaddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction,\nwhen it was well known to those two and their\nGovernments that he did not have such weapons \u2014 and,\nindeed, after invading Iraq, creating much havoc and\ngetting rid of Saddam Hussein, they admitted that he\nhad no weapons of mass destruction. So why had they\nattacked Iraq in the first place? Why did they seek to\nget rid of Saddam Hussein? Was it merely because he\nwas a dictator, as they alleged? No, he was the head of\na country that sat on tons and tons of oil. It was oil they\nrequired, and we saw companies \u2014 indeed, one such\ncompany was headed by a brother of Bush \u2014 rushing\nto suck oil from Iraq.\nThat is also what happened with Libya. The situation\nthey created in Iraq has now brought about greater\ninstability than there ever was. We have Sunnis rising\nagainst Shias, and vice versa, let alone the disastrous\neconomic consequences of that unlawful invasion. The\neconomy is unstable, society unstable, and people are\nfighting one another. Libya has been made equally\nunstable after NATO\u2019s deceitful intervention under the\nsham cover of Chapter VII of the Charter of the United\nNations and the phony principle of the responsibility to\nprotect. I listened to the speech made by the Secretary-\nGeneral. He made reference to that principle. It is\none that can be abused, and it has been abused. And,\nanyway, it is still being debated.\nZimbabwe fi rmly believes in the peaceful settlement\nof disputes between and among States in a manner that\nis consistent with the principles and purposes of the\nUnited Nations. In the maintenance of international\npeace and security, much more must be done to prevent\nconflicts from erupting in the first place, and to prevent\nrelapses once a situation has been stabilized. Beyond\ndeploying adequate resources for managing conflicts,\nit is important to address their underlying causes, and\nto pursue, more proactively, a comprehensive approach\nfocusing on conflict prevention, peacebuilding,\npeace-maintenance and development. In pursuing thst\ncause, my delegation strongly believes that adherence\nto the Charter of the United Nations should be a solemn\nobligation of all Member States.\nWe have noticed, with deep regret, that the\nprovisions of the United Nations Charter dealing with\nthe peaceful settlement of disputes have, on occasion,\nbeen ignored by the Security Council. In contrast,\nthere appears to be an insatiable appetite for war, embargoes, sanctions and other punitive actions, even\non matters that are better resolved through multilateral\ncooperation and dialogue. Instead of resorting to the\npeaceful resolution of disputes, we are daily witnessing\na situation where might is now right. We have said,\n\u201cWell, yes, those who are powerful might hang on the\nprinciple that might is right\u201d, but certainly right is also\nmight.\nWe need to take stock of the inspiring Preamble to\nthe United Nations Charter, where the plenipotentiaries\nwho met in San Francisco in 1945 undertook to \u201csave\nsucceeding generations from the scourge of war\u201d. That\nis especially pertinent at present, when global events\nrepresent a radical departure from that solemn and\nnoble San Francisco declaration. What do the NATO\nalliance members have to say about that, one may ask.\nIt is therefore important that the Security Council\nshould respect and support the decisions, processes and\npriorities of regional organizations. In contrast, recent\nevents \u2014 as has already been stated \u2014 particularly with\nreference to Africa, have demonstrated the scant regard\nthat the United Nations and certain powerful members\nof the international community give to the pivotal role of\nregional organizations. Effective cooperation between\nthe United Nations and regional organizations will\nbecome viable and sustainable only when developed on\nthe basis of mutual respect and support, as well as on\nshared responsibility and commitment.\nIt is regrettable to note that certain unacceptable\nconcepts are currently being foisted on the United\nNations membership in the absence of intergovernmental\nmandates. For instance, there is no agreement yet on\nthe concept of the responsibility to protect, especially\nwith respect to the circumstances under which it might\nbe invoked. We are concerned by the clear and growing\nevidence that the concept of responsibility to protect\nhas begun to be applied and seriously abused, thus\ninevitably compromising and undermining the cardinal\nprinciple of the sovereignty of States and the United\nNations Charter principles of territorial integrity and\nnon-interference in the domestic affairs of countries.\nFor the international community to successfully\ndeal with global economic, social, security and\nenvironmental challenges, the existence of international\ninstitutions to handle them and a culture of genuine\nmultilateralism are critical. The United Nations,\nits specialized agencies and international financial\ninstitutions are the only instruments available for\nresponding effectively to the global challenges we face in the global village. It is therefore critical that those\nstructures be reformed and realigned in response to\nboth global challenges and our contemporary realities,\nin order to enable them to better serve our collective\ninterests.\nThis Assembly is the most representative organ\nwithin the United Nations family. We must therefore\ndedicate ourselves to finding consensus on measures to\nrevitalize it so that it fulfils its mandate in accordance\nwith the provisions of the Charter. We wish to reiterate\nour deep concern that the mandate, powers and\njurisdiction of the General Assembly are shrinking\nas a consequence of the Security Council\u2019s gradual\nencroachment on the Assembly\u2019s areas of competence.\nThat, in our view, upsets the delicate balance envisaged\nunder the Charter and undermines the overall\neffectiveness of the United Nations system. The\nGeneral Assembly must remain the main deliberative,\npolicy-making organ of the United Nations.\nWe have been seized with the debate on the reform of\nthe Security Council for far too long. My delegation fully\nsupports the current intergovernmental negotiations on\nthe reform and expansion of the Council. However, we\nwish to caution against an open-ended approach that\nshort-changes those of us from regions that are not\nrepresented at all among the permanent membership of\nthe Council. Zimbabwe stands by Africa\u2019s demand for\ntwo permanent seats, complete with a veto if the veto\nis to be retained, plus two additional non-permanent\nseats, as clearly articulated in the Ezulwini Consensus\nand the Sirte Declaration.\nFor how long will the international community\ncontinue to ignore the aspirations of a whole continent\nof 54 countries? We shall not be bought off with empty\npromises, nor shall we accept some cosmetic tinkering\nwith the Security Council disguised as reform. It is\nindeed a travesty of justice that the African continent,\nwhich accounts for almost a third of the membership\nrepresented in this Assembly, has no permanent\nrepresentation in the Council. Is that good governance?\nIs that democracy? And is that justice?\nMy delegation condemns unreservedly the\neconomic sanctions imposed against my country and\npeople in an unjustified effort to deny them the chance\nto fully benefit from their natural resource endowment.\nWe wish to remind those who have maintained sanctions\nagainst us that there is international consensus \u2014 fully\nsupported by the Southern African Development Community, the African Union, the Non-Aligned\nMovement and the rest of the progressive world \u2014 that\nthese sanctions must go. We hope they will go.\nAllow me to conclude by reaffirming Zimbabwe\u2019s\ncommitment to the principles that have brought us\ntogether in the United Nations for the last 67 years.\nMy country is confident that in this inextricably\ninterdependent world, our commitment to the common\ngood, which the Organization embodies, will be\nresolute and enduring. Zimbabwe will continue to stand\nfirm and to condemn unilateralism, the imposition of\nunwarranted and illegal sanctions on nations and the\nunwarranted extraterritorial application of national\nlaws."

        "file_text": "\ufeffMy country extends heartfelt congratulations to Mr. Vuk\nJeremi\u0107 on his assumption of his responsibilities as\nPresident of the General Assembly at this crucially\nimportant session. We also express our appreciation\nto his predecessor, Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser of\nthe State of Qatar, who left an indelible mark on the\nGeneral Assembly.\nWe meet again in the quest for development, equity,\nand peace. Last year, our debate took place against the backdrop of rapid, often violent, geopolitical\nchange, as well as continuing economic instability and\nuncertainty. Last year\u2019s general debate, though marked\nby winds of change and clouds of uncertainty, was not\nwithout hope and optimism. Member States anticipated\nmeaningful progress at the United Nations Summit\non Sustainable Development. We predicted a robust\nand legally binding arms trade treaty. We embraced\npopular, home-grown calls for political change. And\nwe scanned the economic horizon for encouraging\nsigns of recovery and growth.\nToday, global optimism, though still enduringly\npresent, is in scarcer supply, as the international\ncommunity has encountered the challenges of a new\nworld and found itself wanting. Our global structures,\nincluding the United Nations, are faced with changes\nof a scope, scale and rapidity that substantially outpace\nour ability to react, partly exceed our capacity to\nrespond, and demand a level of courage, principle\nand decisiveness that is not sufficiently matched by\nour political will. Today, we are not merely spectators\nwatching a moment of global change; rather, we are\nnations in the valley of decision, confronted with two\nquestions that we must answer: \u201cWhat is our vision\nof tomorrow\u2019s post-crisis, post-conflict world?\u201d And:\n\u201cHow, collectively, can we achieve that vision?\u201d\nOur avoidance of these fundamental questions\nthreatens to set our Assembly adrift and rudderless,\nshirking responsibility and afraid of action. We must\nresist the temptation to bury our heads in the shifting\nsands of meaningless resolutions while we studiously\ndisregard our imperative quest for a unifying principle and purpose. To succumb to such a temptation would\nbe to condemn this institution to a future marked not\nby new ideas, but new rationalizations. Our noble\nbattle of ideas will descend into a battalion of excuses;\nof blame-sharing and buck-passing; of soundbites\ndisguised as insights. Such a future, which we are\non a path to realize, would do a disservice to our\nrespective States, our international obligations, and the\nproud history of the United Nations. We would, by our\nimpotence, acquiesce to the possible obsolescence of\nthis Organization, as peoples and Governments would,\njustifiably or not, turn elsewhere for the solutions to\nglobal challenges. Such a future can and must be\nvigorously avoided, in the interest of our peoples\u2019\ncollective advancement and humanity.\nIn our Caribbean region, the global economic and\nfinancial meltdown continues to be felt most acutely\nby the poor, the youth, the elderly and the vulnerable,\nwho bear no responsibility for the rampant financial\nspeculation and unregulated movement of capital that\nspurred the crisis. Today, four years into an externally\nimposed meltdown which has produced negative or\nmarginal growth across the Caribbean, our region is\nforced to contemplate the implications of a potential\n\u201clost decade\u201d of development.\nOur region is not immune to the economic\npressures and fissures that have turned other parts of\nthe world into tinderboxes of social unrest and political\nupheaval. Our citizens, who have nobly struggled under\nthe weight of externally sourced contraction, austerity\nand hardship, are not possessed of limitless patience\nor endurance. Our hard-won development gains are in\njeopardy, and our settled political stability is in possible\nperil. The international community cannot ignore our\nplight based on a distorted calculus of middle-income\nstatus and relative prosperity, or on simplistic,\neven offensive, stereotypes of Caribbean paradises.\nSmall, highly indebted middle-income developing\ncountries, like those in the Caribbean, which are\nvery vulnerable to natural disasters and international\neconomic convulsions, have special concerns which\nthe international community is obliged to address\nproperly, in partnership with the peoples of our region.\nExternal shocks derived from nature or the workings of\nan uneven, casino capitalism, are not merely episodic\nto our Caribbean; they are a constant feature of our\nregional economies.\nCentral to our urgent re-examination and\nreconfiguration of the existing economic apparatus is\nthe recognition that our modern context and individual\nnational characteristics do not lend themselves to\nstrict classical or Keynesian economic prescriptions\nor their variants. In the case of Saint Vincent and\nthe Grenadines and our Caribbean neighbours, our\npeculiarities of small size, openness and vulnerability\nrequire uniquely home-grown economic policies that\nare rooted not in any prevailing ideology or fashionable\ntheories from outside, but in a sensible, flexible and\nfocused practicality.\nWe have little interest in esoteric arguments about\nthe role of the State in economic activity, because,\nhistorically, our national Governments have been a\nforce for good in the stimulation, diversification and\ngrowth of our economies in tandem with the private\nand cooperative sectors. While we welcome and\nsolicit assistance and consultations with the relevant\ninstitutions and organizations, such consultations\nought to be free of the type of textbook orthodoxies\nor formulaic prescriptions that are inapplicable to our\ntimes and circumstances. Our path to development\nmust be our own.\nThe cause of development, as a goal and as a right,\nhas suffered from the neglect of the international\ncommunity in recent, post-crisis years. Within\nthe United Nations system, the current budget for\npeacekeeping dwarfs the resources allocated to\nfostering development, even as we recognize that most\nconflict is rooted in underdevelopment. The age-old\npledges of development assistance have been skirted,\nand their fulfilment delayed, by States that cite their\nown struggles with the global economic fallout. As a\nresult, even as we contemplate post-2015 sustainable\ndevelopment goals, it is painfully apparent that the\nMillennium Development Goals will not be met across\nlarge swaths of our planet.\nThe poor, especially in Asia, Africa, the Pacific,\nLatin America and the Caribbean, can hardly be\nexpected to wait any longer for relief and sustainable\ndevelopment. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines is\nthankful to the nations and organizations that have\nfound it possible to continue extending their hand in\ncooperation with our people, even in difficult economic\ntimes. The support and assistance of those States and\norganizations is a mark of their friendship, solidarity\nand strong global citizenship.\nThe prolonged global economic uncertainties have\npropelled the international economy into a dangerous\nnew phase. Even the International Monetary Fund has so concluded. In the process, the crisis has found\nthe principals wanting, even unaware of the extant\ncondition, with no clear idea as to the way forward.\nIn both economics and politics, the ancien r\u00e9gime is\npassing. The discerning acknowledge that a transition\nis at large, but immense challenges arise immediately\nfrom at least four pertinent queries: first, is the\ntransition manageable, or must it be played out in a\nchaotic manner? Secondly, assuming that the transition\nis manageable, how is it to be managed in the most\nefficacious way, and in whose interest? Thirdly, is this\ntransition a dead end? And fourthly, given that the\ntransition itself, like all human conditions, is dynamic,\nwhat is the destination of this transition?\nIt is a truism that men and women make history not\nin circumstances of their own choosing, but in those\nwhich they meet, which they inherit, and which emerge\non their watch. Noteworthy is the fact that the histories\nof nations and the ghosts of the dead weigh heavily\non the brains of the living. Often unacknowledged is\nthe abiding truth that each people possesses its own\nhistory, its own legitimacy, its own nobility and its own\ntrajectory for further ennoblement.\nUnfortunately, the power of some to define things\nglobally distorts these elemental truths. It is well\nknown that the lion\u2019s view of history does not coincide\nwith that of the gazelle or the lamb; the elephant and\nthe ant do not see things eye to eye. But human beings\npossess the capacity to go beyond the limitations of\nthe animal kingdom. That is fundamentally why we\nhave gathered together under the rubric of the United\nNations, with a Charter so uplifting and magnificent in\nits ideals and purposes as to constitute the best hope for\nthe human race. Arrogant and unbridled power, from\nwhatever source, is thus to be contained. It is always\nwise to remember that the greatest exercise of power is\nrestraint in the use of that power. That is true within and\nbetween nations. It is the surest way for the malevolent\nacross the globe to be accorded no space to flourish and\nto be defeated.\nIt is within this context that the text of a prosperous,\nsafe, independent Palestinian State must be written\nalongside a secure State of Israel, living in friendship\nand non-belligerence. This is a matter of grave urgency;\nthe injustice meted out to Palestine must end now.\nSo, too, must continue our global quest for interfaith\ndialogue and an alliance of civilizations, initiated by\nthe Governments of Qatar and Turkey, respectively. Similarly, let us not forget our pledge of solidarity\nto Haiti. Likewise, reparations for the genocides\ncommitted against indigenous peoples and for African\nslavery must continue to be pursued vigorously on our\ninternational agenda.\nAll of that and more is achievable by the United\nNations. Thus, our collective will can bear fruit\nabundantly through the strengths and possibilities of\nwise leadership, peaceful dialogue among and between\nsovereign nations, international cooperation and\nregional compacts.\nCloser to home, our developmental and\npolitical partnerships increasingly reflect a spirit of\nstrengthened regional integration and greater South-\nSouth cooperation. In the immediate post-colonial\nphase of our national development, the nations of the\nCaribbean and Latin America often have had stronger\nand closer relationships with distant colonial Powers and\ndeveloped nations than we did with the countries in our\nimmediate neighbourhood. After centuries of colonial\nconquest, settlement and exploitation, our deepening\nbonds of friendship, cooperation and integration within\nthe Caribbean and Latin America are a fundamental\nmanifestation of our States\u2019 growing independence and\npolitical maturity.\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines enjoys\nmembership in a number of interconnected circles\nof regional integration. The Organization of Eastern\nCaribbean States (OECS) is in an economic union with\na shared currency, judiciary and nascent representative\nAssembly. The 15-member Caribbean Community\n(CARICOM) also furthers the cause of Caribbean\nintegration with important implications for trade and the\nfree movement of people. Our State is a proud member\nof the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our\nAmerica, which has created bonds of socioeconomic\nsolidarity and cooperation among Caribbean, Central\nand South American States. The Caribbean Forum of\nAfrican, Caribbean and Pacific States, the Association\nof Caribbean States, and the Community of Latin\nAmerican and Caribbean States are also home-grown\nmanifestations of our peoples\u2019 desire to forge linkages\nand partnerships with our regional brothers and sisters.\nThe strength and genuine cohesion of those\ngrowing regional integration initiatives is built on a\nsolid foundation of shared experiences and values,\nwhich deserve the support of the United Nations. The\nmembers of OECS and CARICOM are bastions of good\ngovernance, democracy and the rule of law, and we share those experiences and aspirations with our South\nand Central American sister States, which have also\nestablished unshakeable foundations of democracy and\ngood governance after fitful periods of political unrest\nand foreign interference in the past. The upcoming\n7 October presidential election in the Bolivarian\nRepublic of Venezuela is but one example of the\nmanner in which that country and the region continue\nto institutionalize popular, participatory democratic\nsystems that reflect and respect the will of the people.\nAs we strengthen relations with our immediate\nneighbours, we remain deeply committed to our\nhistorical ties and traditional friendships. The bonds\nthat we share with our friends in Europe, Canada, the\nUnited Kingdom and the United States are as strong\nas they are mutually beneficial. As a multi-island\nnation, the people of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines\nhave always been highly migratory and outward-\nlooking \u2014 so much so that even the words of our\nnational anthem memorialize our proclivity for travel\nto distant lands. Many of the largest and most vibrant\ncities of our nationals exist not in Saint Vincent and the\nGrenadines, but in major metropolitan hubs, including\nthose in Brooklyn, Toronto and London. Those\nproductive and hard-working centres, and many others,\nhave immeasurably enriched their adopted homes and\nprovided needed remittances to relatives in the land\nof their birth. We remain grateful to those friendly\nStates that have opened their doors and embrace to\nour migrants, and we view the ongoing, hassle-free\nmovement of our peoples back and forth as the truest\ntestament of our friendship and solidarity.\nThe recent increase in regional conflicts and unrest\naround the world cannot be ignored. The hopefulness\nand idealistic optimism that were much in evidence\nduring the early days of the so-called Arab Spring\nhave been replaced by a cynical fatalism and rampant\nopportunism in many important quarters. In other\ncontinents, some nations flirt with border wars, while\nothers grapple with insidious and barbaric terrorism.\nIn the midst of the global upheaval, we have witnessed\nthe aggressive re-emergence of those that would seek to\nreshape the world in their own image and to their own\npurposes. Would-be interventionists, unilateralists and\nhegemons, both new and old, have rushed to fill and\nexploit political vacuums, to settle ancient grudges and\nto strengthen their grip on global or regional power.\nIt is a pattern that predates colonialism and the\nCold War and one that once again brings into focus\nmany of the United Nations founding principles. Those\nprinciples cannot be ignored, reinterpreted or sacrificed\non the altar of poll-driven political expediency and\nelectoral ambition. We have bound ourselves together\nin the solemn goal of promoting peace, not fostering\nwars; of self-determination, not unilateral intervention;\nof the economic and social advancement of all peoples,\nnot the callous disregard for the well-being of our\nfellow human beings. To depart from those principles,\nexplicitly or by implication, would be to abandon the\nbetter angels of our nature and to succumb to the forces\nthat made this institution necessary in the first place.\nThe war against global terror is real, and it is being\nfought by all responsible States on multiple fronts. Saint\nVincent and the Grenadines is firm and unequivocal\nin its rejection of all forms of terrorist activity and\nits revulsion at the methods and twisted logic that\naccompany that barbarism. Our friends and brothers\nin the United States of America are unfortunately and\ndisproportionately targeted by those repulsive killers,\nmost recently in the deeply saddening murder of\nChristopher Stevens, the United States Ambassador to\nLibya, and some of his staff. We support unreservedly\nthe determination of the United States to bring\nAmbassador Stevens\u2019s killers to justice.\nAt the same time, we are baff led by the continued\nreference to the Republic of Cuba in some quarters as\na State sponsor of terrorism. The undisputed evidence\nis that Cuba neither supports nor harbours terrorists\nof any type. Indeed, the Cuban Government, itself a\nvictim of orchestrated terror campaigns, has cooperated\non numerous occasions with the Governments of both\nallies and ideological opponents in the fight against\nterrorism. It has also played a useful and constructive\nrole in facilitating peace talks between Governments\nand armed rebel groups in Latin America. Those facts\nare not contested. Therefore, to label Cuba a State\nsponsor of terrorism, in any context, is to cheapen our\nshared global struggle against that insidious scourge.\nIn his famous 1960 speech to the General Assembly,\nthen President Fidel Castro observed that hysteria could\ngo to any length and was capable of making the most\nfar-fetched and absurd claims. That particular absurd\nand far-fetched claim, like the absurdity that undergirds\nthe continued economic embargo against Cuba, is one\nthat is best abandoned.\nThe fascinating rapprochement unfolding across the\nTaiwan straits between the People\u2019s Republic of China\nand the Republic of China on Taiwan lends practical weight to the reasonable and overdue call for Taiwan\u2019s\nmeaningful participation in the specialized agencies\nof the United Nations. My country and several others\nin the Caribbean and Central America bear witness to\nTaiwan\u2019s principled conduct of its intergovernmental\nrelations. Surely the time has now come for this\nexemplar of the magnificent Chinese civilization to be\npermitted to participate in the work of various agencies\nof this world body.\nAllow me to turn to certain existential challenges\nfacing my country, my region, and the world. Saint\nVincent and the Grenadines is angered by the continuing\nand inexcusable failure of the States assembled in this\nHall to move decisively towards a meaningful and\nlegally binding climate change treaty. Entire nations,\nrepresented here today as friends and equals, may\nsimply cease to exist as a result of our inaction and\npolitical cowardice. Other nations, including my own,\nare already the victims of increasingly intense and\nfrequent storms, hurricanes and weather events. These\nchanges not only threaten our way of life but risk\nreversing our recent development progress.\nThe islands of our planet are at war against climate\nchange, warming temperatures and rising seas. That\nwar is not a future event, it is a present-day and ongoing\nbattle. As all of us in this Assembly are aware, it is a\nwar that we are currently losing. The survival of our\nislands is at stake, and the responsibility for immediate\nchange lies undisputedly with those whose reckless\npollution over generations has led us to the brink of\ncatastrophe. In a different time and context, Winston\nChurchill inspired his people with the words \u201cwe shall\nfight on the seas and oceans... we shall defend our\nisland, whatever the cost may be\u201d. Today, know this:\nWe shall fight the rising seas and encroaching oceans\nand defend our islands\u2019 right to exist at any cost. We\ncall on all nations to join us in the fight, for that is a\nwar that can still be won. Our negotiations to arrest\nclimate change are not merely some arcane academic or\ndiplomatic pursuit, and they cannot be treated as some\ninterminable, run-of-the-mill United Nations process.\nLet us set aside narrow, short-term interests and act as\nwe are capable of acting: for the benefit and protection\nof all mankind.\nAnother existential threat whose solution has fallen\nvictim to United Nations paralysis is our common pursuit\nof a global, robust and binding arms trade treaty. In the\nCaribbean, over 70 per cent of homicides are committed\nwith firearms, a remarkable statistic for a region that\nproduces not one single gun or bullet. Saint Vincent\nand the Grenadines has a largely unarmed constabulary\nand lacks a standing army, yet we struggle daily against\nan influx of illicit and untraceable firearms that pose\na grave threat to our national security and way of life.\nThe producers of firearms, as well as the source and\ndestination markets for illicit narcotics, can and must\ncooperate to restrict and regulate the international f low\nof small arms, light weapons and ammunition. While\nwe have failed in our initial attempt to forge an arms\ntrade treaty, I call on members at this session of the\nGeneral Assembly to redouble their efforts to negotiate\na binding agreement in this matter before we reconvene\nnext September.\nThis year it is imperative, too, that the United\nNations continue its focused work in the fight against\nnon-communicable diseases, which the Caribbean\nCommunity has rightly placed at the forefront of the\nglobal agenda.\nThe people of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines\nare strong and fiercely independent. Ours is an\nindependence forged in the heroic struggles of our\nindigenous and Garifuna peoples against genocide\nand hardened in the fires of our resistance to slavery,\nindentureship, and colonial and neocolonial domination.\nOur strength, independence and sovereignty do not\npermit us to look to the United Nations or any other\ncountry or group of countries for the solutions to our\nown problems and challenges. However, as a small State\nin an interconnected world, we recognize that many of\nthe difficulties we face have been born and incubated\nbeyond our national boundaries. The United Nations\ntherefore is our primary multilateral forum to address\nand confront those externally imposed challenges.\nMy statement today is not intended merely to\nchronicle the global ills that have befallen Saint Vincent\nand the Grenadines. No. It is a call for principled and\npractical global action to address and resolve these\nproblems. To do so, we stand ready to work with the\nPresident and with all States in this Assembly to effect\nmeaningful change throughout our planet. As the\ngreat novelist Ernest Hemingway once wrote, \u201cMoral\ncourage is a rarer commodity than bravery in battle\nor great intelligence. Yet it is the one essential, vital\nquality of those who seek to change a world which\nyields most painfully to change\u201d. Today, Saint Vincent\nand the Grenadines calls on this body, and on all\nnations assembled here, to harness that essential moral\ncourage to produce change in a world whose potential is limitless, and whose problems are soluble. The\nrhetoric of change and hope may lack the cachet that it\nenjoyed hitherto, but we still believe that our peoples\nand Governments possess within them the courage\nand conviction collectively to change and materially\nimprove the condition of our nations\u2019 citizens.\nLet us at this sixty-seventh session of the General\nAssembly establish conclusively that that faith is well\nplaced. We move with our burdens from yesterday.\nWe go forward with our strengths and possibilities\ntomorrow."

        "file_text": "\ufeffI wish at the outset to express my sincere gratitude\nfor being given the honour of speaking from this lofty\nrostrum.\nAllow me first of all to convey to the members of\nthe Assembly and to the peoples of their countries the\ngreetings and wishes for peace and prosperity of His\nExcellency the President of Turkmenistan, Gurbanguly\nBerdimuhamedov.\nAllow me to congratulate His Excellency Vuk\nJeremi\u0107 on his election as President of the General\nAssembly at its sixty-seventh session and to wish him\nevery success in his upcoming critical work. I would\nalso like to express appreciation to His Excellency Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser, President of the General\nAssembly at its sixty-sixth session, for the skilful and\neffective manner in which he carried out his duties.\nToday the international community is witness to\ncomplex, multifaceted processes in geopolitics, the\nglobal economy and the humanitarian sphere. Serious\nenvironmental problems challenge us with their\nunprecedented urgency. It is no exaggeration to say that\nmajor global issues related to energy supplies acquiring\nuniversal importance. All of these require a constructive\nand effective response on the part of the United Nations\nand the elaboration of appropriate international\nmechanisms aimed at maximizing the effective use\nof existing political, financial, organizational and\nother resources, so as to overcome existing problems\nand challenges, enhance mutual understanding and\ntrust, and reaffirm the irreversibility of the process of\nsustainable development of all the peoples of our planet.\nObjectively speaking, energy security is\nfundamental to the stable and conflict-free development\nof today\u2019s world. As a leading energy provider with\nthe fourth-largest reserves of hydrocarbon resources,\nTurkmenistan legitimately and consistently calls for\nthe establishment of a sound and reliable international\nenergy supply system and the drawing up of plans\nand projects for cooperation in world energy markets\nappropriate to modern realities. We believe that it is\nnow time for the United Nations to adopt consensus\ndecisions on universal political and legal mechanisms\nto govern global energy cooperation.\nAs members know, at previous General Assembly\nsessions, the President of Turkmenistan launched a\nnumber of initiatives on energy security and mutually\nbeneficial cooperation in the energy sector. The realities\nof modern life affirm the relevance of such initiatives.\nAs a step towards those initiatives, Turkmenistan\nproposes that States Members of the United Nations\nconsider in depth the establishment of an international\nlegal framework to govern the operation of an energy\nsupply system, taking into due account the interests\nof hydrocarbon producers and transit and recipient\nnations.\nAs a first step in that direction, we believe that\nit would be appropriate to draw up a draft resolution\nduring this session on the establishment of an\nexpert group to develop the relevant United Nations\ninternational instrument. At the same time, we look\nforward to constructive engagement with all States Members of the United Nations, which, we believe,\nwould significantly help to find common approaches\nto solving one of the most urgent problems of modern\ndevelopment.\nThe United Nations Conference on Sustainable\nDevelopment, held in June this year, clearly identified\nthe need to strengthen our efforts on ecological issues\nand environmental protection. Speaking at the meeting,\nthe President of Turkmenistan noted that, at the\ninstitutional level, today\u2019s main objective is to merge\nand complement existing global, regional and national\ninstruments.\nIt is no secret that the Central Asian and Caspian\nSea regions have difficult environmental conditions.\nWe think that the efforts made to date to improve\nthe situation are clearly insufficient. We need a joint\nand results-oriented action plan that combines the\nuse of scientific, technological, political, diplomatic,\nadministrative and technical measures for effective\noutcomes in that direction. We therefore propose setting\nup, in cooperation with the United Nations, a regional\ncentre for climate change technologies in Central\nAsia and the Caspian basin. We believe that such a\nstructure would enable the countries in those regions\nto significantly strengthen cooperation on ecological\nsafety. It would promote the effective coordination of\nnational, regional and international efforts and would\nfurther mutual understanding and confidence-building\ntowards achieving sustainable development goals.\nWith regard to international politics, Turkmenistan\ngives particular attention to the issues of peace and\nsecurity and to ensuring sustainable development. In\nthat context, one of the main challenges facing the\ninternational community today is the need for our joint\nefforts to ensure non-proliferation and disarmament.\nAs a party to the principal international treaties and\nUnited Nations conventions in that field, Turkmenistan\nexpects to continue to fully support global disarmament\nprocesses.\nWe believe that it is relevant to pursue the\nmultilateral dialogue on the validity of the Treaty on\nthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. We propose\nthat a high-level consultative meeting be held next year,\nunder the auspices of the United Nations, to discuss\nsteps to expand the international non-proliferation legal\nframework. Turkmenistan\u2019s initiative is particularly\nrelevant to the practical implementation of steps\ntowards a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Asia.\nAs we know, the agenda of the sixty-seventh session includes an item on a nuclear-weapon-free zone in\nCentral Asia.\nOur country is ready to actively cooperate with the\nOffice of the Under-Secretary-General for Disarmament\nAffairs and to participate in a number of initiatives\nin that regard. Given that further improving relevant\nUnited Nations agencies may be one practical step in\nimplementing consistent disarmament measures, we\nthink it appropriate to consider the establishment of a\nUnited Nations subregional centre for disarmament in\nAsia.\nStrengthening comprehensive, targeted and long-\nterm cooperation with the United Nations is a strategic\nchoice of Turkmenistan and a priority of its foreign\npolicy. As an important part of that cooperation,\nour country is considering participating in United\nNations activities to ensure human development, better\nliving standards and people\u2019s well-being; to establish\nconditions conducive to global economic and social\ngrowth; to utilize human creativity; and to promote\npeople\u2019s rights and freedoms.\nIn pursuing those lofty goals and striving to\ncontribute, where possible, to their achievement,\nTurkmenistan has announced its candidacy for\nmembership of the Economic and Social Council for\nthe period 2013-2015. That decision was made on the\nbasis of the country\u2019s current progress in the political,\nsocioeconomic, cultural and other fields, its active role\nin international processes and its understanding of the\nresponsibilities inherent to membership of the Council.\nIf elected, Turkmenistan plans to use all available\nmeans to improve international cooperation for the\neffective implementation of sustainable development\ngoals. At the same time, Turkmenistan will actively\ncontribute to strengthening the Economic and Social\nCouncil by expanding its role in addressing the urgent\nissue of global socioeconomic development.\nThe most important element of the modern system\nof international relations is humanitarian cooperation.\nTo underscore that the humanitarian component is at\nthe centre of the highest principles and values of the\ncommunity of nations, our country will continue to\npromote its cooperation with the United Nations on\nprotecting human rights and on establishing conditions\nconducive to human development. On that basis,\ngiven that the United Nations plays a major role in the\ncomprehensive development of humanity and bearing in\nmind the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals, we believe it appropriate during this sixty-\nseventh session to consider including the humanitarian\nissues on the United Nations international agenda as a\nseparate issue.\nIn that context, Turkmenistan proposes establishing\na United Nations platform of action for humanitarian\naffairs with a view to it becoming the political and\nlegal basis for the consolidation of the international\ncommunity\u2019s humanitarian efforts. We believe that\nsuch a holistic approach will enable us to galvanize\nthe activities of United Nations agencies, to develop\nlong-term solutions in line with international law\nand General Assembly resolutions, and to ensure the\npractical implementation of United Nations conventions\non humanitarian matters.\nIn conclusion, I would like to emphasize that our\nforeign policy, which is based on our love of peace,\non neutrality and on broad international cooperation,\ntogether with the constructive positions advocated\nby our country, form a solid basis for Turkmenistan\u2019s\nwork in the United Nations. In that spirit, we will rely\non broad cooperation with all countries of the world\nin order to strengthen and develop a comprehensive\ninternational partnership."

        "file_text": "\ufeffOn behalf of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg,\nlet me congratulate President Jeremi\u0107 on his election\nas President of the General Assembly. He can count on\nthe full support of my country as he assumes this major\nresponsibility.\nThe General Assembly is the central body of the\nUnited Nations architecture. Here all Member States\nare represented, and each has a vote, irrespective\nof its size, its population or its economic power. The\nAssembly truly is the concert of nations embodying\nthe principle of the sovereign equality of all Member\nStates. To President Jeremi\u0107, the conductor of the\nconcert of States here assembled, we wish inspiration,\npassion and wisdom.\nLuxembourg is proud to have been part, since the\nvery beginning, of the peace project that is the United\nNations.\nOur then Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Joseph\nBeck, in presenting the Charter of the United Nations\nCharter \u2014 signed a few weeks earlier in San Francisco \u2014\nto the Luxembourg Parliament on 9 August 1945, spoke\nthe following visionary words:\n\u201cIt is in the work of the United Nations that our\ncountry found the hope of rebirth in its darkest\nhour; it is within the United Nations that it has\ntaken up its place as an independent State, as a free\ncountry; it is among these peaceful countries, just\nunited by the Organization of San Francisco in the\nwonderful hope of a lasting peace, that it will find\nthe guarantees of a future which are necessary for\nits renewal\u201d.\nHistory has vindicated him. Determined, with the\nother peoples of the United Nations, to save succeeding\ngenerations from the scourge of war, Luxembourg\nfound in the United Nations and in multilateralism\nin general the ideal framework to flourish as an\nindependent, sovereign State, free to choose for\nitself. Luxembourg has been able to prosper thanks\nto the peace it has enjoyed since 1945. In return, we\nhave resolutely committed ourselves, within the\nUnited Nations, to contribute to building peace and\nto promoting sustainable development for the greatest\nnumber possible.\nPresident Jeremi\u0107 has rightly chosen the peaceful\nsettlement of disputes as the theme of the general\ndebate at the current session. It is one of the overarching\nobjectives of our Organization, aimed at enabling it to\nmaintain international peace and security. To settle\ndisputes peacefully, the Charter has attributed a major\nrole not only to the Security Council, but also to the\nGeneral Assembly and to the International Court of\nJustice.\nThe Syrian crisis, which has lasted already 18\nmonths, continues to get worse. It has now claimed more\nthan 20,000 victims. Repercussions on neighbouring\ncountries continue to intensify. The crisis is a call on\nour collective conscience and puts our commitment to\nthe test. Some are tempted to accuse the United Nations\nof inaction. However, the fault lies elsewhere. Those\nresponsible for the terrifying violence, the war crimes,\nthe egregious human rights violations and crimes\nagainst humanity committed in Syria will one day\nhave to answer for them. Such is Luxembourg\u2019s firm\nconviction.\nThe failure to this day of attempts to resolve the\nSyrian crisis through peaceful means must not lead\nus to neglect the quest for political solutions to other\ncrises.\nLuxembourg has consistently advocated a peaceful\nsettlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. That\nconflict has been going on for far too long. It is\nessential that the parties resume direct negotiations and\nnegotiate a sustainable peace among themselves, with\nthe support of the Quartet. The path will no doubt be\narduous, but the objective is worth it for the Israelis, the\nPalestinians and the region as a whole. We would like to\nsee an independent, democratic, contiguous and viable\nState of Palestine, living side by side with the State of\nIsrael in peace and security.\nLuxembourg has for many years now supported the\nbuilding of the Palestinian State at both the political\nand the economic levels. We also support Palestine\u2019s\naspirations to assume its place among the nations of the\nworld. We provide financial support to the Palestinian\nAuthority in order to assist it in making its public\nadministration and basic social services work, and we\nare also a reliable partner of the United Nations Relief\nand Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near\nEast. Under an agreement signed in February 2012, Luxembourg will provide assistance in the amount of\n\u20ac15 million to Palestine refugees throughout the period\n2012-2015.\nAllow me to give a few other examples to illustrate\nhow Luxembourg is contributing to the peaceful\nsettlement of international disputes. First, as was\nrecalled during the High-level Meeting on the Rule of\nLaw, Luxembourg was one of the very first States to\nrecognize the jurisdiction of the International Court\nof Justice as compulsory. The Court elucidates and\ndevelops international law and thereby strengthens\npeaceful relations between States. Next, Luxembourg\nsupports preventive diplomacy and mediation activities\nas well as the good offices undertaken by the United\nNations. Our support in that area also benefits regional\norganizations, such as the African Union. Finally,\nLuxembourg also supports civil society, as it did\nin 2010, when it backed the mediation efforts by the\nCommunity of Sant\u2019Egidio between political and civil\nsociety actors in Guinea and the Niger.\nLuxembourg, a multicultural and multilingual State\nby virtue of its history, its geographical location and the\ncomposition of its population, has often played the role\nof mediator between its large European neighbours and\nwithin the European Union.\nBuilding on a balanced foreign policy, free\nfrom the legacy of a colonial past and defined by\nan unwavering commitment to multilateralism,\nLuxembourg is at the service of the United Nations\nwhen it comes to playing the role of honest broker and\nassuming the responsibilities that come with that role.\nIn 2009, moreover, Luxembourg had the honour of\nchairing the Economic and Social Council at a crucial\njuncture marked by the devastating effects of the global\neconomic and financial crisis of 2008.\nMy country has also been a linchpin of the\nPeacebuilding Commission since its inception in 2005.\nSince February 2011, the Permanent Representative of\nLuxembourg to the United Nations, Ambassador Sylvie\nLucas, has chaired the Guinea configuration of the\nPeacebuilding Commission. Luxembourg is honoured\nto be able to marshal the efforts of the international\ncommunity in support of the authorities in Conakry,\nwho have asked to be assisted in three priority areas:\nnational reconciliation, security sector reform, and\nyouth and women\u2019s employment. Our commitment\nstems from our conviction that we need to adopt a\nglobal approach towards peacebuilding and towards the maintenance of international peace and security \u2014 an\napproach that recognizes the intrinsic link between\nsecurity and development.\nIndeed, to ensure lasting peace, one must tackle the\nroot causes of conflicts. Luxembourg is concentrating\non two of these: social inequalities resulting from\npersistent poverty, and the increasing scarcity of natural\nresources as a result of climate change.\nThe fight against poverty is one of our stated\npriorities. Since 2000, Luxembourg has reached the goal\nset by the United Nations of dedicating at least 0.7 per\ncent of its gross national income to official development\nassistance. In 2009 and 2010, that assistance exceeded\nthe threshold of 1 per cent of our gross national income.\nThe Government of Luxembourg is determined to\nmaintain that effort despite budgetary constraints. Our\nassistance is benefiting the least developed countries\nin particular. Here again, we exceed the goal set by the\nUnited Nations by dedicating more than 0.2 per cent\nof our gross national income to those countries, the\nmajority of which are in Africa.\nBeyond simple statistics, those figures reflect our\nspirit of solidarity towards developing countries. That\nspirit drives not only our political decision-makers\nand our development cooperation experts but also the\nnumerous citizens who are acting through civil society\norganizations. My family is proud to participate in that\nmovement of solidarity. My wife, the Grand Duchess,\ninvests herself fully in the social sector as a UNICEF\nEminent Advocate for Children, notably in Burundi.\nShe has been passionate about microfinance for many\nyears and has completed numerous projects in that area.\nAs the report of the Secretary-General (A/67/1)\nhighlights, we have achieved, worldwide, some essential\ntargets of the Millennium Development Goals ahead\nof time. However, the effects of global warming are\ncatastrophic and are threatening to undo the progress\nthat has been accomplished. In the least developed\ncountries, the situation is particularly worrisome. It is\ntherefore essential that we act resolutely in that area.\nProgress has been made at the Conferences of the\nParties to the United Nations Framework Convention\non Climate Change in Canc\u00fan and then in Durban. We\nnow need further commitments to be made in terms of\nreducing carbon emissions. Another major challenge\nlies in the mobilization of adequate financial and\ntechnological resources to enable the most vulnerable\ncountries, in particular, the least developed countries, the landlocked developing countries and the small island\ndeveloping States, to adapt to the effects of climate\nchange. Luxembourg is acting to meet that challenge.\nWe have thus decided to join an important programme\nof support for renewable energy that would meet the\nspecific needs of Pacific small island developing States.\nI personally attended the United Nations Conference\non Sustainable Development in Brazil in June in order\nto show how high a priority the sustainable development\nof our planet is for my country. None of us has the\nmeans to make it on our own. Our interdependence\npushes us to act together. It is a matter of survival. And\nit is within the United Nations that we must organize\nour collective survival.\nI would be remiss if I failed to mention another\npriority for Luxembourg in terms of conflict\nprevention, namely, disarmament and non-proliferation.\nLuxembourg promotes the constant search for security\nat the lowest level of armaments. It is a party to all\nrelevant global and regional treaties and conventions\nand, despite the setback that the international\ncommunity suffered this year, we remain committed\nto working towards an arms trade treaty, which would\nhelp Member States to effectively combat the scourge\nof uncontrolled arms circulation.\nWhen conflicts break out despite attempts to\nprevent them, Luxembourg does not shy away from\ncommitting itself. My country participates quite\nregularly and actively in peacekeeping operations. At\nthe present time, Luxembourg troops are contributing\nto efforts under the United Nations mandate in Kosovo,\nLebanon and Afghanistan. Through its contributions\nto European Union missions, Luxembourg has also\nassumed responsibilities in the Democratic Republic of\nthe Congo, in the fight against piracy off the coast of\nSomalia and in the Sahel region, where the international\ncommunity must redouble its efforts to prevent terrorist\ngroups linked to transnational organized crime from\ntaking root.\nAll the areas of action I have touched upon here\nshow how indispensable the United Nations is. If\nwe are convinced of the relevance of a multilateral\napproach founded on the United Nations, we must\ngive the Organization the means to be a true centre\nof multilateral action. For that, we need to continue\nto press ahead with United Nations reform, including\nSecurity Council reform. We are all aware of the need\nto make the Security Council more inclusive and more representative of today\u2019s realities and to make it more\neffective and transparent by continuing to improve its\nworking methods.\nAfrica should finally take its rightful place on the\nCouncil, in particular among the permanent members.\nIt is also important to ensure adequate representation\nfor small States, which represent the vast majority of\nthe Member States of the Organization.\nLuxembourg\u2019s action in the United Nations\nsince 1945 can be summarized by three key words:\ncommitment, solidarity, responsibility. Yet, although\nLuxembourg has consistently proved its solidarity and\ncommitment and has taken on responsibilities at the\nUnited Nations, it has not ever had the honour of serving\non the Security Council. Building on its commitment to\npeacekeeping operations and peacebuilding activities,\nLuxembourg declared its candidature 11 years ago\nfor a non-permanent seat on the Security Council for\nthe period 2013-2014. Luxembourg stands ready to\nshare primary responsibility for the maintenance of\ninternational peace and security, which the States\nMembers of the United Nations have conferred on the\nSecurity Council under the Charter.\nCommitment to effective multilateralism does not\ndepend on size. During his official visit to Luxembourg\non 17 April 2012, when he addressed our Parliament\nand thus our country, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon\nmade the following eloquent pronouncement:\n\u201cYou have shown that it is not the size of a nation\u2019s\nterritory that makes the difference. It is the size of a\nnation\u2019s heart. It is the breadth of a nation\u2019s vision.\nIt is the depth of a nation\u2019s promise to the wider\nworld.\u201d\nThat recognition honours us. It has further strengthened\nLuxembourg\u2019s resolve to prove itself up to the task and\nto serve the United Nations.\n"

We are therefore delighted to see him in that\nimportant seat.\nI would also like to thank His Excellency Secretary-\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon for the steady manner in which\nhe has continued to steer our global Organization. In\nZambia we are particularly appreciative that, despite\nhis busy schedule, the Secretary-General made time to\nvisit our country earlier this year to undertake some\nimportant programmes.\nAbout a year ago, I ended my decade-long career\nas an opposition politician when the people of Zambia\noverwhelmingly chose to change their political\nleadership through a democratic and peaceful electoral\ntransition that ushered me into office as the fifth\nPresident of the Republic. I am indebted to the people\nof Zambia for once again undertaking that process in a\npeaceful manner.\nIt is my desire to utilize my experience at both\nends of the leadership spectrum to make a worthwhile\ncontribution to our democracy. I trust that Zambia will\nbe able to share its lessons, as well as to learn from those\nwith longer and even better democratic experiences.\nAs the Assembly is aware, we still face considerable\nchallenges with respect to meeting the basic needs of\nthe majority of the Zambian people. Shortly before I\ntook office, there was much publicity about our positive macroeconomic indicators, but those results did not\ntrickle down to the average citizen.\nIn the quest to develop at the micro level, the focus\nof my new Government is on enhancing agricultural\nproductivity and access to markets for peasants and\nsmall-scale farmers, providing improved health\nservices as close to the families as possible, improving\nthe quality of education and facilitating access to decent\nhousing and accommodation.\nAs we draw closer to the 2015 deadline for meeting\nthe Millennium Development Goals, the international\ncommunity needs to maximize its efforts towards\nachieving all eight goals. Zambia has made steady\nprogress in achieving some of them.That is most visible\nin the education sector, which has seen an increase in\nthe net enrolment of children in primary schools, while\nthe health sector has seen reductions in the prevalence\nof HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria.\nNotwithstanding our progress in tackling\ncommunicable diseases, Zambia is also attempting\nto address non-communicable diseases such as\nhypertension, diabetes and cancer.\nWhile still considering matters related to the\nhealth sector, allow me to mention that my Government\nrecently reviewed statistics that indicate that Zambia\nnow has the second-highest rate of cervical cancer in\nthe world. From 22 to 24 July, our capital, Lusaka,\nhosted the sixth annual Stop Cervical Cancer in Africa\nConference, made up by the Forum of African First\nLadies against Breast and Cervical Cancer and the\nAfrican Parliamentarians and Health Ministers against\nCancer. Just last year, former United States President\nGeorge W. Bush travelled to Lusaka to launch the\nPink Ribbon Red Ribbon campaign against breast and\ncervical cancer. He has since facilitated some generous\ncontributions for the facilities now in place to fight the\ndiseases. I would like to express the Zambian people\u2019s\ndeep appreciation for all those efforts. However, the\nchallenges in the health sector and elsewhere do not end\nthere, and by no means have we stood by with folded\narms.\nSince my Government assumed power, in September\n2011, our country has seen reasonable improvements\nin our economy, with an inflation rate that is down to\n6.6 per cent and a gross domestic product growth rate\nof about 6 per cent, in spite of slow global economic\ntrends. That has been attributed to enhancement of the\ninvestment policy framework and to improvement of the infrastructure and to human capital development.\nDespite those efforts, however, 60.5 per cent of the\nZambian people continue to live in poverty.\nMy Government attaches similar importance to\npromoting good governance. As such, we have put\nin place a robust anti-corruption programme with\nimproved and increased resources, which should\nset a new stage for our development. In addition, for\nthe first time, Zambia has entrusted the governance\nof our legislative and judicial institutions to our\nwomen. The Inspector-General of Police, the Chief\nJustice and the Deputy Chief Justice, the chair of the\nanti-corruption commission and the commissioner of\nthe drug enforcement commission are all women. I\nremain convinced that they will improve our record and\nsurpass the nation\u2019s expectations.\nOur national programmes are also focused on\ncreating employment for our youth. Despite our vast\nnatural resources, unemployment continues to be the\nmost pressing problem for the younger generation. We\nare therefore looking to improve partnership with the\nvarious United Nations agencies and the rest of the\ninternational community to harness best practices from\nacross the world. After all, it is the youth of 2012 who\nhave made Zambia the African football champion.\nOur Government has recognized that without the\nrule of law, social justice and an independent judicial\nsystem Zambia will not be able to attain sustainable\nsocial and economic development. As an initial step in\nthat regard, our Government is currently undertaking\na constitutional review process that is intended to\nensure the primacy of the individual citizen and his\nliberties. We further wish to speed up the process of\ndomesticating the international conventions that seek\nto bridge the gaps for minorities. Special emphasis will\nalso be placed on improving the treatment of people\nwith mental and physical challenges.\nZambia participated in the process leading to the\nRio+20 United Nations Conference on Sustainable\nDevelopment. Over the years, we have learned to\nappreciate the transboundary nature of matters such\nas our common environment. I would like to express\nappreciation to the Government of Brazil, the Chair of\nthe Conference and all who made tremendous efforts\nto bring about the final outcome document of that\nhistoric conference. We are concerned, however, that\nas States Members of the United Nations we missed\nthe opportunity to develop a formidable international process for promoting sustainable development.\nThe failure to commit any funds to the means of\nimplementation, and indeed the little progress in\noutlining the sustainable development goals, has\nunderscored the lack of ambition in addressing our\ndeteriorating environment, worsening inequality and\na growing global population that shares the Earth\u2019s\nlimited resources. In that instance, we failed the test for\nglobal solidarity.\nToday, Zambia is encouraged that three committed\nglobal citizens have been appointed as co-Chairs of the\nSecretary-General\u2019s high-level panel to advise on the\npost-2015 global development agenda. We therefore\nwould like to congratulate His Excellency President\nSusilo Bambang Yudhoyono of Indonesia, Her\nExcellency President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf of Liberia\nand His Excellency Prime Minister David Cameron of\nthe United Kingdom. We wish them every success as\nthey take on that onerous task. We must support the\nhigh-level panel to help recoup the lost opportunities of\nthe recent past. As I indicated earlier, we are still a long\nway from attaining the Millenium Development Goals.\nDiscarding them entirely would be to the detriment of\nthe poorer nations. I trust that the Secretary-General\u2019s\npanel will take that into consideration.\nThe theme for this year\u2019s session of the General\nAssembly, \u201cBringing about adjustment or settlement of\ninternational disputes or situations by peaceful means\u201d,\nis undeniably significant in the wake of the turmoil that\ncontinues to threaten international peace and security\nwith the persistent conflict situations on the African\ncontinent in places such as the Sudan, South Sudan,\nGuinea-Bissau, Mali and Somalia. I therefore wish to\nreport that our Government has in certain instances\nsupported measures to help mitigate the humanitarian\nsituation. I urge the international community to\nredouble its efforts in bringing peace to those troubled\nregions.\nFarther afield, but no less important, is the\nsituation in Syria, which has seen the indiscriminate\nkilling of many innocent people. There is a need for\nconcerted efforts to utilize peaceful means, such as\nmediation and negotiation, to put a halt to the killings\nand to restore peace to the country. Humanity has again\nbeen embarrassed by the unnecessary carnage. Despite\nthe trouble spots, Zambia remains convinced that the\nUnited Nations has since 1945 performed quite well.\nHowever, circumstances have since changed greatly, and we need only look at the sovereign representation\nin this Hall to prove that.\nIt is therefore imperative that ongoing efforts to\nreform the United Nations be approached with renewed\nvigour. We are concerned that a seemingly difficult\ndeadlock has been created in the reform process of the\nUnited Nations.\nIn addition, I wish to reiterate that despite the slow\nprocess of the reform of the Security Council, Africa\nshould not relent or become frustrated. We should\nstand up and be counted. As enshrined in the Ezulwini\nConsensus and the Sirte Declaration, Africa must be\ngiven two permanent seats with a veto immediately\nexercisable and two non-permanent seats to correct\nthe historical injustice that the continent has suffered\nand also adhere to the geopolitical realities of modern\ntimes. Furthermore, the Council should improve its\nworking methods.\nI wish to appeal to all nations to renew their\ncommitment and to strive for new common ground\nwhere individual national interests take a back seat.\nJust as many international conventions have been\nsubject to innovative translations in the recent past, we\nmust plan to be as flexible in creating a new United\nNations, sooner rather than later. To ignore this need\nfor transformation would be tantamount to killing the\nOrganization."

        "file_text": "\ufeffOn behalf of\nthe Government of the Republic of San Marino, I\ncongratulate Mr. Vuk Jeremi\u0107 on his election as\nPresident of the General Assembly at its sixty-seventh\nsession, and I wish him a fruitful year. The San Marino\ndelegation assures him of its utmost cooperation in all\nthe work of the General Assembly. I also express my\ncountry\u2019s gratitude to the outgoing President of the\nGeneral Assembly, Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser, for the\nexcellent work carried out during the sixty-sixth session.\nHe distinguished himself by his leadership in the\ndifficult and complex issues before the United Nations.\nHe promoted the most important themes on the General\nAssembly\u2019s agenda with courage and determination,\nlaying foundations for solutions based on the widest\npossible consensus, while continually working to\nstrengthen the global governance architecture.\nMy country also extends special thanks to the\nSecretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for his energy\nand extraordinary determination in leading the United\nNations. San Marino supports the basic priorities of the\nSecretary-General\u2019s political action and his idea that the\nUnited Nations should play a key role in strengthening\nglobal governance by creating new cooperation\nmodels capable of managing today\u2019s challenges and\nthe ever-increasing calls for change. The Organization\nis in a unique position to provide solutions in deeply\ninterconnected fields, such as development, peace and\nsecurity, human rights and humanitarian action.\nSan Marino appreciates the focus of the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s attention on all United Nations Member\nStates, without distinction, as well as his commitment in\nthe field of reform and his presence in all international politically relevant and emergency situations. Among\nthose worth underlining is the Secretary-General\u2019s\ntireless commitment to finding a solution to the terrible\nSyrian conflict.\nI thank the President for the theme chosen for this\nsession: \u201cBringing about adjustment or settlement\nof international disputes or situations by peaceful\nmeans\u201d. The Republic of San Marino strongly believes\nin the settlement of international disputes by peaceful\nmeans. My country has always believed in the power of\ndialogue, democracy and respect for others as values at\nthe basis of peaceful coexistence among peoples.\nIn that respect, with reference to the recent bloody\nattacks on Western diplomatic missions, San Marino\nintends to voice once more its firm condemnation of\nany form of violence. We do not believe that violence\nis the right answer when someone feels hurt in his\npersonal beliefs or opinions, regardless of the gravity of\nthe statements made. Human life must always be above\neverything and everyone. Those actions are even more\nreproachable when directed to institutions that are the\nemblems of international collaboration and mutual\nassistance and when States bear no responsibility for\nthe statements made.\nOur country is therefore grateful to the President\nfor having chosen the theme, most of all at a time when\nthe international scene is unfortunately characterized\nby ever-increasing and bloody conflicts. In that\ncontext, the role of the United Nations, and in particular\nof the General Assembly, in peaceful transitions and\ndemocratic solutions is even more fundamental.\nFor that reason and because the international\ncommunity is now called upon to face major global\nchallenges in a consistent and rapid manner, the reform\nprocess of the United Nations is crucial to future world\nstability and must remain the target of all our efforts.\nWe have the duty to guarantee the full effectiveness of\nthe Organization\u2019s activities with a view to preserving\nand strengthening its essential value as a point of\nreference for the international community and for any\nindividual.\nI have the pleasure to reiterate again this year the\nsupport granted by San Marino to the revitalization\nprocess of the General Assembly. In that regard, I thank\nGeorgia and the Gambia, as co-Chairs of the Ad Hoc\nWorking Group on the Revitalization of the General\nAssembly, for the report recently adopted (A/66/891),\nwhich is the outcome of considerable effort and numerous informal meetings with Member States and\nthe representatives of the various political groups. That\nreform is particularly important for my country, since\nthe General Assembly is the most democratic body of\nthe United Nations and, as such, the most adequate\nand sometimes the only forum where a small State can\nexpress its opinions.\nThe revitalization process of the General Assembly\nis fundamental to strengthening the global governance\narchitecture and must be an objective common to all\nMember States. The rationalization of the agenda and\nimprovement of the methods of work of the General\nAssembly are important aspects of the reform, which is\nnecessary to enhance the technical and administrative\nefficiency of this body. But more importantly, the\nrevitalization process should include the political role\nof the General Assembly and its authority, as defined\nin the Charter of the United Nations. The reform of the\nGeneral Assembly should also improve its relations\nwith the other main organs of the United Nations in\norder to avoid duplication of functions and means.\nThe Republic of San Marino believes that the role\nof the General Assembly should not be limited to that\nof a mere body where resolutions are adopted. On the\ncontrary, it should be a forum for the exchange of ideas\nand debate, where solutions to today\u2019s challenges can\nbe found, and where a global consensus on issues of\ncommon interest can be reached. In that regard, with a\nview to enabling the Assembly to fully perform its task,\nSan Marino supports the prerogative of its President\nto organize thematic debates on the most relevant and\nurgent issues at the international level.\nIn that context, I underline the great importance\nattached by my country to the initiative of the outgoing\nPresident to organize, together with the Secretary-\nGeneral, the high-level thematic debate on the state\nof the world economy and finance in 2012, which\ntook place on 17 and 18 May here in New York. The\nRepublic of San Marino, together with Turkey, had the\nhonour and the pleasure to facilitate that event. The\ndebate was an efficient way to reaffirm the central role\nof the United Nations, and in particular of the General\nAssembly, by enhancing its deeply democratic nature\nand its indisputable legitimacy in dealing with issues\nthat affect the entire world community.\nFour years ago, the world economy suffered a\ndevastating financial crisis, the consequences of which\nare still evident to all. A prompt response by the Group of Twenty and its central banks was able to avoid the\nworst effects of this crisis, but the situation is still\nprecarious. According to forecasts, many developed\ncountries will experience stagnation and in some cases\nrecession. Economic growth has slowed down in many\nother countries. Today, unemployment has reached the\nhighest levels, in particular among young people and\nwomen. Increases in the prices of food products and\npersistent inequalities contribute to higher poverty\nrates and cause increasingly violent social tensions.\nProblems connected with sovereign debts in\nEurope have further worsened global economic crisis.\nThe crisis has severely hit many countries of the world,\nthus becoming one of today\u2019s major challenges to our\nOrganization as well. It is now more than ever necessary\nto find new strategies, solutions and, more importantly,\nto create a sense of solidarity among our countries and\npeoples.\nFor those reasons too, the organization this year of\na thematic debate on the state of the world economy and\nfinance was extremely important. My country firmly\nbelieves that this exercise should be repeated at this\nsession of the General Assembly and perhaps at later\nsessions, at least until the crisis has been overcome.\nIndeed, when we talk about the revitalization of the\nGeneral Assembly, we think of a forum where all\nmembers of the international community have the\nopportunity to exchange ideas on the most important\nand urgent themes that have a global dimension and\nneed a global response. In our opinion, the Organization\nshould play a leadership role in the promotion of fair\nand inclusive growth, sustainable development and the\nelimination of poverty and hunger.\nThe reform of the Security Council is part of a wider\nreform of the United Nations and remains a central\ntheme of the activity of the General Assembly. Over\nthe past few years, the Security Council has approved\na growing number of peacekeeping operations and has\nbeen increasingly involved in extremely important\nissues concerning international peace and security.\nThe reform of that body, based on the widest possible\npolitical consensus, is therefore necessary and must be\ncarried out with the utmost commitment by all Member\nStates.\nThe Republic of San Marino is grateful to\nAmbassador Tanin for the wisdom and impartiality\nwith which he has presided over intergovernmental\nnegotiations on the reform. Our country is convinced that the intergovernmental negotiations launched three\nyears ago still represent the right framework to find a\nsolution, taking into account the interests and positions\nof all. Although the various groups of countries still\nexpress different positions, it must be recognized that\nsome steps forward have been taken in the reform\nprocess. San Marino believes that the reform should\nlead to an enlarged, more representative, transparent\nand efficient Security Council. Moreover, it believes\nthat the five strongly interconnected fundamental\nthemes of the reform need to be considered as a whole.\nOver the past few years, some new bloody and\nviolent conflicts have broken out. We have also\nwitnessed a massive popular uprising spreading across\nthe squares of cities in North Africa and the Middle\nEast. At the forefront of the Arab revolution were young\npeople, educated and penalized by exclusion from the\nlabour market. The situation is still unstable, and we\nare unable to imagine what the future of such countries\nwill look like. However, we must support them in their\nstruggle for democracy, liberty and social justice.\nFurthermore, today we are witnessing the Syrian\nconflict, the violence of which is unacceptable. There\nare clear reports on the atrocities perpetrated against the\npopulation: mass killings, rapes, summary executions\nand torture. Children have been among the innocent\nvictims of the massacres. San Marino firmly condemns\nthose atrocities, in the same way as it condemns\nany violation of human rights and international\nhumanitarian law.\nWe hope that the Security Council will be able to\nreach an agreement soon on how to settle the Syrian\ncrisis. San Marino seizes this opportunity to express\nits most sincere wishes to His Excellency Lakhdar\nBrahimi for having accepted a difficult task.\nThe commitment of the General Assembly\nconcerning the Syrian crisis reflects an important\nmission of our Organization: to keep the peace\nworldwide and to ensure respect for freedoms and\nhuman rights. The Republic of San Marino expresses\nits satisfaction with the adoption, on 3 August last, of\nresolution 66/253 B, which we co-sponsored.\nAnother important theme this year on the agenda\nof the General Assembly has been the improvement\nof disaster prevention and response. That theme has\nrecently gained greater importance in the political\nagenda. Rising temperatures, earthquakes and\ndroughts have caused unprecedented humanitarian disasters. Many populations have suffered food and\nhealth insecurity, thus becoming fully aware of their\nvulnerability. Disasters are, of course, not only natural\nones but also caused by human beings. The international\ncommunity must be able to rapidly and efficiently\nrespond to emergency situations. A fundamental way\nto reduce the risks connected with natural disasters is\nundoubtedly to invest in the most vulnerable regions in\norder to build the capacities necessary to prevent them,\nso that action can be taken before disasters occur.\nIn the short term, however, it is essential to provide\nour political and financial support so as to overcome\nthe consequences of disasters. In that regard, I am\nproud of the fact that my country, despite its small size,\nis ranked fifty-second among donors to the Central\nEmergency Response Fund.\nWe are extremely grateful to the Secretary-\nGeneral, as well as to the Office for the Coordination\nof Humanitarian Affairs and the Fund, for their rapid\nand fundamental action in favour of populations in\nhumanitarian emergency and for their substantial\ncontribution. Humanitarian and development issues,\nparticularly sustainable development, are inevitably\nintertwined, and our success in providing an efficient\nresponse to natural disasters certainly has a direct\nimpact on our capacity to achieve the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals.\nIndeed, as this is a global economic crisis, responses\nmust also have a global dimension. The United Nations,\non account of its universal character, must play a key\nrole in the decision-making process on the world\neconomy and sustainable development, with a view\nto finding new solutions and to promoting a political\nconsensus on these issues.\nThe Organization must play a leadership role in\nthe promotion of fair and inclusive growth, sustainable\ndevelopment and the elimination of poverty and hunger.\nIn that context, San Marino welcomes the results\nof the United Nations Conference on Sustainable\nDevelopment, held last June in Rio. Resolution 66/288,\nentitled \u201cThe future we want\u201d, marked the conclusion\nof long and complex negotiations at the end of which\nStates finally recognized their common responsibilities.\nNow the most important thing is for the commitments\nundertaken to be respected so that the future that\nis wanted and set out in the resolution can become a\nreality. The 1948 Universal Declaration of Human\nRights states that everyone is entitled to the same\nrights and freedoms, without distinction of any kind.\nUnfortunately, in today\u2019s world there is a clear and\ndirect relationship among disability, poverty and social\nexclusion. According to estimates, approximately\n15 per cent of the world\u2019s population is affected by\ndisabilities, and about two thirds of disabled people live\nin developing countries. Many of them cannot actively\nparticipate in their societies. This situation is not\nlimited only to developing countries. Indeed, women,\nmen and children with disabilities are often victims of\ndiscrimination even in the richest societies.\nSan Marino was among the first countries to ratify\nthe United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons\nwith Disabilities. That Convention and its optional\nProtocol cover a wide range of civil, cultural, economic,\npolitical and social rights. My country is pleased that\nthe Convention has been ratified by more than half of\nMember States and hopes that it will soon be ratified\nby all. Each country has the duty to fully implement\nthe Convention. An effective and positive change in the\nlives of people with disabilities will be possible only if\nit is fully implemented.\nThe Republic of San Marino congratulates the\nGeneral Assembly on its decision to convene a high-\nlevel meeting on disability and development in\nSeptember 2013 and hopes that the meeting will be a\ngreat success.\nToday we all recognize and appreciate the\nfundamental role of women. Nonetheless, the\ndiscrimination and violence to which women are still\noften subjected are among the major concerns of the\nUnited Nations. In many countries, maternal mortality\nis still worrisome, especially in the poorest areas of the\nworld. Women are the most affected by HIV. In many\nparts of the world, women continue to be subjected\nto atrocious and humiliating practices. Improving the\nstatus of women all over the world is our responsibility,\na responsibility which all States must share. To that\nend, in order to promote the empowerment of women,\nit is essential to guarantee women\u2019s access to schooling\nand education and to improve their participation in\npolitical, social and economic life at all levels. The\nRepublic of San Marino welcomes the proposal to hold\na global conference on women in 2015, 20 years after\nthe Beijing summit. Despite the fact that child mortality is decreasing,\nthe most recent estimates show that in 2010\napproximately 7.6 million children died before the age\nof 5. Moreover, according to estimates, in 2015 about\n72 million children will not have access to schooling.\nRecently, the drought and food emergency in the\nHorn of Africa has had a devastating impact on about\n13 million people, in particular women and children.\nAlmost 5 million young people between the ages of 15\nand 24 are affected by HIV.\nChildren are still the most vulnerable group of the\npopulation and are subjected to violence, abuse and\nexploitation. A vast number of children all over the\nworld do not still have access to basic services, health\ncare and education. Besides facing global challenges\nsuch as the economic crisis and the problems connected\nwith climate change, States must find the resources\nnecessary to best meet the needs of children and to\nimmediately improve the conditions of those living in\nthe poorest areas of the world. It is imperative for us\nall if we want to guarantee to the global community a\nfuture worthy of the name."

        "file_text": "\ufeffAt\nthe outset, I should like to join previous speakers in\ncongratulating Mr. Vuk Jeremi\u0107 and the other members\nof the Bureau on his election to the presidency of\nthe General Assembly at its sixty-seventh session. I\nshould like also to congratulate Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz\nAl-Nasser for the work that he accomplished during\nhis mandate, and Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon\nfor his commitment to defending the ideals of our\nOrganization.\nThe holding of a session of the General Assembly\noffers each of us an opportunity to participate in a\ncollective process of ref lection on ways and means of\nensuring the success of efforts aimed at peace, security\nand development in each of our States and throughout\nthe world.\nPresident Jeremi\u0107 has rightly recommended\nthat interventions during this general debate focus\nin particular on the adjustment or settlement of\ninternational disputes by peaceful means. That\nrecommendation is particularly wise because this is an\nissue whose relevance and timeliness are immutable\nand which is part and parcel of the process of tirelessly\nseeking peace through means other than the use of\nforce.\nWorld history makes clear the operational validity of\nthe principle of the peaceful settlement of international\ndisputes. It also teaches us that processes of dialogue\nand negotiation, in order to remain credible as ways of\nresolving conflicts and disputes, must be based on truth\nand respect for the law and the values and universally\nrecognized principles. They should guard against both\nhasty action and stalemate, and they should demonstrate\neffectiveness by producing the hoped-for results, even\nif this is done in a gradual manner.\nIt must be noted that more than 60 years after the\nfounding of the United Nations, the world continues\nto witness many situations of war and instability.\nTerrorism is increasing instead of decreasing. Maritime\npiracy, which we thought had been eradicated, is once\nagain becoming one of the main threats to peace\nand security. The Middle East is today a hotbed of\ntension. Syria is in the throes of bloodshed, and Mali is\nwitnessing attempts at separatism.\nMore broadly, as peace is more than just the absence\nof war, many scourges still affect humanity. Many are\ndevoting their creativity and energy to destabilization\nand destruction, by means of drug trafficking, trafficking in persons and other violations of the rights\nand freedoms of human beings, instead of working for\nthe prosperity and for individual and collective well-\nbeing.\nIn addition, for the sake of more than two thirds of\nhumanity, there is an increasingly urgent need to fight\npoverty, ignorance, violence, injustice and diseases of\nall kinds, particularly HIV and malaria.\nAfter years of difficulties, my country, the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, is in the process\nof consolidating of peace and security. To that end, no\neffort has been spared, and remarkable progress has\nbeen made. Begun for the first time only 10 years ago\nin a country that has had independence for 50 years,\ntireless efforts towards democratization, the building\nof a State based on the rule of law, the development of\nthe socioeconomic infrastructure, and the improvement\nof the living conditions of our people continue, which is\nproof of the determination of the Congolese people and\nof its leaders to be a factor of peace and stability.\nThat momentum, unfortunately, is now under\nthreat by the enemies of peace. Since March 2012, the\nprovince of North Kivu, in the Democratic Republic\nof the Congo, where the concepts of peace, stability,\nreconciliation, work and human dignity had begun\nto regain a foothold, has, sadly, once again gained\nnotoriety, not because of the incomparable beauty\nof its landscape or the extraordinary richness of its\nbiodiversity, but as an example of the profound evil\nthat selfishness, extremism, communal violence and\nthe philosophy of \u201cmight makes right\u201d can wreak on\na society.\nEven as I address the Assembly today, hundreds\nof thousands of children, women and men in North\nKivu are deprived of peace and are being subjected to\ninhuman and degrading treatment by negative forces,\nled by unrepentant elements with a vast capacity to do\nharm and who benefit from external support. Children\nare unable to attend school and are forced to carry\nand use firearms to kill other children, even their own\nbrothers and sisters. That situation is unacceptable. It\nshould be condemned and should give rise to sanctions.\nWe expect that the community of nations will shoulder\nits responsibilities in that respect and that the Security\nCouncil will ensure compliance with its resolutions.\nThat is a condition for those resolutions to be effective\nand remain credible.\n\nWe are aware that it is up to us, the Congolese\npeople, to defend our country and ensure law and order\nand security throughout our national territory. We are\ndetermined to assume that responsibility and we intend\nto dedicate all of our human, material and financial\nresources to that end, even sacrificing our legitimate\nambitions for the emergence of Congo. We also remain\ndetermined to guarantee national cohesion and ensure\nequal protection for all Congolese citizens.\nAt the same time, it is my hope to see the Organization\nencourage all Member States, in particular those that are\ntempted by violence, to respect the guiding principles\nof the Charter of the United Nations.\nIn conclusion, I would like to thank all those who,\nfrom afar or from close by, bilateral or multilateral\npartners, including the United Nations, have assisted us\nin our efforts to build at the centre of Africa a Congo\nthat is united and prosperous and that lives in peace\nwith itself and with all of its neighbours. I would like\nto assure the Assembly of one thing: the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo is a safe investment."

I also want to thank Secretary-\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon, who tirelessly carries on at the\nhelm of our Organization in an ever-shifting global\nenvironment.\nI wish to affirm our endorsement of the positions\nvoiced in the statement made by the observer of the\nEuropean Union. As always, Greece remains fully\ncommitted to the United Nations, to the values of peace,\nsecurity, and to raising the living standards of people\nall over the world so that they may lead lives of dignity.\n\nAt the recent High-level Meeting on the rule of law,\nthe States Members of the United Nations reaffirmed\ntheir commitment to one of the most important principles underlying the international order, which should be our\nguide in the conduct of diplomacy and international\nrelations. We fully agree with the Secretary-General\u2019s\nopinion that freedom of expression is a fundamental\nright and privilege belonging to all people, without any\ndiscrimination, and should not be abused by anyone in\na disgraceful and shameful way.\nUnfortunately, there are those who will do\neverything to provoke, as we have witnessed again\nrecently in the provocative and unacceptable movie\nwhich denigrates Islam. Nevertheless, we should\nstrongly condemn all forms of violence, and, in\nthis particular case, the violence against diplomatic\nmissions. There is no justification for it. After all, the\nmeasure and limit of every right is the respect of the\nright of the other.\nGreece is dedicated to United Nations efforts to\nenhance international cooperation on the promotion and\nprotection of human rights. We have therefore decided\nto present our candidacy for membership in the Human\nRights Council for the 2013-2015 term. In this context,\nwe also support the adoption of the European Union\nStrategic Framework on Human Rights and Democracy\nand the appointment of the European Union Special\nRepresentative for Human Rights as important steps\ntowards a more coherent European policy and approach\nto human dignity.\nThe need to respect and protect human rights and\nhumanitarian law is now as urgent as ever. In fact,\nillegal migration in the Mediterranean region has given\nrise to a humanitarian crisis. That is why Greece has\nintroduced major legislative and institutional reforms\nin the fields of asylum and migration.\nI now turn to one of the main pillars of United Nations\naction: peace and security. Greece\u2019s neighbourhood\nhas often been at the centre of serious, interrelated\nsecurity challenges. My country has consistently\nplayed a stabilizing role, which we have accomplished\nthrough the pursuit of a policy of peaceful resolution of\ndisputes, within the framework of the United Nations\nCharter, based on respect for international law and the\nprinciples of sovereignty, independence and territorial\nintegrity. Despite the economic and financial crisis,\nGreece has continued to participate actively in a number\nof United Nations missions and operations around the\nworld, including in Kosovo and Afghanistan and in the\nanti-piracy efforts off the coast of Somalia. Security in the Middle East remains a crucial quest\nfor the countries of the region and the world community.\nGreece maintains historic ties of friendship, cooperation\nand mutual respect with its neighbours in North Africa\nand the Middle East \u2014 countries that, following the\nmomentous events of the Arab Spring, are moving\ntowards successful electoral processes and towards\nbuilding democratic institutions. The European Union\nshould be there, right by their side, as they build their\nfuture.\nHowever, we have not seen successful outcomes\neverywhere. In Syria, demonstrators faced tanks\nand a brutal crack-down. On numerous occasions we\nhave called on President Al-Assad to open the way\nfor a transitional authority, comprising all sections of\nSyrian society. Yet, we are still in a prolonged bloody\nstalemate that jeopardizes the present and the future of\nthe Syrian people, and stability in our region. The result\nhas been no less than 29,000 victims, 250,000 refugees,\n2.5 million Syrian citizens in need. We are convinced\nthat a Syrian-led political solution is still achieveable,\nand we see no alternative to such a solution. Greece\nbelieves that there is no military solution to the Syrian\nproblem.\nPeace and security in the Eastern Mediterranean\ncannot be achieved without a just, lasting and\ncomprehensive solution of the Palestinian issue, on the\nbasis of a two-State solution. We regret the prolonged\nstagnation in the direct negotiations between the two\nparties. It is only through negotiations that peace\ncan finally be achieved. We believe that unilateral\nactions cannot fulfil Israel\u2019s quest for security or the\nPalestinians\u2019 aspirations for statehood, which we fully\nsupport. The two-State solution should remain feasible\non the ground.\nI would now like to outline the current position\non some salient issues concerning our immediate\nneighbourhood. The issue of the name of the former\nYugoslav Republic of Macedonia is, beyond its semantic\ndimension, an important piece in the puzzle of putting\nto rest irredentist notions and attempts to rewrite\nhistory in our region. I have been informed of what\nthe representative of the former Yugoslav Republic of\nMacedonia said today in the General Assembly (see\nA/67/PV.12). Distorting reality in front of the entire\ninternational community and using nineteenth-century\nrhetoric in the twenty-first century is counterproductive\nand will lead us nowhere. Populism and nationalism\nmake up the worst possible mix for the promotion of anyone\u2019s national interests and the stability of our\nregion.\nGreece believes that the solution lies in a fair\nsettlement. That would be a name with a geographical\nqualifier, since Macedonia is a geographical region that\noverlaps the territories of three countries, the largest\npart being in Greece, followed by Bulgaria and then\nthe former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. And of\ncourse the name must be used in relation to everyone;\nit is an erga omnes obligation, to use the Latin phrase.\nWhen we resolve this issue, we will be able to realize\nthe vast potential in our relations, to our mutual benefit,\nand Greece will be the former Yugoslav Republic of\nMacedonia\u2019s staunchest ally and friend in its efforts to\nfulfil its Euro-Atlantic aspirations. After all, as is well\nknown, Greece is the most important economic partner\nof the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, with a\nlarge presence of Greek companies operating there. We\nalso support the European Union-facilitated dialogue\nbetween Belgrade and Pristina, and we welcome the\nconstructive approach to the talks on the part of the\nSerbian leadership. Dialogue is the only way to resolve\nproblems in Kosovo, while unilateral measures and\nescalation, especially in the north, should be avoided\nby all means.\nLess than two years from now, Greece\u2019s European\nUnion presidency will launch Agenda 2014, which\naims to reinvigorate the European perspectives of all\nour neighbours in the Western Balkans. Elsewhere in\nour immediate neighbourhood, Greece is consistently\npursuing stronger cooperation with Turkey, through a\nwide range of initiatives, so that we can improve our\nrelations to the benefit of both peoples. Moreover,\nGreece continues to support Turkey\u2019s candidacy for full\nmembership in the European family, on the condition,\nof course, that all relevant membership criteria are met\nand that the necessary reforms are carried out. It is of the\nutmost importance that Turkey gives tangible signs of\nfull respect for international law and abandons attitudes\nlike the standing threat of casus belli against Greece, or\nits attitude vis-\u00e0-vis Cyprus, which undermines efforts\nto build trust.\nThat brings us to the Eastern Mediterranean as a\nwhole, where Greece continues to play its role as a force\nfor peace and stability. Greece supports the efforts of\nthe Government of the Republic of Cyprus to pursue\nnegotiations with the Turkish Cypriot community,\nunder United Nations auspices, aimed ultimately at\nreuniting the island, according to United Nations resolutions and taking into account the fact that the\nRepublic of Cyprus is a member of the European\nUnion, which currently holds its presidency. However,\nafter 38 years, the division of the island continues and\nthe results of the talks have been disappointing, owing\nto Turkish-Cypriot intransigence about engaging in\nconstructive talks. We applaud Cyprus\u2019s decision to act\non its sovereign right to exploit the natural gas deposits\nin its exclusive economic zone.\nWe are forging partnerships with other emerging\nenergy players in the region, including Israel and\nthe Arab countries, with which we enjoy traditional\nrelations of friendship and trust. Greece is contributing\nto bringing stability and economic growth to the Eastern\nMediterranean, in order to promote energy security\nand diversification of sources and suppliers for the\nEuropean energy markets. A resolution of the Cyprus\nissue would have a tremendously positive effect, not\njust for the Cypriots themselves but for Greek-Turkish\nrelations and stability in the Eastern Mediterranean as\na whole.\nI will conclude with a few words about the\neconomic crisis that Greece is confronting with the\nhelp of its partners in the European Union and the\ninternational community. The new tripartite coalition\nGovernment in Greece is implementing an ambitious\neconomic adjustment programme in order to improve its\nmacroeconomic outlook and achieve fiscal adjustment,\nwhile at the same time addressing structural reforms\naimed at growth and job creation.\nThat effort has produced impressive results,\nespecially a significant reduction of the primary\ndeficit. At the same time, the Greek economy has\nregained more than 50 per cent of its competitiveness in\nrelation to its global trade partners, while the business\nand investment climate is on a positive path. We are\ndetermined to continue along that path, bearing in mind\nthat the Greek people are suffering tremendously from\nthe implementation of the austerity programme.\nIn a broader view, it is evident that this crisis is not\njust Greek or European. International economies are\nintertwined, and therefore ours is also a global crisis.\nIn that respect, we need to examine measures aimed\nat generating all-inclusive and job-creating growth,\nmeasures that will regenerate economies and diminish\nthe social impact of the crisis.\nThe eurozone, with Greece at the forefront, is\nmaking a hard and painstaking effort and adopting new paths and ways to climb out of the deep economic crisis.\nThe pivotal role and geopolitical importance of Greece\nin South-Eastern Europe, in the Eastern Mediterranean\nand the Middle East will emerge as a result of the\nevents unfolding in our neighbourhood. It is indeed\na stabilizing role, since our vital national interests\nare aligned with the promotion of peace, stability,\nprosperity and regional security. Our advantage is\nnot only our geographical position but also our strong\npolitical will to become a cornerstone of stability\nand security, at a time when uncertainty dangerously\nthreatens our region.\nDuring the past two years, Greece has been\nportrayed by the global media as a country defined\nby its economic need. It is true that our country is\nexperiencing a painful transition leading to economic\nrecovery and growth. It is also true that the Greek\npeople have known in their 3,000 years of history crises\nmore serious than the present one. We survived. We\nexcelled. Let me assure the General Assembly and the\nfamily of nations that Greece will make it.\nWe will make it because Greece is larger than its\ngeographical size and more precious than its present\nfiscal reality. Through knowledge, science and art,\nGreece is there when progress takes place. Through\ndemocracy Greece is present as a global civilization.\nThrough Olympism Greece unites humankind. Through\nour merchant f leet and our maritime tradition we carry\ngoods all around the world. Through our love for life\nwe constantly remind the world that progress should\nalways be measured on the human scale. Through and\nby our legacy we will make it once more.\nWe will make it because Greece is not about\nasking. Greece is about offering. Let us not forget that\nGreece holds intrinsic value in the hearts and minds\nof people irrespective of nationality, race and religion.\nAnd that gives us the moral power, the support and the\nencouragement, along with our partners in Europe, to\ngive to the world and to win our current fight."

        "file_text": "\ufeffAt the outset, I\nwould like to congratulate my good friend, Mr. Vuk\nJeremi\u0107, on his election to the presidency of the General\nAssembly at its sixty-seventh session, and to wish him\nevery success in fulfilling his highly responsible duties.\nWe are also grateful to Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser\nfor presiding ably over the sixty-sixth session.\nThis is the fi rst general debate that I have addressed\nsince Azerbaijan was elected to a non-permanent seat\non the Security Council, and I would like to express\nour sincere gratitude and profound appreciation to the Governments of States Members of the United Nations\nfor their valuable support for our candidacy and for\ntheir solidarity with Azerbaijan during 17 rounds of\nelections.\nThe theme of the this year\u2019s general debate,\n\u201cBringing about adjustment or settlement of international\ndisputes or situations by peaceful means\u201d, is timely\nand topical. It also represents a logical continuation of\ndiscussions we had during the previous session. Indeed,\nthe peaceful settlement of disputes is one of the key\nand core principles of international law enshrined in\nthe United Nations Charter. Its true value is to be able\nto commit States to respecting one another\u2019s territorial\nintegrity and political independence, refraining in\ntheir international relations from the threat or use of\nforce and resolving their disputes in conformity with\ninternational law.\nAt its sixty-fi fth and sixty-sixth sessions, the General\nAssembly adopted two resolutions on strengthening the\nrole of mediation in the peaceful settlement of disputes,\nconflict prevention and resolution (resolutions 65/283\nand 66/291), and the Secretary-General submitted\na report on the subject that contains a Guidance for\nEffective Mediation (A/66/811, annex I). As a sponsor\nof those resolutions, Azerbaijan considers the process\nbegun by their adoption to be an essential effort\ntowards reinforcing the promotion of mediation in the\npeaceful settlement of disputes, conflict prevention\nand resolution, as well as providing useful guidance to\nexisting and future mediation mechanisms. A crucial\nfactor is that those resolutions, and the Guidance for\nEffective Mediation developed by the Secretary-\nGeneral, reaffirmed the key importance of the United\nNations Charter and of international law and justice,\nin particular the commitment to respect and uphold\nthe sovereignty, territorial integrity and political\nindependence of States.\nDuring Azerbaijan\u2019s presidency of the Security\nCouncil this past May, we organized an Arria-formula\nmeeting of the Council to encourage a frank exchange\nof views, within a flexible procedural framework, on\nthe role of mediation, judicial settlement and justice in\npromoting durable peace and reconciliation based on\ninternational law. We look forward to further initiatives\non the topic in the General Assembly and the Security\nCouncil with a view to contributing to the development\nand implementation of comprehensive peace strategies\nwithin specific frameworks that provide that dispute settlement and conflict resolution must be based on\nrespect for the rule of law and for justice.\nThe world continues to face persistent, grave and\nsystematic violations of the fundamental norms and\nprinciples of international law. There are still instances\nwhere archaic patterns of the use of force against the\nterritorial integrity and political independence of\nStates are used to achieve territorial gains. Hundreds\nof thousands of people throughout the world continue\nto suffer from aggression, military occupation, ethnic\ncleansing and a prevailing culture of impunity for the\nmost serious crimes of concern to the international\ncommunity.\nThe ongoing armed conflict between Armenia\nand Azerbaijan continues to represent a serious threat\nand challenge to international and regional peace and\nsecurity. The conflict has led to the occupation of\nalmost 20 per cent of the territory of Azerbaijan and\nhas turned more than one million people in the country\ninto internally displaced persons or refugees. The war\nhas also led to the deaths and wounding of thousands\nof Azerbaijanis, including women, the elderly and\nchildren. In addition, the aggression against Azerbaijan\nhas severely damaged the country in socioeconomic\nterms. Not a single Azerbaijani historic or cultural\nmonument has been left undamaged, and no sacred\nsite has escaped desecration in either the occupied\nterritories or in Armenia.\nWe sincerely believe that there is no alternative\nto peace, stability and mutually beneficial regional\ncooperation. As a country suffering from the occupation\nof its territories and the forcible displacement of\nhundreds of thousands of its citizens, Azerbaijan is the\nmost interested party in the earliest possible negotiated\nsettlement of the conflict. Without prejudice to its rights\nunder the United Nations Charter, in particular those\nset forth in Article 51, Azerbaijan embarked on and\nremains committed to the conflict settlement process,\nconfident that it will lead to the end of the illegal\nArmenian occupation, ensure the return of forcibly\ndisplaced people to their homes and guarantee the\npeaceful coexistence of the Armenian and Azerbaijani\ncommunities in the Nagorno Karabakh region within\nthe Republic of Azerbaijan.\nAttempts by the Armenian side to misinterpret\nthe norms and principles of international law and\nits insistence on unrealistic annexationist claims,\nwhich Azerbaijan will never accept, speak to the real\nintentions of Armenia\u2019s leadership and represent an\nopen challenge to the conflict settlement process, as\nwell as a serious threat to international and regional\npeace and security. In f lagrant violation of the United\nNations Charter, Armenia continues to use force to\nmaintain its occupation of the Nagorno Karabakh\nregion and seven other districts of Azerbaijan, as well\nas to prevent internally displaced Azerbaijani persons\nfrom returning to their homes. It is attempting to alter\nthe demographic balance in the occupied territories\nand to remove any signs of their Azerbaijani cultural\nand historical roots. Additionally, regular ceasefire\nviolations and deliberate attacks by the armed forces of\nArmenia against the inhabitants of towns and villages in\nAzerbaijan along the front line and the border between\nthe two States have become more frequent and violent\nin recent times, resulting in the killing and injuring of\nmany Azerbaijani civilians.\nWe have no doubt that the Azerbaijani and\nArmenian communities of Nagorno Karabakh will\none day live side by side in peace and dignity in that\nregion of Azerbaijan. It is therefore essential and vital\nto continue efforts for peace and coexistence between\nthe two communities. Azerbaijan considers that an\nimportant part of the whole reconciliation process\nand has therefore accepted invitations from a number\nof European non-governmental organizations to hold\nintercommunal meetings. However, those proposals\nhave so far been blocked by the authorities in Yerevan.\nMoreover, the aggressive rhetoric of Armenia\u2019s\nleadership and its blatant promotion of odious ideas of\nracial superiority, ethnic and religious incompatibility\nand hatred towards Azerbaijan and other neighbouring\nnations only deepen mistrust and make more elusive\nthe prospect of a speedy negotiated settlement.\nThe situation is further complicated by Armenia\u2019s\nirresponsible and unacceptable behaviour in the highly\nsensitive domain of justice and reconciliation. The\nperpetrators of war crimes and crimes against humanity,\nincluding acts of genocide against the Azerbaijani\npeople, not only remain unpunished in Armenia but\nare even promoted, venerated and officially rewarded\nwith the title of hero. Schools, universities and streets\nare named after them and monuments are erected in\ntheir honour. War criminals who proudly avow their\nrole in the mass killing of Azerbaijani civilians are\nreincarnated as highly placed politicians, military\ncommanders and public figures.\n\nArmenia must finally realize that the irresponsible\nand provocative policy of territorial claims, animosity\nand hatred towards neighbouring countries and nations\nbased on historical, cultural, racial and religious\nprejudices has no chance of success. The earlier it\ngrasps that fact, the sooner our countries will be able to\nreach mutual understanding and enjoy peace, stability\nand cooperation.\nIt is clear that both the conflict-settlement process\nand its outcome must be consistent with international\nlaw. The achievement of peace, security, stability and\nconfidence therefore depends first and foremost on the\nremoval of the consequences of Armenia\u2019s illegal use\nof force. That will ensure that the occupation of the\nterritories of Azerbaijan is at an end and that the right\nof internally displaced Azerbaijani persons to return to\ntheir homes and recover their property and possessions\nwill be implemented. That is what international\nlaw and the relevant Security Council and General\nAssembly resolutions require, which means that this\ncondition cannot be subject to compromise or used as\na bargaining chip in the conflict settlement process.\nArmenia\u2019s implementation of its obligation to withdraw\nits armed forces from the territory of Azerbaijan and\nto resolve outstanding issues of State responsibility for\nacts deemed wrongful under international law cannot\nbe made contingent on addressing the aggressor\u2019s\nunlawful and unacceptable claims.\nThe fact that the situation has remained unresolved\nfor so long does not speak well for the strength and\nefficiency of the international organizations that are\ndeaing with the issue. It is obvious that the primary\nrole in the resolution of the conflict lies with the\nStates concerned. At the same time, when it comes to\nprinciples, it is everyone\u2019s duty to defend them. In that\nregard, Azerbaijan highly appreciates the principled\nstance of Member States, as expressed in various\nforums, including the most recent summits of NATO,\nthe Organization of Islamic Cooperation and the\nNon-Aligned Movement, on issues of vital importance\nto our country and pertaining to its sovereignty and\nterritorial integrity. We count on the continued resolve\nof the international community to defend the purposes\nand principles of the United Nations Charter, and on its\nstrong solidarity with the just position of Azerbaijan.\nWe would like to express our concern over the\nsituation with regard to the Middle East peace process,\nwhich has been at a standstill with no substantive\nprogress towards the resumption of direct talks between the parties. We call upon the parties to\ncreate the conditions conducive to the resumption of\nnegotiations. In that regard, we share the concerns of\nthe international community over settlement activity\nin the occupied Palestinian territories, which places\na tremendous burden on civilians, seriously obstructs\nthe peace process and, what is even more dangerous,\nthreatens the two-State solution and the emergence of\na viable Palestinian State. We reiterate our support for\nPalestine\u2019s application for admission to membership in\nthe United Nations and look forward to a solution to\nthat issuebased on international law.\nAzerbaijan also remains deeply concerned\nabout the escalation of violence and the worsening\nsocioeconomic and humanitarian situation in Syria. We\nbelieve that the solution to the crisis lies in the hands\nof the Syrian people and in their desire for mutual\nreconciliation and an all-inclusive political process. We\nwelcome the appointment of Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi as\nthe Joint Special Representative of the United Nations\nand the League of Arab States for Syria, and express\nour firm support for his efforts.\nWe must once again express our deep concern\nover the recent escalation provoked by the blasphemy\nagainst Islam. We strongly condemn all assaults against\nreligions. At the same time, attacks on civilians, in\nparticular on diplomatic personnel, are unjustifiable\nunder any circumstances. It is critical to foster global\ndialogue and cooperation to promote tolerance, peace\nand better understanding across countries, cultures and\ncivilizations.\nWe are confident that during the sixty-seventh\nsession of the General Assembly, Member States will\nbe able to take successful steps towards a stronger\nand more effective United Nations. With its active\nparticipation in the work of the organs of the United\nNations, most notably the General Assembly and\nSecurity Council, Azerbaijan will continue to be in the\nforefront of international efforts to that end."

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt is a pleasure to\nbe able to address the General Assembly here on this\nbeautiful morning in New York, and I would first like\nto take the opportunity to congratulate you, Sir, on\nyour election to the presidency of the Assembly at its\nsixty-seventh session. Be assured that the Icelandic\ndelegation will assist you in every way possible.\nLast year, I brought the Assembly the message\nthat my Government would propose to our Parliament\nthat Iceland recognize Palestine as a sovereign and\nindependent State. I am happy to be able to stand here\ntoday and say that we have fulfilled that promise. What\nis more, not a single member of the Icelandic Parliament\nvoted against the recognition of Palestine. Today, we\nhave a fully fledged and strong formal diplomatic\nrelationship between our two countries of Palestine and\nIceland. The United Nations recently estimated that Gaza\nwill no longer be livable by 2020 unless urgent action\nis taken to improve water and power supplies, health\nand basic education. The deplorable living conditions\ndescribed in that report demonstrate only too well that\nthe situation in Palestine is unacceptable to anyone\nwho has respect for human dignity. I have visited Gaza\nmyself. I met with fishermen who are not allowed to go\nfishing in the waters out of Gaza. As an old fisherman\nmyself, that hurts my heart. l met children in Gaza\nwhose lives are made impossible by poverty, violence\nand a blockade that others have described as an open-\ndoor prison. I have seen for myself how the human rights\nof the people of the West Bank are violated every day\nby a man-made barrier that cuts through their roads,\ntheir lands and their lives.\nWhen I was in Qalqilya, the words of a former\nstatesman we all know rang in my head. Mr. Netanyahu,\ntear down this wall! I also know that the Israeli people\nare just like the rest of us. They want to live in peace,\nand they deserve it. The best way to ensure that is a\ntwo-State solution, which would benefit not only the\nPalestinian people but the Israeli people as well.\nI had the pleasure of listening to Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s\nspeech on Thursday (see A/67/PV.12), and I have a\ncomment to make on behalf of the Icelandic people:\nDo not bomb Iran. Not this year, not next year. Do\nnot start another war in the Middle East. At the same\ntime, I say to President Ahmadinejad and the Iranian\nleadership: do not build a bomb. Let diplomacy work,\nnot rabble-rousing or fear-mongering. Let us work for\npeace together.\nWe have seen fundamental changes break forth\nwith the Arab Spring, as demonstrated by democratic\nelections. Democracy only matures and gets better\nwith time, and the Arab Spring is just beginning. In a\ndemocracy everyone has a place and a role. As friends\nand supporters we urge everyone to ensure that the\nArab Spring will advance the rights of all people,\nworking towards societies characterized by democracy\nand social justice, where our sisters in the Arab world\nare allowed to thrive in the same way as our brothers,\nand where women and men enjoy equal rights.\nSadly, there is no spring in Syria. Thousands\nof innocent people, not least innocent children, are\nlosing their lives because of an oppressive regime. The\ninternational community must make a stronger and\nbetter effort to seek a political and peaceful solution for\nthe sake of those children and the people of Syria. We\nmust also ensure that those who commit atrocities, on\nboth sides, will at the end of the day account for their\nactions in an international court of law.\nThe Syrian problem is also a wake-up call for the\nUnited Nations with regard to the Security Council.\nSyria has demonstrated how archaic the Council is, and\nhow out of tune with the needs of the modern world.\nThe truth is that the Security Council has become an\nobstacle to the international efforts to address and solve\nsituations such as that in Syria. We must reform it so\nas to make it a tool for, not a hindrance to, progress in\nsituations such as that in Syria this year, or as we saw\nlast year concerning the Palestinian application.\nLet me also add on behalf of the Icelandic people\nthat we must always oppose terrorism and violence in\nany form. I think that we should all unite in condemning\nthe ghastly murder of the American Ambassador in\nLibya recently. Our embassies, our tools to work for the\npeople for peace, must always be inviolable.\nIceland is an open and embracing society, and our\nforeign policy is based on human rights for everyone.\nFrom the point of view of human rights, it is not\nacceptable that anyone is persecuted or mistreated\nbecause of her or his sexual orientation or gender\nidentity. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights\nguarantees equal treatment and non-discrimination to\nall people, and we, the community of nations, must\nensure that equal treatment in every sense of that\nword extends as well to sexual orientation and gender\nidentity. Let us not forget that we all, every human\nbeing, are sparks from the same sun.\nSmall countries can be global pioneers. Iceland\ndemonstrated that by breaking the ice for the recognition\nof the Baltic States, by introducing geothermal energy\nas an alternative in the world\u2019s quest for clean power,\nand by leading by example in the fight for gender\nequality.\nI am quite happy to relate that now, on this very\nmorning, Iceland is embarking on a pioneering\nprogramme regarding clean renewable energy for up\nto 150 million Africans. Iceland has ensured funds\nto work with the World Bank to assist 13 countries of\nthe East African Rift Valley to identify, research and\nprepare their considerable geothermal resources for\nutilization. That will be the greatest and most historic\nproject Iceland ever has cooperated on with developing\ncountries. I can express the feeling today that Iceland is\nvery proud of it.\n\nput our expertise in geothermal energy to use in East\nAfrica, we are also protecting the environment of our\nown neighbourhood, the Arctic. The ice is melting at\na pace far greater than we ever anticipated. We do not\nneed to be prophets to predict that in the Arctic vast\nareas will open, and sooner rather than later, for new\ntransport routes between continents and for production\nof oil and gas. Of course, that may bring immense\ncommercial benefits to the people living in and around\nthe Arctic. But we are also acutely aware of the dangers\nto the fragile Arctic ecosystem and to the traditional\nlivelihood of Arctic peoples. I tell the Assembly today\nthat we have to tread very carefully in the Arctic. It is\nin the interest of all nations to ensure that the Arctic\nCouncil becomes strong enough to provide, in the\nfuture, the forum for shaping important decisions on\ncommon interests of all the Arctic peoples.\nTimes have been pretty tough in Iceland in recent\nyears. In the recession in Europe, we were the first\ncountry down, but we were also the first country up.\nIf there is any lesson to be drawn from the Icelandic\nrecovery, it is that austerity does not work on its own.\nIceland certainly went through its share of austerity,\nbut we also raised taxes, especially on the wealthiest\ncitizens, and we used the revenue to stimulate growth\nand ensure that the welfare system was intact. Today,\nIceland has some of the lowest unemployment in\nEurope and robust economic growth. The Icelandic\nmodel works.\nPerhaps the best sign that Iceland is back in\nbusiness is the fact that while the global recession\nhas, sadly, led to a decline in international support for\ndeveloping countries, Iceland is bucking that trend. We\nare increasing ours substantially.\nFinally, the first letters of the themes that I have\nbroached here today \u2014 Palestine, energy, the Arctic,\nclimate change and the economy \u2014 form the word we\nshould all hold dearest towards each other, whatever\nour differences, that is, peace."

        "file_text": "\ufeffThe rule of law is among the\ntopics before the sixty-seventh session of the General\nAssembly. This is an especially important issue,\nespecially for someone who has had the opportunity to\npersonally experience the lack of it. For many decades,\nHungary belonged to the Communist-Socialist bloc.\nBy 1949 the Communist takeover of power had been\ncompleted, just four years after the end of the Second\nWorld War. The multiparty system had been eliminated.\nThe majority of leaders of political parties established\nafter the war were forced into exile or were imprisoned.\nI was born 10 years later. I spent my early adult years,\nand thus the years of my political awakening as well,\nin a dictatorship. In fact, my two older children were\nborn under that political system. For our generation,\njust as for that of our parents, our everyday experience\nwas of being deprived of human rights and liberties.\nIndependence? From what, when Soviet troops kept\nHungary under occupation? Free elections? How, when\npolitical parties were non-existent and, even at late as\n1988, it was a crime against the State to form political\norganizations.\nConstitutional freedoms, such as the freedom of\nspeech, the right of assembly and the right to practice\nreligion freely, existed only on paper or not even on\nthat. The end of the 1980s and the fall of the Berlin Wall\nand of the Iron Curtain, brought democratic changes to\nHungary as well. It was in the spring of 1990, more than\n40 years later, that we could organize free elections\nagain. Preparations for the peaceful transition, and\nthen the post-election years, can be deemed to be a\nsuccessful period from the perspective of the rule of\nlaw.\nHungary, however, did not have a new, consolidated\nConstitution that was not unlike the 1949 Constitution,\neasily revealed through the number in its title. It was\nthat shortfall that the Hungarian National Assembly\nrectified in April 2011, when it decided to adopt the new\nfundamental law of Hungary. What is now the youngest\nConstitution of Europe incorporates almost all elements\nof the European Convention on Human Rights, along\nwith the rule-of-law institutions safeguarding the\nchecks and balances established in 1990. As a new\nelement, constitutional constraints compliant with the\nrule of law have been imposed to curb irresponsible\npublic spending and the reckless increase of State\nindebtedness.\n\nThe new Constitution of Hungary provides\nguarantees for the fulfilment of international legal\nobligations and for compliance and adherence to the\ngenerally accepted rules of international law. It is\nimportant to point out that numerous new provisions,\nwhich concern the new, so-called fourth generation of\nbasic rights, have been included in the new fundamental\nlaw.\nArticle P of the Constitution stipulates that:\n\u201cAll natural resources, especially agricultural\nland, forests and drinking water supplies,\nbiodiversity \u2014 in particular native plant and animal\nspecies \u2014 and cultural assets shall form part of\nthe nation\u2019s common heritage, and the State and\nevery person shall be obliged to protect, sustain and\npreserve them for future generations\u201d.\nWhereas Article XXI sets forth that:\n\u201cHungary shall recognise and enforce the right\nof every person to a healthy environment. A person\nwho causes any damage to the environment shall be\nobliged to restore it or to bear all costs of restoration\nas defined by law.\n\u201cNo pollutant waste shall be brought into\nHungary for the purpose of dumping\u201d.\nEnvironmental protection, the preservation of\nnatural values, the protection of soil, air and water\nquality \u2014 how much time have we spent talking about\nthem recently? Due to the limited time alloted, permit\nme to highlight only a single issue from the larger set\nof problems before us, namely, the issue of water and\nsanitation. It is even more important to mention it here\nbecause, as a result of our common decision, nex year\nhas been designated as the International Year of Water\nCooperation.\nWe can truly appreciate the adequate quantity\nand quality of water if we experience what it means\nto be deprived of it, whatever the reason \u2014 pollution,\noverconsumption or environmental, changes. During\nrecent years, a great variety of studies have been\npublished about our irresponsible behaviour, about\nthe short-sighted, and may I say, foolish, attitude with\nwhich we are polluting our waters. Allow me to cite\njust a few findings from these documents. Ninety per\ncent of all communal wastewater and 70 per cent of\nindustrial wastewater in countries of the developing\nworld is discharged into rivers without any treatment\nwhatsoever. The chemical revolution of the era following the Second World War also has had seriously adverse\nimplications on the environment. Industry nowadays\nhas been using about 12,000 different types of toxic\nchemicals, while a single drop of crude oil can render\n25 litres of drinking water non-potable. Manufacturing\na single vehicle requires 148,000 1itres of industrial\nwater. The toilet culture of nearly 2 billion people is\nstill not adequate today.\nWhat are the consequences? Polluted and toxic\nlakes, lifeless streams of water reminiscent of rivers\nonly by their names. Instead, they are stinking\nindustrial canals. The consequences are that there is\nnot enough water around to meet the everyday needs of\nhuman consumption. Today, more than 1 billion people\ndo not have access to clean, potable water. Another\nconsequence, according to a 2009 UNICEF study, is\nthat serious diseases, spread by polluted water and the\nlack sanitation, have been killing young children at a\npace equivalent to that of a Boeing 747 airplane packed\nwith young children crashing every four hours.\nI could continue to list dramatic examples and\nserious consequences of the lack of sanitation, but let\nus ask ourselves the question: if everything were all\nright with wastewater management, would it mean that\neverything was also all right with respect to our water\nmanagement, water treatment and protection of our\nwater basins? Unfortunately, the answer is no.\nWater management today requires international\ncooperation. It is indispensable. Half of the Earth\u2019s\npopulation lives in so-called shared, or joint, water\ncatchment areas. The same river provides the water\nsupplies for two, three or more countries. Cooperation\nbetween such countries is a daily obligation. Absence\nof such cooperation could lead to supply, social, health\nor even war-related tensions. Nearly 1.5 billion people\nlive in river basins, where water usage is larger than the\nminimum extent of water replenishment, which leads to\nthe exhaustion of water reserves.\nAt least two thirds of European cities with a\npopulation of 100,000 or more people are using their\nwater resources faster than they can be replenished. It\nis true that the standards are set high in agriculture,\nespecially if the agricultural sector wishes to produce\nadequate supplies of food for a further 2.5 billion\npeople by 2050. That is especially true if we consider\nthat currently it takes about 140 1itres of water to\nproduce one cupful of coffee or about 15,000 1itres for\n1 kilogram of beef.\n\nWe have been aware of these figures for years. But\nwhat is knowledge worth if we do not put it to use? Why\ndo we wait for nature to remind us again and again of\nour grave irresponsibility? Hungary assesses the issue\nof water and sanitation to be one of the most important\nquestions of the twenty-first century. During recent\nyears, we have been active participants in the friends of\nwater working group, created under the auspices of the\nUnited Nations. I think we will have ample work waiting\nfor us during the coming years as well. We are ready\nand willing to share our knowledge and experience.\nWe are also looking forward to welcoming everyone\ninterested to the conference on water and sanitation to\nbe organized in Budapest next autumn."

        "file_text": "\ufeffAllow me very brief ly\nto address what are, in our opinion, some of the most\nimportant items on the agenda of this session of the\nGeneral Assembly. First of all, today, in this century\nof globalization and rapidly changing situations and\ngrowing tensions and confrontations in many regions\nof the world, we need to come up with unconventional\nand extraordinary responses to crisis situations and\nwars that have been ongoing for many decades and are\ntherefore persistent features of our agenda.\nTo our great regret, instead of seeking to deeply\nunderstand emerging problems and confrontations in\none region of the world or another and addressing them\nin a timely manner, finding their true origins or focusing\nthe international community on preventing them from\ngrowing into large-scale crises and wars, the world\nis letting its most precious resource \u2014 time \u2014 slip\nthrough its fingers. That leads, of course, to enormous\ncosts and the waste of other precious resources. Let me\noffer a few examples.\nAs early as in 1993, President Karimov of the\nRepublic of Uzbekistan, when he spoke before the\nforty-eighth session of the General Assembly (see\nA/48/PV.6), drew the international community\u2019s\nattention to the need to immediately resolve the situation\nin Afghanistan, given the close connection between\nregional and global security, the need to respect the civil\nand religious rights of the people of Afghanistan and the\nneed to prevent the conflict from growing into a full-\nscale civil war. Otherwise the problems in Afghanistan\nwould turn into a painful and bitter issue of concern\nto the international community as a whole. Difficult\nproblems may resurface when the imminent withdrawal\nof the International Security Assistance Forces from\nAfghanistan occurs by late 2014 and the responsibility\nfor ensuring stability in the country is turned over to\nthe newly created Afghan National Security Forces. It\nis obvious today that that turn of events may lead to a\nstand-off between opposing forces in Afghanistan itself\nand in neighbouring countries. It may also lead to the\ngrowth of extremism and radicalism, cause a surge in drug trafficking and aggravate tensions in the region\nas whole.\nAs the situation is unfolding, the best way to\naddress the situation in Afghanistan is to establish a\ncontact group under the auspices of the United Nations\nwith the participation of the country\u2019s neighbours,\nthe United States, NATO and the Russian Federation.\nThe principal goal of such efforts should be to reach a\ncompromise and an agreement between the opposing\nforces and form a coalition Government on that basis.\nSuch a coalition Government could be comprised of\nthe core ethnic, national and religious groups involved\nin the military and political stand-off taking place in\nAfghanistan.\nUzbekistan has suggested that approach a number\nof times, for example, at the NATO summits in\nBucharest in 2008 and in Chicago this year, as well as\nat the High-level Plenary Meeting on the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals held in New York in 2010 (see\nA/65/PV.3). The Republic of Uzbekistan has always\nconducted, and will always maintain, a friendly, good-\nneighbourly policy towards its neighbour Afghanistan.\nUzbekistan has built its relationship with Afghanistan\non a bilateral basis, taking into account the national\ninterests of both countries and respecting the Afghan\npeople\u2019s choice in terms of the future of their country.\nToday, Uzbekistan offers comprehensive forms of\nassistance to Afghanistan so that it may return once\nagain to peace. Specifically, we have contributed\nto the construction of bridges, motorways and the\nstrategic Khairaton-Mazar-e-Sharif railroad link,\nwhich connects Afghanistan with the States of Central\nAsia, as well as providing an uninterrupted supply\nof electricity to Kabul. Uzbekistan plays a key role\nin ensuring the stable and effective operation of the\nnorthern distribution network.\nSecondly, climate change and the global\ndeteriorating ecological situation have made ensuring\nthe reasonable and rational use of water resources the\nmost acute problem of the modern world. Increasing\nshortages of fresh water, which is needed to provide\nfood security and protect human life, serve to confirm\nthat assertion. In that connection, I would like to\npresent the Republic of Uzbekistan\u2019s main approach to\naddressing those issues, which are of vital importance\nfor all the States of Central Asia.\nWe believe that all water and energy issues in our\nregion, where the largest transboundary rivers \u2014 the Amu Darya and the Syr Darya \u2014 are the main sources\nof water and life for the millions of people residing\nnear them, should be addressed in accordance with\nthe universally recognized norms of international law\nprovided for in the 1992 United Nations Convention on\nthe Protection and Use of Transboundary Watercourses\nand International Lakes and the 1997 United Nations\nConvention on the Law of the Non-navigational Uses of\nInternational Watercourses.\nThose instruments require adherence to the\nprinciple of doing no harm to the environment or to\nthe interests of neighbouring States when exploiting the\nresources of transboundary rivers.\nIt is therefore reasonable that Uzbekistan calls for\nthose principles and standards to be our guides in the\nsearch for mutually acceptable compromise decisions\non water use. We believe that all hydropower facility\nconstruction projects in the upper waters of the Syr\nDarya and Amu Darya basins should be evaluated by\ninternational experts under the auspices of the United\nNations and agreed to by the downstream countries.\nOnly after such agreement and coordination should\nconstruction begin on two proposed dams, which\nare practically the largest in the world, namely, the\n350-metre-high Rogun hydropower station in the upper\nwaters of the Amu Darya and the 275-metre-high\nKambarata 1 station in the upper waters of the Syr\nDarya. Furthermore, that construction has to be carried\nout in mountainous terrain where seismicity levels can\nreach 9 to 10 points on the Richter scale.\nTo comply with international requirements, it is\nessential to set priorities for water use. The region\u2019s\nlimited water resources must first be used to meet\ndrinking and sanitary needs, and only after that to\nensure food security and to meet ecological demands\nand the needs of the industry and power sectors.\nThirdly, Uzbekistan remains committed to\npreserving peace, stability and security in the region.\nThat principled position is stipulated in the Republic of\nUzbekistan\u2019s position paper on foreign policy activity,\nformulated on the initiative of the Head of State of\nUzbekistan. In particular, the document includes the\nfollowing important provisions.\nFirst, the Republic of Uzbekistan reserves the right\nto enter into alliances, join commonwealths and other\ninter-State establishments, as well as to leave them,\nguided by the supreme interests of the State, the people,\ntheir well-being and security, the priority guidelines for modernizing the country, existing national legislation\nand international obligations that have been assumed.\nThe paper continues, stating that Uzbekistan maintains\na peace-loving policy, does not participate in military-\npolitical blocs, and reserves the right to leave any\ninter-State body if the latter is transformed into a\nmilitary-political bloc. Next, the Republic of Uzbekistan\nwill take political, economic and other measures to\nprevent its involvement in military conflicts or hotbeds\nof tension in adjacent States and will not allow the\ndeployment of foreign bases and facilities on its own\nterritory. Next, the armed forces of the Republic of\nUzbekistan will not participate in military operations\nabroad. Finally, the main priority concern of the foreign\npolicy of Uzbekistan is the region of Central Asia,\nwhere the country\u2019s crucial interests lie.\nThe problems of Central Asia must be addressed\nby the countries of the region without interference\nfrom external Powers. Uzbekistan remains committed\nto pursuing an open, friendly and pragmatic policy\ntowards its immediate neighbours, and proceeds from\na position that all outstanding political, economic and\necological problems of the region should be addressed\non the basis of the mutual consideration of interests,\nconstructive dialogue and the norms of international\nlaw.\nWe set great store by the United Nations as a\nuniversal structure and the only worldwide, universally\naccepted body capable of ensuring security, stability\nand consistent development, including in our region.\nUzbekistan stands ready to continue to cooperate\neffectively with the Organization and its specialized\nbodies in order to achieve those high and noble goals."

        "file_text": "\ufeffWe are convening\nin this Assembly at a time when we are witnessing a\nworrisome phenomenon, namely, senseless violence\nspreading through an entire region as a result of a\nsenseless offence to religious feelings. More than any\nother organization, the United Nations stands for the\nideals of tolerance, understanding and mutual respect.\nA strong message should therefore emerge from this\ndebate. The hateful slander of people on the basis of\ntheir culture or religion is unacceptable. It is an abuse\nof the right to freedom of expression. However, we\nmust emphasize just as clearly that violence cannot be\njustified by insults, however understandable the outrage\nmay be. Such ongoing events also tell us that we must\nreach many more people in our effort to promote the\nvalues of the United Nations around the globe.\nWhen we last met, a year ago, we heard many calls\nfrom this rostrum to bring an end to the crisis in Syria.\nSince then, the violence has turned into a civil war\nthat puts the United Nations to shame. We have seen\nopen division in the Security Council and little interest\nby the parties to the conflict in a United Nations-led\nmediation. Instead, the situation on the ground has\nfurther escalated. The entire region is now threatened\nwith instability. The blatant disregard for the lives and\nrights of civilians, of women and children in particular,\nis simply shocking.\nIt is a crisis with profound and lasting effects for\nthe three main pillars of the United Nations: peace and\nsecurity, development, and human rights. It is therefore\nalso an existential challenge for this Organization. The\nUnited Nations is only as effective as its political organs\nallow it to be. The crisis must therefore make us think\nin general terms about the lessons we should learn.\nThe situation in Syria is clearly of burning concern\nto the membership as a whole as a human security crisis\nand a threat to international peace and security. At the\nsame time, the Security Council is unable to carry out\nits tasks under the Charter because of disagreement\namong its permanent members. It is therefore essential\nthat the General Assembly step in and play a more\nactive role, as it has done on some occasions. That is\nall the more important as we are confronted by the\nfailure to fulfil the responsibility to protect a civilian\npopulation \u2014 a principle adopted in this Hall at the\nhighest political level.\nThe stalemate in the Council demonstrates that we\nmust look at the way in which the veto power is and can be used. In that respect, there must be accountability\nvis-\u00e0-vis the membership of the Organization as a\nwhole. After all, the Council carries out its work on\nbehalf of us all. We call upon the permanent members\nto acknowledge that the United Nations Charter does\nnot grant them the right to the veto without any strings\nattached. We ask them to acknowledge that the Council\nmust at all times act in accordance with the purposes\nand principles of the United Nations. We therefore\nrequest that they pledge not to use the veto to block\nCouncil action aimed at preventing or ending genocide,\ncrimes against humanity or war crimes.\nClearly, the main priority is to end the suffering of\nthe Syrian people and to bring about a political solution\nthat guarantees human security and stability for the\nregion. However, we also have an obligation to ensure\nthat there is no impunity for the worst crimes under\ninternational law and that those who have the greatest\nresponsibility do not get away with murder.\nThe evidence before us is alarming. The independent\ninternational commission of inquiry on the Syrian Arab\nRepublic, established by the Human Rights Council,\ncame to clear conclusions. The primary responsibility\nto ensure accountability falls, of course, on the Syrian\njudiciary. But we can be under no illusions as to whether\nit will deliver justice to the victims and due process\nto all accused. We therefore join Switzerland in the\ncall to the Council to refer the situation in Syria to the\nInternational Criminal Court (ICC) (see A/67/PV.7).\nBut we also ask the Council to fully support such a\nreferral in order to ensure cooperation and not to put up\nany obstacles to the appropriate financing of the Court\u2019s\nwork. Without those two prerequisites, referrals are a\nmixed blessing and problematic for the ICC.\nThis year, we also commemorate the tenth\nanniversary of the International Criminal Court. We\nare looking at the history of an astonishing success.\nWho would have thought that the Court\u2019s membership\nwould near two thirds of the membership of the United\nNations in such a short time? Who would have predicted\nthat the Security Council would make referrals to the\nICC on two occasions \u2014 once even by unanimous vote?\nAnd who would have expected the Court to emerge\nfrom political controversy as a stronger institution?\nThose are remarkable achievements that we can be\nproud of. Nevertheless, the next decade is also fraught\nwith challenges. We have been strongly united in\nsetting up the Court and getting it under way. Now that it is fully operational, we must more than ever support\nit politically. I therefore launched a ministerial-level\ninitiative to support the ICC earlier this week. I was\nvery encouraged by the strong response to my call for\ncoordinated action when needed.\nIn adopting the Rome Statute, we have not just set\nup an international tribunal located in The Hague. We\nhave also created a global system to fight impunity,\nwhich assigns a strong role to States. It also offers\nthe Security Council an important role, if it chooses\nto play it. Political support is particularly required\nwhere investigations are based on referrals from\nthe Security Council. The obligation for the State in\nquestion to cooperate is based entirely on the Security\nCouncil\u2019s authority, not on the Rome Statute. The\nCouncil must therefore play a key role in ensuring that\nsuch cooperation is forthcoming. We as States are also\nresponsible for ensuring that indicted individuals are\narrested and transferred to the Court. Clearly, we must\ndo better in that regard.\nWe are also being given a historic opportunity both\nfor the Court and for the United Nations: for the first\ntime since the end of the Second World War, we can\nenable an international tribunal to prosecute the crime\nof aggression.\nThe prohibition of the illegal use of force is at the\ncore of the Charter of the United Nations, and aggression\nhas been considered a crime under international law for\ndecades. But the consensual adoption of the Kampala\namendments to the Rome Statute allows us to put that\nprinciple into practice. Leaders that consider resorting\nto the illegal use of force will be put on notice, once\n30 States parties have ratified the amendments and\nonce we have activated them in 2017. I am proud of the\nfact that Liechtenstein, following its presidency of the\nReview Conference, was the first State to ratify the\namendments, on 8 May this year. We chose the date\nas a tribute to the commemoration of the end of the\nSecond World War in Europe. We have also launched\nan initiative to support the ratification process that is\nunder way.\nI would therefore encourage all current and future\nparties to the Rome Statute to ratify the Kampala\namendments as soon as possible. Together we can take\nthis big step forward in the history of international law.\nCriminalizing the illegal use of force between\nStates would be a very significant step forward in the\npromotion of the rule of law at the international level. The rule of law is rightfully moving to the centre of\nour attention. We have illustrated this fact by holding\na high-level meeting on this topic earlier this week.\nThe rule of law permeates many of the activities we\npursue here at the United Nations. Indeed, there can\nbe no lasting security, no sustainable development\nand no effective protection of human rights without\nthe rule of law. We therefore look forward to a strong\nrule-of-law dimension in the sustainable development\ngoals resulting from the United Nations Conference on\nSustainable Development.\nThe Conference resulted in a number of important\nagreements. It also illustrated the value of inclusive and\ntransparent multilateralism, especially when compared\nwith other, more exclusive decision-making processes.\nThis serves as a reminder of the need to reconcile\nseemingly competing interests in international\ndecision-making: transparency and inclusiveness on\nthe one side, and efficiency and effectiveness on the\nother.\n\nMultilateral decision-making is efficient when there\nis sufficient political will. It is effective when it has the\nlegitimacy necessary to ensure full implementation.\nWe must revert to considering the universality and\nopenness of the General Assembly as key assets, not\nas a weakness. The Assembly must reaffirm its unique\nand central role in global governance, including in the\neconomic dimension. I welcome the strong commitment\nof President Jeremi\u0107, expressed at the beginning of this\nsession, to work for genuine multilateralism and, to that\nend, to reach a new level of engagement. I assure him of\nour full support in this endeavour.\nThere must be accountability for decisions of global\nimpact before the Assembly or before other relevant\nand universally accessible bodies. To achieve that aim,\nwe will build on the progress made in recent years in\nthe framework of the Global Governance Group. The\nGroup has become a trusted bridge-builder in these\nmatters. We hope that this issue will become one of the\nhighlights of Mr. Jeremi\u0107\u2019s presidency.\nLet me conclude with some remarks about an issue\nthat is particularly dear to my heart. I am convinced that\nthe inclusion of the whole population, men and women\nalike, is essential to the stability and peaceful and\nprosperous development of nations. Since becoming\nForeign Minister, I have tried to make use of the relevant\ninternational platforms to promote the advancement  women. I also hope to bring Liechtenstein\u2019s expertise\nand passion for women\u2019s issues to the Commission on\nthe Status of Women during the term 2015-2019.\nI am grateful to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon\nfor his leadership in this area. UN-Women, headed so\ncharismatically by Michelle Bachelet, has given a much-\nneeded additional boost to our efforts. If we continue\non our path, then the United Nations can be the decisive\ndriving force for gender equality worldwide. Until then,\nwe can and must do much more, in particular in the area\nof women, peace and security. Stronger protection of\nwomen, both legal and otherwise, in situations where\nthey are particularly prone to becoming victims is a key\ncomponent. The United Nations, with its very strong\nfield presence all over the world, can make a unique\ncontribution to that end. But most importantly, the\nUnited Nations must lead by example when it comes\nto gender equality and the advancement of women.\nWe must make the best use of their talents, skills and\nexperiences as peacemakers, as agents for sustainable\ndevelopment and as advocates for human rights and the\nrule of law. As is well known, the future is female.\nOnly when women are fully included will we, the\nUnited Nations, be successful in pursuing our goals."

        "file_text": "\ufeffWe would like to\ncongratulate Mr. Vuk Jeremi\u0107 on his election as\nPresident of the General Assembly at its sixty-seventh\nsession.\n\nOur world is afflicted by new political, economic\nand social turmoil that has disrupted the peaceful\ncoexistence of the peoples of the world and reduced\nthe quality of life for millions of human beings. New\nneocolonial wars have been launched aimed at seizing\nthe natural resources of developing countries.\nThe proponents of capitalism, while attempting to\novercome the deep economic crisis that has affected\nthe global financial system, have been resorting to new\nimperialistic strategies and overexploiting workers,\nincluding those in developing countries. The social\nwelfare State and the social achievements attained\nafter the Second World War are now in the process of\nbeing dismantled. The new imperialists have sought\nto transfer responsibility for the crisis to those born in\nother countries and to immigrants, whereas the current\neconomic crisis was caused primarily by financial\nspeculators. Social policies are gradually being reduced\nor eliminated. The middle class has been growing poor.\nHunger, poverty and unemployment are reappearing in\nthe developed countries and are spreading around the\nworld. Suffering and despair are increasing.\nMeanwhile, Latin America and the Caribbean have\nmanaged to tackle, with relative success, the impact\nof those global economic and financial imbalances.\nThe United Nations Economic Commission for Latin\nAmerica and the Caribbean reports that the economies\nin our region have had a significant rebound beginning\nin 2010, which enabled our region to mitigate the\neffects of the 2008 to 2009 crisis. Latin America and\nthe Caribbean are well positioned on the world stage,\nthanks to the strengthening of initiatives in the area of\nregional integration, designed to strengthen political\nand economic autonomy. Therefore, the domination\nthat the imperial Powers and their multinationals have\nimposed on developing countries is gradually being\novercome.\nThe Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our\nAmerica is a new coordination mechanism for dialogue\nguided by cooperation, complementarity and solidarity\namong sovereign nations. It represents an alternative\nfor the liberation and independence of our countries.\nThe Community of Latin American and Caribbean\nStates (CELAC) and the Union of South American\nNations (UNASUR) are regional spaces of multilateral\ncooperation aimed at strengthening the unity of Latin\nAmerica and the Caribbean and are constructing\na multipolar, balanced and just world in which the sovereign equality of States will prevail as well as a\nculture of peace in a world free of nuclear weapons and\nof weapons of mass destruction. CELAC and UNASUR\nhave inspired social and human development, with\nequity and inclusion, and seek to eradicate poverty\nand overcome inequalities in the region. In Latin\nAmerica and the Caribbean, we are seeing a new type\nof regionalism that is being promoted by diplomatic\nsolidarity.\nToday, the unipolar system of imperial domination\nis in crisis. A pluripolar and multi-centred system has\nbeen coming into being, in which emerging countries\nand new regional blocs are able to contribute to the\ndemocratization of international relations. Meanwhile,\nthe imperial Powers have been promoting, within the\nUnited Nations, a new regulatory framework enabling\nforeign intervention in the internal affairs of States,\ntrying to get States to give up their sovereignty, political\nindependence and self-determination. Those Powers\nhave become the judges, jurors and administrators of\ninternal conflicts in the countries of the South, resorting\nto interventionist initiatives that are conceived here\nat the United Nations and implemented through the\nSecurity Council.\nA new international order, truly based on the legal\nequality of States, is an imperative demand. Reform of\nthe United Nations is necessary. The Security Council\nmust become more democratic if it wishes to express\nthe will of all nations. The General Assembly is\nbegging for revitalization, and the Secretary-General\nshould be elected democratically, by all Member States.\nInternational peace and security cannot be built on the\nbasis of privileges for a few.\nThe international financial architecture that\nemerged at Bretton Woods is anti-democratic. The\nGeneral Assembly and the Economic and Social\nCouncil are never taken into account when decisions\nare made on vital economic and financial matters that\naffect all of humankind. Reform of the global economic\nand financial system must be addressed in the United\nNations, and all countries should have an equal voice\nin the search for solutions to problems related to\ndevelopment.\nIn Syria we are following the same interventionist\nscript that was applied in Libya. Imperial Powers are\nfomenting ethnic, political and religious divisions\nbetween Syrians and between Syria and its neighbours.\nThey are shamelessly supplying weapons to the rebel forces in an attempt to overthrow the Government of\nthat Arab country. Venezuela supports the peace efforts\nbeing made by the Joint Special Representative of the\nUnited Nations and the League of Arab States for Syria,\nMr. Lakhdar Brahimi. We should encourage political\ndialogue between Syrians, but we reject foreign\nintervention and the deadly policy of regime change.\nWe support the positions of Russia, China and other\ncountries on the issue; they demand that the Security\nCouncil respect the territorial unity and integrity of the\nSyrian State. The Non-Aligned Movement can play a\nproactive role in helping to solve that crisis.\nThe Bolivarian Government reaffirms its support\nfor the existence of a Palestinian State, independent\nand sovereign, within internationally recognized\nborders, in accordance with the relevant resolutions of\nthe Security Council and the General Assembly. We\nalso reiterate our support for Palestine\u2019s admission as\na State Member of the United Nations with full rights.\nWe are concerned about the warmongering threats\nof the Governments of Israel and the United States\nagainst Iran. A military attack on that Persian nation\nwould have fatal consequences for world peace. We\nrecognize the sovereign right of the Islamic Republic of\nIran to develop nuclear energy for peaceful purposes.\nRespect for cultures and religions ensures the\npeaceful coexistence of the human beings who populate\nour planet. Within the crisis of capitalism, we have\nonce again seen a resurgence in Western countries of\nracial hatred, xenophobia and hostility to other cultures\nand religions. The reprehensible video against the great\nProphet Muhammad and Islam has naturally provoked\nprotests among Muslim peoples. Such anti-Islamic\nexpressions are not random; they are part of a political\nand ideological climate that fosters hatred against those\nwho are different.\nWe deplore the fact that freedom of speech is being\nused to offend religions and denigrate religious prophets.\nWhat are the limits of the freedom of expression? Is it an\nabsolute freedom that allows one to besmirch people\u2019s\ndeepest beliefs and religious feelings? Venezuela\nrejects exhibitions of xenophobia against Muslims and\nsupports dialogue between cultures and civilizations\naimed at promoting peace and brotherhood among\nhuman beings. At the same time, we call for respect for\nthe inviolability of diplomatic premises and the dignity\nof human life.  The United States continues to maintain its criminal\neconomic and financial blockade of the fraternal people\nof Cuba. Venezuela emphasizes its solidarity with the\nGovernment of the Republic of Cuba and demands an\nend to that unilateral coercive measure. It is ironic that\na country that practices State terrorism and shelters\nthe well-known terrorist Lu\u00eds Posada Carriles includes\nCuba on its list of countries that support terrorism.\nWe demand that Cuba be removed from that arbitrary\nclassification, whose sole purpose is to justify the\neconomic, commercial and financial embargo against\nits people.\nVenezuela appreciates all efforts on the part of the\nUnited Nations to improve its mediation capabilities in\ncrisis situations that could have negative consequences\nfor international peace and stability. The United Nations\nshould act in a neutral and impartial fashion, with a\nview to strengthening its ability to mediate in cases in\nwhich it is voluntarily and expressly requested to do so\nby the parties involved in international conflicts. The\ncountries of Latin America and the Caribbean have\nvery valuable experience in the use of dialogue and\nmediation for the settlement of disputes. The Rio Group\nmade a major contribution in helping to end the terrible\narmed conflicts in Central America in recent years, and\nUNASUR has also helped to prevent and settle disputes\nin our region.\nVenezuela welcomes the announcement made by\nthe President of Colombia, Mr. Juan Manuel Santos,\nthat negotiations will begin between his Government\nand the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia\n(FARC), with a view to achieving stable and lasting\npeace. Venezuela, Cuba, Chile and Norway are\ntaking part in the dialogue process as supporters, by\nagreement between the Colombian authorities and\nFARC. The Bolivarian Government is backing peace\nand reconciliation for the Colombian people.\nVenezuela supports the Republic of Argentina\u2019s\nright of sovereignty over the Malvinas Islands, the\nSouth Georgia Islands and the South Sandwich Islands,\nand the surrounding maritime areas. We reiterate our\ncall to the United Kingdom to begin talks with that\nfraternal South American country in order to arrive at\na negotiated and peaceful solution to that dispute.\nOn Sunday, 7 October, democratic elections will be\nheld in Venezuela to elect the President of the Republic.\nThey will be transparent and credible, because, as\nformer United States President Jimmy Carter said\na few days ago, we have the most modern electoral system in the world. Between 1999 and 2012 we have\nheld 14 clean national elections, a world record in\npolitical participation. We should issue a warning, here\nin this forum, that anti-democratic national elements,\nin alliance with foreign interests, are attempting to\nuse violence in order to subvert the will of the people.\nThe Venezuelan people are prepared, however, once\nagain to defend their democratic and revolutionary\nachievements.\nVenezuela needs a democratic opposition. Pluralism\nand diversity coexist in democracy. And peace is the\nonly path for the homeland of Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar. President\nHugo Ch\u00e1vez Fr\u00edas is guaranteeing the continuity of\nour sovereign and supportive foreign policy, focused\non improving Latin American and Caribbean unity,\nenhancing cooperation with the peoples of the South, and\nbuilding a multicentric and multipolar world, without\nimperial hegemonies. Similarly, he is guaranteeing the\ncontinuity of a national policy based on social justice.\nThe successes of the Bolivarian Revolution are\nevident. Venezuela has met the targets set by the\nMillennium Development Goals before 2015. The\nnumber of households in extreme poverty has fallen\ndramatically, from 21 per cent in 1998 to 7 per cent\nin 2010. Social investment in my country is among\nthe highest in the world. Venezuela has the highest\nminimum wage in Latin America and the Caribbean.\nAccording to the Gini coefficient, our country is the\nmost egalitarian in Latin America and the Caribbean.\nAccording to the Food and Agriculture Organization\nof the United Nations, we are ranked tenth among the\nbest-fed peoples in the world. We are the country with\nthe fifth-highest percentage of university enrolment\nin the world. Education and health care are free. All\nVenezuelans, without exception, have access to those\nrights.\nThose extraordinary achievements in economic,\nsocial and cultural rights have been attained in the\ncontext of a participatory democracy, in which civil\nand political rights are fully respected, as never before\nin our country\u2019s history. The Venezuelan people have\nregained their sovereignty and self-determination. A\nrevolution for freedom, justice and equality is under\nway. That is the Bolivarian revolution."

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt is timely that we are meeting\nhere over the next few days to seek ways and means\nto prevent and generally manage conflicts. While\nit may seem that conflict is perennial and its forms\nincreasingly destructive, we have the urgent task of\nseeking more effective ways to prevent, manage and\nsolve it. The losses we witness or experience on a\ndaily basis in terms of human life and devastation are\nunacceptable. Moreover, at a time when widespread\npoverty robs too many people of the opportunity to\nrealize their full potential in life, conflict also diverts\nus from development. We might ask ourselves why, after decades of\nefforts to rein in conflict on a global scale and foster\nmultilateral cooperation for sustainable peace, the\nresults are still not where they should be. The reasons\nfor this are several and multifaceted.\nFirst, we must appreciate that many conflicts arise\nwhen people are, or feel they are, excluded from full\nparticipation in the affairs of their country, particularly\naround issues that affect their everyday lives. Even\na cursory look at the conflict hotspots around the\nworld shows us the dangerous consequences of a\ndisenfranchised and despondent citizenry. Durable\nsolutions can come only from an inclusive approach to\nboth politics and development.\nSecondly, thorough analysis of the specific\npolitical and cultural contexts of any given conflict\nis key to finding lasting solutions. Too often, the\ninclination is to parachute into a situation with ready-\nmade answers based on a superficial examination of\nthe conflict\u2019s dynamics, doing considerably more\nharm than good, despite good intentions. There is\nno one-size-fits-all remedy; these issues are complex\nand should be approached as such to arrive at the best\npossible outcome.\nThirdly, the links between conflict and\ndevelopment are often overlooked. If we are looking\nfor peaceful ways to resolve and prevent conflicts,\npromoting development tops the list. The stakes are\nhigh. A civil conflict costs the average developing\ncountry about 30 years of gross domestic product\ngrowth, and violence can easily spill over borders, threatening hard-won progress. Since security and\ndevelopment cannot be achieved without each other, we\nall \u2014 from the average citizen to Government leaders\nand global institutions like the United Nations \u2014 have\nto play our roles in order to find inclusive solutions for\nlasting peace and prosperity.\nFinally, it is increasingly obvious that local or\nregional initiatives aimed at resolving conflicts yield\nmore positive results because those involved have\na deeper understanding of the issues at hand. Their\nproximity to the conflict makes them more invested in\na comprehensive resolution and enables the necessary\nsupport for whatever process is agreed upon. We need\nto see these initiatives strengthened. We should be\nhighlighting root causes as we address conflicts.\nIn the 50 years of our independence and\nmembership of the United Nations, Rwanda has lived\nthrough conflicts. Our country was destroyed by\npolitical exclusion and subsequent genocide. Over the\npast 18 years, we have been able to rebuild the country\nthrough policies that include all citizens in governance\nprocesses and by applying home-grown conflict\nresolution and development mechanisms.\nWhile our experience with the United Nations\nsince becoming a Member has been a mixed one, it\nhas taken on a positive trajectory in recent years, and\nwe are optimistic that it will remain there. The history\nof how conflicts have been handled in Rwanda, and\nindeed in our region, however, shows that improvement\nis needed. It is our obligation to point this out not in\norder to be critical, but because we subscribe to the\nideals and principles on which the United Nations was\nfounded. We can and should do better.\nRwanda remains committed to a more effective\nUnited Nations, particularly with respect to its work\ntowards a more peaceful, just and equitable world. We\nwill continue to contribute to various programmes for\ndevelopment and peace, from our role in promoting the\nMillennium Development Goals and supporting the\nBroadband Commission for Digital Development to our\ntroops participating in peacekeeping missions. We hope\nto contribute and participate even more going forward.\nLet me conclude by saying that although the\nchallenge to better prevent and resolve conflict may\nseem daunting, it remains ours to take on. When we see\nleaders work with the people in an inclusive manner;\nwhen development can proceed unhindered by conflict;\nwhen regional groupings take greater responsibility in tackling their own issues; and when international\ncooperation takes place in a spirit of true partnership,\nI believe that the results will speak for themselves\nand billions of lives across the globe will improve.\nUltimately, this is what we all should work towards."

        "file_text": "\ufeffFirst, I would like\nto express my sincere appreciation to His Excellency Mr. Al-Nasser for his dedication during his one-year\ntenure as President of the General Assembly, as well\nas to congratulate His Excellency Mr. Vuk Jeremi\u0107 on\nhis assumption of the presidency of the Assembly at\nits sixty-seventh session. I would also like to pay my\ndeep respect to His Excellency Secretary-General Ban\nKi-moon for his leadership.\nOne year ago, I started my speech on this rostrum by\nconveying our outpouring of appreciation to the world\n(see A/66/PV.19). It has been a year and a half since the\nGreat East Japan Earthquake in March 2011. The people\nin the affected areas are making strenuous efforts, with\nan unyielding spirit, to revive their hometowns. In order\nto respond to generous support from all over the world,\nwe, the Japanese, vowed before the souls of the victims\nto hand the lessons learned from the disaster down to\nsucceeding generations beyond our national borders.\nJapan will continue to share those lessons learned\nwith the world in order to build societies resilient to\nnatural disasters and to make concrete contributions to\nnuclear safety. The Fukushima Ministerial Conference\non Nuclear Safety, which is scheduled for the end of this\nyear, and is co-sponsored by the International Atomic\nEnergy Agency and the third World Conference on\nDisaster Reduction, which Japan plans to host in three\nyears, will also provide meaningful opportunities to\nshare those lessons.\nThe warning from nature brought on by the\nunprecedented earthquake and massive tsunami posed a\nmore fundamental question as to how we should sustain\nour civilization. From the moment of birth, human\nbeings transform their own wisdom into the power to\nsurvive harsh natural environments. Despite advanced\nscience and technology in modern civilization, however,\nthe forces of nature have reminded us how weak human\nbeings still are and that they have a fragile existence.\nThreats that may endanger human existence lie\nnot only in nature, but in advanced civilization itself.\nThere are a number of examples of those threats,\nsuch as environmental degradation, terrorism and the\nproliferation of nuclear weapons. What is required for\nthe human species to be able to keep its presence on\nEarth and continue to enjoy peace and prosperity? The\nanswer is clear: humans must become wiser.\nHumans have so far gained abundant knowledge.\nThe revolution in information and communication\ntechnology unfolding in front of us is further building\nup human knowledge on a geometric scale and at an exponential speed. Human wisdom seems to have\nimproved dramatically. However, is that really true? At\nthe forefront of a long human history, we are living in\na period of complicated and violent change. Tensions\namong nations have risen in many parts of the world,\nwith more uncertain prospects for the future. The real\ntest for our survival in this unprecedented period is not\nhow much knowledge and information we have, but to\nlearn the true value of the numerous pearls of wisdom\nwe have accumulated.\nOne of the first such pearls of wisdom humans\ngained was the power to give adequate thought to not\nonly the present, but also the future. It is also the power\nto imagine, beyond our own benefits, the benefits to\nfuture generations and the power to act on their behalf.\nAgricultural society, which prompted human beings to\nadopt a new vista, was made possible through the long-\nterm perspective towards the future that human beings\nacquired when they waited for the harvest instead of\nthinking solely about immediate concerns.\nNow is the time for us to exert our wisdom and\nbuild a sustainable future for the sake of succeeding\ngenerations. Many countries have built up massive\nfiscal deficits, therefore fiscal soundness is now\na common challenge. If people living now do not\novercome deficits by cutting spending and striving to\nincrease revenues, future generations will be forced to\nrepay the deficits.\nThat structure amounts to nothing but current\ngenerations exploiting future generations.\nDemocracy has been historically proven to be\nthe best political system. However, we now face\nthe enormous challenge of learning whether or not\ndemocracy can maintain fairness between generations\nacross the globe. Under the system of parliamentary\ndemocracy, today\u2019s representatives serve people living\nnow; there are no guarantees with respect to properly\nrepresenting the interests of future generations. The\ncurrent structure encourages politics that will burden\nsilent future generations by passing today\u2019s problems\nonto them.\nWe are all responsible for the next generations.\nThis generation must successfully meet the challenges\nbefore us, and today\u2019s political leaders must take\nresponsibility now for tomorrow.\nIn order to protect sound democratic societies,\nnow is the time to exert the power to think about the\nbenefits for future generations. Over the past 20-odd years, Japan repeatedly procrastinated in policies and\nwas considered a symbol of a country that delayed\ndecisions. I pledged to change all that and staked my\npolitical life on implementing a comprehensive reform\nof our social security and taxation systems.\nThat reform is an ambitious package of policies\ndeveloped to support Japan\u2019s social security system\nby maintaining a stable financial basis in the face\nof a rapidly aging population and by paving the way\nfor fiscal rehabilitation. It is a comprehensive reform\nprogramme that pursues both economic growth and\nfiscal reconstruction. Japan is taking a firm step\ntowards becoming a country that makes decisions\nwithout postponing difficult issues.\nAnother pearl of wisdom that humans acquired\ncame from the possibility of seeing the Earth we live on.\nI recently had the opportunity to communicate directly\nwith astronaut Akihiko Hoshide from my office while\nhe was orbiting the Earth in the International Space\nStation. At the time of our phone linkup, a female\nelementary school student who was in the office with\nus posed a riddle to the astronaut: \u201cThe Earth has air\nand gravity, but space does not,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat does\nspace have that the Earth does not?\u201d \u201cThe view of\nthe Earth from outside it\u201d, the astronaut replied. That\nconversation expressed in simple terms what I want to\nsay today.\nBecause we have attained the perspective of being\nable to see the Earth from outside, humankind as a\nwhole shares the sublime mission of protecting the\nglobal environment. We must always return to that\nperspective, reaching beyond borders and advancing\nconcrete measures to protect the Earth\u2019s environment,\nwhich is the a basis of human survival.\nWith the aim of protecting the global environment,\na significant outcome for sustainable development\nwas achieved at the United Nations Conference on\nSustainable Development (Rio+20) in June 2012. Japan\nannounced its green future initiatives, proposing that\nwe explore sustainable growth in prosperity without\nthe supply-demand crunch of natural resources and\nenergy or damage to the global environment. Japan\nwill implement a low carbon and sound material-cycle\nsociety and take the lead in solving the common energy\nchallenges facing the world. To that end, we need more\ninnovation in energy efficiency and renewable energy.\nIn the light of the accident at Tokyo Electric Power\nCompany\u2019s Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power station on\n11 March 2011, and with the goal of achieving a society not dependent on nuclear power by the 2030s, the\nGovernment of Japan will mobilize all possible policy\nresources to show the world a model that supports a\ngood balance between the shift towards green energy\nand economic growth. We will constantly review and\nre-examine our policies while carefully assessing the\noutlook for the future, including the international\nenergy situation.\nBeing ever more conscious of our one precious\nEarth, we must direct our caring attention to the\npreciousness of each life breathing on the planet. The\nJapan-led resolution on human security (resolution\n66/290), adopted on 10 September, can be a solid guide\nto visualizing development for the next generation from\nthe perspective of all people, including women and\nyoung people. In the light of the common understanding\nof human security stipulated in that resolution, Japan\nis determined to contribute to worldwide efforts to\nachieve the Millennium Development Goals and to\nwork towards the establishment of the next development\nframework.\nThe ideal of human security needs particular\nemphasis with respect to the African continent, which\nsteadily reveals greater development potential but\nstill suffers from many challenges, such as poverty,\nnatural disasters and conflicts. On the occasion of\nthe fifth Tokyo International Conference on African\nDevelopment, to be held in Yokohama next June,\nJapan plans to discuss the measures the international\ncommunity and Africa should adopt and implement.\nWe must completely and successfully meet the\nchallenges that place our precious lives in danger.\nAfghanistan is making significant efforts\ntowards reconstruction after its prolonged experience\nof war. South Sudan is also moving forward in its\nnation-building efforts, and Myanmar has taken steady\nsteps towards democracy and reconciliation. Japan will\ndo its utmost to support and promote peacekeeping,\npeacebuilding and human security in each of those\nregions.\nA third pearl of wisdom that humans obtained\nwas the manner in which human beings settle disputes\nreasonably under rules. Human beings acquired\nlanguage and nurtured wisdom, but, even in modern\ntimes, they have failed to resist the temptation to solve\nconflicts by force. Despite two world wars and the two\ncalamities of atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima\nand Nagasaki, disarmament, the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the prevention of\nterrorism remain key contemporary issues. The nuclear\nand missile issues in the Democratic People\u2019s Republic\nof Korea and Iran currently pose serious threats\nto the entire world. It is essential that all countries\ncoordinate at the United Nations and the International\nAtomic Energy Agency, including the implementation\nof Security Council resolutions urging both the\nDemocratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea and Iran to\ntake concrete action. Japan, the only country that has\nexperienced the horror of nuclear devastation in war,\nwill continue to carry out its mission of seeking a world\nfree of nuclear weapons.\nThe issue of the abductions by the Democratic\nPeople\u2019s Republic of Korea represents a violation of\nbasic human rights. That makes it a universal issue and\na matter of grave concern to the entire international\ncommunity. Japan is committed to continuing its utmost\nefforts to achieve the return of all victims at the earliest\npossible date, through strengthened coordination with\nother Member States. Japan intends to maintain its\nefforts to comprehensively resolve outstanding issues\nof concern, settle the unfortunate past and normalize\nrelations in accordance with the Japan-Democratic\nPeople\u2019s Republic of Korea Pyongyang Declaration.\nJapan continues to urge the Democratic People\u2019s\nRepublic of Korea to take positive steps.\nHumans have done more than just act on their lust\nfor the use of force. We have also developed the skill\nto solve conflicts calmly through reason, which we\ncall the rule of law. Every State has a responsibility\nto safeguard peace, ensure the safety of its people\nand protect its territorial and maritime sovereignty.\nJapan will fulfil those responsibilities in accordance\nwith international law. Meanwhile, as globalization\nproceeds, the challenges confronting the international\ncommunity are growing increasingly complex, and\nrelations between nations can easily become tense.\nAt this critical juncture, we must establish the rule of\nlaw as a basis for global peace, stability and prosperity.\nBecause the rule of law is essential to preventing and\nresolving conflicts in a peaceful manner, and because\nit plays a critical role in the maintenance of stable and\npredictable societies, it must be further enhanced. Any\nattempt to impose a country\u2019s ideology or claim by\nunilateral use of force or by threat of the use of force is\ninconsistent with the fundamental spirit of the United\nNations Charter and runs counter to human wisdom; it\nis thus absolutely unacceptable. It is important to try to further develop international law and ensure that\nit gets implemented more effectively. I strongly call\nfor leaders to strengthen the rule of law so as to leave\nfuture generations with a more peaceful and stable\ninternational community.\nWe are currently witnessing the settlement of\nconflicts between nations on the basis of international\nlaw. A typical example is the dispute settlement process\nof the World Trade Organization, a mechanism that has\nmade it possible for States to solve trade disputes with\nthe common language of law, not by force, in a panel or\nappellate body.\nJapan has always valued the rule of law and has\ncontributed to strengthening it. Since joining the\nInternational Court of Justice, Japan has consistently\nrecognized the jurisdiction of the Court as compulsory\nand has taken the lead in practicing the rule of law.\nJapan is leading the world in its contributions\nof personnel and financing to international judicial\ninstitutions. In addition to having served at the\nInternational Court of Justice, Japanese judges have\nalso served at the International Tribunal for the Law of\nthe Sea, the International Criminal Court (ICC) and the\nExtraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia.\nFurthermore, Japan has provided the largest financial\nsupport of any country for the latter three institutions.\nJapan requests each country to kindly offer financial\nsupport to the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts\nof Cambodia, which is facing a severe financial crisis\nat the moment.\nSupporting the United Nations in promoting the rule\nof law continues to be a great challenge. Once again, I\ncall for nations to work in cooperation with the United\nNations to recognize the compulsory jurisdiction of\nthe International Court of Justice, as Japan did, and\nfor non-member countries of the ICC and the United\nNations Convention on the Law of the Sea to join at an\nearly date.\nThere are still a number of territorial and maritime\ndisputes in many parts of the world. It is the philosophy\nof the Charter of the United Nations and a principle\nshared by the international community as a whole\nthat disputes should be settled in a peaceful manner\non the basis of international law. In all circumstances,\nJapan is determined to comply with that principle and\nseek peaceful solutions based on international law.\nThe world should pay greater attention to the role the international judicial institutions play in the peaceful\nsettlement of disputes.\nAlthough the Middle East and Africa are still in\na tumultuous whirlwind, they are in fact moving in\nthe direction of establishing democracy. Japan will\ncontinue to support efforts at democratization and\nreform of every country. Moreover, we cannot overlook\nthe ongoing violence and suppression in Syria, or the\nserious violations of human rights with respect to\nthe rule of law. Japan strongly condemns the massive\nattacks in Syria that have involved tens of thousands\nof innocent citizens, journalists and aid workers,\nincluding Ms. Mika Yamamoto, a Japanese journalist.\nJapan intends to put more pressure on the Government\nof Syria, together with the international community,\nand to extend humanitarian assistance to the people of\nSyria.\nLet me emphasize that the international community\nmust secure the protection of civilians and the safety of\ndiplomats and workers of international organizations\nthrough the rule of law. Today, violence against that\nprinciple cannot be tolerated for any reason.\nThe concept of the rule of law is the foundation for\na stable and reliable society, making the movement of\npeoples and goods more vibrant and serving as a basis\nof prosperity. I believe that the rule of law can provide\nimportant infrastructure for order and prosperity for a\nnetwork of States centred in the Asia-Pacific region.\nJapan will vigorously contribute to rule-making efforts\nto expand trade and investment, build maritime order,\nincluding the safety of navigation, and create stability\nfor prosperity.\nThe rules needed by the international community\nare not simply for solving individual problems. Orderly\nrelations between nations or within international\norganizations require the rule of law, more specifically,\nenhanced global governance. Unless all nations fulfil\ntheir responsibilities in their respective capacities, we\ncannot overcome the various common challenges that\nthe world is facing. I hope in particular that emerging\ncountries will fulfil their responsibilities commensurate\nwith their respective national powers.\nAs part of such efforts, it is important that we\nengage in thorough discussions on how the United\nNations should develop in the future. We strongly\nsupport management reform at the United Nations.\nFurthermore, in order for the Security Council to be\nfully effective, it must be endowed with a legitimacy that reflects the realities of the world today. Japan\nis ready to take on greater responsibility in the\ninternational community. Now is the time to accelerate\nthe stalled process on Security Council reform and to\nstart genuine negotiations.\nSo far I have mentioned three pearls of wisdom\nnecessary for human beings to live sustainable lives\nin the future, and I have tried to convey Japan\u2019s\ncontribution in each. It is my belief that human beings\nwill continue to adapt to a complex world and become\nwiser. I believe they will give adequate consideration\nto future generations and solve disputes calmly through\nreason based on rules generated from the perspective of\nlooking at the Earth from the outside.\nLet us take charge of our responsibilities for\ntomorrow together. The lofty task for us living now is\nto carry out politics while imagining the benefits for\nfuture generations and gather all our wisdom to set a\ncourse towards the survival of human beings.\nI should like to conclude my remarks by pledging\nto the entire General Assembly that Japan will stand at\nthe forefront of shaping the future of human history for\npeaceful and aff luent societies."

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt is a distinct honour for me\nto speak today for the first time as President of the\nRepublic of Guyana in this general debate of the sixty-\nseventh session of the General Assembly.\nTo the President of the Assembly at its sixty-seventh\nsession, I extend my delegation\u2019s sincere congratulations\non his election. I also pay tribute to his predecessor, His\nExcellency Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser, who presided\nover the sixty-sixth session with distinction during a\ntrying period for this body. The Secretary-General\ndeserves commendation for his unstinting service\nto the Organization and our continued support as the United Nations negotiates the many issues that confront\nour world.\nThe present international system is characterized\nby change and crises. A tide of change is evident at all\nlevels, from the local to the global, and it is either being\nprecipitated or accompanied by multiple crises within\nthe global community.\nIn the economic realm, continuing adverse\nconditions stymie global efforts to achieve\ninternationally agreed-upon development objectives.\nRecovery from the global financial crisis is at best\nincipient and sluggish. Several of the major contributors\nto global output are grappling with unsustainable fiscal\nbalances that hinder their ability to stimulate lasting\nrecovery. The problems in those economies continue\nto place a drag on global growth. Compounding those\ndifficulties is the slowdown in output in major emerging\neconomies. Naturally, those events have had serious\nnegative impacts on developing countries.\nAlthough more resilient than in earlier times,\ndeveloping countries have paid a heavy price as a result\nof the present difficulties in the world economy. That\nhas been reflected in growth that is generally lower than\npre-crisis levels. Already grappling with adverse trading\narrangements and the consequences of an inconclusive\nand disappointing Doha Development Round, the plight\nof developing countries has been made worse by the\nprolonged global slump. Many of the gains made before\n2008 have been erased by the continuing difficulties in\nthe world economy. The small, vulnerable economies of\nthe Caribbean face special challenges, compounded by\ngenerally high levels of indebtedness and falling export\nrevenues.\nIt is within the unfavourable international climate\nthat we have to judge our own performance. Guyana\nhas had to face many serious challenges. However,\nwe have worked steadfastly to build a more resilient\neconomy and country. We have managed to forestall\nthe worst effects of the international economic crises.\nOver the past six years, we have achieved an economic\ngrowth rate of approximately 5 per cent per annum. The\ngrowth rate is, I believe, the result of the investments\nthat we have been making in our people. More than\n30 per cent of our budget is dedicated to education,\nhealth, housing, water and social programmes to help\nthe most vulnerable.\nToday Guyana has achieved universal primary\neducation, and we have come a long way towards attaining universal secondary education. However,\nsignificant challenges remain in reaching people in the\nremote areas of our country. If we are to encourage our\nyouth to become responsible citizens and prepare them\nto be the leaders of tomorrow, we must ensure that our\neducation systems allow for the development of their\nfull potential.\nI am therefore honoured to join the Secretary-\nGeneral in promoting the Education First initiative. We\nare nonetheless conscious that the sustainability of our\ngrowth and that of other developing countries will be\nhindered if the weakness in the international economy\nis prolonged.\nGuyana therefore continues to advocate for reform\nof the graduation policies and aid allocation criteria of\nthe international financial institutions to take account\nof the structural vulnerability and level of economic\nresilience of small States, for measures to ease the debt\nburden, for renewed access to concessionary financing\nfor highly indebted middle-income countries and for\nthe strengthening of financial regulations.\nThe international economic crisis has also led to\ngrowing negative social problems. Despite great efforts\nby many countries, the war against narco\u2013trafficking\nis far from over. That scourge has an impact on all our\ncountries. It has also directly and indirectly engendered\nthe growth in criminal activity in our region. The\navailability of guns in many societies \u2014 I would note\nthat we do not produce them \u2014 most of which has come\nas a by-product of the narco-trade, has contributed to\nthe growth of gun crimes and murders in the region\nand beyond. To deal with the problem, Guyana is ready\nto cooperate fully with the international community to\nbring the criminals to justice and free our people from\nthe multiple dangers that drug trafficking creates.\nEven as our society advances, the issues we have\nto deal with often seem to multiply. The issue of\ntrafficking in persons has also arisen over the past\ndecade as a major concern. We join with all democratic\nand decent people throughout the world in condemning\nthat crime. Again, it is a campaign that requires a high\nlevel of cooperation. We are ready to play our part.\nIf solving those collective problems requires greater\nwill, then other transnational problems such as the\nclimate crisis require urgent, immediate and decisive\naction. Our failure to do so risks causing irretrievable\nharm to humankind. Despite the strong scientific and economic case\nfor action, the global response to the climate crisis\nfalls short of what is required in terms of both scale\nand urgency. The projected level of reduction in\ngreenhouse-gas emissions is much too low. Scientists\nare warning us of the catastrophic consequences if the\nrise in greenhouse emissions is not halted. Already\nsome States are facing imminent extinction.\nTo add insult to injury, the promise of fast-start\nfinancing made at Copenhagen a few years ago has\nnot materialized. The result is that those most at risk\nare effectively deprived of the means to adapt to that\nexistential threat. We cannot continue to deal with\nthreats to the survival of the planet with such casualness.\nAs a low-lying coastal State, Guyana is mindful\nof the dangers posed by climate change. We have been\nat the forefront of the appeals to the international\ncommunity to match its concern with tangible action.\nIt is clear that some countries are taking the issue\nseriously. Norway has led the way by giving tangible\nsupport in fighting climate change. Guyana, for its\npart, has chosen to pursue a low-carbon development\nstrategy in order to ensure economic growth, social\nprogress and environmental sustainability for present\nand future generations of our citizens.\nBut, as our experience patently demonstrates, that\npath is not without its hurdles. Just three short months\nago, in Rio de Janeiro, we renewed our collective\ncommitment to sustainable development and to\nensuring the promotion of an economically, socially\nand environmentally sustainable future for our planet.\nWe also agreed that the eradication of poverty was\nthe greatest challenge facing the world today, and we\nrecommitted ourselves to freeing humankind from\npoverty and hunger as a matter of urgency.\nWe need, therefore, as a matter of exigency, to\nrespond to the plight of more than 1 billion of our fellow\ncitizens who bear the ache of hunger on a daily basis.\nThey are found on every continent, in every city and in\nrural communities across the world.\nTheir plight is worsening. Food prices are surging\nonce again, and risk rising even further as severe\ndroughts decimate crop yields. Those who suffer from\nchronic hunger today cannot wait until the international\ncommunity agrees on a post-2015 development\nframework. They cannot wait until we craft new\nsustainable development goals. They need action now. The decades-long under-investment in agriculture\nand rural development needs to be urgently reversed if\nfood security is to be guaranteed on a sustainable basis.\nIn line with the Five Rome Principles for\nSustainable Global Food Security, Guyana calls for an\nacceleration of the twin-track approach to enhancing\ndirect action against hunger for the most vulnerable\nand for promoting medium- to long-term sustainability\nin agriculture and rural development. In that context,\nincreased international support for the expansion of\nrural infrastructure is critical.\nMs. Flores (Honduras), Vice-President, took the\nChair.\nIf we are to maintain our credibility, we must avoid\nindecisiveness on the issues that afflict humankind. We\nare only three short years away from 2015, the year we\nset for ourselves to reach important goals for improving\nthe security of our planet and enhancing the quality of\nlife for all. We must do what we promised to do and we\nmust do so without delay.\nGreater alacrity is also needed in the area of politics,\nwhere tensions and unrest in many corners of our globe\nthreaten to undermine international peace and security.\nThe tide of democratic change that has swept the\nplanet and raised the expectations of peoples for social\nprogress and better standards of life in an environment\nof enlarged freedoms is receding. Those legitimate\naspirations deserve the respect and encouragement\nof the Governments concerned and the support of the\ninternational community. No people should be denied\nthe right to live in dignity or to live a life free from\nfear and want. At the same time, we must be careful to\nguard against the superimposition of agendas based on\nulterior designs that are alien to those noble aspirations.\nWhile we give solidarity and support where needed,\nlet us not forget that this body crafted an important\nprinciple of self-determination.\nHuman rights and fundamental freedoms are best\npreserved in an environment of peace and security.\nRespect for the rule of law and tolerance for the faiths\nand beliefs of all humankind must continue to be the\nguiding principles through which we build harmonious\nsocieties. While we condemn the attacks and insults\nthat the recent film heaped on Islam, we believe\nthat nothing of that nature can justify the murder of\ndiplomats and the violence we have seen. We therefore\nextend our sympathy to the people and Government of the United States of America on the murder of\nAmbassador Christopher Stevens and others in Libya.\nWe believe that the best homage we can pay to their\nmemory is to work even harder for a just, peaceful and\ntolerant world.\nIn concert with the proposed theme of this debate,\nthe United Nations must continue to pursue peaceful\nsolutions to political conflicts, no matter how slow and\npainstaking the process may be.\nIt is my country\u2019s sincere hope that peace will soon\ncome to the Syrian people. Guyana urges the renewal\nof efforts to bring the warring parties to the negotiating\ntable. The international community must contribute to\npeace and not to the exacerbation of strife and conflict.\nAny abandonment of its role in bringing peace to Syria\nwill result in greater suffering in that country and\nundermine security in that part of the world. The United\nNations must therefore persevere in finding a peaceful\nend to the conflict. We therefore support the efforts of\nthe Joint Special Representative of the United Nations\nand the League of Arab States in trying to bring the\nconflict in Syria to a peaceful end.\nI also wish to underline Guyana\u2019s strong support\nfor the peaceful settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian\nconflict. We are of the view that the resolution of that\nconflict, which has lasted for too long, is key to a lasting\npeace in the Middle East. Guyana recognizes the State\nof Palestine based on its 1967 borders and supports its\naspirations to full membership in the United Nations.\nThe Palestinian people deserve the same rights as\npeople everywhere: to live in dignity, security, freedom\nand independence, at peace with all their neighbours\nand with the right to move freely in their own land.\nGuyana is encouraged by the continuing efforts of\nthe Republic of the Sudan and the Republic of South\nSudan to resolve their differences through negotiations.\nWe are hopeful also that the people of Mali will be\nable to overcome their current crisis and restore the\ncelebrated legacy of Timbuktu.\nHaving regard for the principle of the sovereignty of\nStates set down in the United Nations Charter, Guyana\nwishes to place on record once again its firm opposition\nto the economic, financial and commercial embargo\nimposed against its sister Caribbean State of Cuba. We\ncall for an immediate end to the policy. Cuba has made\ngreat contributions to the social development of many\ndeveloping countries. The lifting of the blockade can\nallow it to do much more. The myriad challenges affecting our world today\npose a formidable test to the multilateral system that\nembodies our collective aspirations for peace and\ndevelopment. Such challenges tax our collective resolve\nto act in the best interest of humankind.\nThe United Nations was established at a time\nwhen the vast majority of the human family was not\nrepresented in its councils and most nations could not\nspeak on their own behalf. That is not the case today.\nThe near universal representativeness of its membership\ngives the United Nations unparalleled legitimacy among\nworld institutions. The governance of the Organization\nneeds major reform if it is to reflect the realities of the\npresent time and give full expression to the aspirations\nof the world\u2019s peoples. For the Security Council, the\nimperative for reform is particularly urgent. I reaffirm\nGuyana\u2019s steadfast support for timely reform of the\nCouncil through an expansion in both the permanent\nand non-permanent categories, with particular regard\nto the representation of developing countries.\nThe United Nations must also be reformed in a\nmanner that will enhance its contribution to global\neconomic governance, in keeping with the purposes\nof its Charter. The United Nations has an important\nrole to play in addressing the democracy deficit in\ndecision-making on such matters, which often have\nfar-reaching implications, particularly for small States.\nReforming the United Nations along those lines will\nprovide it with greater legitimacy, which is key to its\neffectiveness in the eyes of the world. That legitimacy\nwill be enhanced by the delivery of results that meet\nthe expectations of the global citizenry in areas where\naction is most needed.\nIn conclusion, allow me to recognize the great role\nplayed by this body over the years in promoting world\npeace. It has done a lot to contain and resolve regional\nand local conflicts. In our time, the United Nations has\nbecome indispensable in tackling pressing global issues.\nWe must therefore all work together to strengthen the\nOrganization so as to make it more effective in the face\nof the many challenges that are ahead."

        "file_text": "\ufeffWe often\ninvoke the phrase \u201cthe spirit of San Francisco\u201d. We do\nthat when we speak and think about positive aspects of\ninternational relations. Indeed, the message sent from\nthe 1945 Conference in San Francisco offered immense\nhope to the generation that had just survived the most\nhorrible war ever experienced \u2014 hope for building\na fundamentally new world. Justice was intended\nto replace violence, cooperation was to replace\nlawlessness. The United Nations, founded in that city,\nwas called upon to become the key element of a new\norder.\nHave the hopes, born in San Francisco, come\ntrue? To some extent, they have. After all, today there\nis no sign of the sharp ideological confrontation that\ncharacterized the twentieth century. Nor is there the\ndirect, open conflict between the major Powers that had\nmarked all previous centuries with its violence. What\nis more, such scourges as colonialism, slavery and\napartheid have been irrevocably consigned to oblivion.\nBut the spirit of San Francisco was about something\nmore than just preventing the recurring mistakes of\nthe past. First and foremost, it was a message about a\npromising future. Unfortunately, that is precisely what\nhas failed to become a reality. Why? Reinhold Niebuhr,\nan outstanding American philosopher who was writing\nin those fateful times, noted that general community\nis established only when the knowledge that we need\none another is supplemented by the recognition that the\nother form of life, or that unique other community, is\nthe limit beyond which our ambitions must not run.\nToday that point is as insightful as it was then.\nSome countries see neither the limits of their foreign\npolicy nor forms of statehood other than their own.\nAnd that is exactly what gives rise to many of today\u2019s\ngeopolitical problems. States that refuse to follow\npatterns imposed from the outside and choose to defend\ntheir real sovereignty must pay dearly for that right.\nTake the case of Cuba. The historic choice to pursue\nan independent path of development that was made by its people more than five decades ago encountered\nrejection and economic blockade on the part of those\nwho still believe, in the twenty-first century, that they\ncan continue to write the history of humankind in the\nsame manner as they did in the past. And that is not the\nonly example.\nBelarus is fully convinced that any attempt to make\nsomeone do something against their will is doomed to\nfail. Are we not learning the lessons of the past? After\nall, neither weapons nor wealth constitute the greatest\nsource of power on Earth. That power stems rather\nfrom the spirit of self-determination. If a nation has\nembarked on its own path of peaceful and progressive\ndevelopment, then no external force is able to stop it in\nits tracks. Battles can be won against such a nation, but\nnever wars.\nThe time of imperialism, in whatever lofty slogans\nit is now being dressed \u2014 democracy, human rights,\ngood governance \u2014 is irreversibly past. Furthermore,\ntoday we are weighed down by global economic\nchallenges, nearly all of which have resulted from a\npolicy of so-called market fundamentalism relentlessly\npursued by its proponents over the past four decades.\nIts major outcome is a steady rise in inequality at\nall levels. Essentially we are witnessing the great\ndivergence. Clearly, the situation resembles a slowly\nticking time-bomb of future mass upheavals fraught\nwith unpredictable consequences.\nUnfortunately, the current economic woes are\nstructural and therefore unlikely to be quickly and\ndecisively resolved. That is attested to by the fact that\nthe crisis persists all over the world four years after\nit began. The measures adopted over that period have\nfailed to do much to remedy the situation. Yet, what\nis far more disturbing is that the countries whose\npolicies had nothing to do with market fundamentalism\nhave also experienced severe hardships. Because of\nthe growing global interdependence of all aspects of\ninternational life, they simply have no other option.\nWe call attention to another chronic ailment of\nmodernity, of a moral nature. Double standards in the\nforeign policy of the world Powers have become a norm.\nAs a result, those major world players are willing to go to\ngreat lengths to cater to the interests of their \u201cfriends\u201d.\nYet they advocate the forced imposition of democracy\nand human rights on their adversaries. Guided solely by\ntheir own interests, the players who were shaking hands\nwith you yesterday openly contribute to your downfall\ntoday. In considering human rights situations in other countries under a microscope, those players have\nrefused to acknowledge the obvious faults in their own\ncountries. In other words, we have come to witness the\nrise of unscrupulous and barbaric behaviour in foreign\npolicy that is worthy of the teachings of Machiavelli\nhimself.\nIt is unfortunate that the United Nations, by and\nlarge, has been sidelined in that context. Nevertheless,\nit has not been the fault of the Organization. The\nbrainchild of San Francisco has simply not been allowed\nto function in the manner conceived by its founders.\nIs there a way out of the seemingly hopeless\nsituation? We are certain that there is. The current\nchallenges have not become insurmountable yet. We\nwill be able to overcome them. However, that will\nrequire us to revive the spirit of San Francisco. We\nshould return to the principles and foundations, which\ncould serve as the building blocks for a better world\ntoday. Multilateralism, justice and cooperation are as\nrelevant today as they were in 1945.\nSo, what in practical terms must be done? Belarus\ndoes not pretend to have exhaustive answers. We would\nlike just to draw attention to four areas that, in our view,\nare most crucial: the rule of law, politics, economics\nand the environment. First, to establish the rule of law\nglobally, the system of international law must become\nfully functional. Forged through centuries of suffering,\nit is the foundation without which all other elements\nof modern civilization cannot operate. Having signed\nthe Charter of the United Nations, the world\u2019s countries\ncommitted themselves to abide by the principles of\ninternational law. In other words, they refused to live\nany longer under conditions of destructive anarchy and\nlawlessness.\nInternational law has been shaped as a historic\ncompromise between the interests of all States. It\nmay be supplemented and revised only if all States\nagree to do so. There should be no place for arbitrary\ninterpretations that seek to subordinate international\nlaw to private interests. Let us bear in mind that such\nbehaviour leads to infringement of the interests of other\ninternational actors. That is why no trendy concepts\nsuch as humanitarian intervention or responsibility to\nprotect can justify interference in the internal affairs of\nsovereign States.\nSecondly, in political terms, we need a stable and\npredictable global order. It is up to us whether we will\nhave one. Global systems cannot establish and manage themselves \u2014 they result from human action. At this\npoint we are living in a system that may be viewed as\na dysfunctional multipolarity. Indeed, we are forced\nto witness a rising number of global players that are\nproving unable to cope effectively with increasing\nglobal demands.\nIf we fail to restructure the situation, then we\nwill most likely end up with a scenario that is even\nworse \u2014 something that resembles the dark era of the\nMiddle Ages but aggravated by ever more dangerous\ntransnational threats and challenges. Thus, again we\nreturn to the perennial question: how is it possible to\nbuild an effective global order in a world that lacks a\nglobal government?We can offer an idea. A response\nwould involve addressing the structural issue by means\nof a functional approach. Let us try to devise an effective\nglobal system by tackling specific functional problems.\nAfter all, is it not the case that all positive-minded\nglobal stakeholders have an interest in addressing fewer\nproblems or eliminating them altogether?\nWe are deeply convinced that global partnerships\nwill provide the means whereby we realize that vision.\nThey can bring together multiple players on the world\nstage in a common effort against specific transnational\nthreats and challenges. So let us begin working on and\nimplementing functional partnerships on each of the\nissues. Indeed, my country has already been doing just\nthat, for instance, in the fight against human trafficking\nwithin the framework of the global partnership against\nslavery and human trafficking proposed by Belarus\nsome time ago.\nThirdly, there is the economic dimension. Mass\nprotests across the world, like the Occupy Wall Street\nmovement, testify to public rejection of the prevailing\ndevelopment model. This is hardly surprising; after\nall, the model was built with the interests of corporate\ncapital in mind. Clearly, the classic recipe of Adam Smith\ndoes not work in a modern world. Contrary to general\nexpectations, the invisible hand of the market has not\nled to universal public well-being. The experience of\nthe past few decades indicates that the invisible hand\ncontributes to the enrichment of the corporate sector\nalone, while impoverishing others.\nThe global economy of the twenty-first century is\ntoo sophisticated to be left to the whims of market forces.\nThat economy requires a reasonable balance among\nits various elements. As far as the balance per se is\nconcerned, it cannot be established by default, someone\nmust do it. Only a State is able to accomplish that task, and more crucially, a strong, socially oriented State that\ndoes not live by borrowing from future generations, as\nis currently the case in some advanced countries.We are\nconvinced that a State-based paradigm, as we suggest,\nwill permit the severe imbalance to be redressed.\nLikewise, it is key to significantly reducing poverty in\nthe world.\nFinally, what is required of us in terms of the\nenvironment? Climate change is the central and\ndefining challenge of today\u2019s world. This is the wall\nthat separates current and future generations from a\nprosperous future. Our efforts in all other areas will\nprove futile if we fail to tackle this core challenge. We\nmust preserve the life-giving ecosystem of the Earth.\nThis, therefore, is where there is the greatest need for\ncomprehensive international cooperation.\nThe United Nations Conference on Sustainable\nDevelopment (Rio+20) was held in June. The\nConference\u2019s decisions essentially marked the start of a\nnew green deal that is expected to rally all stakeholders\nfor common action. We need to move forward\ndecisively to implement its individual elements. It is,\nabove all, about elaborating sustainable development\ngoals and ensuring the transfer and integration of\ngreen technologies. In the context of the follow-up to\nRio+20, the formulation of a comprehensive United\nNations energy agenda must be seriously considered.\nWe believe it would contribute to an urgently needed\ncomprehensive approach to addressing the interrelated\nissues of climate change, energy and food security.\nThe United Nations is the natural place for the\nimplementation of all the ideas articulated above. No\nother international body possesses such universal\nlegitimacy. Let us therefore, at last, empower the\nUnited Nations. We are certain that the United Nations\nwill then be able to realize with dignity the vision set\nforth in San Francisco so many years ago."

        "file_text": "\ufeffI\nwould like to join previous speakers in congratulating\nMr. Vuk Jeremi\u0107 on his election as President of the\nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-seventh session. I would\nalso like to extend our thanks to the outgoing President,\nMr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser.\nThis session of the General Assembly is an\ninvaluable opportunity to bring together Member States\nin order to examine the challenges facing humanity and\nto join efforts in effectively addressing those challenges\nand in achieving internationally agreed goals. We\nall know that when decisions are based on common\nunderstanding and agreement, their implementation\nand success are more likely.\nArmenia continues to be committed to strengthening\nthe institutional capacities of the Organization. We\nsupport the United Nations reform processes and are\nready to contribute to them. We believe that the reforms\nare an opportunity to strengthen the role of the United\nNations in solving the major issues facing our world\nand to achieve both the Millennium Development Goals\nand the sustainable development goals.\nWe welcome the fact that the agenda of the sixty-\nseventh session, which encompasses the most pressing\nissues of our joint responsibility for the maintenance\nof international peace and security, proposes that\nthe session focus on the settlement of disputes by\npeaceful means. In that context, we view the goals of\ndisarmament and arms control as major elements of\nglobal and regional security systems. We must also\nshoulder the responsibility to work together to counter\nmilitaristic threats.\nA few days ago, on 14 September, within the\nframework of the United Nations, the first ever High-\nLevel Forum on the Culture of Peace took place, calling\nfor tolerance and seeking to build mutual understanding\nand respect. Unfortunately, today, hate and intolerance\ncontinue to spread in some parts of the world, and we\nhave yet to dig into the root causes of such situations,\nto have the courage to openly ask difficult questions as\nto the reasons for them, and to face sometimes painful\nresponses.\n\nRegrettably, we have witnessed intolerance and\nhatred in our part of the world, too. Year after year,\nArmenia has, from this rostrum, raised concerns\nabout the militaristic rhetoric, blatant violation of\ninternational commitments and anti-Armenian hysteria\nbeing instilled into Azerbaijani society from the\nhighest levels of its leadership. Many international\norganizations on human rights have been alerted to\nf lagrant cases of xenophobia, racism, intolerance and\nviolations of human rights in Azerbaijan, as well as\nabout the policy of hatred against Armenians.\nWhat has been the Azerbaijani response? It not\nonly ignores the expectations of the international\ncommunity, but it constantly takes new steps that go\nagainst the values of the civilized world. The latest\nsuch case is the Azeri Government\u2019s release and\nglorification of the murderer Mr. Ramil Safarov, who\nhad slaughtered an Armenian officer in his sleep with\nan axe, during a NATO programme in Budapest, simply\nbecause he was Armenian. The Azerbaijani leadership\nmade him a symbol of national pride and an example\nfor young people to follow.\nThe world\u2019s reaction was unanimous and very\nclear in condemning what was done by Baku, the\ncapital of Azerbaijan, in granting him clemency.\nAzerbaijan continues to express bewilderment at the\nstance of the international community. What did they\nexpect \u2014 that the international community would\napplaud the glorification of a heinous murderer? The\nAzerbaijani leadership continues to pretend that the\nact was in accordance not only with the Azerbaijani\nConstitution and legislation, but also with the norms\nand principles of international law and the relevant\nEuropean conventions. The leadership of the country\nclaims that what was done was very good. It is very sad\nindeed that the constitution and legislation of a country\nwould permit making a hero of a murderer and paying\nsuch a brutal criminal a salary for the years he spent in\nprison.\nThe Commissioner for Human Rights of the Council\nof Europe warned that \u201cto glorify and reward such a\nperson f lies in the face of all accepted standards for\nhuman rights protection and rule of law\u201d. The President\nof the European Parliament and the President of the\nParliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe\nexpressed concern about the abuse of the European\nlegal instrument in question. The United Nations High\nCommissioner for Human Rights said on 7 September:\n\u201cethnically motivated hate crimes of this gravity should\nbe deplored and properly punished \u2014 not publicly\nglorified by leaders and politicians\u201d.\nIt is very clear that there are different perceptions\nabout international legal principles and laws, different\nperceptions in Azerbaijan and the rest of the world\nabout what is good and what is bad. That is deeply\nirresponsible and shameful behaviour, not only for a\nnon-permanent member of the Security Council, but\nalso a Member State of the United Nations.\nIt is clear that the international community cannot\ntolerate the attempts of the Azerbaijani leadership to adjust international law to their own racist ideology.\nWith a rich domestic experience in corruption, Baku is\nattempting to transfer that vice to inter-State relations,\nexploiting it as a tool in order to impose its own false\nperceptions on others. The international community\ncannot tolerate the attempts of Azerbaijan to replace\nthe rule of law with the rule of oil.\nThe scandalous situation regarding Safarov\nhas seriously undermined the Nagorno Karabakh\nnegotiation process and endangered the already fragile\nregional security and stability. Azerbaijan poses a threat\nto the security and stability in the region by constantly\nthreatening to use force against Nagorno Karabakh\nand Armenia, along with the daily unprovoked\nwarmongering by its leadership. It has not only\nrejected the proposals of the three co-Chair countries\nof the Organization for Security and Cooperation\nin Europe (OSCE) group on the consolidation of the\nceasefire agreement and on the creation of a mechanism\nof investigation of incidents along the line of contact\nbut also systematically commits ceasefire violations,\nnot only on the contact line between Nagorno Karabakh\nand Azerbaijan but also through provocations along the\nborder with Armenia and ceaseless acts of vandalism\nagainst the Armenian historical and cultural heritage.\nWhile Armenia and the international mediators\nhave been working hard around the negotiation table,\nAzerbaijan has increased its military budget more than\ntwenty-fold during the past few years, and boasts about\nit. While Armenia and the international community\nhave been calling for the withdrawal of snipers from the\nline of contact, Azerbaijani leaders have been rejecting\nthose calls and have opened sniper schools for young\npeople. While Armenia has been calling for regional\neconomic cooperation, which could become a tool for\nincreasing confidence between the parties, Azerbaijani\nauthorities have declared that, together with Turkey,\nthey will continue the blockade until there are no more\nArmenians in Armenia.\nArmenia and the international community are\nspeaking in one language regarding the Nagorno\nKarabakh issue. The documents on the settlement of\nthe Nagorno Karabakh conflict adopted within the\nframework of the OSCE Astana Summit in 2010; the\nOSCE Ministerial Conferences of Helsinki in 2008,\nAthens in 2009, Ahnaty in 2010 and Vilnius in 2011;\nthe statements of Presidents of the Co-Chair countries\nwithin the framework of the Group of Eight Summits in\nl\u2019Aquila in 2009, in Muskoka in 2010, and in Deauville\nin 2011; and during the Group of 20 Summit in 2012\nin Los Cabos serve as proof of that. The position of\nArmenia is in line with those documents, and it is in\nline with the position of the international community,\nnamely, to accept the settlement on that basis.\nDespite the intensive efforts of the three Co-Chair\ncountries of the OSCE, it has been impossible to reach a\nbreakthrough, because the Azerbaijani side has rejected,\none after another, all of the proposals presented by the\nmediators. Despite Azerbaijan\u2019s destructive stance,\nArmenia will continue to work towards the settlement\nof the Karabakh issue exclusively through peaceful\nmeans and on the basis of the purposes, principles and\nnorms reflected in the Charter and international law.\nLike many other speakers, I wish to express our\nconcerns about the developments and worsening of the\nhumanitarian situation in Syria, which also directly\naffects the large Armenian community in that country.\nThat community was formed mainly by the survivors\nof the Armenian genocide in the Ottoman Empire at\nthe beginning of the twentieth century. Today, they\nare struggling for life, as are many Syrian citizens.\nArmenia continues to receive refugees from Syria;\nthose refugees are full of worries about the escalation\nof violence in that country. It is impossible to reach a\ndurable settlement without the cessation of hostilities\nby all parties and without an inclusive political dialogue\nthat takes into account the interests of all Syrians.\nNext year, the United Nations will mark the sixty-\nfifth anniversary of the Convention on the Prevention\nand Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. That\nanniversary will become an important landmark\nand occasion on which to create a more effective\ninstrument for combatting the crimes of genocide.\nThe denial of genocide and impunity pave the way\nfor the repetition of new crimes against humanity. As\ndescendants of the nation that survived the horrors\nof the first genocide of the twentieth century, we\nare convinced that the international community\nmust stand together \u2014 independent of any kind\nof considerations \u2014 in the recognition and strong\ncondemnation of genocide, so as to be able to prevent\nit from occurring. In the absence of such unanimity,\nhumankind will witness new attempts at crimes against\nhumanity. Our strong conviction is that we should\nkeep the issue high on our common agenda. We should\nrecommit to a world where the crime of genocide can\nnever occur again.\n\nArmenia gladly assumes its share of our common\nresponsibility to support the United Nations as a\nplatform for dialogue, multilateralism and collective\naction in addressing the multiple challenges of today\u2019s\nworld."

        "file_text": "\ufeffIn accordance with Ghanaian\ntradition and custom, I would like to begin with a basic\nbut essential courtesy by expressing, on behalf of the\nGovernment and people of my beloved country, our\ndeepest gratitude and most profound appreciation to the\nUnited Nations and to the numerous world leaders who\nmourned with us following the sudden and untimely\ndeath of our former President, Mr. John Evans Atta\nMills. Ghanaians were touched by the many heartfelt\nmessages of condolence and the glowing tributes that\npoured in from all over the globe. Those messages of\ngoodwill strengthened us and enabled us to transcend\nthe adversity of an occurrence that was unprecedented\nin the history of Ghana.\nMr. Mills was a dedicated and honourable\nstatesman. He committed himself to bringing about\nimprovement not only in the lives of Ghanaians but also\nin the lives of all other Africans, and indeed in the lives\nof individuals throughout the world. His death was a\nsignificant loss, and I am certain that he will be sorely\nmissed by the international community.\nWith the first-hand knowledge of what it means\nfor a nation to lose its leader, I also want to take this\nopportunity, on behalf of all Ghanaians, to extend\ncondolences to the people of Ethiopia, Malawi and\nGuinea-Bissau, who also suffered the untimely demise\nof their sitting Presidents. May the souls of these great\nmen, who gave so self lessly and helped to move our\nnations forward, rest in perfect peace.\nOne of the lessons that I learned from the tragedy\nof Mr. Mills\u2019s death \u2014 and it is a lesson worth\nsharing \u2014 is that it is during times such as these, times\nof great sorrow and pain, that we often reveal the very\nessence of who we are. That is as true of nations as it is of individuals. Over the past few months, Ghanaians\nhave shown ourselves to be resilient and respectful of\nthe values that promote peace and the institutions that\nsafeguard the stability of our democracy. In our process\nof healing from that great loss, we have become more\nunited and more determined to stay the course that we\nbegan in 1957, when we became the first sub-Saharan\nAfrican nation to gain independence. In the process\nof healing, we have become more confident than ever\nbefore in our ability to create a better Ghana for our\nchildren.\nToday\u2019s assembly of Heads of State is being held at\na most critical time. Our world is being confronted with\na number of significant challenges. War, conflict and\nstrife are very much features of our present existence.\nPoverty, disease and famine continue to cripple the\nlives of many. Oppression, discrimination, illiteracy\nand unemployment still stif le the potential and shatter\nthe hopes of millions.\nAlthough examples of such conditions can be found\non every continent, for a while, whether rightly or\nwrongly, they seemed to be automatically and primarily\nassociated with Africa. Perhaps that is why it gives me\nsuch great pleasure to lead my address to the General\nAssembly at its sixty-seventh session with news of\nprogress from Ghana and stories of success from the\nAfrican continent. Today, Africa boasts of some of the\nfastest-growing economies in the world, with Ghana\nbeing one of them. The number of countries engaged in\nconflict is steadily decreasing year after year. As that\nhappens, we are also witnessing a steady increase in the\nnumber of countries that are governed along democratic\nlines. As is true of all new democracies, those systems\nare not without their f laws. While they may not be\nperfect, however, they are promising.\nIn fact, three African countries that lost their\nleaders this year \u2014 Ethiopia, Malawi and, of course,\nGhana \u2014 experienced seamless and peaceful\nconstitutional transitions of power to a new leadership.\nMembers can see that, right now, something spectacular\nis happening in Africa. Growth is taking the place\nof stagnation; tranquillity the place of turmoil; and\ndemocratic governance, founded on the rule of law, the\nplace of dictatorship.\nThere is no denying the visibility and viability of\nsuch significant developments. At the very least, they\nrequire a re-examination of the long-held views and\nmisconceptions about the African continent. Those developments must also find expression in the manner\nin which developed nations relate to Africa. In many\nways, that is already taking place, but the shift has only\njust begun. There is still much room for improvement.\nHowever, I am inspired by what I see, which are\nlimitless possibilities for Africa and its engagement\nwith the rest of the world.\nAs the United Nations Human Development Index\nattests, we in Ghana have made tremendous strides in a\nnumber of areas, with the aim of improving the living\nconditions of our people. Ghana is on track to achieve\nthe targets set under the Millennium Development\nGoals. Significant progress has been made in the\nfollowing areas: reducing poverty, gender parity in\nschool enrolment, universal primary education, the\nprovision of safe drinking water and the fight against\nHIV/AIDS.\nUnemployment is a challenge that exists on a\nglobal scale. Nearly all nations, be they developed or\ndeveloping, are grappling with finding ways to tackle\nthat potential threat to their economic stability. In\nGhana, we are attempting to deal with the problem as\naggressively and as effectively as possible by finding\nlong-term and sustainable solutions. That includes a\nprogramme that we will launch to encourage young\npeople to become entrepreneurs, owning their own\nbusinesses and thereby becoming employers rather\nthan employees.\nIn Africa, to say that the youth are our future is\nslightly misleading. Nearly 60 per cent of the continent\u2019s\nentire population is below the age of 35. Our young\npeople are not only our future, but also our present. In\nGhana, we have been working assiduously to empower\nand support our youth so as to ensure that they will not\nbe left behind owing to fast-changing global economic,\neducational and social priorities.\nThe Government is implementing several social\nprotection programmes across various sectors to cushion\nthe poor and the vulnerable and to ensure that the fruits\nof our economic growth are distributed equitably. Under\nthose programmes, massive investments have been\nand are still being made in education, health care, the\nmodernization of agriculture, the social infrastructure\nand direct payments to the poorest households.\nIn furtherance of our battle against HIV/AIDS, a\nnew five-year national strategic plan has been launched\nto consolidate the gains already made in reducing the\nprevalence of the disease. Under the new plan, our target\nis to achieve the virtual elimination of mother-to-child\ntransmission and to expand access to antiretroviral\ntherapy for persons living with HIV/AIDS.\nThe Government of Ghana has committed\napproximately $80 million as its contribution to the\nfinancing of the new strategic plan. However, that is\nnot enough. We now find ourselves in a rather ironic\nsituation that is threatening the advances we have made\nthus far. Ghana, like several other developing countries\nthat have made remarkable headway in combating\nHIV/AIDS, is becoming a victim of its own success.\nAs the numbers associated with the disease \u2014 the\nrates of infection and the mortality \u2014 go down, so\ntoo do the figures in the global funding for HIV/AIDS\nprogrammes. That leaves a considerable financing gap\nfor many African countries, such as Ghana, that are\ntrying not only to maintain their progress but also to\nmove closer to the complete eradication of the disease.\nIn 1992, under the Constitution of its fourth\nrepublic, Ghana established itself as a multiparty\ndemocracy. Since then, we have held five successful\nelections, which have resulted in the smooth transfer\nof power from one democratically chosen leader to\nanother. When it comes to transparency in the electoral\nexercise, Ghana is, in fact, held up as an example of\nexcellence.\nWe are just a few weeks away from conducting\nour sixth presidential and parliamentary election. As\nPresident, I wish to assure the international community\nthat that election will also be free, fair and peaceful.\nI am so certain of our stability through that process\nthat I extend a warm welcome to any individual or\norganization that would like to come and monitor our\nelections.\nThe commitment to peace that I have pledged in\nthe past, and which I am pledging anew today, is in\nkeeping with a long-standing tradition that Ghana has\nestablished domestically and internationally. In the\n1960s, when Ghana deployed 8,800 soldiers to what\nis now the Democratic Republic of Congo, it went on\nrecord as the first African country to participate in\na United Nations peacekeeping mission. Since then,\nGhana has continued to be an active and key partner\nin the United Nations peacekeeping programme. It was\nrecently ranked among the 10 largest contributors of\npersonnel to peacekeeping operations over the years.\nCurrently, we have troops in five peacekeeping theatres\nthroughout the world.\n\nGhana\u2019s consistent championing of peace is neither\naccidental nor coincidental, but by design and by\ndetermination. We have always recognized that peace is\ncritical to development and to the overall improvement\nand enrichment of our people\u2019s lives. It is therefore no\nwonder that, in 1961, when United States President\nJohn F. Kennedy established the Peace Corps, its very\nfirst mission was in Ghana.\nIn the past two decades, Ghana\u2019s position on peace\nhas been tested again and again as the West African\nsubregion was ravaged by one civil war after another.\nHowever, we held firm to that position and will continue\nto do so.\nBecause Ghana wishes to coexist harmoniously\nwith all our neighbours, when legislating policy, we\nare always conscious of the importance of peace. When\noffering asylum or a safe haven to refugees, we are\nalways protective of our borders, making certain that\npolitical conflict and ethnic tension do not cross over\nonto our soil. The unfolding tensions in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire\nand Mali have been and continue to be of particular\nconcern to us.\nLet me say that Ghana will not allow its territory to\nbe used to destabilize any other nation. We will not be\nthe storehouse for any resources or weapons that may\nbe used to disrupt the peace and development of another\nnation. We will not harbour any individual or group\nwhose intent is to use Ghana as a base of operations to\nundermine the safety and security of our neighbours.\nWe will work under the ECOWAS protocol and\nwill utilize whatever other tools of diplomacy are\nat our disposal to ensure that security and peace are\nestablished in Mali and C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire and that those\ncountries find a place alongside their fellow African\ncountries in the continent\u2019s march forward towards\nprosperity.\nGhana has a strong belief in the Universal\nDeclaration of Human Rights. Under the principle\nof the self-determination of peoples, Ghana was the\nfirst sub-Saharan country to emerge from colonial\ndomination. Our nation\u2019s founding father, Mr. Kwame\nNkrumah, proclaimed that the independence of Ghana is\nmeaningless unless it is linked with the total liberation\nof the African continent. In keeping with that right of\nself-determination, we wish to restate our support for an\nindependent, prosperous Palestinian State, coexisting\npeacefully with a free, stable Israeli State.\n\nWe also reiterate our opposition to the continuous\nblockade on Cuba and call for an immediate lifting of\nthat embargo.\nThe twenty-first century can readily be described\nas the century for Africa. Last year, of the 10 fastest\ngrowing economies in the world, six were African.\nGhana, my own country, posted one of the highest\ngross domestic product growth rates, reaching as much\nas 14 per cent. Foreign direct investment amounted\nto some $1.5 billion across various sectors. That type\nof sustained growth in combination with security and\ndemocracy can only ensure an Africa that will bear no\nresemblance to the ghost of its former self. It will be an\nAfrica where we create equal opportunities for women\nto realize their full potential and where there is respect\nfor the rights of all human beings. The new Africa will\nwean itself from handouts and humanitarian relief. It\nwill not continue to succumb to the corruption and\noppression of despots.\nThe new Africa will stand on the world stage as\na mutual partner. True partnership, of course, must\nbe based on equality. When the founding fathers of\nthe United Nations established the Security Council\nsome 66 years ago, it was based on the reality of the\ntime. Almost seven decades later, the paradigms and\ndynamics of the world have shifted dramatically. The\nlines that divided our world and categorized it into\nhierarchies of first and third worlds \u2014 those lines were\ndrawn by settlers transforming once sovereign lands\ninto colonies and territories \u2014 all of those boundaries\nhave now become blurred.\nTechnology has made information more\nimmediately accessible to the general public and\nindividuals more accessible to one another. The world\nthat we know today is not the same world our fathers\nand grandfathers knew. Our world is smaller, more\nintegrated and familiar.\nThe current realities call for greater inclusion in\norder to consolidate our common security. They inform\nGhana\u2019s call for an expansion of the Security Council\nto admit more members in order to have a meaningful\nimpact on the many challenges that we all face. Africa\nis ready for that true and sincere partnership. Our time\nhas come."

        "file_text": "\ufeffSamoa commemorated\nthe fiftieth anniversary of its independence this year,\nat home and abroad. The Headquarters of the United\nNations was one of the venues, and for good reason.\nOur aspirations to be a sovereign State founded on\ndemocratic principles, Christian beliefs and our cultural\nvalues were ably facilitated by the United Nations. New\nZealand, as the administering Power, was sympathetic\nand supportive, which hastened the attainment of our\nindependence. Our people were given the choice to\ndecide the future of our country. The United Nations\nand the administering Power supported the process and\npaved the way. As we also heard from the President of\nthe United States, people everywhere must ultimately\nlong for the freedom to determine their destiny.\nHalf a century later, there still remain territories\ntoday, even in our Pacific region, where people have not been able to exercise their right to self-determination.\nIn the case of French Polynesia, we encourage the\nmetropolitan Power and the territory\u2019s leadership, with\nthe support of the United Nations, to find an amicable\nway to exercise the right of the people of the territory to\ndetermine their future.\nThe outcome document of the United\nNations Conference on Sustainable Development\n(resolution 66/288, annex) provides a blueprint for the\nfuture we want. It is a future we all signed on to, a\npartnership of shared responsibilities, commitments\nand undertakings among all Members, big and small.\nFor all the goals to be achieved, every country must\ndeliver on its pledges in good faith and not try to\nnegotiate a way out.\nFor Samoa, the gains include the reaffirmation\nthat small island developing States (SIDS) are a special\ncase in the area of sustainable development, owing\nto their unique and particular vulnerabilities. But\nacknowledging the vulnerabilities of SIDS without the\nattendant resources for strengthening their resilience\nmakes that achievement only a hollow victory. The\noceans and seas are resources that most members of\nour group have access to. The call to conserve and\nharness the marine biodiversity beyond national\njurisdictions, including taking a decision on developing\nan international instrument under the Convention on\nthe Law of the Sea, is a major achievement, worthy of\nsupport.\nThe decision to hold a SIDS review meeting in\n2014 is important and timely. Samoa\u2019s offer to host\nthat meeting is a matter of record. Coincidentally, 2014\nholds special significance for our country. Barring\nany natural catastrophes, we will graduate from the\ncategory of least-developed countries (LDCs) on\n1 January of that year. That was one of the motives for\nour bid to host the SIDS review meeting. We want to\nunderscore that, through genuine partnerships with\ndevelopment partners, our small island developing\nState, which is also an LDC, has been able to markedly\nraise our country\u2019s socioeconomic situation and our\npeople\u2019s standard of living. It is important that every\nMember State be afforded the opportunity to host\nUnited Nations meetings, and the success of meetings\nshould be measured on the quality of the decisions and\ncommitments agreed to, not merely on considerations\nof costs and numbers of participants.\nThe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) are\nnot merely aspirations of what might be, but tangible outcomes of what should be. By their very nature, they\nare a restatement of our peoples\u2019 development needs\nand hopes. Thus for us, the achievement of the MDGs\nby 2015 is not just a matter of pride but one of necessity,\nand we will continue to do everything possible to bring\nabout the desired result. Success would also mean that\nwe would start the post-2015 sustainable development\ngoals framework at higher thresholds, which would\nhelp spur greater effort to improve the lives of more\nand more of our people.\nThe sustainable development goals that will succeed\nthe MDGs are already a major focus of attention in some\nquarters. From Samoa\u2019s perspective, clear, time-bound,\ntargeted and measurable global benchmarks are critical.\nWe must ensure that the post-2015 development agenda\nbuilds on the important progress made in the MDG\nprocess and is expanded to cover broader sustainable\ndevelopment issues, as agreed on in Rio. We must\nalso ensure that the important priorities identified in\nthe outcomes of the 2014 SIDS meeting are integrated\ninto the post-2015 global development frameworks and\ncomprehensively addressed in order to respond to the\nneeds of SIDS.\nClimate change is the world\u2019s most urgent problem,\nrequiring a decisive global response. It is a challenge\nthat should unite and not divide us. Entrenched\npositions that ignore today\u2019s realities and pursue\nunrelated agendas have no role in our collective effort.\nAll countries are affected to varying degrees by climate\nchange. No one should be detached or unconcerned\nabout our common plight. We must work together, with\na sense of urgency and commitment, to address climate\nchange \u2014 today, not tomorrow. It should not be only\nscience that recommends what we should do, but also\nour consciences and the political will to follow through.\nWe clearly want leaders who view the world as a single\nconstituency where everyone works together within the\nlimits of their capacity and capability to be part of the\ntotal solution.\n\nThe climate change negotiating process has been a\nlong and frustrating journey, especially for small island\ndeveloping States, which contribute the least to the\ncauses of climate change yet stand to suffer the most,\nand are least able to effectively adapt to its adverse\nimpacts. Climate change cannot be wished away. Even\nthose countries that have been in denial to date must\nsurely now accept the weight of scientific evidence.\nClimate change, facilitated largely through human\nactivity, poses one of the gravest threats to humankind\nand to the continuation of life in our world as we know\nit today.\nSamoa\u2019s unwavering support for United Nations\npeacekeeping work is underscored by its 12 years of\nuninterrupted police deployment in service of missions\nin Liberia, the Sudan, Timor-Leste and South Sudan.\nOur commitment is rooted in our firm belief in the role\nthat United Nations peacekeeping plays in helping to\neliminate the causes of conflict and in bringing about\npeace and stability. A peaceful environment helps to\nimprove the lives of those who have been affected by\nconflict and, ultimately, to achieve our common goal of\npeaceful coexistence for our peoples and nations.\nWe are determined to gradually increase over time\nthe level and number of our officers in peacekeeping\nduties. Regionally owned and coordinated solutions to\nregional upheavals can be quite effective and successful.\nThe Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands,\nunder the umbrella of the Pacific Islands Forum,\ndemonstrates the effectiveness of that approach very\nwell, and Samoa will continue to provide strong support\nto regionally owned solutions when required.\nSamoa reaffirms its unequivocal condemnation of\nterrorism in all its forms. Our continuing determination\nto work with other Member States to fight terrorism\nusing all possible means is consistent with human rights\nand the rule of law. The horror of terrorist atrocities\nis a common and almost daily occurrence. Terrorist\nacts committed under whatever pretext or purpose are\ndeplorable and morally unjustified. In its various forms\nand manifestations, terrorism is responsible for the\npermanent scars of horror and fear that have gripped\ninternational attention in recent years. Those attacks\nhave underlined the fact that when terrorists are able to\ninfiltrate national borders, no peoples or countries will\never be immune to the threat of terrorist violence.\nSo many innocent lives have been lost\nindiscriminately and unceremoniously. More than ever,\nterrorism is a major threat that must be confronted\nby a collective international response at the national,\nregional and international levels. It must be condemned\nin the strongest terms possible in order to send out\nan unequivocal message that it is neither accepted\nnor condoned and that perpetrators should not expect\nany sympathy for their actions. The tragic events in\nBenghazi recall and underscore the importance of all nations working together, including through the United\nNations, to implement practical and effective measures\nto provide for the protection, security and safety of\ndiplomatic and consular missions and representatives\nworldwide. Samoa will continue to work with\nlike-minded countries towards that goal.\nSamoa\u2019s membership of the United Nations is\ngrounded on the promise of the hope, equality and\njustice that the United Nations offers its Member States,\nirrespective of their economic, political or military\nstrength. States in leadership positions and those\naspiring to that status must lead responsibly and by\nexample. Every Member State, irrespective of its size\nor strength, should be able to contribute appropriately\nto decisions and actions of the United Nations in order\nto make our Organization an agent of change during\nchallenging times. The United Nations continues to play\nan important role in our collective effort to achieve its\nobjectives, whether in the areas of peace and security,\nthe environment, poverty alleviation, the fight against\nterrorism and many other challenges that threaten our\nworld.\nThis week, at the treaty event, I deposited Samoa\u2019s\ninstrument of ratification for the Kampala amendments\nto the Rome Statute of the International Criminal\nCourt. We ratified those amendments because we place\ngreat faith in the rule of law and the vital protection\nthat the law offers to all States, especially to the weak\nand small.\nLately, serious disputes have arisen among\nbordering States, with the potential to escalate into\nconfrontation with far-reaching consequences. We\nwould encourage the parties concerned to resolve their\ndifferences through appropriate peaceful settlement\narrangements.\nClearly, Member States can do only so much.\nWe need a committed Secretariat that is aware and\nsensitive to the needs of the peoples it exists to serve.\nThat is why Samoa supports the Secretary-General\u2019s\nvision to create a flexible and mobile professional\ncareer service to allow for quick and positive responses\nto the diverse demands of Member States. The need\nfor the United Nations to deliver as one entity cannot\nbe overemphasized. It adds value and quality to the\nprocess, eliminates waste, minimizes duplication, and\nensures that the scarce resources entrusted to its care\nare used optimally to supplement Member States\u2019 hard-\nearned contributions.\n\nThe United Nations remains the only viable\ninstitution that draws all the nations of our world\ntogether. The need to revitalize the General Assembly\nand reform the Security Council has been obvious for\nmany years. In the case of the Security Council, as\nlong as its composition and rules ignore today\u2019s global\nrealities, it will continue to struggle for legitimacy and\nstrain to effectively carry out its intended tasks, as has\nbeen witnessed over many years.\nSamoa remains firm in its position that the\npermanent and non-permanent membership categories\nof the Security Council should be expanded. Member\nStates with appropriate credentials and the disposition\nto contribute to the Council\u2019s work and resources\nshould be encouraged to apply for membership of that\nimportant organ of our Organization. Importantly, the\nintergovernmental process should continue in earnest\nduring the current session to bring finality to an issue\nthat has taxed Member States\u2019 patience and endurance\nfor over a decade and a half.\nIf the United Nations is to be truly reformed, we also\nneed a strengthened and revitalized General Assembly\nas the primary policy and decision-making organ of\nthe Organization. Moreover, we encourage the efforts\nunder way to streamline the work of the different United\nNations agencies to eliminate the wasting of resources\nand unnecessary duplication of time and effort.\nWe often congregate around points of commonality,\nfinding legitimacy and safety in numbers. It is\ndiversity, however, that has historically ensured human\nadaptability, resilience and true dynamism. Our own\nPacific region is going through a process of maturity,\nwhere subregionalism is evolving and the uniqueness\nof capacity and comparative advantages are coming to\nthe fore. The same can be said of our United Nations\nfamily and its dynamic leadership. Diversity can create\na platform for collective progress if, in the words of\nPresident Obama, \u201cwe ensure that we are strengthened\nby our differences, not defined by them\u201d.\nAs we heard from other leaders, including the\nSecretary-General and the President of the United\nStates, it is of critical importance that the Palestinians\nbe allowed to realize their right to a viable State of\ntheir own, existing alongside a secure and safe Jewish\nState of Israel. That has also been and continues to\nbe Samoa\u2019s long-standing position on the issue. We\nremain hopeful that current efforts to secure a peaceful,\ndurable and fair settlement in the Middle East will be successful. All efforts towards that goal rekindle hope\nand should be supported. A peace deal is central to\nproviding conditions conducive to the achievement of\na two-State solution.\nWe wish the President well as he leads the work of\nour General Assembly. We also wish to place on record\nour appreciation to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for\nthe leadership he brings to the work of our Organization,\nand to wish him success in the discharge of his key\nresponsibilities in the challenging times ahead."

        "file_text": "\ufeffFirst of\nall, on behalf of my country, I would like to welcome\nthe broad vision and the pertinence of the ideas put\nforward by the Secretary-General.\nI come from Belgium, one of the six founding\ncountries of the European Union (EU), a multicultural\nunion of 500 million people who, as President Obama\nhas reminded us, live in peace \u2014 something that I wish\nfor the entire world \u2014 after experiencing horrifying\nwars.\nBelgium provides a unique setting for political\ndecisions and international meetings. Brussels is\nthe capital of Europe and also the seat of NATO\nheadquarters. We are naturally open to the world. I\nmyself come from the city of Mons, which will be the\nEuropean cultural capital in 2015. In 2014, Belgium\nwill solemnly commemorate the centennial of the\nstart of the sad and painful First World War. We will\ndo so in memory of the young people from more than\n50 countries who, on our territory, defended the ideals\nof peace and freedom. In 2013, Antwerp will host the\nWorld Outgames, a gathering of tolerance and diversity, while the city of Li\u00e8ge is a candidate to host the World\u2019s\nFair in 2017. All those international events have a single\ngoal: to bring us closer together and to mobilize around\nuniversal values.\nFor my country, respect for life and human rights\nis fundamental. Whether we speak of the rights of the\nchild, of women or of refugees, or of the struggle against\nall forms of discrimination, a single principle guides\nmy country: the effective equality of all human beings,\nregardless of status or beliefs. In that light, Belgium will\njoin Slovenia in sponsoring a draft resolution against\nracial discrimination. I hope members will support it.\nAll heads of State and ministers share an immense\ncollective responsibility to ensure that women become\nequal to men worldwide at the political, social and\neconomic levels; to ensure that little girls are no\nlonger subjected to circumcision; and that acts of\nviolence against women are systematically fought and\neliminated.\nIn my country, women head three ministries: the\nMinistry of Justice, the Ministry of the Interior and\nthe Ministry of the Police. Significant efforts have\nalso been made to more effectively combat domestic\nviolence. Our national laws prohibit and punish all\nforms of discrimination, whether on the basis of gender\nor that of claimed race, disability or sexual orientation.\nIn my country, both marriage and adoption are open\nto same-sex couples. Those are grounds for pride in\nBelgium.\nWith the support of several countries of the European\nUnion, Belgium invites members to take vigorous,\nconcerted action in various realms of social life. I am\nthinking first and foremost of the decriminalization of\nsexual orientation and the promotion of the rights of\nlesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. In that\nregard, I welcome the initiative of UNESCO to counter\nhomophobia in schools.\nFor my country, freedom of religion, which is to\nsay the freedom to practise or not practise a religion,\nis fundamental. Belgium unequivocally condemns\nIslamophobia. We just as firmly condemn violence,\nwhich is unacceptable in all cases. We believe that\nhuman beings should be free to think what they wish\nand be able to express their indignation without ever\nresorting to violence. Diplomatic missions should be\ninviolable throughout the world. It is not by oppressing\nhuman beings or promoting violence that the fundamental challenges of prosperity, the well-being of\ncitizens and peace will be resolved.\nBelgium attaches particular importance to\nstrengthening the rule of law throughout the world. The\nreason for that is simple: in my country we are convinced\nthat the rule of law is necessary for development and\nprosperity. It contributes to a better world, because the\npurpose of the rule of law is to enable every human\nbeing to live, flourish and love in complete freedom.\nFor that reason, and in the spirit of mutual human\nrespect, we support the principle of the responsibility\nto protect victims of violence wherever they are. In\nthe same spirit, Belgium responded to the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s call by instituting 17 specific projects.\nThe rule of law and the enforcement of respect for\nhuman rights require us to step up the fight against\nimpunity. Belgium will continue its policy of active\ncooperation with international criminal tribunals. The\naction of the International Criminal Court will help to\nusher in an era of responsibility. It is incumbent upon all\nStates to cooperate with the Court. Belgium, together\nwith Slovenia and the Netherlands, calls on all States\nrepresented here to improve international cooperation\nin mutual legal assistance and extradition.\nAs the President of Brazil pointed out\n(see A/67/PV.6), the effects of the economic crisis\nand financial speculation are felt by every household.\nWhen the balance sheets of banks represent 300 per\ncent, 400 per cent or 600 per cent of gross domestic\nproduct \u2014 indeed, even more in some countries \u2014 we\nshould not be surprised that there is a direct link between\nbank management and the economic and budgetary\nhealth of sovereign States. In many countries in-depth\nstudies have been carried out and decisions taken, but\nclearly that is not enough. That is because the financial\nworld operates in line with the rhythm of its own peculiar\nlogic. Here at the United States the phenomenon is\nbetter understood than elsewhere. Programme trading\ndominates financial exchanges. The software reacts a\nmillion times faster than human traders, buying and\nselling thousands of shares every millionth of a second.\nWe must work together here at the international level to\nestablish oversight mechanisms for the financial world,\nwith a view to ensuring that it again assists more in job\ncreation and that it steers clear of risky management\npractices that compromise the economic and budgetary\nhealth of nations.\nIn Belgium we are working on the issue nationally\nand within the eurozone. But an agreed international approach is becoming indispensable. Beyond such\nin-depth reforms in the banking and financial sectors,\nlet us also dare to tax financial transactions. It is high\ntime that income derived from that source be used to\npromote prosperity for our people.\nThe Assembly is committed to the follow-up\nto the United Nations Conference on Sustainable\nDevelopment. We can never underline enough that we\nmust break with an economic development model that\ndevours natural resources and energy. Belgium supports\nthe Secretary-General\u2019s Sustainable Energy for All\ninitiative. It also stresses the importance of merging\nwithin one process the Millennium Development Goals\nand the sustainable development goals.\nI would like to turn to some regional issues that my\ncountry finds especially disturbing and tragic. In the\nGreat Lakes region, the situation in the eastern part of\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo, the resurgent\nviolence and the Mouvement du 23 Mars rebellion\ngreatly concern the Belgian Government, especially\nbecause of their serious impact on local populations.\nWe see images of massacres, rape, forced recruitment,\nincluding of children, pillaging, 400,000 internally\ndisplaced persons \u2014 all of it completely unacceptable.\nBelgium calls upon the countries of the region to\nredouble their efforts to put an end to the current\nrebellion. We also call for a response to the root causes\nof instability in the Great Lakes region. We commend\nthe Secretary-General\u2019s attention to the region and his\ninitiative in calling a high-level meeting tomorrow\non the crisis. Our Foreign Minister will attend, and\nBelgium stands ready to do what it can to help.\nThe territorial integrity of the Democratic Republic\nof the Congo must categorically be respected. All\nexternal support for the rebels must stop. Let us not\ndelude ourselves. Denying the facts does not make\nthem disappear. The facts on the ground give the lie to\nall denials. Belgium calls on all countries in the Great\nLakes region to pledge to respect the sovereignty of the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo. Belgium also urges\nthe Congolese authorities to institute the necessary\nreforms in the army and the police to re-establish the\nrule of law in the whole of its territory, including,\nobviously, the eastern part.\nI dearly hope that reason will prevail. Belgium is\nready to work to help restore trust among the countries\nof the region. We furthermore hope that direct relations\nbetween the President of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the President of Rwanda can be established\nand that it will speed progress towards a solution.\nAs to Syria, we are all deeply concerned by the\ndeteriorating situation of an impasse on the ground,\nand a political impasse as well. We are appalled by\nthe posture of a regime that kills its own citizens.\nBeyond the 30,000 dead there are at least 250,000\nrefugees in neighbouring countries, and even more\ninternally displaced. How is it that the collective human\nconscience is not in agreement to stop the massacre? I\nsay respectfully to the members of the Security Council\nthat we cannot knowingly allow such human suffering\nto go on. Unless we take action we are complicit in\ncrimes against humanity.\nBelgium has faith in and supports Joint Special\nRepresentative Lakhdar Brahimi. Belgium also supports\nthe efforts by Arab countries and hopes that they will\nbe successful. We must all hope for a political solution.\nOne thing is certain. Bashar Al-Assad must leave. The\nregime has lost all legitimacy. Given the urgency of the\nsituation and the approaching winter, Belgium urges\nthe international community to take concrete steps on\nthe humanitarian front and to come to the aid of the\nmillions of people affected. Humanitarian concerns are\nour highest priority. The Belgian Government provides\nfinancial support for humanitarian aid to the refugees.\nIn that connection, I will allow myself to insist\nthat my country demands earnestly that a solution be\nfound to enable humanitarian organizations to carry\nout their work, particularly in hospitals, in line with\ninternational humanitarian law. I believe that both the\nChinese and Russian authorities will be able to join us\nin those objectives.\nI have another comment concerning the region; I\nwish to mention the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Belgium\nfavours the rapid resumption of negotiations aimed\nat finding a solution based on the coexistence of two\nStates \u2014 the State of Israel and a State of Palestine that\nis independent, democratic, united and viable \u2014 living\ntogether in peace, security and prosperity. We also wish\nto state very clearly our opposition to the continuation\nof colonization.\nMy country believes that multilateralism is the only\nway to improve conditions of our planet. Belgium is the\nfifteenth largest contributor to the United Nations.\nLet us have the courage and strength to agree to\nfree humankind from wars and social injustices, and support its development. I invite all of us to spur our\nawareness. Let us demonstrate together our capacity to\nact."

The President\nof the General Assembly can be assured of the Malian\ndelegation\u2019s complete readiness to work with him for\nthe full success of his mandate.\nIn the same spirit, I express my great appreciation\nto his distinguished predecessor, Ambassador Nassir\nAbdulaziz Al-Nasser, for the excellent manner in which\nhe led the work of the previous session. I also take this\nopportunity to pay warm tribute to Secretary-General\nBan Ki-moon for his ongoing commitment to the ideals\nof the Organization. The settlement of international disputes by\npeaceful means, which the President proposed as the\ncentral theme of the general debate, is timely, as it\nis a part of Chapter VI of the Charter of the United\nNations, whose relevant provisions aim to limit hotbeds\nof tension through negotiation, mediation, conciliation,\narbitration, judicial settlement, resort to regional\narrangements or agreements, or through other peaceful\nmeans. The subject is quite current, in the light of\nthe many crises and conflicts that seriously threaten\ninternational peace and security.\nThe settlement of disputes by peaceful means is\nparticularly important for my country, Mali, as it is a\ncountry that is firmly attached to the ideals of peace\nand stability. Despite that, today it is undergoing one\nof the most difficult periods in its history. Its northern\npart has been occupied by armed groups consisting\nof fundamentalist terrorists, drug traffickers and\ncriminals of every other sort. The most fundamental\nhuman rights are being violated continuously by a\nhorde of heartless and lawless vandals.\nThe Government of Mali has just requested the\nInternational Criminal Court to consider those odious\nacts, which are no more and no less than war crimes\nand crimes against humanity. Whipping, amputation,\nsummary execution, rape, stoning and looting and\ndestruction of cultural and historical monuments and\nsites are the daily lot of the afflicted and helpless people\nof northern Mali.\nThat sad situation led the interim President of\nthe Republic of Mali to request, on 1 September, the\nEconomic Community of West African States for\nassistance in recovering the occupied territories and\nfighting terrorism. Similar requests have been made to\nthe Security Council through the Secretary-General,\nas well as to the French Republic, the United States of\nAmerica, the African Union and the European Union.\nHowever, I would like to firmly emphasize that a\nlasting solution to the situation in the Sahel requires\nstronger and more dynamic cooperation among the\nStates of the Sahel-Saharan region. In that vein, the\nGovernment of Mali remains in favour of the convening\nof a meeting of heads of State and Government of the\nSahel region, with the support of the United Nations\nand other partners, in order to support and strengthen\ncapacities and the arrangement for coordinating\nexisting regional mechanisms. In the specific case of our common area, the\nneighbouring countries of Algeria, Mali, Mauritania\nand the Niger have set up mechanisms, such as the\njoint operational military staff committee based in\nTamanrasset, Algeria, and others involving joint patrols\nand the right of pursuit. But we must recognize that those\nmechanisms need to be fully operational. In that regard,\nI would like to call for the support of the international\ncommunity for their effective implementation.\nMy delegation would like to strongly emphasize\nthat the aggression and occupation in the northern part\nof Mali is a major collateral consequence of the Libyan\ncrisis, as indicated in the report of the joint United\nNations/African Union mission to assess the impact of\nthe Libyan crisis in the Sahel region (see S/2012/42).\nThe Security Council considered that report in\nJanuary (see S/PV.6709).\nThe presence today of terrorist groups of various\nnationalities on our soil and in the Sahel region is a\nsituation that should mobilize the entire international\ncommunity to take joint, rapid and effective action,\nbecause that threat knows no bounds. Here I should\nlike to reiterate the determination of the Government of\nMali to continue the work that it has begun jointly with\nother core countries in the framework of the combat\nagainst terrorism, transnational organized crime and\nirredentist, subversive forces in the Sahelo-Saharan\nregion.\nIn parallel with that approach, I should like to\nreaffirm the commitment undertaken by the interim\nPresident and the Government of Mali to negotiate\nwith our compatriots who are not terrorists. I have\nsaid it before and I will say it again from this United\nNations rostrum: we in Mali are not afraid or ashamed\nof negotiating, but we will not negotiate with terrorists.\nWe are not prepared to negotiate issues that call into\nquestion the integrity of our territory and the secular\nnature of the country.\nThe situation in northern Mali due to the occupation\nhas resulted in a deterioration in humanitarian\nconditions, which were already precarious owing to\nthe f low of internally displaced persons and of people\nseeking refuge in neighbouring countries. Because of\nthe crisis, more than 350,000 people have had to f lee\nnorthern Mali, including 84,000 internally displaced\npersons and more than 268,000 others who are refugees\nin neighbouring countries. The crisis has also hampered\naccess to education for more than 560,000 school-age children, 300,000 of whom were in school before the\ncrisis began.\nThere has also been damage to educational facilities\nand equipment. In addition, 85 per cent of all teachers\nand 10,000 pupils have been displaced to the south, and\n50,000 school-age children are now in neighbouring\ncountries. Furthermore, schools have been occupied by\nflood-affected people in the south.\nAs the Assembly is aware, Mali is facing tremendous\nhumanitarian needs in terms of housing, food, health,\neducation and nutrition for refugees, displaced persons\nand wage earners. During his stay in the region, the\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugees stated\non 31 July 2012 that the crisis in Mali was \u201cone of the\nmost neglected humanitarian situations in the world\u201d.\nHe said that from an appeal for $153 million, his Office\nhad received only about $49 million to deal with that\nhumanitarian crisis.\nThe Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian\nAffairs, Ms. Valerie Amos noted during her visit to\nMali in August that $213 million was needed to deal\nwith the humanitarian crisis that is currently affecting\nmy country. That shows that the humanitarian situation\nis continuing to deteriorate, thus increasing the cost of\nintervention.\nHere I would like to reiterate the gratitude of the\npeople and the Government of Mali to all brotherly\ncountries and all partners of goodwill for their\nhospitality in hosting our compatriots and for their\ngenerous contributions. I therefore call for a greater\nmobilization by all of Mali\u2019s partners and friends as\nwell as the coordination of aid for Mali nationals who\nare displaced or refugees.\nOur Government of National Unity was established\non 20 August 2012, with the fundamental mission of\nquickly liberating the northern regions of the country\nand of holding democratic, transparent, just and\ncredible elections. With a view to recovering territorial\nintegrity, we are calling for the adoption by the Security\nCouncil of a resolution authorizing, under Chapter VII\nof the Charter of the United Nations, intervention by\nan international military force so as to help the Malian\narmy to retake and ensure the security of our national\nterritory.\nThe Government of Mali would like to see the\nimmediate arrival of such a force to support the defence\nand security forces of Mali in carrying out their noble mission of recovering and maintaining our territorial\nintegrity and of protecting persons and property. The\npeople of Mali continue to hope that the members of\nthe Security Council will give due consideration to that\nrequest.\nI should therefore like to take this opportunity to\nreiterate the gratitude of the people and the Government\nof Mali to the Economic Community of West African\nStates, the African Union and to the United Nations for\ntheir ongoing efforts to put a lasting end to the crisis in\nMali, which also threatens the stability of the subregion\nand of Africa, and even beyond.\nOur meetings are taking place at a time when\ndeveloping countries are facing many major challenges,\nin particular the consequences of the economic and\nfinancial crisis, the burden of external debt and a decline\nin development assistance. There is therefore a need to\nundertake a more in-depth dialogue on new strategies\naimed at mobilizing additional stable and predictable\nresources so as to ensure financing for development\nprogrammes and the achievement of the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals, in particular in the areas of health,\neducation, food security and the environment.\nClimate change is one of the major challenges facing\nthe world. The very survival of our planet is threatened\nby natural disasters caused by that phenomenon, which\nis seriously affecting living conditions in countries of\nthe Sahel such as mine through, inter alia, the inexorable\nadvance of the desert; the silting of rivers, in particular\nthe river Niger; ecosystem deterioration; f loods; and\nproblematic precipitation patterns.\nI should like to highlight the need to find appropriate\nresponses to this serious situation so as to avert tragic\nrepercussions for sustainable development in the most\nvulnerable countries.\nThe United Nations has a pivotal role to play in the\nbuilding of a new world order that is based on justice,\nsolidarity and sustainable development. In order to\ntackle current and future challenges, it is important\nthat the current mode of functioning of the United\nNations be reviewed so as to take into account the new\nconfiguration of the world, which is fundamentally\ndifferent from that which prevailed at the time of its\nfounding. Such a review should, inter alia, make it\npossible to correct the historical imbalance that results\nin the continued exclusion of Africa from the limited\ncircle of the countries that are permanent members of\nthe Security Council.\n\nTo conclude, I hope that all present will agree\nwith me that the situation in Mali is a manifestation of\nsecurity problems in the Sahel and that it should be dealt\nwith comprehensively through the appropriate United\nNations mechanisms. It is therefore urgent to act, first\nof all to put an end to the suffering of the people of Mali,\nand secondly to prevent the development of a similar or\nworse situation for other peoples in the Sahel, or even\nthe rest of the world.\nIt is also urgent to act because criminal and terrorist\nactivities in northern Mali and the security risks that\nthey pose for the entire subregion are in the long term a\nserious threat to the rest of the world.\nFinally, it is urgent to act so as to resume cooperation\nwith our bilateral and multilateral partners so as to\nconsolidate a republic based on secular and democratic\nvalues.\nToday my people are seriously affected. But\nMalians have not lost hope, because they are convinced\nof the support of other nations, whose leaders and\nrespresentatives are here. Malians in both the north and\nthe south legitimately await their active solidarity to\nemerge from the crisis. My people are convinced that\ntheir appeal for international solidarity will be heard\nand followed up with appropriate measures. Malians\nknow that nations have the means. They look forward to\ndecisive and diligent action. At stake is the stability and\nsecurity of our subregion, of Africa and of the world."

        "file_text": "\ufeffBefore I begin my statement,\nI want to express the strongest condemnation of the\nrecent acts of incitement to hatred perpetrated against\nthe faith of the billions of Muslims around the world\nand our beloved Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon\nhim. Although we can never condone violence, the\ninternational community must not remain a silent\nobserver and should criminalize such acts, which destroy\nthe peace of the world and endanger global security by\nabusing the freedom of expression. Pakistan asks that\nthe United Nations immediately address this matter of\ngreat alarm and concern and bridge the widening rift in\norder to enable the comity of nations to be one again.\n\nI would like to congratulate the President on\nhis election to his important post and to convey our\nappreciation to the previous President, His Excellency\nMr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser, from the brotherly\nstate of Qatar, who carried out his work with skill. I\nwould also like to express our appreciation for the\nlaudable work of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. We\ngreatly appreciate his leadership in guiding the work\nof the Organization. It is a special privilege to be at\nthe General Assembly today, representing the brave and\ncourageous people of Pakistan.\nGlobally, we face enormous challenges. But with\ncollective efforts and commitment we can provide our\npeople with a better future. We must work to end poverty.\nWe must work to protect the planet and mitigate climate\nchange. We must ensure that all people have equal\nrights, and we must protect the weak and vulnerable.\nWe must pursue justice and fairness for all. We must\npursue the peaceful settlement of international disputes.\nWe must save our current and future generations from\nthe horrors of war. I think of my own children and the\ngenerations of unborn children yet to come. They, and\nall the children of the world, deserve safety, stability\nand security. Those goals have guided me throughout\nmy four years in office as President of Pakistan. They\nare the goals and principles about which I want to talk\ntoday.\nPakistan\u2019s engagement with the United Nations\nlies at the heart of those goals. We are proud of going\nabove and beyond the call of duty in fulfilling our\ninternational responsibilities. Pakistan has consistently\nbeen among the top United Nations peacekeeping troop\ncontributors for many years. Today, more than 10,000\nPakistani troops proudly wear the Blue Helmet of the\nUnited Nations in the service of our brothers and sisters\naround the world.\nOur election to the Security Council reflects\nour commitment to world peace. It is also a vote of\nconfidence in Pakistan on the part of the international\ncommunity.The United Nations represents our common\naspirations for peace and development. However, it\nneeds reform. The United Nations system must become\nmore democratic and accountable, and reform should\nbe based on consensus and democratic principles.\nIn the last several years, Pakistan has repeatedly\nsuffered natural calamities. The people of Pakistan\nappreciate the support of the United Nations and the\ninternational community in that connection.\n\nBeing a democratic country, we believe that\nthe legitimate aspirations of any people should be\naccommodated peacefully and in a manner consistent\nwith the sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity of\nStates. We support the rights of the Palestinian people\nand an independent Palestinian State. We also favour\nthe admission of Palestine to full membership of the\nUnited Nations.\nThere are many questions that are asked of\nPakistan these days. I am not here to answer questions\nabout Pakistan. The people of Pakistan have already\nanswered them. The politicians of Pakistan have\nanswered them. The soldiers of Pakistan have answered\nthem. We have lost more than 7,000 Pakistani soldiers\nand policemen, and more than 37,000 civilians. We\nhave lost our Minister for Minority Affairs, Shahbaz\nBhatti, and my friend Salmaan Taseer, Governor of\nPunjab, our most populous province, to the actions\nof extremists. And I need not remind my friends here\ntoday that I bear a personal scar. On 27 December 2007,\nknowing that her life was under threat from the mindset\nthat she had warned the world against, Pakistan\u2019s first\nelected female leader, and my wife, Shaheed Mohtarma\nBenazir Bhutto, was martyred by the bullets and bombs\nof terrorists. Terrorism and extremism have destroyed\nhuman lives, torn the social fabric and devastated the\neconomy. Our economy, our lives and our ability to live\nin the shadow of our Sufi saints and our freedom-loving\nforefathers have been challenged.\nWe have responded. Our soldiers have responded.\nSo I am not here to answer questions about Pakistan.\nI am here to ask some questions on behalf of the\nPakistani people: on behalf of the two-year-old baby\nwho was killed in the bombing at Lahore\u2019s Moon\nMarket on 7 December 2009; on behalf of Pervaiz\nMasih, a Christian Pakistani who was killed with six\nothers while trying to protect Muslim Pakistanis during\na bomb attack on Islamic University in Islamabad on\n20 October 2009; on behalf of Commandant Siffat\nGha-yoor of the Frontier Constabulary police force in\nPeshawar, who was martyred by militants on 4 August\n2010; on behalf of the traders and businessmen in\nPeshawar, Quetta, Lahore and Karachi and in the\ndozens of marketplaces that have been ravaged by\nmultiple bombings, over and over and over again; and,\nperhaps most of all, on behalf of my three children,\nwhose mother, Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto, was\nalso martyred by terrorists.\n\nFor more than 30 years, our doors have been open\nto our Afghan brothers and sisters.\nFor many years, we were left to fend for ourselves\nand our Afghan guests.\nI remember the red carpet that was rolled out for all\nthe dictators in our country \u2014 dictators who promised\nthe international community the moon \u2014 while Pakistan\nwas kept in the dark. Those dictators and their regimes\nare responsible for suffocating and throttling Pakistan,\nPakistan\u2019s institutions and Pakistan\u2019s democracy. I\nremember the judicial execution of Pakistan\u2019s first\nelected leader, Shaheed Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto. I remember\nthe jailing of Pakistan\u2019s elected leaders.\nI remember the 12 years that I myself spent in\nprison, and I remember the billions provided by the\ninternational community to support those dictatorships.\nMy country\u2019s social fabric and its very character have\nbeen altered. Our condition today is a product of\ndictatorship.\nNo country and no people has suffered more in the\nepic struggle against terrorism than Pakistan. Drone\nstrikes and civilian casualties on our territory add to the\ncomplexity of our battle for hearts and minds through\nthis epic struggle. To those who say that we have not\ndone enough, I say in all humility: please do not insult\nthe memory of our dead and the pain of our living. Do\nnot ask of my people what no one has ever asked of any\nother people. Do not demonize the innocent women and\nchildren of Pakistan, and please, stop this refrain to do\nmore. The simplest question of all is: how much more\nsuffering can Pakistan endure?\nI am sure that the international community does not\nwant any suffering anywhere, least of all in Pakistan.\nWe believe, in fact, that the international community is\na partner. That is because it is in the common interest\nof all nations to work together.\nIn Pakistan, I have helped bring about a major\nstrategic shift in how we view working together. Within\nPakistan, our democracy has brought about major\nchanges. God willing, this will be the first civilian\nGovernment in Pakistan\u2019s 66-year history to complete\nits full five-year term.\nIn that time, Parliament has passed unprecedented\nreforms. We have restored the consensus 1973\nConstitution.\n\nThe National Assembly has enacted wide-ranging\nsocial reforms. We have established a National\nCommission on Women and a National Commission\non Human Rights. We have established, for the first\ntime, a truly independent election commission, to\nensure free, fair and transparent elections. Our media\nis free, uncensored and thriving. Our civil society is\nflourishing under the protection of democracy. We have\ncreated the first social safety net, through the women of\nPakistan, for the weak and less privileged. Millions of\nfamilies have benefitted. We have aided the poor and at\nthe same time empowered the women of our households.\nThat safety net is called the Benazir Income Support\nProgramme. These are the gifts of democracy. This is\nthe dream of Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto.\nThe growing regional pivot in Pakistan\u2019s foreign\npolicy is a symbol of our democratic policy-making. In\nengaging with our region, we are changing the future.\nIn China, our strategic partnership is growing from\nstrength to strength. In Afghanistan, we have begun to\nengage and deepen our friendship with the entire range\nof the Afghan political spectrum.\nWe believe that a sovereign, stable and secure\nAfghanistan is good for the Afghan people, and what\nis good for the Afghan people is good for Pakistan.\nWhile our hearts and homes remain open to our\nAfghan brothers, it is imperative that the international\ncommunity support the 3 million Afghan refugees in\nPakistan in their quest to return home with dignity. A\nbrighter Afghan future will be possible only when the\nquest for peace is Afghan-owned, Afghan-driven and\nAfghan-led.\nWe respect and support the efforts of the\nGovernment of Afghanistan for reconciliation and\npeace. Pakistan will support in every way possible any\nprocess that reflects Afghan national consensus.\nSimilarly, we approach our relations with India\non the basis of mutual trust. The contacts between\nour leadership are expanding. I was encouraged by\nmy discussions last month in Tehran with the Prime\nMinister of India, whom I met with for the fifth time\nin four years.\nOur principled position on territorial disputes\nremains the bedrock of our foreign policy. We will\ncontinue to support the rights of the people of Jammu\nand Kashmir to peacefully choose their destiny in\naccordance with the Security Council\u2019s long-standing\nresolutions on this matter. Kashmir remains a symbol of the failures, rather than the strengths, of the United\nNations system. We feel that a resolution of these issues\ncan be arrived at only in an environment of cooperation.\nBy normalizing trade relations, we want to create\na regional South Asian narrative. Such a narrative will\nprovide an environment that will mutually benefit the\ncountries of our region.\nAlong this road, there are pitfalls. One of them\nis the tendency to respond to failure through blame.\nPakistan does not blame others for the challenges it\nfaces. We believe that we should look for a win-win\nsolution. Regional cooperation and connectivity will\nbring us closer and bind us together. It will make us\nstakeholders in one another\u2019s futures. Our hosting of a\nquadrilateral summit next month and our signing of the\nAfghan-Pakistan Transit Trade Agreement are proof of\nthat commitment to regional connectivity.\nIn Pakistan, the lesson we learned from the last 30\nyears is that history cannot be changed, but the future\ncan \u2014 to a future that is brighter, more prosperous\nand more secure, not only for Pakistanis but for all the\npeoples of the region, and, indeed, the world.\nI must thank the member States of the European\nUnion (EU) for recognizing the value of trade to\nPakistan. We seek trade, rather than aid. By granting\ntrade concessions to Pakistan, the EU has sent a\npositive message. Those concessions will help us revive\nthe economy and fight terrorism.\nAs we embark on this ambitious transformative\nexperience, we are aware that there are threats and\npitfalls. One of them is the expanding illegal trade of\nheroin. Despite the presence of international forces in\nAfghanistan, the size of the heroin trade has increased\nby 3,000 per cent in the last decade. The heroin industry\nis eroding the social fabric of our society.\nTerrorist activities within our region and, indeed,\nall over the world are funded and fuelled by the\nunrestricted production and sale of illegal drugs.\nPakistan has pursued an ambitious agenda to control\nthat menace. We are coordinating with our neighbours\nand will hold a conference later this year to develop a\nunified approach to stamping out the drug trade.\nMy call upon this body, and especially those nations\nrepresented here that are actively engaged in the region,\nis: here, today, let us begin to work together.\n\nI have committed my presidency and my nation\u2019s\nfuture to a paradigm shift, a permanent democratic\nfuture for Pakistan. It has not been easy, but nothing\nworth fighting for is. We long ago stopped thinking\nof doing what is easy. Instead, we have committed\nourselves to doing what is right. In that regard, I recall\nthe powerful words of my beloved martyred wife and\nmy leader, Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto, when\nshe appeared before this body 16 years ago.\nHer words ring out and guide us into a new future.\nShe said in 1996,\n\u201cI dream of a third millennium in which the\ngap between rich and poor evaporates; in which\nilliteracy, hunger, malnutrition and disease are\nat long last conquered; in which every child is\nplanned, wanted, nurtured and supported; and in\nwhich the birth of a girl is welcomed with the same\njoy as that of a boy. I dream of a millennium of\ntolerance and pluralism, in which people respect other people, nations respect other nations, and\nreligions respect other religions.\n\u201cThat is the third millennium I see for my\ncountry and others\u201d. (A/51/PV.20, p.4)\nWe have made some progress towards achieving\nthose goals. But so much remains to be done. In her\nmemory and in the name of God Almighty, Pakistan\ncommits to that path again today.\nMay peace be upon all countries and their people."

        "file_text": "\ufeffThis is the\nfirst time that I speak from this rostrum at the United Nations. It is a very moving moment for me because\nI understand what the United Nations represents, for\nour world, and what it has represented historically. I am\nalso aware of a sense of responsibility, because France\nis a permanent member of the Security Council and\ntherefore has duties. I am also here at this rostrum to\ntalk about values that do not belong to any particular\npeople, are not owned by any particular continent\nand are not the privilege of any particular part of the\npopulation.\nI am here to talk about universal values, which\nFrance has always proclaimed, and about the rights\nof every human being, wherever they live: liberty,\nsecurity and resistance to oppression. Those values\nand those rights are all too frequently held in contempt\nin our world, especially as we face three main threats,\nwhich we must tackle head-on. The first is the threat\nof fanaticism, which fuels violence. We have seen\nthat yet again in recent days. The second is the global\neconomy, which has been affected by a crisis and which\nperpetuates intolerable inequalities. The third threat is\nthe disturbance in the climate system, which threatens\nthe very survival of our planet.\nThe mission of the United Nations is to tackle these\nchallenges and to find strong and just responses to them\ntogether. These responses must be just because without\njustice, force is blind, and they must be strong because\nwithout strength, justice is powerless.\nI am also here to express France\u2019s confidence in\nthe United Nations. In recent years, we have been able\ntogether, to finally put an end to deadly conflicts, and\nwe have been able to prevent confrontations. However,\njust as we are sending out 100,000 Blue Helmets who\nact on our behalf \u2014 and I would like to pay tribute to\nthem \u2014 because of divisions, the blocking of our own\ninstitutions and inertia, the United Nations has not been\nable to put an end to war, atrocities and attacks on the\nrights of peoples.\nI would therefore, on behalf of France, draw one\nconclusion that I would like to share with the Assembly.\nIf we want to make our world safer, it is up to us to fully\nshoulder our responsibilities. How can we do so?\nFirst of all, we can do so by reforming our own\nOrganization, the United Nations. The Security Council\nmust better reflect the realities of the world today. This\nis why I would once again recall that France supports\nthe request for an enlargement of the Council made\nby Germany, Japan, India and Brazil. But we are also in favour of an increased African presence, including\namong the permanent members. Having a seat on the\nSecurity Council is not a privilege justified by history,\nand it is not a matter of satisfying some ambition related\nto economic power. No, having a seat on the Security\nCouncil means making the commitment to take action\nto promote peace in the world. Indeed, we must act and\nact together, but act quickly, because it is urgent.\nThe most urgent situation is in Syria. The Assembly\nhas several times denounced the massacres carried out\nby the Syrian regime, called for those responsible to be\nprosecuted and expressed the desire for a democratic\ntransition. But the ordeal of the population continues to\nthis day. There have been almost 30,000 deaths in the\nlast 18 months. How many more deaths will we wait for\nbefore we take action? How can we allow the paralysis\nof the United Nations to continue?\nI know one thing for certain: the Syrian regime\nwill never again take its place among the alliance of\nnations. It has no future among us. This is why I have\ntaken the decision, on behalf of France, to recognize the\nprovisional Government representing the new Syria as\nsoon as it is formed. That Government will itself have\nto give guarantees that every community in Syria will\nbe respected and will be able to live in security in their\nown country. Without further delay, I would ask that\nthe United Nations immediately give the Syrian people\nall of the assistance and support they are requesting\nand, in particular, that the liberated areas be protected\nand humanitarian aid be assured for refugees. As for\nthe leaders in Damascus, they must know that the\ninternational community will not stand by if they take\nthe unhappy decision to use chemical weapons.\nAnother situation that is urgent is the fight against\nthe most serious of threats to stability in the world,\nnamely, the proliferation of nuclear weapons. For several\nyears now, Iran has been ignoring the demands of the\ninternational community. It shuns monitoring by the\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency. It does not keep\nits word or uphold Security Council resolutions. I had\nhoped that negotiations could take place in earnest and\nthat steps could be outlined, but, again, no negotiations\nhave taken place. France will not accept such actions,\nwhich threaten not only security in the region but peace\nthroughout the world.\nI therefore state once again that we are prepared to\nadopt new sanctions, not to punish the great people of Iran, but to tell their leaders that enough is enough and\nthat negotiations must be resumed before it is too late.\nThe third urgent issue is at last to find a solution to\nthe Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The status quo is not a\nresponse; it is an impasse. France will make every effort\nto re-establish the basis for negotiations leading to the\ncoexistence of the two States in question; everyone\nknows that this is the only solution that could lead to a\njust and lasting peace in the region.\nThe last of the urgent issues that I will mention,\nalthough there are many others, might be the most\nimportant one for us to focus on this week: the Sahel.\nThe situation created by the occupation of territory\nin northern Mali by terrorist groups is intolerable,\ninadmissible and unacceptable. It is unacceptable not\nonly for Mali, which is affected by that terrorist threat,\nbut also for all countries of the region and beyond the\nregion \u2014 all of those that one day might be affected by\nterrorism.\nThe African Union, which I commend, and the\nEconomic Community of West African States have said\nthat they are prepared to take courageous decisions.\nThe authorities of Mali have spoken; there is no time to\nlose. France will support any initiative that will enable\nthe Africans themselves to resolve that issue within the\nframework of international law, with a clear mandate\nfrom the Security Council. Mali must recover its\nterritorial integrity, and terrorism must be eliminated\nfrom that area of the Sahel.\nThe role of the United Nations is to respond to\nurgent situations. But there is another objective that\nshould unite us here, and that is development. The\nUnited Nations Conference on Environment and\nDevelopment, held in Rio, in which I participated, was\na disappointing stage for some and an encouraging one\nfor others. I believe that today we have an agenda that\nshould encompass economic growth, poverty reduction,\nsocial progress and environmental protection. That is\nwhat we need to do over the long term.\nThe 2015 deadline for a climate agreement is fast\napproaching. I wish to state here that France is ready to\nhost the United Nations conference on climate change\nto be held at that time, because I want us to succeed\ntogether in meeting that challenge.\nIn parallel, I would recall that one of the\ndisappointments of Rio was our failure to agree on\nthe creation of a major United Nations organization for the environment. That remains France\u2019s objective.\nSuch an agency would be based in Africa, because\nthat continent, which has been neglected for too long,\nis facing climate-related challenges. It would also be\nhighly symbolic to entrust Africa with such a global\nagency for the environment.\nWith respect to development, I believe that we\nshould face reality. We will not achieve the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals without new resources. Everyone\nknows the budgetary limitations of our respective\nStates. That is why today, from this rostrum here at the\nUnited Nations, I am making an appeal for innovative\nfinancing, which would give us the means to enable our\norganizations to fight effectively against diseases such\nas HIV/AIDS and malaria.\nI would like to commend the success of the\nInternational Drug Purchase Facility, which was\nfinanced by a tax on airline tickets. That path\nhas been opened, and today we must take another\nstep in that direction. I propose a tax on financial\ntransactions \u2014 which several European Union countries\nhave already agreed to \u2014 aimed at slowing down the\nmovement of capital or at least financing development\nand helping to fight health-related scourges. France\nhas adopted such a tax. We have also made another\ncommitment: to dedicate at least 10 per cent of the\nbenefits of that tax to development and to fight health-\nrelated threats and pandemics.\nThat is the message that I wanted to send to the\nAssembly today: let us ensure that a global tax on\nfinancial transactions can be levied and that the benefits\nit yields can be spent on development and fighting\npandemics. That would be an excellent example of what\nI call the globalization of solidarity, and one of the best\nideas that today\u2019s world could implement.\nBut the mission of the United Nations is not only\nto fight financial instability or ensure that development\nremains at the centre of our concerns: it is to work to\ncounter all forms of instability. I am thinking here about\ndrug trafficking, a scourge that affects producing, transit\nand consuming countries. To combat drug traffickers,\nwho are frequently allied with terrorist networks, the\nUnited Nations must elaborate and implement a global\nstrategy to fight against drugs.\nArms trafficking also poses a major threat. France\nis firmly committed to the conclusion of a universal\narms trade treaty. What the United Nations must defend\nand promote is a worldview that is based on respect for fundamental rights and freedoms. The Arab Spring\nshowed that those values are universal and apply to all\ncontinents and countries.\nI want to welcome the events that took place in\nTunisia, in Libya, in Egypt. It is true that transitions\nare not always easy. There are risks, and setbacks can\noccur. Some may attempt, through violence, to reverse\nthe progress made and the achievements gained. France\nwill call on the new political authorities emanating\nfrom democratic elections in those countries to wage an\nunrelenting combat against complacency, extremism,\nfanaticism, hatred, intolerance and violence, whatever\nthe provocation may be, because there can never be any\njustification for violence.\nFrance wants to set an example. It is not telling\nanyone what to do; that is simply its history and its\nmessage. We want to be an example in the promotion of\nfundamental freedoms. That is our combat, and we are\nhonoured to wage it. That is why France will continue\nto fight to abolish the death penalty, to ensure women\u2019s\nright to equality and dignity, and to work towards the\nuniversal decriminalization of homosexuality, which\ncannot be viewed as a crime but must be recognized as\nan orientation.\nWe will continue to fight for the protection of\ncivilians. Moreover, I recall that the Assembly affirmed\nthe principle that all States have the responsibility to\nensure the security of their civilians. If a State fails\nin that obligation, it is up to us, the United Nations,\nto use the means at its disposal to meet it in its place.\nLet us not neglect that promise, as it can serve us. I\nam thinking, in particular, of what is happening in the\nDemocratic Republic of Congo, where civilians are the\nmain victims of clashes and where foreign interference\nmust cease as soon as possible.\n\nThose are the goals that France will support and\ndefend at the United Nations. France has confidence in\nthe United Nations. We know that no State, however\npowerful, can deal with emergencies, undertake the\nfight for development or overcome all crises. No State\ncan do that, but, on the contrary, if we act together, we\nwill live up to our responsibilities. France wants the\nUnited Nations to be the centre and the framework for\nglobal governance, but do the States that make up the\nOrganization want that to be our purpose and goal?\n\nI say in all seriousness that when there is paralysis,\ninertia and inaction, injustice and intolerance find their\nplace. What I would like members to understand is that\nwe must act in order to shoulder our responsibilities\nand to deal with urgent situations, such as Syria,\nnuclear proliferation and the Sahel. We must also work\nfor another world that is based on development and\ninnovative financing and for the fight against health\ncrises. We must act, always and together. Let us live up\nto the mission entrusted to us and to the expectations of\npeoples. That is France\u2019s message."

        "file_text": "\ufeffThe primary mission of the\nUnited Nations is to \u201csave succeeding generations from the scourge of war, which... has brought untold sorrow\nto mankind\u201d. Those are the words of the Charter of the\nUnited Nations: the legacy of our predecessors. Our\nhistory tells us that conflict grows in the spaces where\nhuman rights are denied; that, where deprivation,\ninequality and injustice erode human dignity and\npotential, conflict is the consequence; that war follows\nhunger, and hunger follows war. That is why the Charter\nexpresses in simple and clear terms our commitment\nto fundamental human rights. It reaffirms our \u201cfaith\nin the dignity and worth of the human person, in the\nequal rights of men and women and of nations large\nand small\u201d.\nWords can at times become too familiar, so familiar\nthat their force and impact fade with time. We who\ngather here each year must remind ourselves what we\nstand for, reflect honestly on what we have achieved and\nwhat we have not achieved, and rededicate ourselves to\nthe ideals set out in our Charter. We must make those\nlofty words relevant again to the peoples for whom we\nspeak here.\nThe struggle for human rights is being fought every\nday in every region of the world. There are too many\nforgotten places and forgotten causes. We must not turn\naway from the dark corners where the media spotlight\ndoes not shine or from which the media spotlight has\nlong departed. We must speak here for the five-year-\nold child, without a family, struggling to survive in a\nrefugee camp; for the hungry mother cradling a dying\ninfant at a feeding station; for those who cannot speak\npublicly in their own lands and who look to us here\nfor the vindication of their basic rights; for those who\nbelieve in the words of our Charter and expect us to act\non them.\nWhat is happening in Syria is an affront to\nhumanity. Syrian children, Syrian women and Syrian\nmen, young and old, are being slaughtered by their own\nGovernment. A national army \u2014 the army of a sovereign\nState and Member of this Organization \u2014 is shelling its\nown people as they queue for bread, and is launching\nairstrikes on its own cities. We find compelling evidence\nof wholesale massacres in towns such as Houla, and\nwe see Syrian children trying to make sense of their\nshattered lives in refugee camps in neighbouring\ncountries. The violence is indiscriminate, and on an\nappalling scale. And it is not confined to one side.\nThe people of Syria deserve the full support of\nthe international community for the efforts to bring about an end to their suffering and to achieve an early\npolitical transition. Ireland backs the Joint Special\nEnvoy of the United Nations and the League of Arab\nNations, Lakhdar Brahimi, in his difficult task. The\npriority must be to achieve an immediate ceasefire and\nto get a political process under way that will facilitate\nthe transition.\nWhat is needed, above all, is a strong Security\nCouncil resolution that will authorize targeted sanctions.\nIt must include a comprehensive arms embargo against\nall those who are responsible for violating the human\nrights of the Syrian people. That is what the Syrian\npeople want from us, and what they have a right to\nexpect.\nThere must also be full accountability for human\nrights abuses. To prevent further atrocities now and to\nsave lives now, we must make it clear now that atrocities\nwill not go unpunished. That is why Ireland supports\nthe call by the United Nations High Commissioner for\nHuman Rights and by Switzerland and others for the\nSecurity Council to refer the situation in Syria to the\nInternational Criminal Court. We are working to build\nup strong cross-regional support for such a referral.\nIf the events in the Arab world over the past two\nyears have taught us anything, it is that leaders who deny\nlegitimate demands for greater political and economic\nfreedom and who instead resort to waging war on their\nown people will inevitably lose the right to rule. The\nsystematic denial of human rights and suppression of\ndemocratic liberties has fuelled a profound desire for\nchange. In Tunisia, Egypt, Libya, Syria, Bahrain and\nelsewhere, Ireland has supported the will of the people,\npeacefully expressed, to bring about long-overdue\ndemocratic reforms.\nAs world attention focuses on Syria, peace and\njustice remain elusive elsewhere in the Middle East.\nThe need for a lasting resolution of the Arab-Israeli\nconflict is as urgent as ever. Yet a depressing stalemate\npersists, with no progress towards a comprehensive\nsettlement. Ireland has said on many occasions that\nthe establishment of a Palestinian State, within borders\nbased on those of 1967, is long overdue. We have made\nclear our hope that Palestine will be formally admitted\nto the United Nations as a full Member. While that hope\nremains to be fulfilled, we welcome the announcement\nby President Abbas of his plans to consult with the\nmembership of the General Assembly on a resolution\nthat, as an interim step towards the achievement of that goal, would accord Palestine non-member State\nobserver status. Ireland will be proud to support a\nfair and balanced resolution to that end, and we look\nforward to the forthcoming consultations.\nWe know of course that such steps will not alter\nthe situation on the ground. Israel must stop expanding\nsettlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem,\nwhich only impede the prospect of achieving Israel\u2019s\nown stated desire for a Palestinian State. The peace\nand security of the people of Israel, to which they are\nentitled, gain nothing from denying the basic rights of\nthe people of Gaza, who are subjected to an unjust and\ncounterproductive blockade.\nThere is no alternative to serious negotiations\nbetween the two sides aimed at a comprehensive\nsettlement. I would like to see President Abbas and\nPrime Minister Netanyahu commit themselves to\nachieving a comprehensive peace agreement within\na specified timescale. That will not be easy and will\nrequire painful compromises on both sides. But if both\nleaders are willing to embark on that path they will\nhave the unstinting support of the entire international\ncommunity, including Ireland.\nPeace and security are inextricably linked to\ndevelopment. And development is at the heart of\nIreland\u2019s foreign policy. We have maintained our\nofficial development assistance above 0.5 per cent of\ngross national product \u2014 an important achievement\nin the face of major economic difficulties \u2014 and we\nremain committed to reaching the United Nations target\nof 0.7 per cent as soon as we possibly can.\nIreland\u2019s aid programme represents a genuine\ninvestment by the Irish people in the world we share\nwith the people of developing countries. We focus in\nparticular on the countries of sub-Saharan Africa. We\nhave prioritized investments in education, in health, in\ngood governance, and in the lives and rights of girls\nand women and of persons living with HIV and AIDS.\nWe have seen remarkable economic progress made in\nAfrican countries as a result of such investments. But\ngreat inequalities still persist.\nIt is in all our interests as global citizens to stay\nthe course in relation to the Millennium Development\nGoals and to continue to work together for a sustainable\nand just world in which States operate on the basis of\nthe rights of all people to participate in and contribute\nto society and inclusive economies. \n\nAgainst that background, the reality of hunger\npersists in our world. The scandal is that we have the\ntools to tackle that suffering and that terrible waste of\nhuman potential. How can people realize their rights\nand potential if they cannot meet their most basic needs\nfor existence?\nNo country knows that better than Somalia. Once,\nSomalia was at the centre of the world\u2019s attention. But\nthe media spotlight moved on, and the people of Somalia\nhave faced a long struggle to emerge from war, famine\nand instability. Today, more than two million Somalis\nstill need our help. On the last Sunday of July 2012,\nI visited Mogadishu. Amidst the grinding poverty and\nthe misery of insecurity, I saw genuine signs of hope\nand opportunity. Schools, homes, shops and businesses\nare being rebuilt and reopened, and people are returning\nfrom exile. Increased international engagement has\nbeen essential. Real progress is also being achieved\nin Somalia\u2019s transition to democracy, with impressive\nengagement by Somali traditional and political leaders.\nWe must support them.\nI pledge today that Ireland will not turn away from\nSomalia or from humanitarian emergencies elsewhere\nin the Horn of Africa, the Sahel and across the globe.\nWe will work with our partners to highlight forgotten\ncrises and the needs of fragile States, as well as to forge\na more coherent and effective international approach\ntowards humanitarian action and development policy.\nIreland has made the fight against hunger and\nundernourishment the key priority of its development\npolicy. We have delivered on our commitment to direct\n20 per cent of our aid budget to that priority. With our\npartners, we have worked closely with the Secretary-\nGeneral to build and support the Scaling Up Nutrition\nmovement. But we must do more. Collectively, we must\nact now to recognize the systemic linkages between\nrecurring food price crises, humanitarian emergencies,\nchronic undernourishment and the effects of climate\nchange.\nThere is nothing that connects us more across\nborders, across oceans and across generations than\nour mutual dependence on the planet that we share.\nClimate change is not something happening in a far-off\nland or in a distant future. It is happening now and it is\nhappening fast. It is not for another generation to solve.\nIt is for us to take responsibility, to strive to achieve\nclimate justice, and to act.\n\nA deep attachment to the safeguarding of human\nrights has been at the heart of Ireland\u2019s foreign policy\nsince the foundation of our State. Ireland\u2019s commitment\nto the protection and promotion of human rights has\nbeen shaped by our own history. As a small island\nnation that has experienced the impact of colonialism,\ncivil war and conflict, we learned the hard way that\nhuman rights can never be taken for granted.\nFrom the earliest days of our United Nations\nmembership, we pioneered the promotion of nuclear\ndisarmament and non-proliferation. We also paid close\nattention to decolonization and the struggle against\napartheid. Today, we make substantial contributions\nto United Nations development agencies and funds and\nare active participants in United Nations peacekeeping\noperations. Thousands of Irishmen and Irishwomen\nhave served in United Nations peacekeeping forces,\nand our people are intensely proud of that contribution\nto the ideals of the United Nations.\nIreland also plays an active role in the work being\ndone in the United Nations framework to protect and\npromote human rights. We are proud that our former\nPresident, Mary Robinson, served with distinction as\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights\nfrom 1997 to 2002. When the Human Rights Council\nwas first established in 2006, Ireland declared that it\nwould seek election to that body in 2012. That is the\nfirst occasion on which we have sought election to the\nCouncil.\nWe are committed to a robust and effective Human\nRights Council. We want to see a principled Council\nthat provides real leadership in that critical area. We\nalso value and support the full participation of small\nStates in the work of the Council. The Universal\nPeriodic Review process has opened up an important\nspace for national dialogue on human rights. Ireland\nengaged constructively and self-critically in its own\nreview. We are also firmly committed to a strengthened\nUnited Nations treaty monitoring body system and have\nactively contributed to efforts to reinforce that system.\nThreats to human rights worldwide are proliferating\nsteadily, whether from widespread poverty and hunger,\nrepressive systems of governance, religious intolerance,\ngender-based violence or other sources. If Ireland is\nelected to the Human Rights Council in November,\nwe will serve the cause of international human rights\nprotection as an active and committed member of the\nCouncil. \n\nThe United Nations was founded on the principle\nthat diplomatic engagement and dialogue between\nnations are essential to peace and human development.\nAttacks on diplomatic missions, such as we saw\nrecently in Benghazi, are attacks on that principle.\nThey are never acceptable and must be condemned by\nthe international community.\nIreland is currently chairing the Organization for\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). That has\nenabled us to make a contribution to the search for\nagreement across the full range of the OSCE\u2019s activities.\nWe have drawn on our own experience in building\npeace in Northern Ireland to contribute to the work of\nthe OSCE, which seeks to find peaceful settlements to\nprotracted conflicts. I am hopeful that by the end of our\nterm in office we will have been able to make progress\nin some key areas, including in the so-called human\ndimension of the OSCE and on some conflict issues.\nWe have used our chairmanship to prioritize\nInternet freedom, reflecting the increasing importance\nof the Internet as a platform for the exercise of human\nrights and fundamental freedoms. A major conference\nin Dublin last June focused on how human rights\nand fundamental freedoms do not change with new\ntechnologies, but extend seamlessly into the digital\nage. We look forward to assuming the presidency of the\nEuropean Union Council of Ministers in the first half\nof next year. We will bring to that role the same energy\nand commitment that we have devoted to discharging\nour OSCE responsibilities.\nA distinguished Irish politician and lawyer of the\nlate eighteenth century, John Philpot Curran, once\nremarked that \u201cthe price of liberty is eternal vigilance\u201d.\nIf we are to live up to the aspirations of the Charter of\nthe United Nations, we must also assume the burden of\neternal vigilance. The daily challenges to human rights\nare painfully obvious. Our response must be clear and\nunrelenting. In the words of the Vienna Declaration and\nProgramme of Action, the promotion and protection\nof human rights is \u201cthe first responsibility\u201d of\nGovernments. We cannot and must not shy from that\nresponsibility."

        "file_text": "\ufeffI would\nfirst like to congratulate the President of the General\nAssembly at its sixty-seventh session on his election. I\nalso wish to congratulate his country for that success,\nwhich allows him to manage the Organization during\nhis term of office. I would also like to congratulate\nthe outgoing President, His Excellency Mr. Nassir\nAbdulaziz Al-Nasser, whose term of office was a very busy one. Lastly, I would like to thank the Secretary-\nGeneral, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for the tireless work that he\nhas undertaken through the programme he submitted\nfor the next five years and through which he particularly\nfocuses on sustainable development, peace, security\nand the participation of women and young people.\nSad reality shows us that some people, using the\nfreedom of expression that is guaranteed in their own\ncountries, have believed that that freedom includes the\nright to publish cartoons and to produce a video that\ninsults Islam. Those acts are comparable to anti-Semitic\nacts or racist acts in general by those who reject any\ndifferences and insist on making that a rule of conduct.\nWe firmly condemn those actions, which are hurtful and\noffensive for Muslims. But however disgraceful they\nmay be, they cannot justify the outbreak of violence we\nhave seen, especially those against diplomatic missions.\nIn particular, we condemn the murderous attack against\nthe United States diplomatic mission in Benghazi, and\nwe repeat here the sincere condolences of the people\nand Government of the Niger to the American people\nand Government. We reassert that Islam, a religion of\nbalance and moderation, cannot provide a basis for such\nhateful responses. Those who, in the name of Islam, are\nbehaving like savage hordes discredit this great religion\nand, in doing so, are behaving exactly like those they\nclaim to denounce.\nThe sad facts that I have just referred to demonstrate\nthe wisdom of the theme the President chose to place\nat the centre of his mandate, that is, \u201cBringing about\nadjustment or settlement of international disputes or\nsituations by peaceful means\u201d. The peaceful settlement\nof disputes, we may recall, was the theme of the general\ndebate at the sixty-sixth session. Between the two\nsessions, the position of my country on the issue has\nnot changed.\nAt the sixty-sixth session, my country\u2019s President,\nMr. Mahamadou Issoufou, said from this rostrum: \u201cWe\nmight have thought that the end of the Cold War would\nopen the way to an age of full and lasting peace around\nthe world\u201d (A/66/PV.20, p. 17). Unfortunately, because\nthere was no ability, or perhaps not even the will, to\nattack the evil at its roots, the hope for a world without\nconflict recedes like the horizon as one approaches it.\nThe root of the evil is bad governance, politically and\neconomically. The promises of liberty, equality and\njustice, of the rule of law and solidarity \u2014 promises\nthat were made to people both globally and at the\nnational level \u2014 have still not been upheld. The lack of any regulation of the global economy, the domination\nof banks, unfair trade and the growth of inequalities\nbetween and within nations are factors of disorder,\ncrises and conflicts that disrupt world peace. The rise\nof terrorism and the increasingly strong probability\nof criminal forces controlling great areas will worsen\ntensions throughout the world.\nAnticipating international conflicts and disputes\nis the best way to prevent them. As international\neconomic competition can lead to war, the anticipation\nof crises should create specific conditions for global\neconomic growth that benefits all. To do that, there\nshould be mechanisms to regulate the global economy\nwith the goal, among others, of ending the hegemony\nof financial capital and unfair trade. The end of the\nhegemony of financial capital should allow us to direct\navailable financial resources towards investments in\nthe real economy rather than towards speculation.\nThe end of unfair trade will allow countries that\nproduce raw materials, such as the Niger, to draw\ngreater benefit from them, particularly through the\nchange that generates added value. If a country such as\nmine were able to get a fair price for its raw materials\nand to establish real control over their exploitation, then\nthe Millennium Development Goals could be achieved\nby 2015. That is one of the ambitions of the programme\nfor the renaissance of the Niger that President Issoufou\npresented.\nOn the basis of that programme, the Government\nhas just drawn up an economic and social development\nplan for 2012 to 2015. For financing the programme, the\nNiger is organizing a donors\u2019 meeting to be held in Paris\non 13 and 14 November. The 3N initiative \u2014 Nigeriens\nNourishing Nigeriens \u2014 is an integral and important\npart of the plan. I take the opportunity here to invite all\npartners of the Niger, both bilateral and multilateral,\nboth public and private, to take an active part.\nAllow me also to take the opportunity to thank\nall those who have responded positively to the appeal\nthat our President launched here on 23 September\n2011 during his address to the Asembly at its sixtysixth\nsession, calling for assistance to the people of\nthe Niger following that year\u2019s mediocre harvest. The\nmobilization of the people and the Government, as well\nas all our partners, enabled us to prevent the drought\nfrom leading to famine, while creating the conditions to\nprepare for the 2012-2013 harvest. The results are very\npromising despite the recent f looding in the country. It is said that history has more imagination than\ndo men, because events often escape the control of\nthose who cause them. It is my hope that this saying\nwill not apply to the Arab Spring, which has created\nturmoil from which we hope good will come. Allow me\nto recall the fact that at the Group of Eight Summit in\nDeauville on 26 May 2011, President Issoufou drew the\nattention of the Heads of State and Government present\non the need for them not to lose sight of the foreseeable\nconsequences of a Libyan conflict in the Sahel-Saharan\nregion.\nHis fears were unfortunately confirmed with\nthe outbreak of the rebellion in Mali on 17 January,\ntriggered by elements from Libya and followed by\nthe coup d\u2019\u00e9tat of 22 March, which dealt democracy\na severe blow while enabling the occupation of two\nthirds of Malian territory, not just by external forces,\nsome of them from Libya, but also by terrorists and\ncriminal organizations specializing in various types\nof trafficking, particularly drugs. In our view, the\ncurrent situation in Mali constitutes a serious threat\nto the security and stability of the member countries\nof the Economic Community of West African States\n(ECOWAS), as well as the countries in the thick of\nthings.\nThe ambition of the jihadists who have subjugated\nnorthern Mali, destroying the patrimonial historic sites\nof Timbuktu, cutting off hands and forcing women\nto wear the burka, is to conquer the whole of West\nAfrica and the Maghreb. Once they have achieved that\ngoal, will they stop there? Of course not. They will\nimmediately go on to attack Europe and the whole of\nthe rest of the world. This is therefore a global threat,\nand the response should be global, too.\nIt must be immediate and unhesitating, because we\nknow well that postponing a fight always puts one at a\ndisadvantage. Therefore the international community,\nand the Security Council in particular, has a duty to\ntake responsibility for the crisis in Mali without delay\nin order to restore a united, democratic and secular\nMali. An operational concept for military intervention\nshould be drawn up and adopted within the framework\nof a coalition that should include troops from ECOWAS\nmember States as well as from the countries involved\nand from other African countries wishing to take\npart. Such an operation should receive the firm and\ndetermined support of the friends of Mali and Africa\namong the great Powers. It should be carried out through\na Security Council resolution in a framework based on the current efforts of ECOWAS but better coordinated\nwith and controlled by the African Union through its\nPeace and Security Council."

        "file_text": "\ufeffThe world is living\nthrough unprecedented times. The challenges of an\neconomic crisis now loom large. All nations, developed\nand developing, face growing uncertainties about their\neconomic prospects. Serious concerns about the global\neconomy arise now just after global prosperity had\nreached unprecedented heights. A second paradox is\nthat the countries most seriously affected by the crisis\nare those that contributed the least to its root causes.\nAs fallout from the crisis threatens to produce ever\nmore significant impacts, many already vulnerable\nsmall island States also face a major threat of a\ndifferent nature. The threat is an existential one. As\nwith the economic crisis, the countries that may be\nmost severely affected by climate change are those that\nhave contributed the least to the root causes of climate\nchange. Many small island developing States thus face\nthe dual threat of the impact of the worsening economies\non their trading and their development partners and that\nof climate change.\nAlready vulnerable nations face greater threats at\nthe international level, and more vulnerable groups face\ngreater difficulties within nations. Young people are\nfaced with higher levels of unemployment, and women\nand children are faced with reduced access to public\nservices, health and education. Secretary-General Ban\nKi-moon, speaking at the latest Group of 20 meeting,\nput food and nutrition security at the top of the agenda.\nMeeting the energy needs for development is a major\nconcern. Recent meetings convened by the Economic\nand Social Council have again highlighted other major\nconcerns, including structural unemployment, rising\ninequality and the lag in poverty eradication.\nMany countries, both developing and developed,\nface a major challenge with respect to youth\nunemployment. Improving access to education and\ntackling the mismatch between qualifications and\nemployment are now a top policy goal. The world\ncannot let its young people down and must give them\nan opportunity to contribute to economic recovery and\nprosperity. What we do for young people and what they can do for the world they will inherit will shape the\neconomic future of our world.\nAs all nations work to promote sustainable\ndevelopment, essential components of governance\nrequired to achieve that goal include more equitable\nand inclusive growth, the fight against corruption,\ngreater accountability, more transparency and a general\nculture of integrity. Mauritius affirms that along with\ninitiatives to revisit development objectives, reform\nof the international financial architecture and global\neconomic governance must remain a top priority.\nMauritius strongly supports the view that the present\neconomic crisis is of a global nature and that solutions\nfor inclusive green growth also need to be global in\nnature.\nThe inconclusive talks of the Doha Round and those\non the United Nations Climate Change Convention\nboth suffered from a historical divide that regrettably\nresurfaces from time to time and is resurfacing now\nat a time when global solutions are more than ever\nnecessary. The debate over good economic and fiscal\ngovernance at the national level will always remain\nvalid and necessary but, however sound such domestic\npolicies may be, the global environment will have an\nimpact on growth and development, especially on that\nof developing countries and smaller economies.\nThirty-two years ago, the Independent Commission\non International Development Issues highlighted, in the\n1980 Brandt report, the interdependence of developing\nand developed economies and the mutuality of their\ninterests. The report explained how all nations would\nbenefit from a strengthened global economy. As the\nworld faces another crisis, all nations should recall\nhow much interdependence has grown since the Brandt\nreport and bear in mind the interconnection and\nmutuality of interests in the development agenda.\nIn that context, nations must resist protectionist\nmeasures as an easy way out. They would definitely\nbe detrimental in the medium and long term.\nThe Committee for Development Policy, in its\nJuly 2012 report (E/2012/33), called for a Transformative\nDevelopment Agenda. The international community\nmust pledge its support for a transformative agenda\nbased on the recognition that globally coordinated\nsolutions are necessary to accompany sound domestic\npolicies. It is imperative that the General Assembly,\nwith its pre-eminent and universal membership, play a crucial role in the debate on globally coordinated\nsolutions.\nWe reaffi rm our support for a revitalized Economic\nand Social Council, which should be able to exercise the\neffective role and function attributed to it by the Charter.\nIn that context, we also welcome the reaffirmation of\nthe mandate of the United Nations Conference on Trade\nand Development (UNCTAD) at Doha. UNCTAD\nmust continue to serve as the focal point of the United\nNations system for the integrated treatment of trade\nand development and the interrelated issues of finance,\ntechnology, investment and sustainable development.\nAs the world engages in the current debate on global\nsolutions, we must promote more economic exchanges\namong developing nations. Regional integration and\ncooperation are key to future development. Trade\nand investment must also be accompanied by greater\nregional cooperation through the pooling of resources\nand the provision of public goods. Pooling entails\nincreased economies of scale and makes it less costly\nto acquire technology.\nOne area where regional cooperation can make a\nsignificant contribution is the energy sector. Pooling\nresources and coordinating policies at the regional\nlevel and among groups of developing countries with\ncommon requirements can facilitate the development\nof technology and the implementation of renewable\nenergies.\nAs we celebrate the thirtieth anniversary of the\nUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea,\nlet us remind ourselves of the potential of the oceans\nas an engine for growth and promote international\ncooperation in a vast collective effort to tap that\npotential. There is potential there with respect not only\nto food and mineral resources but also to transport,\nleisure and the advancement of science.\nWe welcome the reaffirmation by world leaders\nin Rio de Janeiro that small island developing States\nremain a special case for sustainable development in\nview of their unique and particular vulnerabilities. We\nexpect that the commitment to take urgent and concrete\naction to address the vulnerabilities of small island\ndeveloping States will be followed by concrete actions.\nIt is imperative that small island developing States\nissues be more effectively mainstreamed throughout\nthe entire United Nations system and that a dedicated\nand clearly identified focal point be set up within\nevery United Nations entity dealing with small island developing States issues. The Small Island Developing\nStates Unit within the Department of Economic and\nSocial Affairs should be strengthened to enable it to\nprovide coordinated support for small island developing\nStates.\nMauritius joins other world leaders who have\ncalled on all countries to deliver on their assistance\ncommitments. The international community cannot\nspend so much capital on negotiating new pledges and\nundertakings in a whole array of outcome documents\nand then ignore what has been agreed. We can move\nforward only if past commitments are honoured.\nWe welcome the proposed establishment of a\nsustainable development council to follow up on the\nUnited Nations Conference on Sustainable Development\nand formulate sustainable development goals. We also\nwelcome the appointment of a high-level panel on the\npost-2015 development agenda. Those entities and\nothers should be able to build on what has already been\nagreed through global negotiations.\nI must say that our hearts go out to the people of\nSyria, who are enduring the consequences of a severe\nhumanitarian crisis, as there is no prospect in sight of\na resolution to the political struggle. The international\ncommunity cannot remain indifferent to such suffering.\nThe world can also not remain indifferent to the\nsuffering of the Palestinian people, who are without a\nuniversally recognized State and face severe economic\nhardships and insecurity. Those challenges will test\nthe credibility and moral authority of the international\nsystem.\nI must also say that, while we have the utmost respect\nfor all faiths and religions, we strongly believe that\nthere is no justification for violence, however profound\nthe outrage in response to religious vilification. We\nalso support the fundamental principle of the protection\nof diplomats and diplomatic premises, which is at the\ncore of the interaction between nations, and we call on\nall members of the comity of nations to fully respect\nthat principle.\nWe also call on the international community to\nsupport the full implementation of the road map worked\nout in our neighbouring State of Madagascar and to\nprovide the transitional Government with the means\nto ensure a speedy return to constitutional rule and\ndemocracy in that great country.\n\nMauritius very much welcomed the High-\nlevel Meeting of the Assembly on the rule of law.\nDevelopment and greater economic prosperity go\nhand in hand with enhanced rule of law at both the\nnational and the international levels. There will be no\nmeaningful rule of law at the international level unless\nand until all nations, especially the small ones, have\navenues for resolving their disputes with other States.\nThe United Kingdom excised part of Mauritian\nterritory prior to independence, has refused to enter\ninto talks in good faith on that dispute and has ensured\nthat the dispute cannot be resolved by the International\nCourt of Justice. Thus, the decolonization of Africa\nhas not been completed. At a time when the United\nNations debates the rule of law at both the national\nand the international levels, we urge the international\ncommunity to work on machinery that would enable\nStates, whatever their size or economic power, to have\nat their disposal judicial and other peaceful means of\nresolving disputes. The rule of law at the international\nlevel cannot be normative only. There must also be\nadequate enforcement mechanisms, without which\nthere is no meaningful rule of law. The full realization\nof the territorial integrity of Mauritius also requires a\nsettlement that would enable us to effectively assert our\nsovereignty over Tromelin Island. We look forward to\ncontinued dialogue with France in a spirit of mutual\ncooperation.\n\nThe challenges that our countries currently face call\nfor exemplary solidarity on the part of the community\nof nations. Our common interests must guide all of our\nactions. We will not be able to pull through without\neach other. All Governments, civil society, researchers\nand entrepreneurs must therefore be aware of the\ninterdependence of our economies and work together\nfor the good of all nations. Countries often turn inwards\nin times of crisis and look out only for what they believe\nto be their own interests. However, true solutions are\ncollective. A global recovery would serve the interests\nof all States.\n\nBefore I end, let me convey to the Assembly the\ngreetings of the Prime Minister of the Republic of\nMauritius and its people."

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt\nis a great pleasure for me to address the representatives\nhere today and to express my congratulations to Mr. Vuk\nJeremi\u0107 on his election as President of the General\nAssembly at its sixty-seventh session, and to his cabinet\nas well. I also thank his predecessor, Ambassador Nassir\nAbdulaziz Al-Nasser, for his excellent work during\nhis presidency. In addition, I extend my appreciation\nto Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his work for\nthe good and well-being of Member States and their\npeoples.\nIt is an honour and a pleasure for me to speak from\nthis rostrum about current issues of great importance\nto my country and the world. It is a pleasure especially\nbecause Burundi is right now at a decisive and historic\nturning point. What I have to say Pierre Nkurunziza,\nPresident of the Republic of Burundi, also spoke of last\nyear at the Assembly\u2019s sixty-sixth session. A major turn\nof events has placed a special stamp on our country\u2019s\nhistory since independence. Democratically elected\ninstitutions now serve out the terms entrusted to them\nby the people in peace, and then, at the end of their\ntenure, give way to others, also democratically elected.\nOver two years ago, in 2010, Burundi organized\ndemocratic elections for the second time since\n2005, from which were born our current republican\ninstitutions, which operate with legitimacy in a restored\nclimate of peace and security. That development gives us\ngreat satisfaction, and the Burundian people have every\nreason to be proud of it. Indeed, whereas my country\nfaced crises on multiple fronts, under which the people\nsuffered economic depletion, social degradation and\npolitical discord, seriously demoralizing them, those\nsame people are now steadily getting back on their feet\nand rediscovering hope as they look to the future. That\npositive trend demonstrates conclusively a complete\nbreak with the spirals of violence and instability that\nhave for decades been our ongoing lot.\nThanks to the collective efforts, strength and spirit\nof the Burundian people, as well as to the support of our\npartners, I can confirm here and now that the policies\nbegun in 2005 and carried on after 2010 have produced\nmost encouraging results in many areas. As I said earlier,\nin the political sphere our country has held democratic\nelections twice in the recent past, in 2005 and 2010. We\nhave established democratic institutions \u2014 the executive\nbranch, the National Assembly and the Senate \u2014 all\nof which are representative of the various elements\nof Burundi\u2019s population, in conformity with the\nethnic and gender balances agreed to in the Arusha\nPeace and Reconciliation Agreement, which have\nbeen incorporated into the Constitution governing\nBurundians today. I take pleasure in pointing out that\nour Senate\u2019s composition shows a gender parity such\nthat out of all senates worldwide Burundi\u2019s places\nsecond in women\u2019s representation. That is clearly a\nsignificant and bold step forward, because, rather than\nsettle for the minimum set out in the Constitution, our\nGovernment voluntarily made the deliberate choice to\ngo further, to ensure that the female majority in the\npopulation is represented meaningfully in the country\u2019s\ninstitutions.\nIn its determined drive towards change, the\nGovernment subsequently established an independent national commission on human rights and an\nombudsman\u2019s office. It initiated a zero-tolerance policy\ndesigned to eradicate corruption and misuse of public\nfunds, a scourge that has ravaged Burundian society\nfor several years, and also set up adequate enforcement\nmechanisms. We still have a way to go, as is the case\nin many other countries, but the structures to get there\nare firmly in place. In October 2011 the Government\nadopted a national good governance and anti-corruption\nstrategy for 2011-2015. Also, Government officials,\nincluding those at high levels, have signed performance\ncontracts, laying the groundwork for a culture of\naccountability, which is essential to democratic\nsystems. The members of the Administration and\nhigh-level officials are periodically evaluated based on\nthose contracts. If they live up to agreed performance\nstandards they are retained, but otherwise they are\nreplaced.\nThe Arusha Peace and Reconciliation Agreement\ncalls for transitional justice mechanisms. We are\nworking towards a transitional justice system\nthat carefully and rigorously balances national\nreconciliation requirements and those of justice. We\nneed a mechanism that banishes the demons of the\npast and at the same time affords no opportunity for\nany type of vengeance or the settling of old scores; in\nother words, a mechanism to establish the truth and\nto ensure that there is no recurrence of the acts in\nquestion. National consultations were held in 2009, and\nthe related report has been made public. A technical\ncommittee was established with a mandate to pave the\nway for a truth and reconciliation commission. That\ncommittee proposed a methodology in its final report,\nwhich was submitted through the proper channels in\nOctober 2011. The Government had hoped to establish\nthe commission in January 2012, but that decision had\nto be postponed for technical reasons owing to the fact\nthat further consultations were required, along with\nspecific proposals on the commission\u2019s mandate and\ncomposition, the selection criteria for its members and\nmatters related to its operating budget.\nBesides those achievements in the political sphere,\nthe Government undertook a vast social construction\nproject that yielded positive results. Measures\nproviding free education for children of primary school\nage enabled millions of little Burundians to attend\nschool, while free medical care for pregnant women,\nnursing mothers and children under five years of age\nsignificantly improved maternal and child health care\nand will help us to reach the Millennium Development\nGoals (MDGs) in that regard in the near future. Also,\nwith the participation of the population in communal\nlabour, 2,024 schools, 80 health centres and more than\n2,000 potable-water wells were built in just three years.\nWith respect to socioeconomic development,\nBurundi is continuing to improve its basic economic\ninfrastructure, including the management of public\nfinances, an improved business climate and good\ngovernance. In addition, significant progress has been\nmade with respect to the gradual and orderly return\nof displaced persons and the repatriation of refugees.\nAll those efforts have taken place within the Strategic\nFramework for Growth and Poverty Reduction, Vision\n2025 and the MDGs. Of the total of 800,000 counted\nin the census of 2000-2001, all have returned to our\ncountry with the exception of 37,000 from the Mtabila\ncamp, who are expected to return by 31 December. Many\ninternally displaced persons have already returned to\ntheir homes. We have just finished a profiling survey\nof those who remain on site, which, in the light of their\nexpressed wishes, will determine the most appropriate\nand humane resolution of their situation.\nThe social and economic reintegration of former\ncombatants has yet to be completed and represents a\ngenuine security risk. While it is true that there have\nbeen a few isolated instances of insecurity here and\nthere in the country, that is not unique to Burundi.\nBanditry, which has taken place on a small scale in\nBurundi, also occurs elsewhere, in many countries.\nThe Government is determined to stamp out all forms\nof criminality, including armed robbery. It considers\nsecurity the sine qua non of all social and economic\nprogress, which is why it has embarked on reforms in\nthat regard. The professionalization of the defence and\nsecurity forces and of the justice system to guarantee\nthe rights of both citizens and foreigners on our soil are\namong the measures that the Government has written\ninto its programme and will continue to promote as the\ncountry moves forward.\nIn the area of regional integration, an\nintragovernmental committee has been established to\ndevelop a national strategy for regional integration, with\nthe goal of enabling Burundi to take best advantage of\nits participation in subregional entities and reducing the\ndeficits and disadvantages that stem from belonging to\nnon-regional organizations.\nThe Strategic Framework for Growth and Poverty\nReduction has reached an advanced stage. The Government and the \u0412urundi configuration of the\nPeacebuilding Commission have made visible progress\nin a number of areas, as indicated in the outcome of the\nfifth review of the Peacebuilding Commission, issued\non 26 April 2011. Positive results were noted in the areas\nof political and institutional peacebuilding issues, good\ngovernance, human rights, economic issues, vulnerable\ngroups and regional integration, as described earlier.\nAfter this brief survey of the internal situation of\nmy country, I now turn to Burundi\u2019s role and position\nregarding certain international matters. With respect\nto Burundi\u2019s participation in peacekeeping operations,\nI would like to say that Burundi was one of the two\ncountries to take part in the African Union Mission in\nSomalia, and that it is pleased with the work accomplished\nby its soldiers in that context. As the Secretary-General\nhas already done, my country commends the adoption,\nin August, of the provisional Constitution of Somalia\nby the National Constituent Assembly in Mogadishu.\nIt congratulates and encourages the Somali delegates\nand leaders with respect to the new developments under\nway, aimed at normalizing that country\u2019s situation, and\nto their commitment to ending the transition period and\nestablishing new political institutions that represent\nall Somalis. Burundi stands ready to share with the\nSomalis our experience on the question of national\nreconciliation and in training a national republican\narmy.\nWith respect to the security situation in the\neastern part of the Democratic Republic of the\nCongo, Burundi, along with the other members of the\nInternational Conference on the Great Lakes Region,\nconfirms its strong commitment to the terms of the\npact of 15 December 2006 and to its related protocols\nguaranteeing security, stability and development. We\nare also a signatory to the declarations agreed by the\nheads of State and Government of the member States\nof that organization in Addis Ababa on 15 July, and in\nKampala on 7 and 8 August and 7 and 8 September.\nAlong with the other countries of the region, Burundi\nremains determined to seek solutions to that conflict\nthrough existing regional arrangements and in\naccordance with decisions already taken by the\ncountries of the subregion within the framework of the\nInternational Conference on the Great Lakes Region.\nThe Assembly will have noted in the course of my\nstatement that the Government of Burundi has made\nundeniable progress. Still, major challenges remain, not least of them the maintenance of economic growth.\nDespite the unfavourable international financial and\neconomic context, Burundi, with the support of its\npartners, must keep its head above water. It must increase\nits economic growth with the aim of implementing\nits economic and social development projects. It\ngoes without saying that lack of growth, along with\npoverty, means fewer schools, fewer hospitals and\nless progress in the areas of energy and transportation\ninfrastructure \u2014 in short, less development for the\ncountry and its people. No leader worthy of the title\nwould bequeath such a disastrous economic situation to\nfuture generations.\nThat is why, despite the troubling international\neconomic outlook, guidance and support are more\nthan ever necessary for economies as weak as ours in\nBurundi. However sustainable it may be at the national\nlevel, our economy is still very much dependent on\nthe global economy. I remain convinced that, with the\nwill, commitment and vigour of the people of Burundi,\nsupported by our friends, the scale of our political and\nsocioeconomic gains will continue to expand. For its\npart, the Government will spare no effort to harness,\ncoordinate and collaborate with the efforts of all parties\nto fight hand in hand for people\u2019s well-being and\nprosperity, in Burundi and around the world.\nI would like to conclude by welcoming the actions\ntaken by the United Nations, which over the 67 years of\nits existence has moved the world forward at an everaccelerating\npace. I would also like to see the institutional\nchanges envisaged for the Organization take the\ninterests of all Member States into consideration, with\nall stakeholders taking part in the reform and updating\nof the system..\nFinally, I wish the President of the General\nAssembly every success throughout his term of office.\nLong live international cooperation! Long live the\nUnited Nations! Long live Burundi!"

        "file_text": "\ufeffOn behalf\nof the delegation of Viet Nam, I extend my warmest\ncongratulations to you, Sir, on your election as President\nof the General Assembly at its sixty-seventh session. I\nam confident that under your stewardship this session\nwill be crowned with success. I appreciate the excellent\nwork done by the Secretary-General and welcome the\noutcomes of the sixty-sixth session, presided over by\nMr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser.\nTo start with, we would like to welcome the theme\nproposed for this year\u2019s general debate, \u201cBringing about adjustment or settlement of international disputes\nor situations by peaceful means\u201d. This theme is of\nparticular relevance in today\u2019s world, when instability\nand conflicts continue in various regions, especially in\nNorth Africa and the Middle East. The decades-long\nPalestinian-Israeli conflict lingers on and requires a\nsatisfactory solution, including the establishment of\nan independent sovereign Palestinian State coexisting\npeacefully with the State of Israel. Progress has yet\nto be made in disarmament, particularly nuclear\ndisarmament, while the risk of the proliferation of\nweapons of mass destruction continues to grow. New,\ncomplicated developments are emerging in the Asia-\nPacific region, a dynamically growing and important\nregion of the world.\nWe believe that the success of this General\nAssembly session will significantly contribute to the\nprimary goal of the United Nations, maintaining world\npeace and security. Accordingly, we must further uphold\ninternational law and strengthen compliance with\nit. Nations must strongly commit to the fundamental\nprinciples of international law and the United Nations\nCharter, particularly the peaceful settlement of disputes\nand non-use of force, as well as respect for the national\nindependence, sovereignty and territorial integrity\nof States. We must promote dialogue and the use of\npeaceful means in the settlement of disputes, especially\nrecourse to international and regional organizations\nand international legal mechanisms. And we must\nnot accept the imposition of sanctions like those\nagainst Cuba, the removal of which the Assembly has\nrepeatedly called for.\nInternational law is an intellectual creation of the\ncivilized world, which all States must respect and abide\nby in good faith. If international law is enforced, the\nrisk of conflict will be minimized and sustained peace\nwill be better secured.\nViet Nam therefore welcomes the important\noutcome of the recent High-level Meeting on the\nRule of Law at the National and International Levels\n(resolution 67/1), which reaffirmed that the rule of law\nis fundamental to political dialogue and cooperation\namong States and is the indispensable bedrock for a\nmore peaceful, prosperous and just world. Compliance\nwith international law is an essential principle that\nguides the policies and actions of each nation, as well\nas the joint endeavours of the international community.\nWhen we commemorate the thirtieth anniversary\nof the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) later this year, we should further\nreaffirm our strong commitment to and compliance\nwith that constitution of the seas, which contributes\nto the maintenance of peace, stability and maritime\nsecurity, safety and cooperation.\nThe United Nations continues to play an\nindispensable role, entrusted to it by the international\ncommunity, in the maintenance of international peace\nand security. Viet Nam commends the work done by\nthe United Nations, especially in helping settle regional\ndisputes and conflicts by peaceful means, including\nthrough the strengthened use of peacekeeping\noperations. We expect the Organization will continue\nto build further upon its experience in that area and\npromote a culture of peace and dialogue, to better\nresolve ongoing conflicts and prevent the eruption of\nnew ones.\nThe United Nations must step up efforts in\ndisarmament and the non-proliferation of nuclear\nweapons and other weapons of mass destruction, while\nstrengthening international cooperation and ensuring\nthe right of States to use related technologies for\npeaceful purposes. Multilateral negotiating forums in\nthis area, particularly the Conference on Disarmament,\nmust be revitalized and intensified.\nFurthermore, we should recognize the increasingly\nimportant role of regional organizations. In East Asia,\nthe Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)\ncontinues to play a central role in the regional\narchitecture and helps promote peace, stability and\nsecurity in the region, including maritime security\nin the South China Sea. Viet Nam fully supports\nASEAN\u2019s six-point principles statement on the South\nChina Sea, which further reaffirms the settlement of\ndisputes by peaceful means, respect for international\nlaw, particularly UNCLOS, the full implementation\nof the Declaration of Conduct of Parties in the South\nChina Sea and a timely agreement on a code of conduct.\nPeace is the prerequisite for development. Yet it is\nsustainable development, including the end of poverty,\nthe promotion of social justice and the elimination of\ninequality in international relations, which helps resolve\nthe root causes of conflicts and lays the foundation for\na sustained peace.\nToday, the global economy continues to be in\ndifficulty. The Doha Development Round has yet to\nmake progress, while protectionism persists and the\nshortcomings of the international economic and financial systems have yet to be overcome. As a result, many\ncountries, especially developing countries, continue to\nface great difficulties in their development, including\nin their efforts to achieve the Millennium Development\nGoals (MDGs). In that context, it is essential that we\nreaffirm our strong political commitment to ensuring\nthe realization of the MDGs, the promotion of inclusive\nsustainable and green development, and the effective\nresponse to natural disasters, climate change and other\nglobal challenges.\nThe United Nations needs to strengthen global\npartnerships for development and take the lead in\nan inclusive process to formulate the post-2015\nglobal development agenda, including the proposed\nsustainable development goals. In that regard, we urge\ndeveloped countries to fulfil their pledges for increased\ndevelopment assistance and support developing\ncountries in capacity-building.\nThis year, Viet Nam commemorates the thirty-fifth\nanniversary of its membership in the United Nations.\nThroughout that time, Viet Nam has consistently been\nan active and responsible member of the Organization,\nstriving for peace, national independence, democracy,\nsocial progress and prosperity for all nations. Building on\nits 25 years of reform and important accomplishments,\nViet Nam has been working towards a growth model\nthat links economic development with social progress\nand environmental protection.\nIn the face of recent global economic difficulties,\nViet Nam has taken steps to effectively maintain\nmacroeconomic stability and ensure social security.\nViet Nam continues to strengthen the rule of law and\nbuild a State of the people, by the people and for the people, which places the people at the centre and\npromotes their ownership and rights in all spheres.\nPursuing the policy of proactive international\nintegration, Viet Nam continues to contribute\nactively to the work of the United Nations, ASEAN,\nthe Non-Aligned Movement, the International\nOrganization of la Francophonie and others. We also\ncontribute constructively in multilateral forums in\nendeavours designed to respond to global challenges\nincluding nuclear security; disarmament and the\nnon-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction;\nsustainable development; climate change; water, food\nand energy security; and the achievement of the MDGs.\nViet Nam has been implementing with good results\nthe United Nations initiative of Delivering as One. To\nfurther contribute to the work of the United Nations,\nViet Nam has put forth its candidature for membership\nin the Human Rights Council for the term 2014-2016,\nand we look forward to the Assembly\u2019s support.\nViet Nam always endorses efforts to enhance\nthe role and effectiveness of the United Nations to\nenable the Organization to become the true centre for\nharmonizing the actions of nations in the attainment\nof the common goals enshrined in its Charter. We\ntherefore support the continued reform of the United\nNations, including the strengthening of the General\nAssembly as the most representative deliberative body,\nand of the Economic and Social Council in the field of\nsocioeconomic development, as well as the expansion\nof Security Council membership and reform of its\nworking methods."

        "file_text": "\ufeffLast year, Mongolia observed\nthe fiftieth anniversary of its joining this important body. Thanks to the choice of our free people, this son\nof a herder is here today, happy to report on Mongolia\u2019s\nprogress in building a strong and free society.\nMore than 20 years ago, Mongolia stood at a\ncrossroads. The f lag of democracy was firmly planted\nin our rich and historic soil when, in the cold winter of\n1989 and in the spring of the White Horse Year of 1990,\ndecades of rule without the consent of the governed were\nswept aside. Individual rights and liberties prevailed.\nOur revolution did not break a single window, and not\none drop of blood was shed.\nMore than two decades later, Mongolia is a stable\nbeacon of self-governance, a moving force behind the\nAsian Partnership Initiative for Democracy and the\ncurrent President of the Community of Democracies.\nWe are proud to chair that world movement for freedom.\nMongolia has demonstrated a firm commitment\nto transparency, accountability and the rule of law.\nWe have recognized that that is the only way that our\ndemocracy can succeed. Therefore, we cannot tolerate\npublic corruption at any level, from the highest officials\nto the ordinary citizen. Corruption is like an infectious\ndisease, growing in the dark, eating away at the public\ntrust, scaring away investors, robbing average citizens\nof opportunities and attacking the vital immune system\nof a nation. We must shine a light on corruption and\nattack it head-on.\nAdditionally, our track record of free and fair\nelections and the peaceful transfer of power from one\nparty to another can serve as an example to our sister\ndemocracies around the world. Mongolia is moving\ntowards more direct and participatory democracy.\nWe are empowering our people, not the Government.\nMongolia is proud to be the democratic anchor in the\nEast.\nNo democracy is ever perfect. We have experienced\nchallenges similar to those experienced by other young\ndemocracies. Democracy does not end with the casting\nof a ballot. That is just the beginning.\nMongolia is uniquely situated on many levels,\ndemocratically, economically and geographically. Our\ndrive for democracy, transparency and hope for peace\nmakes our nation a vital regional player.\nEconomically, we are blessed by extraordinary\ngrowth \u2014 nearly 17 per cent last year. Keeping up with\nour high rate of growth is a very real challenge and\none that we are prepared to meet directly. We are very focused on balancing two goals \u2014 first, sharing the\nopportunities created by our economic success with all\nMongolians, and secondly, demonstrating clearly and\nfirmly that Mongolia is open for business and a fully\nengaged member of the international community.\nOur nation\u2019s needs are significant \u2014 improved\ninfrastructure, better health care and world-class\neducation. We have much to do to meet the immediate\nand long-term needs of our people. Our people are\nthe key to our success. We need to invest in their\nfuture. We need to invest in both social and economic\ninfrastructure. We are committed to making the\ninvestments needed to give our children the bright\nfutures they deserve.\nAs an emerging leader of the global community,\nMongolia also has important international priorities.\nNone is more important than protecting our\nenvironment. All nations must work to preserve our\nplanet as our economies expand and mature. I was\nhonoured and humbled to be recognized by the United\nNations Environmental Programme this year for the\nwork we are doing in Mongolia to preserve our precious\nenvironment. We are committed to doing even more.\nAnother priority for Mongolia is expanding\nhuman rights. Mongolia has established an effective\nmoratorium on capital punishment. We are seeking to\npermanently abolish the death penalty in Mongolia by\nlegislative action very soon. A Government is created\nby its people; therefore no Government has the right\nto take the life of those who have created it. Let me be\nclear: capital punishment is ineffective and barbaric.\nMongolia cares deeply about safeguarding global\npeace. We must preserve our planet by eliminating\nnuclear weapons across the world. We are also firmly\nopposed to storing nuclear waste on Mongolian soil.\nWe are celebrating 20 years of enjoying nuclear-\nweapon-free status. I am grateful that on 17 September,\nthe five permanent members of the Security\nCouncil \u2014 the People\u2019s Republic of China, France,\nthe Russian Federation, the United Kingdom and the\nUnited States \u2014 signed a joint declaration reaffirming\nthat status for Mongolia.\nThe dialogue on Mongolia and its nuclear-\nweapon-free zone, which was initiated and has been led\nby Mongolia, has continued to make progress. We will\nhost an event in 2015 to make even further progress.\nWhile nuclear power may remain a viable energy\noption for some, any nuclear energy programme in\ndevelopment must submit to the permanent supervision\nof the United Nations and the International Atomic\nEnergy Agency. Any nation seeking to build nuclear\npower must not endanger the peace and security of\nits independent neighbours. The solution to those\nchallenges is engagement, not isolation. The solution is\nmore diplomacy, more dialogue and more action.\nNow more than ever, it is clear that words alone\nare not enough. We must be united in taking action to\npreserve peace. That goal is even more imperative in\nlight of the conflicts that have grown ever more tense\nin areas such as the Middle East. I was saddened by the\ndeath of the United States Ambassador and others in\nLibya. The mission of diplomacy is peaceful. Attacks\non diplomatic compounds violate both the letter and\nspirit of international law.\nToday, I join with Mongolia\u2019s allies in condemning\nthe needless violence and bloodshed in Syria. Last year\nI urged action. The protest had started peacefully, but\nwas met with violence from the Syrian Government.\nEach day, each hour and, indeed, each minute, the\nsituation grows worse. In dealing with crises such as\nthat in Syria, we must remember that those dying are\nnot just citizens of that nation. They are also citizens\nof our planet. They are therefore also our brothers\nand sisters. The world should be unified and direct in\nbringing the bloodshed to an end before another life is\nneedlessly lost.\nYoung girls and boys should be in school, studying\nfor their future, building their dreams. Young girls and\nboys, as well as their mothers and fathers, should not be\ndying in the streets and living through nightmares. That\ncrisis is not just a subject for television programmes.\nWe Members of the United Nations are not spectators.\nThe Organization was not created merely to watch a\nshow unfold on our televisions. We have to act. We have\nto move.\nToo many mothers suffer when their children\nstruggle, whether it is for a lack of human rights or\neconomic opportunity. Mothers want their children to\nbe free. They want their children to have a job. They\nwant a better life for their children. My 92-year-old-\nmother reminds me daily to serve all people with\nrespect, especially women, children and the elderly.\nWomen are the backbone of the family and the bedrock\nof a nation. They bring life into the world. They sense\nthe cries of an infant. Their instincts are to care for the old, the sick and those in need. Our mothers, sisters and\ndaughters share a core value of caring for others.\nWe need more women leaders. Women tend to see\nthe whole picture. For society to advance, we need more\nwomen in public service at all levels, local to global.\nThey bring a unique perspective that is often missing\nin global challenges. Has anyone ever heard of a female\nbloody dictator or tyrant? I think not. If there were more\nwomen in power, I think we would have more harmony,\nmore engagement, less suffering and less conflict. I am\nproud to report that in our last elections, we tripled the\nnumber of women in Parliament.\nThe way to empower women is to ensure that girls\nshare the same educational opportunities as boys.\nEducation is the most basic human right. It is the\nfundamental building block for human development and\nfree society. We owe our children \u2014 all of them \u2014 the\nopportunities that a strong education can offer. Instead\nof weapons, we should invest more in education, which\nunlocks the potential of every child. The return on\nsuch investment will be higher, both for the young men\nand women of tomorrow and for the world. Educated\nnations are more secure economically, respect human\nrights and have greater political freedom.\nIn conclusion, I am happy to report Mongolia\u2019s\nincredible forward movement and to renew our\ncommitment as a part of the community of nations. We\naccept both the rights and responsibilities that come\nwith that honour.\nEight hundred and fifty years ago, our great king,\nChinggis Khan, was born. He built the largest land\nempire in the history of the world. Yet that great king\ndid not erect a single statute to himself. Chinggis Khan\nfamously noted, \u201cIt was easier to conquer the world on\nhorseback than to dismount and try to govern.\u201d Let us\nbe frank. It is not easy to be a diplomat in a troubled\nworld. It is not easy to fight for equal opportunity for\nall. It is not easy to shine a light on corruption. It is not\neasy to govern by the rule of law. It is not easy to build\nreal democracy.\nIt is easier to build statues. It is easier to destroy.\nIt is hard to govern well. But we all must dismount and\ngovern, and govern well. That is vital in order to build\na world where our children feel safer, a world where\nour families are stronger, a world where all nations can\nprosper. That is the legacy that real leaders need to build \u2014 not\nstatues, but opportunities for all humankind. Let us,\ntogether, build opportunities for all."

        "file_text": "\ufeffAllow\nme, at the outset, to join fellow Member States in\ncongratulating the President of the General Assembly\non his election to preside over the Assembly at its sixtyseventh\nsession and to commend his predecessor for his\nsuccessful stewardship of the most recent session.\nI would like to seize this momentous occasion to\nexpress our deepest gratitude and appreciation to the\nSecretary-General for the passion and compassion\nhe has shown in responding to the various global\nchallenges facing the Organization and, most important,\nhis unwavering personal support for our referendum on\nself-determination, our independence and the speedy\nadmission of the Republic of South Sudan into the\nUnited Nations.\nFurthermore, we are also deeply grateful to the\nAssembly for the warmth, generosity and hospitality accorded to our President when he addressed the\nAssembly last year. He made that address at the time\nwhen the international community was concerned\nabout the viability of our new nation. In the light of\nthe progress we have made and despite recent events,\nI am pleased to address the Assembly this year under\nthe theme of the sixty-seventh session \u201cBringing about\nadjustment or settlement of international disputes or\nsituations by peaceful means\u201d.\nThe Republic of South Sudan achieved its\nindependence peacefully, through the exercise of the\nright of self-determination by the people of South\nSudan in an internationally supervised referendum,\nas stipulated in the Comprehensive Peace Agreement\n(CPA). The international community played an\nimportant role in this, our independence process. We\nare therefore very thankful to all those who helped us\nachieve independence, not least the United Nations.\nOur declaration of independence on 9 July 2011 did\nnot resolve all the issues between us and the predecessor\nState, the Republic of the Sudan. These unresolved,\npost-independence issues include border demarcation,\noil infrastructure, security and the final status of the\nAbyei Area. The bilateral engagement between the two\ncountries failed to achieve an agreement. As a result,\nthe African Union intervened by mandating the African\nUnion High-level Implementation Panel, under former\nPresident Thabo Mbeki, to facilitate negotiations\nbetween the two parties.\nAs the situation continued to deteriorate, the\nSecurity Council intervened and adopted resolution\n2046 (2012). That resolution sets out a clear road map\nfor resolving all the remaining differences between the\nSudan and South Sudan, including Abyei, and addresses\nthe conflicts in Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile.\nBefore I discuss the developments in the talks in\nAddis Ababa, allow me to also brief the Assembly on\nother issues of importance such as State-building, food\nsecurity, public service reform, access to education,\nsecurity and accountability in my country.\nWe have embarked upon laying a secure foundation\nfor a prosperous, democratic and stable nation by\nestablishing institutions at the national, state and local\nGovernment levels for governance and the delivery of\nservices to the people. We believe that food security\nis not a privilege but a basic right of each and every\ncitizen in South Sudan. No citizen should go hungry.\nAs the saying goes, a hungry man is an angry man. It will not be good for the stability of the country if we\nhave many hungry and angry men. In our endeavour to\nachieve food security, we are diversifying the economy\nby utilizing oil revenues to fuel agriculture and build\nthe necessary basic infrastructure. This is the only way\nwe can benefit from the vast fertile agricultural lands\nthat our country is generously endowed with.\nOur public service is functioning satisfactorily,\nespecially after the introduction of far-reaching public\nservice reforms. That has brought about efficiency and\ntransparency in service delivery. We have introduced\nconstructive and effective reforms in our public\nfinancial management and have strengthened measures\nto improve transparency and accountability.\nAs for education, we have increased access to\neducation for all children in South Sudan. Since the\nsigning of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement, in\n2005, enrolment in our primary schools has more than\ndoubled. In the past year, we continued to strengthen\nand expand the education sector by further introducing\nalternative education. This innovative notion of an\nalternative education system is currently offering\naccelerated learning programmes to more than 200,000\nyouth and adults. Favourable conditions and terms of\nservice for teachers have been introduced throughout\nthe country, and the Government is working tirelessly\nto meet the rapidly increasing demand for secondary\neducation caused by the increase in primary school\nenrolment.\nHowever, the Government still has a long way to go\nin providing educational opportunities for our children\nand youth that prepare them for the future and meet their\nexpectations and aspirations. At this juncture, allow\nme to commend the launch by the Secretary-General\nof the Global Initiative on Education, which we hope\nwill open up avenues of collaboration between South\nSudan and the international community on improving\neducation access for our children.\nOur nascent nation has been tested enormously in\nits first year of independence. We have been tested by\nconflicts within and beyond our borders; we have been\ntested by severe economic hardship; and we have been\ntested by the revelation of severe abuse of the public\ntrust and funds resulting partly from malpractice\nand lack of capacity. The Government is undertaking\nserious corrective measures and institutional capacitybuilding\nto address that issue in order to restore public\nconfidence.\n\nMy Government is striving harder than ever to\ncombat corruption in our public service. Along with\nreformed systems for management of public funds and\ntighter controls, we are combating corruption through\nthe rule of law and through greater transparency and\naccountability. The Government has enacted legislation\nthat holds public officials accountable and brings the\nmanagement of our resources closer to international\nstandards.\nThe Government has published the entire annual\nbudget and opened our books to public scrutiny. By\nthe end of the year, we aim to be up to date on all of\nthe audits of our national accounts since the signing\nof the Comprehensive Peace Agreement, in 2005. As\nan accountable Government before our people, we\nstill believe that there is a long way ahead to achieve\nthe efficiency, transparency and accountability in our\npublic service and financial management. Despite the\neconomic peril since the shut-down of oil production,\nwe are, nevertheless, encouraged that the current\nperiod of austerity has strengthened our resolve to press\nahead in our reform agenda and has allowed us to lay\na strong foundation for more efficient and accountable\ngovernance beyond the austerity period \u2014 tough times\nnever last, but tough people do.\nWith regard to security, the Republic of South\nSudan is currently facing security threats in the form\nof armed militia groups that are creating insecurity and\nundermining our young democracy. The Government\nhas accorded the highest priority to reaching a peaceful\nresolution to these internal conflicts. Four of the armed\nmilitia groups have laid down their weapons and have\nintegrated voluntarily into our national army and\ncivilian life.\nWe believe that the internal and external security\nof our nation is a prerequisite for having meaningful\neconomic development and social progress. While we are\nworking tirelessly towards achieving and maintaining\npeace within our borders, critical unresolved issues\nremain between South Sudan and the Sudan, including\nborder demarcation, citizenship rights, the status of\nAbyei and oil-related issues. The lack of progress on\nthose post-independence issues has been posing a threat\nto peace and stable relations between the two countries.\nOur relations with the Sudan reached a critical\njuncture last year, when Khartoum blocked tankers\nloaded with our crude oil and prevented them from\ndeparting from Port Sudan. In addition, Sudan seized and resold crude oil that we had sold to international\ncustomers. By January, we had lost some $800 million\nin revenues. At that point, my Government was left with\nno choice but to shut down oil production. The decision\nwas publicly supported by the majority of our people.\nIn the context of relations of South Sudan and the\nSudan, it is incumbent upon my Government to shed\nsome light of what became known as the Heglig or\nPanthou incident between us and the Republic of the\nSudan. That crisis was the result of increasing border\ntensions and repeated bombings in the border areas of\nmy country by the Sudanese Armed Forces.\nIn April, our forces clashed with the Sudanese army\nin an area inside South Sudan, several kilometers south\nof Heglig. That resulted in our armed forces taking over\nHeglig temporarily; we acted in self-defence to prevent\nHeglig from being used as a launching pad for military\nattacks by the Sudanese Armed Forces on our country.\nIn compliance with advice from the international\ncommunity, we withdraw our forces soon thereafter.\nAlthough Heglig is historically part of South Sudan, it\nwas not our intention to take it by force. We believe that\nwe can settle the matter through peaceful negotiations.\nAnother area in which we believe we have not been\nwell understood by the international community is\nour alleged support for the Sudan People\u2019s Liberation\nMovement \u2013 North (SPLM-North). What may not be\nfully appreciated by outside observers is that those\nforces were integral members of the SPLM. But\nalthough they fought side by side with us, they were\nnot fighting for the independence of southern Sudan,\nbut for their own cause through alliance with us. Of\ncourse, we shared a common vision of creating a new,\nfundamentally restructured united Sudan of inclusivity,\nequity and dignity for all, without discrimination on the\nbasis of race, ethnicity, religion or culture. But we also\nhad issues that were specific to our particular situation\nand which, for us, eventually led to our independence.\nIt should be recalled that the CPA included a special\nprotocol on Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile states\nthat addressed their special grievances. That protocol\nis yet to be credibly implemented. As the SPLM-North\nwere former allies who contributed significantly to our\nsuccess in achieving the objectives of our struggle, we\nobviously have a moral and, indeed, political obligation\nto assist them in addressing their legitimate grievances,\nas stipulated and agreed in the CPA. In that connection, South Sudan is currently\ncarrying the burden of accommodating an increasing\nnumber of refugees from the two areas. We therefore call\nupon the international community to assist in meeting\nthe humanitarian needs of the refugees within South\nSudan, as well as throughout the Sudanese territory for\nthose internally displaced by the conflict.\nOur President stated in his statement at our\nindependence celebration:\n\u201cWe cannot abandon them, but would support their\ncause peacefully through negotiated settlement\nbetween them and the Government of the Sudan\u201d.\nSouth Sudan will use its good offices as a former\nally of the SPLM-North to assist the Sudan by acting\nas an honest broker in mediating a peaceful, but just,\nresolution of the conflict. We believe that our role as\nhonest brokers will in the long term assist our neighbour\nto the north, the Government of the Sudan, to achieve\npeace and stability. We are glad that the United Nations\nrecognizes that there can be no military solution to\nthe conflict and that a negotiated settlement is the way\nforward.\nI am pleased to inform the Assembly that, today,\nPresident Salva Kiir Mayardit and President Omer\nHassan A. Al-Bashir signed an agreement that will allow\nthe two countries to pursue their national development\nefforts under a secure and lasting peace. We are hopeful\nthat the new agreement with the Sudan will lead to the\nresolution of our differences on security, borders and\nthe use of petroleum infrastructure.\nIt is envisaged that if each side upholds its part of\nthis agreement, the most significant causes of dispute\nbetween our two countries will have been amicably\nresolved. Diplomacy will have won, and reason will\nhave prevailed.\nWith the resolution of those key matters,\npreparations to resume oil production in South Sudan\nwill now begin. The following agreements were signed\ntoday between our two countries: first, the Agreement\nConcerning Oil and Related Economic Matters;\nsecond, the Framework Agreement on the Status of\nNationals of the Other State; third, the Agreement on\nthe Demarcation of the Boundary; fourth, an agreement\non border issues; fifth, the Agreement on a Framework\nfor Cooperation on Central Banking Issues; sixth, the\nAgreement on Trade and Trade-related Issues; seventh,\nthe Agreement on Certain Economic Matters: Division\nof Assets and Liabilities, Arrears and Claims and Joint Approach to the International Community; and, finally,\neighth, the Framework Agreement to Facilitate Payment\nof Post-Service Benefits.\nWhile we are happy with all that has been agreed\ntoday by our two countries, I wish to inform the General\nAssembly that we have failed to reach agreement on\nAbyei. President Al-Bashir has rejected the proposal\nof the African Union High-level Implementation\nPanel, as stipulated under Security Council\nresolution 2046 (2012). It is now incumbent upon the\nAfrican Union (AU) Peace and Security Council,\ntogether with the United Nations Security Council, to\ntake the action necessary to move forward.\nWe are thankful to both the AU Peace and Security\nCouncil and the United Nations Security Council\nfor their great efforts to bring about this agreement\nbetween our two countries.\nAs our President stated in this forum one year\nago, \u201cThe ambition of the people of South Sudan is\nto be able to transform their country into a regional\nagro-industrial powerhouse\u201d (see A/66/PV.19), with\nreduced dependence on external assistance, and the\npotential to feed the people of South Sudan and to be a\nbreadbasket for East Africa.\nOur strategy is aimed at utilizing oil wealth as\na catalyst to stimulate our economic development\npotential, with an emphasis on agriculture.\nWe are conscious of the fact that we cannot achieve\nthose goals alone. We need continued support from\nfriends, partners and the international community.\nWe are confident that together we shall overcome the\nchallenges ahead. I take this opportunity once more,\non behalf of the people and the Government of South\nSudan, to express our profound gratitude for the support\nrendered to us by the United Nations, the AU, regional\norganizations, friends and partners.\n\nFinally, allow me to reiterate the resolve and the\ncommitment of the people and the Government of\nthe Republic of South Sudan to be a productive and\nactive member of this global family of nations, and to\nmake their contribution to promoting world peace and\nprosperity for all humankind."

        "file_text": "\ufeffAt the\noutset, I would like to offer the President and his\nfriendly country, the Republic of Serbia, my warmest\ncongratulations on his election to the presidency of the\nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-seventh session. I would\nalso like to express my appreciation to his predecessor,\nMr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser, from the brotherly\nState of Qatar, for the exemplary way in which he\nconducted the work of the previous session.\nI would also like to take this opportunity to convey\nmy appreciation to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon\nfor his role and efforts in improving the Organization\u2019s\nworking mechanisms, and to wish him every success\nin his endeavours. The record of the United Nations\nincludes numerous positive and tangible achievements\nthat have helped to promote international peace and\nsecurity and reach a political consensus on many\nregional and international issues.\nIn our Middle East region, the Syrian crisis\ncontinues to be of great concern, owing to the great loss\nof life and property that it has caused and the instability\nthat it has produced in the region and the world as a\nwhole. Despite the efforts of the United Nations and\nthe League of Arab States, the parties involved in the\nSyrian crisis have failed to reach a peaceful solution\nthat could spare the lives of the Syrian people.\nWe call on our brothers in Syria to renounce\nviolence, end hostilities and launch a political process\nthat will fulfil the aspirations and hopes of the\nSyrian people and preserve Syria\u2019s security, stability\nand unity. At the same time, we call on the Security\nCouncil, the international body primarily responsible\nfor the maintenance of international peace and security,\nto reach consensus on a unified position on the Syrian\ncrisis, without political disagreements and without bias\ntowards any side, by way of starting a serious national\ndialogue between all political forces in Syria, with no\nexceptions. We believe that the principles and guidelines\nfor a Syrian-led process of transition, as contained in\nthe final communiqu\u00e9 of the Action Group for Syria\n(S/2012/523, annex), issued at its meeting in Geneva in\nmid-2012, could form the basis for a solution, if agreed\non and accepted by all Syrian and international parties.\nThe conflicting interests among some countries\nand their disagreements on how to address the Syrian\nconflict no longer serve any purpose, because the time\nhas come to take collective action that can preserve\nsecurity, stability and development for every country\nin the Middle East, especially since the alternative\nwould be the spread of violence, killing, destruction\nand chaos. We believe that it is not in the world\u2019s best\ninterests to allow the Middle East to become another\nglobal f lashpoint.\nI would also like to take this opportunity to say that\nmy country welcomes the appointment of Mr. Lakhdar\nBrahimi as the Joint Special Representative of the\nUnited Nations and the League of Arab States for Syria.\nWe hope that he can provide practical and concrete\nproposals to pull Syria out of the current cycle of\nviolence and killing.\nWe are aware of the complexities that arise in any\ndiscussion of the question of Palestine at sessions of the\nAssembly. We all know, however, that while the United\nNations has explored every avenue and adopted many\nresolutions and policies on the Palestinian question, that\nissue continues to be a cause for concern and a source\nof unending threats and conflicts in the Middle East\nand beyond. We believe, therefore, that the role of the\nUnited Nations with regard to the question of Palestine\nshould change from one of managing the crisis to one\nof seriously seeking a just, lasting and comprehensive\npolitical solution that would take into account the\ninterests of both Palestinians and Israelis and lead to\nthe establishment of a State of Palestine, living side by\nside with the State of Israel. In that context, my country\nsupports Palestine\u2019s application for non-member\nState observer status at the United Nations, hoping\nthat that will usher a new phase in the Palestinian-\nIsraeli negotiations and one that could make a positive\ncontribution to settling the issue.\nThe Somali people have long suffered from an\nabsence of security, stability and State institutions\nand bodies; we therefore welcome the formation of the\nnew Somali Parliament and the election of Mr. Hassan\nSheikh Mohamud as President of Somalia. We hope\nthat his Government will be able to achieve national\nreconciliation and establish security and stability\nthroughout Somalia.\nprovide support and assistance, whether political,\neconomic or humanitarian, to the Somali people, we\nurge the Somali factions and parties from various\npolitical and tribal affiliations and organizations to\nreject violence, cease hostilities and place the higher\ninterest of the nation above all others. We believe that\na national dialogue, involving all parties in the Somali\nconflict, regardless of their ideological and political\ndifferences and inclinations, is essential and will\nhelp restore security, stability and nation-building in\nSomalia.\nWe would like to commend the international efforts\nto combat piracy and the armed robbery of merchant\nvessels in the Indian Ocean, particularly in the Arabian\nSea. The Sultanate of Oman, which is located on the\nArabian Sea, reaffirms its continuing support for\ninternational efforts to eradicate the problem, and will\ncooperate with countries that have a naval presence\nin the area in order to protect international trade and\nnavigation.\nFrom the outset, the Sultanate of Oman has\nsupported the proposal to establish a zone free of nuclear\nweapons and all other weapons of mass destruction\nin the Middle East. In that regard, we welcome the\nReview Conference of Parties to the Treaty on the\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, scheduled to be\nheld in Finland at the end of this year. We hope it will\nbe able to officially declare the Middle East a zone free\nfrom nuclear and all other weapons of mass destruction,\nsimilar to other such zones that have been established\nelsewhere in the world.\nAt a time when Muslims are trying to promote a\nculture of tolerance and coexistence, we note that there\nare those who abuse their right to express themselves\nby deliberately slandering monotheistic religions and\nprophets and messengers of God. My country condemns\nthe video slandering the Prophet Muhammad \u2014 peace\nbe upon him \u2014 which clearly and deliberately sought to\nspread a culture of hatred against Muslims. Despite the\ngravity of the offence, we reject escalating the reaction\nto a level resulting in attacks against diplomatic\nmissions and representatives, such as those against\nUnited States and other Western diplomatic missions.\nAgainst the backdrop of those events and similar\nincidents earlier, we believe that it is incumbent on\nthe United Nations to adopt international legislation\nthat would hold accountable those responsible for any deliberate abuse of and slander against the sanctity of\npeople\u2019s beliefs, with a view to deterring others who\nmay attempt to spread hatred among people.\nThe world today is facing a genuine threat of food\nshortages, owing to the steady increase in the world\u2019s\npopulation and the problems facing the global economy,\nwhich have resulted in the famines currently plaguing\nmany parts of Africa, Asia and Latin America. There\nis no doubt that addressing that problem will require\nus to undertake a practical study of alternatives that\ncould alleviate the negative impacts of food shortages.\nAmong the ideas we deem worthy of exploring is\nthe establishment of a global food reserve system to\ndeal with food shortages, with food reserve centres\nlocated in various continents of the world and managed\nthrough an international fund specifically established\nto support the system. States, international institutions\nand sovereign funds that have the capacity to contribute\nto the fund would also be allowed to do so. We are of\nthe view that the Food and Agriculture Organization\nof the United Nations, in the light of its expertise in\nthat field, could be the appropriate body to oversee the\npreparation and implementation of such a study.\nWe would like to take this opportunity to encourage\nindustrialized countries to increase their investment\nin agricultural research and to utilize science and\ntechnology in their search for innovative solutions\naimed at increasing food production so as to keep pace\nwith the steady increase in the global demand for food.\nIn conclusion, I would like to reiterate my\ncountry\u2019s support for all international efforts to achieve\nthe aspirations of peoples to a safer, more stable and\nprosperous world."

        "file_text": "\ufeffWe\nwarmly congratulate Mr. Vuk Jeremi\u0107 on his election\nto the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-\nseventh session.\nWe are also pleased that the general debate of this\nsession is devoted to considering, among other issues,\nthe promotion of sustained economic growth and\nsustainable development in accordance with relevant\nGeneral Assembly resolutions and recent United\nNations conferences.\nSince we adopted the Declaration that led to the\nMillenium Development Goals (resolution 55/2), the\nimage of development has been tied to the reduction\nof poverty and to the development of capacities and\nopportunities for the most vulnerable populations.\nThe majority of our developing countries had made\nsignificant progress in this area until 2008, when the\nfinancial crisis, which affected the world economy and\nthreatened to cancel out our achievements, began.\nWe are living at a time of multiple simultaneous\ncrises. The ecological crisis threatens the majority of\nour f lora and fauna. Global warming threatens coastal\npopulations and small island countries. Unchecked\npopulation growth threatens to exceed the capacity of\nnature to restore itself. We have witnessed a crisis of the\nvalues that have traditionally governed the behaviour of\nhumankind. War and armed conflict threaten the right\nto cultural, ideological and political diversity and our\nright to live in peace and unity.\nThose of us who live in the developing countries\ndid not cause the world financial crisis. As you know,\nthe crisis was caused by the failure to use effective\nregulations in the international financial system and\nby the arrogance, greed and unbridled desire to amass\nwealth. In the context of the crisis, age-old debates\nhave resurfaced as to how best to tackle the crisis.\nShould we reduce investment in social protections for\nour populations? Or, on the contrary, should we bolster\ninvestment, making anti-cyclical social investment policies into a springboard for reviving economies?\nAnd how do we measure poverty and development and\nrecognize the social impact of the measures adopted?\nDo we use average income indicators for reducing\nsocial inequality and improving quality of life?\nThe countries in the developing world whose\neconomies have performed better and have shown less\nvulnerability in the context of the world crisis have been\nthose that have understood, in time, that investing in\ntraining our peoples and improving the quality of life of\nour peoples is the best way to reduce our vulnerability\nand to maintain economic growth. The economy must\nserve the people, not the reverse.\nIn the debate on development, we must reaffirm\nas peoples and as Government leaders that we have\nlearned quite often through painful experience that\nequality and sustainability are key prerequisites for\nensuring sustained and sustainable economic growth.\nToday, we know that it is not enough to have economic\ngrowth in order to reduce social inequity and to\nimprove the quality of life of our peoples. Nor is it right\nto sacrifice our people in the hope that the growth of\nan economy will ultimately lead to benefits for all and\nreduce social inequality. That expectation quite often\nremains unmet. On the contrary, experience has shown\nthat by improving the quality of life and by reducing\npoverty and social exclusion, we can help stimulate\nhealthy economic growth.\nIn the context of international crisis and\nuncertainty, we must reduce national and international\nsocial inequalities. We must increase social cohesion\nand strengthen democratic governance. We also know\nthat economic growth, which does not take account of\nthe limits of natural resources and the needs of future\ngenerations, will entail the risk of imminent collapse.\nWe must revise the ideas about development that have\nprevailed in the international financial system.\nEquity and sustainability are two sides of the\nsame coin, and that is how we must approach human\ndevelopment. That vision is consistent with international\ndeclarations on sustainable development, such as the\nDeclarations issued by the United Nations Conference\non the Human Environment in Stockholm in 1972, by\nthe Rio Earth Summit in Rio de Janiero in 1992, and\nby the World Summit on Sustainable Development in\nJohannesburg in 2002. They promoted the three pillars\nof sustainable development: environmental equity,\neconomic equity and social equity. Development means protecting environmental systems, raising the\nproductive capacity of goods and services and reducing\nsocial inequality by raising the quality of life of all men\nand women, multiplying capacities and opportunities.\nToday, 7 billion people inhabit the Earth. Of those,\n43 per cent, or 3 billion, are under the age of 25. We\nmust invest so that our young people have the skills and\nopportunities to tackle creatively the development tasks\nthat face our societies. For many years, the development\nof countries has been assessed by international financial\ninstitutions, using measures of income or national\nproduction expressed per capita in order to determine\nthe state of material well-being. Based on that kind\nof measure, our country, the Dominican Republic,\nhas been classified in recent years as a medium high\nincome country.\nNonetheless, more than a third of our citizens live\nin poverty. How then is it possible to exclude countries\nlike ours from receiving development aid? By the same\ntoken, to give an international comparison, poverty has\nbeen measured in terms of income, with those families\nthat subsist on less than $2 a day being defined as poor\nand those who live on less than $1.25 as extremely poor,\nan adjustment being made in both cases for buying\npower.\nAccording to those criteria, over 2 billion people\nworldwide \u2014 33 per cent of humanity \u2014 are poor, and in\n2005 the number living in extreme poverty had dropped\nto 1.4 billion. Those same measures project that by 2015\nonly 883 million will be living in extreme poverty. The\noptimism of those international figures does not appear\nto coincide with the perception of many of our citizens,\nwho feel that the increase in gross domestic product\ndoes not reflect their needs or despair, nor does it jibe\nwith the unhappiness of our young people who, despite\nraising their educational level, are still unable to find\ndignified work or the opportunities to fulfil their\nbusiness aspirations.\nThat discrepancy between the optimism of certain\ninternational indicators and the discontent on our streets\ncan be explained by the fact that we are using inadequate\ntools to measure poverty, development and well-being.\nAt least in the Dominican Republic, it is hard to believe\nthat the quality of life and the opportunities to improve\nit would be very different for a person with an income\nof $2 a day than for someone earning a few cents less.\nPoverty in a given family or community is much more\nthan the lack of income with respect to a predetermined threshold, just as the development of a country is much\nmore than the size of its median income.\nThe International Labour Organization reported in\n2010 that 81 million of the 620 million young people\nbetween the ages of 15 and 24 worldwide who were\neconomically active, which represents 13 per cent\nof that age group, had been unemployed during the\npreceding year, primarily due to the world economic\nand financial crisis. Between 2007 and 2009, the global\nunemployment rate for young people experienced the\ngreatest rise in its history: from 11.9 per cent to 13 per\ncent. Young women had a harder time than young men\nin finding work.\nThe results in terms of health, education and\nmaternal and child mortality show the limits of\nthe unilateral and optimistic focus on poverty and\ndevelopment. Not without reason have some academics\nsaid that\n\u201cwe are gambling with the fate of our planet with\n\u2018games\u2019 in which a few private players reap the\nbenefits and society pays the consequences. A\nsystem that permits results like those is destined to\nmismanage risk\u201d.\nSocial investment in the education, health and\nemployment of young people can build the foundation for\na strong economic base that can halt the transmission of\npoverty from one generation to the next. Strengthening\nyoung people\u2019s skills creates the conditions for them to\nearn higher income during their productive economic\nlives. The way we understand and measure poverty\ntranslates into national and international policy\ndecisions.\nTo assume that poverty and underdevelopment are\nsimply the expression of family income or national\naverages has led to limited social policies of entitlement\nor transfers. Such policies temporarily raise the income\nof impoverished families above the so-called poverty\nline, at the expense of developing universal, more\neffective and better-quality public service systems that\nwould benefit, as a right, those who have traditionally\nbeen excluded.\nAdam Smith, the father of economic liberalism,\nincluded in his definition of poverty such social and\ncultural aspects as \u201cthe ability to go about without\nshame\u201d. More recently, the Nobel Prize winner in\nEconomics Amartya Sen spoke of development itself\nas freedom. In that sense, broadening our concept of poverty to include measures of social participation and\ninclusion, as well as unmet basic needs, will allow us to\ndevelop more holistic and effective responses. Poverty\nis a multidimensional phenomenon, a complex system\nof problems that requires a systemic solution leading to\nbroader skills, freedom and opportunities for those who\nhave traditionally been excluded.\nInvestment in quality universal education and health\nsystems, a universal safety net, access to dignified\nwork and living spaces, personal safety and the security\nof goods, inter alia, are crucial elements for expanding\nthe skills and opportunities of impoverished portions of\nthe population. Poverty reduction is the basic lever for\nincreasing the production of goods and services and for\npropelling new dynamics of growth and development.\nAssessing the development of countries exclusively on\nthe basis of their national per capita income leads to\ndecisions that have a negative impact on our efforts at\ndevelopment. When a country is ranked according to\nthose simple criteria, the contribution of international\ncooperation is reduced and access to loans from\ninternational financial institutions is reduced or\nbecomes more expensive.\nAs developing countries, we also need to shoulder\nour share of responsibility. Domestically, we need to\nimprove our information systems in order to better\nunderstand our social, land and gender inequalities,\nas well the impact we have on the environment. At the\nsame time, we must redirect our investment patterns\nand our public policies to promote equality and social\ninclusion for the most vulnerable groups, and for that\nwe need the support of the international community..\nA country should not cease to receive development aid\nsimply because its average national income has crossed\na certain arbitrarily defined threshold.\nLatin America has long experience with the\nsearch for multidimensional measures of poverty and\ndevelopment. Since the middle of the last century,\nthe Economic Commission for Latin America and the\nCaribbean has developed a methodology based on an\nindex of unmet basic needs. Many countries have\napplied such composite multidimensional indexes. In\nthe Dominican Republic we use a quality of life index\ntailored to our reality. The United Nations Development\nProgramme has applied the human development index,\nand a number of other indexes have been proposed at the\ninternational level. Despite that, the majority of bodies\nin the international financial system continue to rely\non one-dimensional measures that focus on monetary income to assess and categorize the development of our\ncountries and to determine their policies on the basis of\ncriteria for international financial support.\nWe wish to avail ourselves of this opportunity to\nurge international financial organizations to be more\nready and willing to embrace our efforts to break\nthe vicious cycle of poverty and social exclusion as\nthe basis for development. We need to use enhanced\nindicators with a greater capacity to capture and\nmeasure the complex dynamics of human development.\nWhat is needed is for us to work together to overcome\nexclusion, not to prolong poverty and extreme poverty\nindefinitely.\nThe Dominican Republic reiterates its firm\ncommitment to peace, tolerance and international\ncoexistence as well as to democracy and freedom as basic\ncomponents for development. We hope that sustainable\ndevelopment will enrich the daily lives of individuals,\nfamilies, communities and countries and will preserve\nour natural resources. Peace, the abolishment of\nsocial inequality, environmental sustainability and the\nsustained growth of our capacity to produce the goods\nand services required by our peoples go hand-in-hand,\nand they are the very core of development."

        "file_text": "\ufeffI would like to\ncongratulate the President on his election to the\npresidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-seventh\nsession, and to thank him for the inspiring speech he\nmade at the opening of the general debate (see A/67/\nPV.6). We are confident that the spirit exemplified in\nthat speech will guide him during his presidency. Let me\nalso take this opportunity to express my appreciation to\nthe outgoing President.\nThe reason I am here on this rostrum, making my\nmaiden speech to the General Assembly as Head of\nGovernment of the new Ethiopia, is because we lost our\nleader only a little more than a month ago. The passing\nof Prime Minister Meles Zenawi is a huge loss for\nEthiopia, and undoubtedly for Africa as well. He was a\nman of prodigious intellect who was uncompromising\nin his insistence that Ethiopians and Africans should\nown and protect their development strategies and their\napproaches to governance and democratization. The late\nEthiopian Prime Minister, and the party he led, have\nfacilitated the emergence of a new Ethiopia, rekindling\nthe hopes of Ethiopians for the future and strengthening\ntheir confidence in their ability to overcome adversity.\nEthiopians proved their mettle, and what they are\nmade of, when they received the unexpected news of\nthe tragedy with which the nation was faced. It is an\nhonour and a blessing to be the leader of a people who\nare generous in paying tribute to those, like Prime\nMinister Meles, who served them self lessly; a people\nwho have the maturity and wisdom to see, and even\nlucidly articulate, who has done what for the nation\nand for the people of Ethiopia. That would naturally\nmake any human being who is given the opportunity to\nlead a country ask himself what more he can do for his people \u2014 not in words but in deeds, as our late Prime\nMinister often emphasized. As might be expected,\ndoomsday scenarios for Ethiopia\u2019s future were bandied\nabout.\nBut the people of Ethiopia \u2014 from north to south,\nfrom east to west, across the length and breadth of\nthe country \u2014 were categorical in stating in unison\nhow much they embrace the unity of the country,\nunity that celebrates their diversity and is built on the\nbedrock of their federal Constitution. Let me take this\nopportunity to thank, on behalf of the Ethiopian people\nand myself, all those leaders and heads of delegation\nwho came to Addis Ababa to be with us at our time of\ngrief. We cherish your friendship. I wish to reiterate my\ncondolences to the peoples and Governments of Ghana,\nMalawi and Guinea-Bissau, who have also lost their\nleaders recently.\nWe Ethiopians are confident that we have come\na long way. Never before in its modern history has\nEthiopia had the kind of rapid economic growth that\nit has witnessed over the last decade or so. Indeed, for\nthe first time in its modern history, Ethiopia has begun\nto see a bright light at the end of the tunnel in terms of\nreal prospects for economic transformation. We are, for\nsure, on a hugely promising trajectory. Our Growth and\nTransformation Plan, to which our late Prime Minister\nwas devoted, and which is now embraced by our people,\nis designed to catapult our nation to a destination\nthathas long eluded it but is now within reach.\nWe go forward with full recognition of our\nresponsibility, as the second most populous country\nin Africa, to contribute to regional integration. We\nforesee huge possibilities for bringing the countries of\nthe greater Horn of Africa together. We have already\ngone some distance in playing a catalytic role in laying\nthe infrastructural basis for consolidating economic\nties with the countries of our region. The electric power\ninterconnections and the road and railway networks\nthat we have built and are in the process of building\nwith Djibouti, the Sudan, Kenya and South Sudan are\nemblematic of our resolve to play our part in regional\nintegration. We are confident that Somalia and others,\nwithout exception, will follow suit.\nBut our success hinges on a number of conditions\nbeing met, none of which is amenable to our unilateral\ninitiative. First is the question of peace and stability\nand the challenge of extremism. Here, also, we have\nmade much progress. Somalia is gradually coming out of the woods. We salute all those, most particularly the\ncontributors of troops to the African Union Mission in\nSomalia, for the sacrifice they have made. The African\nUnion (AU) has made an enormous contribution to\nlaying the basis for the progress that Somalia has made.\nWe also acknowledge the very useful cooperation\nbetween the AU and the United Nations, including\ntheir two Councils responsible for security. We have to\nrecognize the role of partners as well. But much more\nneeds to be done in Somalia to ensure that the new\nGovernment stands on its own feet. We would be naive,\nhowever, if we believed that the enemies of peace of\nSomalia and the region are completely defeated. That\nis why it is so critical that the momentum is not lost\nin Somalia and Somalia\u2019s ownership of the process\nof national reconciliation is strengthened. We will\ncontinue to assist Somalia and the new President of the\ncountry, Mr. Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, and the people\nof Somalia can count on that.\nWe are pleased that there is also major progress in\nthe peace process between the Sudan and South Sudan.\nWe are confident that the two parties will maintain the\nmomentum towards durable peace, which is the basis for\nensuring the viability of both. We are indeed indebted\nto former President Thabo Mbeki and the African\nUnion High-level Implementation Panel for their\nperseverance and commitment to peace between the\ntwo sisterly countries. What has been achieved by the\ntwo parties over the last few days, which culminated in\nthe signing of the much anticipated agreements on vital\nmatters, is a significant breakthrough, which needs to\nbe consolidated and used as a basis for resolving the\nissues still remaining. We are confident that the two\nparties appreciate how vital their joint effort for a\nwin-win outcome is, not only for their peoples, but also\nfor us all.\nPeace between the Sudan and South Sudan and a\nclose partnership between the two, above and beyond\nthe benefit it has for us all, has for us Ethiopians an\nadditional emotional and sentimental value. That was\nan issue that our late Prime Minister, even as he was\nstruggling for his life, was following with the same\nintensity as before, and he continued to offer whatever\nadded value he could bring to bear on the peace\nprocess. Let me thank both the Sudan and South Sudan\nfor placing their trust in us, as has been so manifest in\nthe deployment of the United Nations Interim Security\nForce for Abyei. Indeed, we are proud of our troops in Abyei, as we are of all our people serving under the\nUnited Nations f lag, including those in Darfur.\nBefore I move on to the second challenge we face, I\nwish to say a few words on broader issues that help put\nin perspective the challenge our region faces in securing\nsustainable peace and stability. The major war we have\nto win is undoubtedly the war on poverty. The most\ndifficult challenge we face here in developing the most\neffective means to wage that war is that of ensuring that\nthe rule of law is observed, both in inter-State relations\nand in the domestic sphere. At its most fundamental\nlevel, the struggle against extremism is one aspect of\nthe struggle to ensure that the rule of law is respected\nand the principles of tolerance are adhered to. Wherever\nan act of intolerance or a violation of laws occurs,\nsometimes in an egregious manner, as in Benghazi, it\nneeds to be condemned.\nThe second challenge we face in sustaining our\ndevelopment agenda relates to a host of issues impinging\non our capacity to ensure sustainable development.\nLet us be frank and admit that there is a huge deficit\nin international cooperation for the development of\nboth low-income and least developed countries. At\nthe end of the day, regardless of other impediments to\ndevelopment, the major bottleneck for countries such\nas Ethiopia for ensuring sustainable development and\nsuccessfully achieving the Millennium Development\nGoals is related to shortfalls in development finance.\nWe said as much in the Paris Declaration on Aid\nEffectiveness and the Accra Agenda for Action,\nand, recently, in the Busan Partnership for Effective\nDevelopment Cooperation, but the results have been\nfew and far between. In our view, the current global\neconomic situation should never be allowed to detract\nattention from the critical need for development finance\nof low-income countries.\nThe challenge in this area is compounded and\nmade even worse by climate change, which is a global\nchallenge calling for responsible and wise leadership\nat the international level. The response should rely\non full commitment to the principle of common but\ndifferentiated responsibilities. However boring it may\nbe, something that is universally acknowledged bears\nrepeating. Countries such as Ethiopia which did not\ncontribute to climate change are nonetheless those most\naffected by it. But, still, we recognize our obligation.\nThat is why Ethiopia has already opted for a green\ngrowth path, and our current five-year Growth and\nTransformation Plan is based on developing a green economy, the strategy for which has already been\nissued and is being implemented. We seek effective\ncooperation in this endeavour.\nWe had hoped that the United Nations Conference\non Sustainable Development would achieve more than\nit did. Nevertheless, we look forward to meaningful\nand effective work by the working group on sustainable\ndevelopment, to which we are ready to contribute as best\nwe can. We are also hopeful that the intergovernmental\nprocess under the auspices of the General Assembly\nin connection with financing for development will not\nturn into a filibustering exercise without any impact on\nthis issue, which is so critical for the development of\nlow-income countries.\nAs I conclude, I wish to express my agreement\nwith previous speakers that the twenty-first century\nis indeed an African century. As mentioned by my\nbrother, the President of Ghana, out of the 10 fastest\ngrowing economies in the world last year, six were\nAfrican countries. I should also mention that Ethiopia\nwas among the six. Africa is indeed changing, and\nchanging for the better. There is no greater human\nrights violation than attempts to put obstacles in the\nway of the success of the ongoing transformations of\nAfrica, which will have enormous salutary implications\nfor hundreds of millions of Africans.\nAfrica is no longer the marginalized continent\nof the 1980s or even of the period a little later than\nthat. Ethiopia will continue to play its part to ensure\nthe success of the transformation and the success\nof multilateralism under the auspices of the United\nNations."

        "file_text": "\ufeffThe advance of democracy has taken place in\nsuccessive waves since the United Nations was created.\nThat advance has experienced a new acceleration,\nwhich we all can all welcome. Without underestimating\nthe difficulties and problems encountered elsewhere, I am thinking especially of the positive developments in\nMyanmar and Somalia and of the young democracies\nthroughout the world, such as Timor-Leste.\nBut it is, of course, the transformations under way\nin the Arab world that are foremost in my mind today.\n\nWhen these historic changes swept through the\nArab world, they stirred a mixture of deep emotions\nin those watching, both within the region and beyond.\nThere was fear of bloodshed, regional instability and\nof a rise of extremism, and uncertainty about what\nwas yet to come. But, overwhelmingly, the world\nlooked on with solidarity, understanding and hope.\nWe in Europe \u2014 geographically so close and with our\nsocieties so deeply involved with those in the countries\nexperiencing these upheavals \u2014 were also acutely\naware that the changes and the risks and opportunities\nthat lay ahead would directly affect us as neighbours.\nOf course, expectations were high. It was tempting\nto read the events in Tunis or Cairo as the opening pages\nof a fairy tale. But this is the book of history. It contains\ndark pages too, some of them tragically being written\nat this very moment. We are bound by a simple truth:\nachieving lasting change takes time. New democratic\ninstitutions do not run smoothly as if by magic. Turning\neconomies around and creating jobs for millions of\nyoung men and women are not things that happen at the\nwave of a wand. Deep tensions do not suddenly dissolve\nonce a dictator has gone.\nThe long path of transition lies ahead. There will\nundoubtedly be disappointments along the way. There\nwill be wrong turns, hurdles and setbacks. But I firmly\nbelieve that despite the difficulties, the momentum is\nheading in the right direction and there is no going\nback. Whatever the future brings, the Arab Spring will\nremain a turning point. The movement is irreversible.\nOnce the voices of the people have been set free \u2014 an\nunforgettable experience for all those who had never\nbeen heard before \u2014 those voices cannot be silenced.\nIt is the responsibility of each country to chart its\nown course and to do justice to the aspirations of its\npeople. The European Union is committed to staying by\ntheir side every step along the way. We are in it for the\nlong run. I want to reaffirm that we still believe in the\nmessage of the Arab Spring.\nEuropeans are well placed to recognize that\npolitical change is not painless and does not happen overnight. We know about long transitions. When\nEuropean integration first started, within my lifetime,\na majority of the countries that are now members\nwere not yet democracies. For us, a transition of such\nmagnitude should not be judged by its speed but by its\ndirection and by progress achieved through countless\nsteps forward.\nThe starting point is free and fair elections. We\ntherefore commend the achievements of Tunisia, Libya,\nEgypt and other countries in successfully organizing\ndemocratic elections, in which many citizens voted\nfreely for the very first time in their lives \u2014 elections\nfor which we were happy to lend expertise to national\nand local authorities.\nIn order to ultimately bring jobs, social justice and\nfreedom of expression to all, this gigantic democratic\nprocess will have to overcome, every single day,\nthe obstacles of corruption, red tape and economic\nprivileges and maintain the political determination to\nensure inclusiveness. It is an important effort, to which\nmany parties are contributing. For our part, across the\nregion we offer advice to entrepreneurs and officials,\nhelp train judges and police and support journalists and\ncivil society groups.\nIn our experience, societies are stronger when\nwomen are fully able to take part in the political and\neconomic lives of their countries, when their voices\nare heard and their choices respected. There may be\ntemptations, once power is gained, to refuse to grant to\nsome the rights that until recently were withheld from\nall. But a democracy can flourish only when it gives all\nits people \u2014 whatever their gender, religion, language\nor ethnic identity \u2014 an equal say and equal rights,\nguaranteed in law and in practice.\nFinally, neighbours can achieve more when they\nwork together. That is why we share experience from\nour own European union on issues such as connecting\nenergy networks and removing regional obstacles to\ntrade.\nBringing together and reconciling former enemies\nin a common desire for peace, democracy and\nprosperity has been one of the European Union\u2019s great\nachievements. Respect, tolerance and non-violence\nare the core values, without which living together\nharmoniously is not possible. These are fragile values;\nsustaining them requires constant attention, especially\nin a global digital world in which messages of all kinds\ncan spread faster than ever and can easily be exploited. Tolerance is the ability to withstand criticism, to\noffer dialogue, to refrain from violence. As such, it\nshows self-confidence. At the same time, respect for\nthe faith and beliefs of others is a key value for living\ntogether. Tolerance and respect acquire their full\nmeaning in an open society that protects freedom of\nexpression. Each and every one of us in this Hall has a\nresponsibility to defend and promote tolerance in and\nbetween our countries, as well as respect. Violence\nand killing, such as that of United States Ambassador\nChristopher Stevens, can never be justified, regardless\nof their motivations.\nToday I join the voice of Europe to those who\nhave spoken to deplore the civil war raging in Syria.\nConfronted with the massacre of tens of thousands of\npeople, the world has united in horror and condemnation,\nbut \u2014 we must be frank \u2014 we have not yet been able to\nstop the brutal violence. Of course Europe and others\nprovide humanitarian support to refugees. Of course\nwe support individuals who risk their lives collecting\nevidence of the massacres. Of course our diplomats\nin Damascus do their utmost to support the United\nNations efforts for a peaceful solution. But we will\nremain powerless unless the international community\nunites in a common determination to end this senseless\nviolence, which threatens to wreak havoc in the whole\nregion.\nI should like to commend the excellent work and\nstrong commitment of the Secretary-General, as well as\nthat of Special Representative Lakhdar Brahimi, to find\na solution to overcome this tragedy.\nI also welcome the initiatives aimed at bringing\ntogether the main regional players in a coherent\ninternational approach. Earlier this year, European\nleaders called upon all members of the Security Council\nto work together in an effort to stop the violence. Today\nthat call is even more urgent.\nThe country needs to move quickly towards a\nSyrian-led political transition that meets the democratic\naspirations of the Syrian people, while fully respecting\nthe civil and human rights of minorities. It is the only\nway out. Those responsible for the repression have no\nplace in determining the future of Syria and must step\naside. The longer that the conflict continues, the more\nradicalized people will become, the more blood will\nneedlessly be shed, and the longer it will take for the\nwounds to heal.\n\nThe security situation remains complex and fragile\nin many parts of the world. The events of the Arab Spring\nshould not distract us from the urgent task of achieving\npeace in the Middle East \u2014 quite the contrary. There\nare also other pressing issues, including addressing\ninstability and the humanitarian situation in the Sahel\nregion; bringing peace and stability to the Great Lakes\nregion; convincing the Democratic People\u2019s Republic\nof Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons and missile\nprogrammes; and finding a negotiated solution to the\nIranian nuclear issue, an issue to which the European\nUnion is directly committed.\nWe must address all of those concerns, with the\nknowldege that lasting solutions require political will\nfrom the countries involved. In the same spirit, it is\nimportant that tensions in the East and South-East\nAsian maritime areas subside and that disputes be\nsettled peacefully in a spirit of cooperation based on\nrespect for international law.\nThere are many global challenges that we must\ntackle together. But without multilateral cooperation on\nissues ranging from fighting climate change to reducing\npoverty around the world, we will not succeed. That\nis why the European Union fully supports a stronger,\nmore effective and more efficient United Nations.\nCitizens in all our countries want jobs. In that regard\nas well, global cooperation is indispensable and is the\nbest way to ensure the world\u2019s economic recovery. Our\neconomies have become completely interdependent. No\ncountry can solve its issues alone; no country can afford\nto ignore the problems of others. Do we know that? Yes.\nDo we act upon that knowledge? Not often enough.\nIn 2008, at the start of the global financial crisis,\nthere was a brief moment of global awareness, a sense\nof urgency that led to new forums, joint pledges and\ncoordinated action. Today, although the crisis is still\nwith us, our resolve in the current period after the failure\nof Lehman Brothers seems to have waned and must be\nrevived. All major economies need to play their part in\nputting the world economy back on the path of growth.\nGlobal growth depends on structural reforms in each\nof our countries and on reducing the macroeconomic\nimbalances among them.\nIn Europe we are doing our part of that work.\nNo effort has been spared to overcome the current\ndifficulties in the eurozone. We have been setting up\nstronger firewalls to guarantee the stability of our\ncommon currency, and we are reforming our economies\nto become more competitive and create jobs for the\nfuture. We have started building a banking union to\nbetter manage and contain financial sector risk; and in\nthe coming months we will be defining the perspectives\non where we are headed and where we want our\neconomic and monetary union to be in 10 years\u2019 time.\nWe have already come a long way, and today we see\nthe first results of that collective endeavour. Although\nthere is still some way to go, I am confident that those\nefforts will meet with success and that Europe will\nemerge from the experience stronger, economically and\npolitically.\n\nThat is what I have come before the Assembly to\nsay. In our view as Europeans, managing the financial\ncrisis not only concerns monetary operations and\nbalancing budgets. What is at stake is the very future\nof our European project. The project was born in order\nto overcome the wars and dictatorships that had long\nhaunted our continent. For 60 years, our union has\nallowed us to end nationalist hatred between countries\nand to establish a unified continent in peace that seeks\nsocial justice and prosperity, which requires daily\nefforts to maintain those values and establish them\nmore firmly. Gains can always be forfeited. At the\nglobal level, it is the task of the General Assembly to\nstrive tirelessly to pursue the same goals that we all\nshare, and to clear the way forward towards greater\nharmony and greater progress throughout the world."

        "file_text": "\ufeffOnce again, a woman\u2019s\nvoice is opening the general debate of the General\nAssembly. For many, we women are \u201chalf the sky\u201d.\nHowever, we wish to be half the Earth as well, with\nequal rights and opportunities, free from all forms of\ndiscrimination and violence, capable of building our\nown emancipation and, with it, of contributing to the\nfull empowerment of all.\nA year after my statement at this same rostrum\n(see A/66/PV.11), I note that many of the problems that\nalready troubled us in September 2011 remain. Today,\nI want to again consider a few of those issues, whose\nsolutions are becoming increasingly urgent.\nThe grave economic crisis that began in 2008\nhas taken on new and worrisome aspects. Opting for\northodox fiscal policies has been exacerbating the\nrecession in developed economies, with repercussions\nfor us as emerging countries, including Brazil. The\nmain leaders of the developed world have not yet found\nthe path that combines appropriate fiscal adjustment\nwith measures to stimulate investment and demand,\nwhich are indispensable to halt the recession and ensure\neconomic growth.\nMonetary policies cannot be the only response to\nthe growing unemployment, the increase in poverty and\nthe dismay that affects the most vulnerable sectors of\nthe population throughout the world. The central banks\nof developed countries continue to pursue expansionist\nmonetary policies, which causes an imbalance in\nexchange rates. The resulting artificial appreciation\nof emerging countries\u2019 currencies causes them to lose\nmarket space, which further exacerbates the global\nrecession.\nWe cannot accept the legitimate trade protection\ninitiatives of developing countries being unfairly\nclassified as protectionism. We must remember that\nlegitimate trade protection measures are in accordance\nwith the rules of the World Trade Organization. We\nshould fight protectionism and all forms of trade\nmanipulation, since they create greater competitiveness\nin a spurious and fraudulent way.\nThere can be no effective response to the crisis\nwithout strengthening cooperation efforts among\ncountries and multilateral bodies, such as the Group\nof Twenty, the International Monetary Fund and the\nWorld Bank. Such cooperation must seek to reshape\nthe relationship between fiscal and monetary policies\nin order to prevent the recession from worsening, to\ncontrol the currency war and to again stimulate global\ndemand.\nWe know from our own experience that the national\ndebt of States and bank and financial debts will not be\naddressed in the context of a recession. On the contrary,\nrecession only exacerbates such problems. It is urgent\nthat we establish a comprehensive agreement for the\ncoordinated resumption of global economic growth in\norder to prevent the despair caused by unemployment\nand a lack of opportunities.\nMy country has been doing its part. In recent\nyears, we have pursued prudent economic policies,\naccumulated significant foreign exchange reserves,\nstrongly reduced public debt and, with innovative social\npolicies, lifted 40 million Brazilians out of poverty,\nthereby strengthening a large domestic market.\nLike all countries, we were affected by the crisis.\nHowever, despite the temporary slowing in our growth\nrate, we have managed to maintain extremely high\nemployment levels and to continue to reduce social\ninequality while significantly increasing workers\u2019\nincome levels. We have overcome the incorrect view\naccording to which measures to stimulate growth\nare incompatible with austerity plans. That is a false\ndilemma. Fiscal responsibility is as necessary as\ngrowth measures are indispensable, because fiscal\nconsolidation can be sustainable only in a context of\neconomic recovery.\nHistory reveals that austerity, when exaggerated\nand isolated from growth, is self-defeating. Brazil has chosen to face both of those challenges simultaneously.\nWhile exerting strict control over public spending, we\nhave increased our investments in infrastructure and\neducation. While controlling inflation, we have acted\nvigorously through policies aimed at social inclusion\nand poverty eradication. Furthermore, while carrying\nout structural reforms in the financial and welfare areas,\nwe have reduced the tax burden and the cost of energy,\nand we have invested in infrastructure and knowledge\nto generate science, technology and innovation.\nThere are moments in which we cannot choose\nbetween one alternative or the other. Both must be\ndeveloped separately at the same time.\nJust as in 2011, the Middle East and North Africa\ncontinue to be at the center of the attention of the\ninternational community. Important social movements,\nwith different political orientations, have swept\naway despotic regimes and brought about transition\nprocesses whose meaning and direction still cannot be\nclearly discerned. However, it is not difficult to identify\nin almost all those movements a cry of protest against\npoverty, unemployment and the lack of opportunities\nand civil rights imposed by authoritarian governments\non large sectors of those societies, especially young\npeople. Nor is it difficult to find in those events the\ntraces of historical grievances caused by decades of\ncolonial or neocolonial policies carried out in the name\nof a supposedly civilizing agenda. Little by little, the\neconomic interests behind those policies became clear.\nToday, we are witnessing with consternation\nthe unfolding of the dire situation in Syria. Brazil\ncondemns in the strongest terms the violence that\ncontinues to claim lives in that country. Syria is\nwitnessing a large-scale humanitarian tragedy on its\nterritory and in that of its neighbors. The Government\nin Damascus bears the largest share of responsibility\nfor the cycle of violence that has victimized a large\nnumber of civilians, especially women, children and\nyoung people. However, we are also aware of the\nresponsibilities of armed opposition groups, especially\nthose that increasingly rely on foreign military and\nlogistical support.\nAs President of a country that is home to millions\nof people of Syrian descent, I call on the parties to\nthe conflict to lay down their weapons and join the\nmediation efforts being undertaken by the joint United\nNations-Arab League special envoy. There is no\nmilitary solution to the Syrian crisis. Diplomacy and dialogue are not simply our best option; they are the\nonly option.\nAs President of a country where thousands and\nthousands of Brazilian Muslims live, I declare here\ntoday our vehement repudiation of the escalation\nof Islamophobic prejudice in Western countries.\nBrazil is one of the players in the generous Alliance\nof Civilizations initiative originally launched by the\nTurkish Government.\nWith the same vehemence, we repudiate the\nterrorist acts that took the lives of American diplomats\nin Libya.\nWith our eyes still set upon the Middle East, where\nsome of the most important challenges to international\npeace and security lie, I wish to once more touch upon\nthe Israeli-Palestinian question. I reiterate my words\nof 2011, when I expressed the Brazilian Government\u2019s\nsupport for the recognition of the Palestinian State as a\nfull Member of the United Nations. I added then, and\nI repeat today, that only a free and sovereign Palestine\nwill be able to fulfil Israel\u2019s legitimate desires for peace\nwith its neighbours, security in its borders and regional\npolitical stability.\nThe international community has encountered\ngrowing difficulty in dealing with the exacerbation of\nregional conflicts. That is clear from the stalemates\nwithin the Security Council. It is one of the gravest\nproblems that we face. The crisis that began in 2008\ndemonstrated the need for reform of the mechanisms\nof global economic governance. In point of fact, to this\nday we have still not fully implemented such reforms.\nIncreasingly intense regional wars and conflicts, the\ntragic loss of human lives and the immense material\nlosses for the peoples involved all demonstrate the\nutmost urgency of undertaking the institutional reform\nof the United Nations, in particular of its Security\nCouncil.\nWe cannot allow the Council to be replaced, as has\nbeen the case, by coalitions that are formed without its\nconsent, beyond its control and without due regard for\ninternational law. The use of force without authorization\nby the Council is clearly illegal, yet it is beginning to\nbe regarded in some quarters as an acceptable option. It\nis by no means acceptable. The ease with which some\nresort to that kind of action results from the stalemates\nthat paralyse the Council. Because of that, the Council\nmust urgently be reformed.\n\nBrazil will always fight to ensure that decisions\nemanating from the United Nations prevail. But we want\nlegitimate actions, founded on international legality. In\nthis spirit, I have defended the need for \u201cresponsibility\nwhile protecting\u201d as a necessary complement to the\nresponsibility to protect.\nMultilateralism is stronger today after the\nUnited Nations Conference on Sustainable\nDevelopment \u2014 Rio+20. Together, during those days\nin June, we held the largest and most participative\nconference in the history of the United Nations.\nWe were able to take firm steps towards the historic\nconsolidation of a new paradigm: to grow, to include,\nto protect and to preserve \u2014 that is, sustainable\ndevelopment. I thank Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon\nand Ambassador Sha Zukang for their efforts and their\nclose collaboration with Brazil, before and throughout\nthe Conference.\nThe outcome document that we approved by\nconsensus in Rio (resolution 66/288, annex) not only\npreserves the legacy of 1992 but also sets the starting\npoint for a sustainable development agenda for the\ntwenty-first century, with a focus on the eradication\nof poverty, on the conscientious use of natural\nresources and on sustainable patterns of production and\nconsumption.\nThe United Nations has before it a number of tasks\nmandated by the Rio Conference. In particular, I would\nlike to make reference to the definition of the sustainable\ndevelopment goals. Rio+20 shone a powerful light on\nthe future we want. We have an obligation to heed\nthe many warnings being sounded by science and\nsociety. We must consider climate change one of the\nmain challenges to present and future generations.\nThe Brazilian Government is firmly committed to the\ntargets for controlling greenhouse gas emissions and\nto the unrelenting fight against deforestation in the\nAmazon rainforest.\nIn 2009, we voluntarily took on commitments and\nadopted them as laws. Those targets are particularly\nambitious for a developing country, which must deal\nwith pressing demands of all types in order to promote\nthe well-being of its population. We hope that those\ncountries that bear a greater historical responsibility\nfor climate change and that have greater means with\nwhich to deal with it will fulfil their obligations to the\ninternational community.\n\nAnother United Nations initiative we commend is\nthe Decade of Action for Road Safety 2011-2020. Brazil\nis engaged in efforts to protect lives and reduce road\naccidents, one of the main causes of death among young\npeople of the world. To that end, our Government\nis developing a wide-ranging awareness-raising\ncampaign together with the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale\nde l\u2019Automobile.\nIn a context of environmental challenges, economic\ncrises and threats to peace in different parts of the\nworld, Brazil continues committed to working with\nits neighbours to build an environment of democracy,\npeace, prosperity and social justice. We have made\ngreat progress in integrating the Latin American\nand Caribbean region as a priority for international\ncooperation.\nOur region is a good example for the world. The\nrule of law that we have achieved by overcoming\nauthoritarian regimes is being preserved and\nstrengthened. Democracy is not a heritage immune\nto attacks. In order to avoid setbacks, the Southern\nCommon Market and the Union of South American\nNations have been firm when they had to be, because we\nconsider integration and democracy to be inseparable\nprinciples. I also reaffirm our commitment to keeping\nour region free from weapons of mass destruction. In\nthat regard, I wish to recall the existence of immense\narsenals that, in addition to threatening all humankind,\naggravate tensions and hamper efforts towards peace.\nThe world clamours for food instead of weapons, for the\nbillions of men, women and children who suffer from\nthe cruelest punishment inf licted on humanity: hunger.\nFinally, I wish to refer to a brother country, beloved\nby all Latin Americans and Caribbeans \u2014 Cuba. Cuba\nhas made great progress in bringing its economic\nmodel up to date. To continue on its path, it needs the\nsupport of partners both near and far. Cooperation on\nCuba\u2019s progress is, however, hampered by the economic\nembargo that has plagued its population for decades.\nThe time has long since passed for us to put an end to\nthat anachronism, which is condemned by the immense\nmajority of Members of the United Nations.\nThis year, we watched the Olympic and Paralympic\nGames brilliantly organized by the United Kingdom.\nWith the closing of the London Olympic Games, Brazil\nhas begun the countdown towards the Rio de Janeiro\nOlympic Games in 2016, which will be preceded by the\n2014 World Cup. Every two years, during the Summer and Winter Games, humanity seems to reawaken to\nvalues that should inspire us permanently: tolerance,\nrespect for differences, equality, inclusion, friendship\nand understanding. Those principles are also the\nfoundation of human rights and of this Organization. At\nthe opening of the sixty-seventh session of the General\nAssembly, I propose to all the nations represented here\nthat they let the ideals of the Olympic flame shine upon\nthem.\nStrengthening the United Nations is necessary\nat this stage when multipolarity opens a historic new\nperspective. We must work towards that end. We must\nwork to ensure that in the multipolarity that is coming\nto prevail, cooperation predominates over conflict,\ndialogue overcomes threats and negotiated solutions are\nreached before and forestall interventions involving the\nuse of force. I reiterate that in this necessarily collective\neffort, which presupposes the quest for consensus, the\nUnited Nations has a key role to play, particularly as\nthe Organization and its various bodies become more\nrepresentative and more legitimate and therefore more\neffective.\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAt the outset, I am\npleased to congratulate Mr. Vuk Jeremi\u0107 on his election\nas President of the General Assembly at its sixty-\nseventh session. I would like to commend Mr. Nassir\nAbdulaziz Al-Nasser for his leadership as President\nat the sixty-sixth session. I also wish to express our\nprofound gratitude and appreciation to His Excellency\nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his valuable efforts\nto achieve the purposes and principles of the Charter of\nthe United Nations.\nThree years ago, a despot who ruled my country for\n42 years with tyranny and oppression stood at this very\nrostrum and tore up a copy of the Charter, saying that he\ndid not recognize the authority of the document. Today,\nI am standing on the very same rostrum to assure the\nAssembly of my delegation\u2019s support and respect for\nthe Charter.\nToday, I stand before the Assembly and the whole\nworld to apologize for all the harm and the crimes\ncommitted by that despot against so many innocent\npeople, as well as to apologize for the extortion and\nterrorism he inf licted on so many States. I want to\nassure the Organization that the Libyan people are\ndetermined to build a State that respects its neighbours,\nits international obligations and human rights, and that\nbelieves that genuine peace in the world will not be\nrealized unless the conscience of every individual is\nbrimming with peace. Libya will be a land of peace and\nsecurity and a strong force for peace.\nI am speaking today before this international\ngathering to convey the greetings of the Libyan\npeople, whose revolt on 17 February 2011 turned into\na comprehensive, explosive revolution that shook the\nvery foundations of the regime of the despot Muammar\nAl-Qadhafi, who declared that he would burn and\ndestroy Libya and make it swim in a sea of blood. He\nkilled thousands of civilians, recruited mercenaries\nfrom everywhere, assaulted peoples\u2019 honour, ordered his\nmilitias and mercenaries to rape minors, and destroyed\ncities. However, our people did not kneel; they did not\nback down. Thousands of martyrs were lost among the\nwounded and missing. The price of freedom was paid in\nblood, lives, amputated limbs and lost youth.\nIn this forum, on behalf of the Libyan people, I\nsalute the United Nations system, which stood with our\npeople, with the will of freedom against blood lust and\nannihilation, and adopted Security Council resolutions 1970 (2011) and 1973 (2011) to protect the innocent\npeople in Libya from crimes against humanity and\nviolations of human rights.\nI stand before the Assembly today representing\nthe Libyan people, who are building the institutions\nof democracy after the fall of dictatorship. The whole\nworld has witnessed the first free, transparent elections\nin Libya, when the General National Congress was\nelected and I was honoured to be elected as its President.\nThe world, through the United Nations, has given us\ncomplete, genuine support for that achievement.\nIn our revolution of freedom and in the challenge\nof establishing democracy, the conscience of the world\nwas with us, both in deeds and in thoughts. Support was\noffered from everybody and from everywhere.\nAmong those offering help was Ambassador Chris\nStevens, a voice of reason and conscience, a man of\nlove and a messenger of friendship, who came to Libya\nafter the outbreak of the revolution for freedom. He\ntouched people\u2019s emotions in Benghazi and travelled\nfrom Tripoli to the western mountains and back and\nall across Libya. Chris Stevens spoke with everyone\nin Arabic; he always smiled and showed the utmost\nconcern. This humane diplomat has found his place in\nthe consciousness and emotions of the Libyan people.\nIt was a day of sadness throughout Libya when he was\nassassinated, along with three of his aides. We would\nlike to express our deepest condolences to the friendly\nAmerican people for the grave loss. It was a loss for\nLibya as it was a loss for the United States of America.\nWe assure the Government and the people of the\nUnited States that this tragedy will only increase our\nsolidarity to entrench the hopes and objectives in\nwhich Ambassador Chris Stevens believed. We will\ndefeat the schemes of the backward terrorists, who\ndo not represent Libya or Islam. Islam is a religion of\ntolerance, peace and love. As President Obama said\nfrom this rostrum two days ago, \u201cour future will be\ndetermined by people like Chris Stevens, and not by\nhis killers\u201d (A/67/PV.6, p.11).\nIn that context, I would like to express my\ncondolences to the Libyan people, particularly the\npeople of Misrata, on the death of Imran Juma Shaban,\nwho joined the long list of martyrs some five days ago.\nI would like to express our profound appreciation\nfor the understanding shown by the United States\nAdministration following that incident, and to assure it that my country is determined to pursue the perpetrators\nand bring them to justice. We will spare no effort to\nstrengthen the necessary protection for the diplomatic\nand consular missions and all guests and ensure the\nsafety of their staff and facilities. That tragic incident\ndoes not at all represent the feelings of the Libyan\npeople, who are known for their moderation, hospitality\nand gratitude. Perhaps the massive demonstrations\ncondemning that abominable crime that took place in\nBenghazi and other Libyan cities best represent the\ngenuine feelings of the Libyan people and their total\nrejection of all forms of violence and extremism.\nLibya will never become an incubator for radical\nextremist groups and will remain a peaceful Muslim\ncountry where moderation prevails. The new Libya\nwill be based on democracy, openness, transparency,\ncombating corruption and empowering women and\nyouth. The new Libya will be by, and for, one and all.\nMeanwhile, it would be remiss of me not to\ncondemn the campaigns against Islam and to defame\nthe Prophet Muhammad. Such campaigns foment hatred\nand aim to provoke tensions among civilizations. They\ngo beyond the concept of freedom of expression and\nopinion and require that the General Assembly adopt\na legal document to criminalize the defamation of all\nreligious symbols and figures. We Muslims have an\nabsolute belief in the unity of humankind and solidarity\namong all human beings. We express our support for\nthe dialogue among religions and for cooperation,\ntolerance and eternal humanitarianumanitarian values\nand ideals. My country therefore supports all efforts\ncarried out within the framework of the dialogue among\ncivilizations, cultures and religions under the United\nNations and relevant international organizations.\nSince the revolution of 17 of February 2011, Libya\nhas witnessed many changes due to the uprising of its\npeople against social injustice and political tyranny. It\nhas not only achieved a change of the tyrant regime but\nhas progressed towards a genuine democratic regime\nbased on respect for and promotion of human rights,\npolitical pluralism and peaceful transfer of power, as\nwell as on commitment to the principles and provisions\nof international law and the Charter of the United\nNations.\nThe Assembly may have followed the sequential\npolitical developments that Libya experienced during\nthe past few months along the path to democratization.\nThose include the rebuilding of State institutions; the election of the General National Congress, which\nwill, through a constituent committee, draft Libya\u2019s\npermanent constitution; and the formation of the\nfirst interim Government following elections that\nwere commended by international observers as fair,\ndemocratic and transparent.\nWe shall work to rebuild, reorganize and reform\nState institutions, primarily the police, the national army\nand the judiciary. Various programmes and plans are\nbeing implemented towards disarming, demobilizing\nand reintegrating the former revolutionaries within\nthe ministries of defense and interior and other State\ninstitutions.\nFor the first time since independence, political\nparties have emerged on the political stage, as have\nfreedom of the press and expression, unconditional\nfreedom to demonstrate, freedom of assembly and\nfreedom to establish civil institutions, trade unions and\nintellectual, political and social organizations without\nrestrictions. That has led to free dialogue and the active\nparticipation of all segments of the people throughout\nthe country.\nFor four decades, the former regime f lagrantly\nviolated human rights through torture, detention\nwithout trial, extrajudicial killing, forced disappearance\nand ill-treatment of citizens and violations of their\ndignity. The outbreak of the 17 February revolution\nin the form of peaceful protest was confronted by the\nsecurity brigades of the former regime with bullets and\nbrutal repression, in f lagrant violation of international\nhumanitarian law and human rights law.\nThe Human Rights Council decided to suspend\nLibya\u2019s membership in the Council and formed an\ninternational fact-finding committee that voiced\nthe condemnation of the international community\nof such violations. The Council certified violations\nof human rights by the regime\u2019s forces and by some\nrevolutionaries, which has required the new Libyan\nauthorities to give the human rights file particular\nattention and to take many specific measures.\nSome may wonder whether the Arab Spring was\nworthy of support. To them I say, would it have been\nbetter for the corrupt, dictatorial regimes to continue\nfor decades more with their practices of tyranny,\noppression, injustice, arbitrary treatment, corruption,\nexploitation, and violations of the most basic human\nrights? Should they have been allowed to continue\npillaging the wealth of their peoples, pushing some of the oppressed towards extremism or a certain agenda\nincompatible with peace and security, an agenda that\npromoted violence and terror to achieve its objectives?\nDemocracy did not prevail in France a year, or even\na decade, after the French Revolution. That pattern has\nbeen repeated in other States that have gained their\nfreedom. A period of liberation was followed by stages\nof instability and a sometimes long and bloody civil\nwar before those States were able to achieve stability\nand security and to build their democratic institutions.\nAt the current stage of building the new Libya, we\nare facing extremely serious challenges that threaten\nnational and regional security. Some are a result of\nillegal activities by the sons of Al-Qadhafi and certain\nelements of the former regime who are being sought\nto face justice but have unfortunately found refuge in\nneighbouring countries and some other countries from\nwhere they carry out criminal activities that threaten\nsecurity and stability in Libya.\nBut we in Libya also face other security\nthreats \u2014 trafficking in drugs and psychotropic\nsubstances, illegal immigration and smuggling and\ntrafficking of weapons. As the Assembly knows, the\nnature and scope of such threats to national and border\nsecurity require a bilateral and multilateral response that\npromotes and strengthens national efforts. Therefore,\nlast March my country hosted the Regional Ministerial\nConference on Border Security in the North African\nand Sahelian Region, which resulted in the adoption\nof the Tripoli plan of action. The plan establishes\ncommon mechanisms and structures for cooperation\nand exchange of information, consultations, experience\nand communications on border security.\nAmong our national priorities is Libya\u2019s right\nto restitution of moneys that were pillaged from the\nState treasury and secreted outside the country. Those\nfunds have been used to finance criminal activities\nand operations in order to destabilize the country and\nthreaten its national security. That has had an impact\nupon neighbouring countries as well. We therefore call\non all our friends and on States to allow us to recover\nLibyan moneys, investments and property located in\nother countries, particularly in some countries in Africa,\nLatin America and Asia, where those funds have been\nsubject to coercive measures by some Governments.\nIn that context, we call upon all States of the\nworld to cooperate in combating corruption and\nmoney laundering. We call upon financial institutions, particularly those located in Western countries and\nsome island States, to shoulder their responsibilities\nand not accept suspicious funds, particularly from\nThird World dictators who are bleeding the wealth of\ntheir peoples and hiding those funds under fictitious\ncompany names.\nIn March 2010, Global Financial Integrity issued\na report estimating that the gross offshore deposits\nwere $10 trillion. We look forward to the signing and\nratification of an anti-corruption convention by 130\nStates. We believe that that would promote cooperation\namong States to combat corruption and bring about the\nrestitution of stolen funds.\nI would now like to pay tribute to the great\ncontribution made by the United Nations Support\nMission in Libya, previously headed by Mr. Ian Martin,\ndespite the many challenges and difficulties that were\nnatural and to be expected in the transitional phase.\nWe also welcome the appointment of Mr. Tarek Mitri\nas the new head of the Mission. We wish him every\nsuccess and look forward to further cooperation. We\nare committed to providing all the necessary assistance\nto him and the Mission.\nThe new Libya undertakes to respect all of its\ncommitments contained in the international instruments\nand covenants on disarmament and the maintenance\nof international peace and security. We are fully\nprepared to cooperate transparently and sincerely with\nthe international community to support efforts, both\nregional and international, to implement the provisions\nof international conventions and protocols and to\ncreate an international environment that would foster\nprogress towards definitively eliminating weapons of\nmass destruction. We are also determined to review\nall other international instruments to which we are not\nyet party and take the appropriate decisions thereon as\nsoon as the permanent constitution is adopted and a\nGovernment and parliament are elected.\nWe condemn Israel\u2019s measures designed to Judaize\noccupied lands and its violations of human rights and\ninternational humanitarian law. The international\ncommunity must assume its responsibilities by taking\nstrong, urgent measures to put an end to Israeli\naggression and ensure the full protection of Palestinians.\nIt must come up with a radical solution to the question\nof Palestine through a just and lasting settlement that\nincludes Israel\u2019s withdrawal from all occupied lands\nand the return of all Palestinian refugees to their homes, as well as the establishment of the independent State\nof Palestine with Al-Quds as its capital, in accordance\nwith the relevant international resolutions.\nThe suffering of the brotherly Syrian people\nis unimaginable. The regime in power is violently\nrepressing its citizens, shedding their blood and\nattacking their dignity, and has thus lost its legitimacy.\nIn order to put an end to such a tragedy, Libya urges\nthe Security Council to act promptly, in accordance\nwith the principle of the responsibility to protect,\nto take immediate action to end all forms of murder,\nviolence and destruction, find a way out of the crisis\nthrough a peaceful transition of power, and fulfil the\nlegitimate demands of the Syrian people. This can be\nachieved only through consensus among members of\nthe Security Council and support for the efforts of the\nJoint Special Representative of the United Nations and\nthe League of Arab States, Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi.\nLibya condemns the social and political injustice,\nharassment and killings being inf licted on the Muslim\nminority in Myanmar on the basis of ethnicity and\nreligion. That is a f lagrant violation of human rights\nand constitutes crimes against humanity. We call on\nall relevant human rights institutions to immediately\nintervene and put an end to the tragedy. We underline\nthe necessity of forming an international committee of\ninquiry to identify those responsible for such violence\nand killings, bring the perpetrators to justice and\nensure that victims are duly compensated and refugees\nreturned safely to their homes.\nStates Members of the United Nations have\nconvened every year at the General Assembly ever since\nthe Organization was established in order to reflect\non the purposes and principles set out in its Charter.\nWe have achieved much, but many challenges remain,\nsuch as reforming the United Nations, eliminating\nweapons of mass destruction, reducing poverty,\nignorance and disease and wars and armed conflicts,\nfighting terrorism and organized crime, protecting\nthe environment, achieving sustainable development,\nrespecting human rights, in particular the rights of\nwomen, and ensuring the rule of law and combating\nracism, hatred and fanaticism.\nLibya wishes to stress its affi nity with Africa and the\nimportance of shifting its policies towards, and relations\nwith, Africa and the world \u2014 which were once based\non personal whims and acts of extortion \u2014 to policies\nand relations firmly grounded in the best interests of all peoples. The new Libya dissociates itself from the\nrepugnant past and extends its hands in freedom and\nfriendship to build new relationships based on mutual\nrespect and fruitful cooperation.\nIn conclusion, let me wish the General Assembly\nat its sixty-seventh session full success in solving the\nissues on its agenda. I express the hope that a spirit of\nsolidarity and cooperation will prevail so that we may\ncreate a better world, one blessed with security and\nstability."

        "file_text": "\ufeffThis year\u2019s general debate began\nwith a Declaration by world leaders that our collective\nresponse to all challenges must be guided by the rule\nof law (resolution 67/1). Palau is very proud to join in\nthat Declaration, as our national story is inextricably\nlinked with the international rule of law. Not long\nago, Palau emerged as the last United Nations Trust\nTerritory, granted independence after more than 100\nyears and four successive colonial administrations. Our\nunique road to freedom left us with a lasting legacy: a\nstrong partnership with the United States of America\nand a constitution that guarantees the Palauan people\nthe rights and freedoms enshrined in the Universal\nDeclaration of Human Rights.\nThrough independence, we have preserved our\nheritage, our culture and our environment. That\npreservation was marked this year by UNESCO\u2019s\ndesignation of the Rock Islands of Palau as 2012\u2019s only\nnatural and cultural world heritage site. And, just last\nyear, the United Nations Development Programme\nranked Palau forty-ninth in the world in its Human\nDevelopment Index, a composite measure of life\nexpectancy, health, educational attainment and living\nstandards. We are very proud of that ranking for this\nsmall, new country. It is a tribute to Palau\u2019s success.\nHaving gained so much, Palau has worked to give\nback to the international community and to make the\nworld a better place. Palau proudly deployed officers as\npeacekeepers in Timor-Leste and the Solomon Islands,\nand continues to do so today in Darfur.\nUpon first taking its United Nations seat, Palau\nfocused its energies on the odious practice of deep-sea\nbottom trawling. And though it has taken some time\nand considerable buy-in from others, the two consensus\nresolutions 61/105 and 66/68 show that we can help\nprotect vulnerable deep-sea marine ecosystems and\nbiodiversity on a global scale.\n\nIn 2009, from this rostrum, Palau\u2019s President,\nJohnson Toribiong, launched the first volley in an effort\nto save the world\u2019s dwindling shark populations. He\ndeclared the world\u2019s first shark sanctuary in his general\ndebate address. The ocean\u2019s vitality depends on healthy\nshark populations. So we are grateful that States and\nterritories from across the globe have joined Palau in\ncommitting to nurture shark sanctuaries. Today, almost\n2 million square miles of ocean \u2014 an area approximately\nnine times the size of Palau\u2019s waters \u2014 are safe for\nsharks.\nPalau was also the first to sound the alarm on the\nsecurity impacts of climate change. With our Pacific\nbrothers and sisters, we moved early on to declare\nclimate change a security issue that demands the special\nattention of every organ of the United Nations system.\nThat was a new and different way of thinking about\nthe problem. Some sceptically questioned whether Blue\nHelmets would be able to hold back the rising tides.\nBut 18 months after we began, the Assembly\nadopted consensus resolution 63/281, inviting the\nrelevant organs of the United Nations to intensify\ntheir efforts to consider and address climate change,\nincluding its possible security implications. That call\nwas heeded by Germany, when it took up the issue last\nJuly as President of the Security Council. Thanks to\nGermany\u2019s efforts, as well as those of others on the\nCouncil, we now have a historic presidential statement\nhighlighting the potential risks of climate change to\ninternational peace and security.\nGermany\u2019s statement and resolution 63/281 have\nnot stemmed the rising tides, but they have helped to\nchange the way we understand and discuss climate\nchange. No longer can anyone question the impact of\nclimate change on energy security, on food security, on\nwater security or indeed on our territorial integrity. No\nlonger can anyone deny that rising seas and oppressive\ndroughts are displacing people across the globe. As\nthe United States Permanent Representative said\nat last year\u2019s Council meeting, to deny the security\nimplications of climate change would be pathetic.\nThe world has reached a crossroads on sustainable\ndevelopment. We have recently concluded discussions\nat the United Nations Conference on Sustainable\nDevelopment and will soon delineate new sustainable\ndevelopment goals, focusing again on small island\ndeveloping States. For Palau, that crossroads is an\nopportunity to better integrate healthy oceans and\nfisheries into the regulatory development framework.\nSustainable fisheries are Palau\u2019s lifeblood. For\nPalau, it has always been, and continues to be, a blue\neconomy or no economy. That is why we have limited\npurse seine fishing, agreed with our neighbours to\nclose the doughnut holes between our jurisdictions, and\nimplemented an innovative vessel day scheme strategy\nthrough the parties to the Nauru Agreement. That is\nalso why we have conserved 58 per cent of our in-shore\nmarine area through the Protected Areas Network,\nbanned bottom trawling and declared the world\u2019s first\nshark sanctuary.\nWe were honoured this year that the Protected Areas\nNetwork Act and the Shark Haven Act received the 2012\nFuture Policy Award for outstanding maritime policy\nand for contributing most effectively to the sustainable\nmanagement of the world\u2019s oceans and coasts for the\nbenefit of current and future generations. We thank the\nWorld Future Council, the Convention on Biological\nDiversity, the Food and Agriculture Organization of\nthe United Nations, the Okeanos Foundation for the Sea\nand the Global Environmental Facility for conferring\ntheir generous recognition and support through that\naward.\nPalau champions three straightforward principles\nfor global fisheries. First, global fisheries should be\nfair. If distant-water vessels want to come for fish that\ntraverse Palau\u2019s waters, they should respect our laws.\nThey should fish within our limits and recognize our\nright to realize the benefits of our natural resources.\nIllegal fishing is tantamount to piracy; it robs us of our\nlivelihoods and undermines our security.\nSecondly, global fisheries should be sustainable.\nWe should use every means at our disposal to achieve\nstock levels that will ensure healthy fisheries for\nthe long term. That includes closing fisheries when\nnecessary.\nThirdly, global fisheries should be accountable.\nReports show that 87 per cent of global fish stocks\nare now fully exploited or overexploited. Those are\nthe worst numbers on record. Regional fisheries\nmanagement organizations, which stand in the shoes of\nthe General Assembly, should do better and should be\nmore transparent. We are encouraged that negotiations\nthis year enabled the resolution on sustainable fisheries\n(resolution 66/88) to better reflect those three principles.  Palau is pleased to report on the success of a number\nof key domestic initiatives, which we have previously\nraised in the general debate. Palau has taken innovative\nsteps to reduce our emissions by solarizing our airport,\nour Government buildings and our highways. By\n2020, we will generate 20 per cent of our energy from\nrenewable sources. We have also created a successful\ngreen mortgage programme to assist the financing of\ngreener homes. That programme, which began with\na small amount of financing from Italy, was recently\nthe subject of a workshop among 13 regional financing\ninstitutions, with plans for expansion throughout the\nPacific.\nPalau is also working to connect itself to the\nworld \u2014 literally. It is inconceivable to many of us here\nin New York, but Palau remains without broadband\nInternet. That means that no Palauan can watch\nthe streaming video of this speech. The Broadband\nCommission of the International Telecommunication\nUnion tells us that broadband access is a prerequisite\nto achieving the Millennium Development Goals and\nthat a 10 per cent increase in broadband penetration\nincreases a developing country\u2019s gross national product\nby 1.4 per cent. We are sure that a 100 per cent increase\nwould fundamentally improve Palauan health, business\nand civic engagement. We continue to seek partners\nthat might help Palau to reach that goal.\nLast year Palau underwent its Human Rights\nCouncil Universal Periodic Review. The most repeated\nrecommendation by Human Rights Council members\nwas that we should establish a national human rights\ninstitution. With the help of new partners, we are\ntranslating human rights conventions into Palauan,\nbringing the lessons of international human rights into\nPalauan schools, harmonizing our national legislation,\nregulations and practices with the international human\nrights instruments, and supporting human rights\nprogrammes and services in Palau through that formal\ninstitution.\nAll those activities have been complemented by\nthe outstanding work being done to remove explosive\nremnants of Second World War from Palau. As President\nToribiong stated from this rostrum last year, many of\nthose explosives are still live and are being discovered\nnear our schools, roads and utilities. With the help of\nour partners, much of this unexploded ordnance is being\ndestroyed. We hope that anyone interested in our efforts\nwill attend our upcoming regional workshop in October\nto see first-hand the successful model of cooperation\nbetween Palau\u2019s Government, non-governmental\norganizations, donors and the local community that is\neradicating that scourge from our midst.\nWe would like to express our gratitude for the\nstrong support and friendship of our partners for\nhelping to get those and other important projects off\nthe ground. Palau thanks especially the United States,\nJapan, Australia and the Republic of China (Taiwan).\nPalau continues to believe that Taiwan\u2019s meaningful\nparticipation in the United Nations system will help to\nfurther promote the system\u2019s efficacy, goals and ideals,\nincluding those of the International Civil Aviation\nOrganization and the United Nations Framework\nConvention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).\nPalau very much appreciates the President\u2019s\nchoice of \u201cBringing about adjustment or settlement\nof international disputes or situations by peaceful\nmeans\u201d as the theme for this year\u2019s general debate. It is\nas important as ever that we commit to upholding the\npeace and condemn violence wherever it occurs. To that\nend, Palau condemns in the strongest possible terms the\nrecent attacks on the diplomatic premises in the Middle\nEast. We agree with President Obama that such attacks\nare \u201can assault on the very ideals upon which the United\nNations was founded\u201d (A/67/PV.6,  p.  11). We must be\nvigilant in protecting all diplomatic missions, wherever\nthey may be.\nCloser to our shores in the Pacific, Palau is also\nhopeful that tensions in the East China Sea will\ndissipate, and that all of our neighbours can engage in a\nmore peaceful dialogue.\nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon cautioned the\nworld last week that we are wilfully blind when it\ncomes to climate change. We are awash in reports\ntelling us that the situation is dire. We have experienced\nmore than 100 consecutive months of temperatures\nabove global averages. Nine of the 10 warmest years\non record have occurred since the year 2000. Arctic\nsea ice is at its lowest level in recorded history. Coral\nreefs are disappearing at an alarming rate. Now, buried\nin the recent report of the Intergovernmental Panel on\nClimate Change regarding the management of risk is\nadvice to policymakers in small island States that, in\ncertain cases, they may wish to consider relocating their\npopulations. We assure the members of the Assembly\nthat Palau has no intention of moving its people. Our\nislands are their home. They are the essence of Palau\u2019s\nvery being. I can state with every confidence that Palau will pursue every legitimate recourse available before\nwe concede hope.\nThe current situation at the UNFCCC is\nunacceptable. After more than 20 years of negotiations,\nwe are running out of creative ways to say that countries\nare being destroyed. Sadly, it seems that the most\nvulnerable countries have become acceptable collateral\ndamage. The world knows the causes of climate change.\nIt is within our grasp to effect a solution. No army\nstands in our way. If something is not done soon, all\nthe good, hard work to which Palau and the other island\nnations of the world have dedicated themselves will be\nfor naught.\n\nIn conclusion, we know that the times we live in\nare turbulent, but we must heed our leaders\u2019 call to be\nguided by the Charter of the United Nations and the\ninternational rule of law. Palau will continue to do\nits part by being a moral voice for what is right, and\nhopefully, a model global citizen."

        "file_text": "\ufeffAt the outset, I would\nlike to congratulate my dear friend His Excellency\nMr. Vuk Jeremi\u0107 on his election as the President of the\nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-seventh session. I believe\nthat, with his able leadership, he will contribute greatly\nto the work of the Assembly.\nI want to be frank and speak the language of the\npeoples we all represent. Every year, we all gather here\nat the United Nations, the embodiment of the human\nquest for peace, security and international order. We\nexchange views on the daunting challenges that we all\nface and express our strong commitment to resolving\nthem. On many matters, we speak as one, yet we often\nfail to act in unity. We express our commitment to\nthe settlement of frozen conflicts, but there is still no\nprospect for a solution to many such conflicts.\nFor instance, we have time and again declared\nour support for a two-State solution to the question of\nPalestine and adopted numerous resolutions to that end. However, we still hope that, one day soon, Palestine will\nbe represented as an equal member in the Assembly.\nWe also underline the need for a solution to the\nNagorno Karabakh issue in accordance with the\nterritorial integrity of Azerbaijan. Yet there has not\nbeen a single step towards the resolution of that problem\nfor the past two decades.\nIn addition, the problem of Cyprus has remained\nunresolved for almost half a century. Nearly a decade\nhas passed since the United Nations settlement plan\nof 2004, which the entire international community\nendorsed. However, Turkish Cypriots continue to face\nisolation and an unlawful and unjust embargo as if it\nwere a token of appreciation for their support for the\nUnited Nations-led settlement.\nMy point speaks for itself. We cannot resolve\ncurrent problems, and each year we find ourselves\nbesieged by ever-increasing new ones. Terrorists\ncontinue to strike and take the lives of innocent people,\nyet we still have no effective international response to,\nor adequate solidarity against, the scourge of terrorism.\nToday, some States employ methods of State\nviolence and brutal oppression with impunity, which\ncosts the lives of innocent citizens whom they are\nobliged to protect. We firmly believe that human life\nis sacred and that life is the foremost blessing for any\nhuman being, whoever and wherever they are.\nHowever, millions of people live in poverty\nand under oppression. They are deprived of their\nfundamental rights and freedoms, suffering under\nextreme conditions that no human being should ever\nhave to live under. To soothe our collective conscience,\nwe constantly reiterate our pledges to help alleviate\nthe misery of those people. However, we fall short of\nmatching our words with deeds.\nWe live in perpetual hope. After all, as human\nbeings, we are the children of hope. For us, every\ndawn, every sunrise and every spring signifies a new\nbeginning of hope. We yearn for peace and idealize\npeace. It is the essence of our nature.\nHumankind expects from us, the leaders of nations,\nto move humankind towards real peace. However,\nwe lag far behind in meeting the expectations of our\nnations and of humankind. If it is not for us to provide\nrelief and give hope to a child living in a refugee camp\nor in open prisons in certain parts of the world, then\nwhat is the chance that we will cultivate real peace? When a child opens his eyes to a world of extreme\npoverty and oppression in a refugee camp or in the\nstreets of his neighbourhood, or when a parent leaves\nbehind a destroyed house, orphans and widows, how\ncan we prevent them from succumbing to despair and\npessimism? If we cannot regard the rights of a person\nin Syria, Palestine, Somalia, Afghanistan, the Rakhine\nregion or other places as equal to our own, how can we\ntalk about freedom and justice? If fundamental human\nrights are sacrificed for the sake of power politics and\nbecome negotiable in talks among a few nations in\nthe Security Council, how are we to achieve universal\nhuman rights and security? If we remain incapable of\ntaking action to preserve the universal principles that\nthe forefathers of the United Nations set out when\nforming this body, how can we demonstrate to people\nthat the f lag of the United Nations represents hope for,\nand a safeguard of, their destiny? If the use of force\nis accepted as unlimited; if indiscriminate attacks and\ncollective punishment become weapons in the hands\nof cruel regimes against their own citizens, as we\nare currently witnessing every day, day and night, in\nSyria; if we fail to hear and rise to join the cry of the\ninnocent masses, wherever they are; and if we cannot\nforce such brutal regimes to submit to justice and the\nrule of law, how are we to maintain international peace\nand security?\nA peaceful world, as the founders of the United\nNations envisioned, cannot be established if we remain\nineffective in our work against those challenges. Let\nus not forget: our inability to act becomes a tool in the\nhands of despots and destructive regimes to demolish\ncities, towns and villages, massacre their own citizens\nand make a mockery of the civilized world and the\nUnited Nations.\nThe failure to address humanitarian crises shakes\nour collective conscience. Worse, however, inaction\neventually emboldens oppressors and aggressive\nregimes and creates evil alliances that perpetuate\nand commit crimes against humanity. Let us make\nno mistake: mercy shown to an oppressor is the most\nmerciless act towards people under oppression. If not\nnow, when are we supposed to act in unity? If not the\nUnited Nations, who is to lead? If not us, then who\nwill shoulder the responsibility to protect innocent\ncivilians? Let us now imagine that we are in the shoes\nof those people. How can we even dream about a real\nfuture?\n\nWe need a strong, efficient and credible United\nNations. To that end, we must first tackle the long-\noutstanding issue of reforming the United Nations to\nmake it fit for its purpose. The working methods and\nstructures of the United Nations are not commensurate\nwith the current realities of the world. The Security\nCouncil, with its primary responsibility to maintain\ninternational peace and security, should become\nmore representative, functional and effective. It has\nto respond to the real needs of the world. That is the\nonly way that it will remain relevant to the enormous\nchallenges that we all face in the twenty-first century.\nI can freely appeal to the Assembly\u2019s conscience,\nas Turkey has a solid record \u2014 be it in Afghanistan,\nSomalia, Syria, Yemen, Libya or Bosnia and\nHerzegovina or when it comes to cooperation with\nleast developed countries, the United Nations Alliance\nof Civilizations and the Mediation for Peace initiative,\namong other examples.\nAllow me now to brief ly touch upon some specific\nissues that continue to pose formidable challenges for\nthe international community.\nLet me start by underlining that the recent attacks\nagainst Islam and the Prophet Muhammad \u2014 peace be\nupon him \u2014 and Islam are outright provocations. They\naim to pit nations and peoples against each other. We\ndeplore in the strongest terms the malicious attempts to\ndenigrate the most sacred values of Islam or any other\nfaith. We condemn any type of incitement to hatred and\nreligious discrimination against Muslims and people of\nother faiths.\nUnfortunately, Islamophobia has become a new\nform of racism. It can no longer be tolerated under\nthe guise of freedom of expression. Freedom does not\nmean anarchy. It means responsibility. The purpose of\nIslamophobia is clear and simple. It aims to create an\nabstract and imaginary enemy out of the millions of\npeace-loving Muslims all over the world. Regretfully,\naccepting generalities, stereotypes and prejudice as\ntruth, many people unknowingly become Islamophobic.\nHowever, no agenda, no provocation, no attack and no\nincitement to hatred can darken the bright face of Islam.\nAt the same time, we condemn all the provocations\nand violence that have led to the loss of lives in many\ncountries, including the death of the United States\nAmbassador in Libya. I express our sincere condolences\nfor all who have lost their lives. Violence against\ninnocent people cannot be justified under any pretext. Any such activity, no matter whom it is carried out by\nor for what purpose, is a betrayal against the soul, spirit\nand letter of Islam.\nHowever, the recent events are testament to a more\nserious problem that should concern not just Muslims,\nbut the adherents of all faiths and religions. The\nalarming increase in the number of acts that defame\nreligions, and thereby people who adhere to them, now\nhave serious implications for international peace and\nsecurity. The time has therefore come to establish the\ndenigration of any religion and its followers as a hate\ncrime. We have to take swift measures. We cannot, and\nwe shall not, leave our future vulnerable to the reckless\nprovocations of all sorts of extremists.\nWe need to craft a universal policy and a legal\ninstrument that, while protecting free expression, also\nensure respect for religion and prevent intentional\ninsults against anyone\u2019s faith. The solution should not\nbe arbitrary. It has to focus on those who defame a faith\nwith the intention of inciting discrimination, hostility or\nviolence. We have to find a balance between protecting\nthe rights of an individual or group to free expression\nand protecting the right of another individual or group\nnot to become the target of hatred or of emotional,\nincited or psychological violence.\nTherefore, from this rostrum, I would like to make\na strong appeal to the members of the international\ncommunity to set up all the necessary instruments\nto combat all hate crimes, including the denigration\nof religions and defamation of their followers. The\nUnited Nations must lead that effort and should provide\nthe international legal framework to that end. We are\nresolved to actively pursue this objective and to work\ndiligently with like-minded nations and international\norganizations to ensure that we take a united and\neffective stance against Islamophobia and all forms of\nhate.\nMoreover, we are well aware of the need to ensure\nthe safety, security and protection of diplomats. In\nthe past four decade, the Turkish nation has lost 33\ndiplomats to terrorist acts by the Armenian Secret\nArmy for the Liberation of Armenia. We encourage\nthe United Nations to focus on a new understanding\nof, and international instrument for, the protection of\ndiplomats.\nAs a mockery of the values we all share, the people\nof Syria have continued to suffer under the brutality\nand tyranny of the regime in Damascus for the past 18 months. The numbers speak volumes. More than 30,000\npeople have been killed so far, approximately 300,000\nSyrian refugees have f led to neighboring countries,\nincluding Turkey, and more than 1 million people are\ninternally displaced.\nUnfortunately, this humanitarian tragedy has\nbecome just a statistic for many. What has the\ninternational community done to stop this carnage?\nLiterally nothing. We have yet to see a single effective\naction to save innocent lives. It is a great disgrace\nto witness that today, after 20 years, the ghosts of\nSrebrenica and Halabja continue to haunt us, this time\nin the cities of Syria.\nOne can argue about the reasons for the failure of\nthe Security Council to stop the violence of the Syrian\nregime. However, there can be no legitimate explanation\nfor the failure of the Security Council to reflect the\ncollective conscience of the international community.\nIt has to uphold its primary responsibility to maintain\ninternational peace and security. It is the inability of the\nCouncil to act that continues to encourage the Syrian\nregime to kill ever more people.\nIf the Security Council does not follow the\nconscience of the international community, as reflected\nby the resolutions adopted by a more than two-thirds\nmajority of the General Assembly, who will respond to\nthe cries of the Syrian people? For how long will we,\nthe international community, allow this humanitarian\ntragedy to continue?\nThe responsibility to protect the people of Syria\nis our fundamental duty. No political differences,\nno balance of power politics and no geopolitical\nconsiderations should prevail over our conscience and\nour concern for the destiny of the Syrian people.\nMore important, the situation in Syria has evolved\ninto a real threat to regional peace and security. The\nSyrian regime deploys every possible instrument to\nturn the legitimate struggle of the Syrian people into\na sectarian war, which will engulf the entire region in\nflames. Unfortunately, the longer the regime is allowed\nto wage its campaign of violence, the harder it will be\nto prevent such a dreadful eventuality.\nIt is high time that the Security Council take\naction, as the Assembly called for. There has to be a\nsolution to ensure the immediate safety and security of\nthe Syrian people. There has to be a solution for a sound\ntransition process that paves the way for the creation of a new and democratic Syria. The regime in power\nhas to step down and allow an interim Government to\nlead the country to free and fair elections. The Syrian\npeople need our united support and solidarity in their\nstruggle for their future and their right to a legitimate\nand representative Government.\nThe Turkish nation stands by its brethren, the\nSyrian people, in their legitimate struggle. We now care\nfor 90,000 displaced Syrian refugees in Turkish homes.\nLet me underline once again that, since the beginning\nof the conflict, we have never hesitated, nor will we\never, hesitate to be at the side of our Syrian brothers and\nsisters in their most difficult hour.\nAnother tragedy that has long been taking\nplace before our eyes in the Middle East is that of\nPalestine. This is the fourth General Assembly session\nwhere we continue to stress the unacceptability and\nunsustainability of the situation in Gaza. However, to\ndate, there has been no progress. As a result, in the\nfourth year of the unlawful blockade by Israel, the\npeople in Gaza, children in particular, continue to live\nin despair, desolation and fear.\nMany decisions and resolutions have been adopted\nat the United Nations calling for the lifting of that\nunlawful blockade. However, Israel persists in its illegal\npolicy to this day, thereby causing misery and anguish\nin Gaza. In fact, we see the same attitude by Israel in all\nof the occupied Palestinian territories. Despite insistent\ncalls by the international community, it carries on with\nits illegal settlements in Palestine, and thus deliberately\nundermines the prospects of a peaceful two-State\nsolution.\nIndeed, when President Mahmoud Abbas spoke in\nthe Assembly last year (see A/66/PV. 19) and declared\nthe right of Palestine to be recognized as an independent\nState, I remember seeing the whole Assembly in a\nstanding ovation. But as of this day we have yet to see\nthe State of Palestine as an equal member of the General\nAssembly, with the f lag of the independent Palestine\nf lying. How can we convince the Palestinian people\nthat the international community is serious about a\ntwo-State solution when no United Nations resolutions\nhave helped their cause for an independent State of\nPalestine? However, we will one day see the f lag of\nPalestine in the Hall. Turkey will certainly support the\nPalestinian people in their quest for statehood, dignity\nand peace.\n\nWhile the whole world\u2019s attention is rightly focused\non the Middle East, we should not forget that there are\nserious human tragedies taking place elsewhere as\nwell. We do not have the luxury to turn a blind eye to\nany human suffering.\nAs I personally witnessed during my visit in June, the\npeople of the Rakhine region, especially the Rohingya\nMuslims, are in desperate need of humanitarian\nassistance. The democratization process under way in\nMyanmar provides us with a window of opportunity, as\nthe Government has repeatedly stressed its readiness to\ncooperate with the international community to ease the\nsuffering of those people.\nBefore concluding my remarks, I wish to touch\nupon yet another long-standing conflict that also\nrequires immediate practical steps towards a fair\nand lasting solution. I am referring to the problem of\nCyprus. Unfortunately, the new round of talks started\nin 2008 are at a stalemate, with no end in sight, due\nto Greek Cypriots\u2019 intransigence and lack of political\nwill. Today, despite half a century\u2019s experience and a\nbody of United Nations work, there is still not a clear\nprospect for a solution.\nThe Turkish Cypriots have so far proven their firm\ncommitment to a negotiated solution, but remain subject\nto an inhumane and unlawful embargo. That is simply\nunfair. They should not be forced to play this game for\nan indefinite period without a clear perspective and\ntimeline for a solution.\nThe international community must not remain\nindifferent to what is happening in Cyprus, either. After all, the continuation of the problem creates additional\nrisks for the stability of the region. Moreover, the\nunilateral exploration of oil and natural gas by the\nGreek Cypriots around the island further intensifies\nthose risks.\nUnder those circumstances, the United Nations\nmust do more than what it is currently doing. The\nSecurity Council in particular has to facilitate a solution\nrather than merely sustaining the status quo. A change\nof mentality is essential. There should be a distinction\nbetween those who seek and aspire for a solution and\nthose who reject it. It is no longer enough to pay lip\nservice to a bi-zonal, bi-communal federation. It is time\nto act before it is too late.\nIn conclusion, I wish to go back to what I said at\nthe beginning of my remarks. We are at the end of the\nopening of yet another session of the General Assembly.\nWe have all expressed our desire for and commitment\nto a more peaceful and prosperous world. However,\npositive change can only be realized if our actions\nmatch our words and promises. Every attempt to\nachieve our objective for real peace, every moment we\nspend to uphold rightness and justice and every effort\nwe make for freedoms and human rights will provide\ngreater comfort for those who struggle to have a say in\ntheir destiny. A while ago, I asked if not now, when?\nThis year, let us make a difference and let us hope that\nwe will not repeat the same question next September in\nthe Assembly."

        "file_text": "\ufeffI wish to join previous speakers\nin congratulating the new President of the General\nAssembly and in commending the President of the\nAssembly at its sixty-sixth session for his excellent\nleadership. Allow me also to convey my deep respect\nfor the tireless efforts that His Excellency Secretary-\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon has made as leader of the\nSecretariat and as a world statesman.\nToday our world continues to face numerous\narduous challenges that require an urgent and collective\nresponse. Many of the gravest threats to the States\nmembers of the Assembly, including mine, the Federated States of Micronesia, are simply beyond the abilities of\nour individual countries to single-handedly address,\neven with our most aggressive and concentrated efforts.\nTo speak before this body today is an honour and an\nopportunity that I must take to encourage international\ncooperation to help address those challenges.\nThe biggest challenge we face today in Micronesia\ncontinues to be climate change, not just the projections\nof future loss and damage, but the dangerous impacts\nthat my people are experiencing every day. Sadly,\nto date no significant progress has been made on\nclimate-change mitigation. Time and again, I have\nasked, \u201cHow do I tell my people that their plight and\ntheir future lie in the hands of those most responsible\nfor greenhouse gases?\u201d\nFrom our point of view, we must step up our\ncollective efforts to confront global climate change\nmore urgently and more creatively. What is needed\nnow is to close the ambition gap. I therefore call on the\nmajor emitters to step up their level of commitment\nunder the Kyoto Protocol. Our very existence depends\non it. Without international cooperation and assistance,\nwe are helpless against the adverse impacts of climate\nchange.\nMicronesia has barely contributed to the problem\nof climate change; it has, in fact, contributed to some of\nthe solutions thereto. We actively participate in United\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change\nnegotiations and continue to advocate for significant\ncuts in greenhouse-gas emissions.\n\nWe were therefore pleased with the agreement\nreached this summer in Rio to begin cooperation on a\nglobal phase-down in the production and consumption of\nhydrof luorocarbons (HFCs). Micronesia first proposed\namending the Montreal Protocol on Substances that\nDeplete the Ozone Layer in 2009. Today it remains\nthe ideal venue for a phase-down of the production\nand consumption of HFCs, just as has been done with\nrespect to similar gases that HFCs were invented to\nreplace.\nTo the rest of the world, the map may look fairly\nempty on our side of the globe, but to all of us it is\nas much a homeland as any continental land mass. We\nmust treat it accordingly, and we must defend it just as\nstrongly. And therein lies our second, closely related\nchallenge: the change in our ocean environment. That\nchange includes not only rising tides and temperatures\nand ocean acidification, but also the damage caused by\nharmful and destructive fishing practices, pollutants\nsuch as mercury and oil, and other waste resulting from\nunsustainable human activity. The abhorrent practice of\nillegal, unreported and unregulated fishing continues\nunabated, and urgent actions to reduce by-catch, fish\ndiscards and post-harvest losses must be taken.\nFor us, as a Pacific small island developing State,\nour livelihood, our economy, our culture and our\nway of living are tied to a blue economy. We have\nrecognized that the conservation and sustainable use\nof the ocean and its resources are key elements in\nachieving sustainable development. We must fulfil our\ncommitments made at Rio.\nMy country welcomes the decision taken in Rio\nto hold a global conference on small island developing\nStates in 2014. Micronesia fully supports that decision\nand reiterates its call to hold such a conference in one of\nthe Pacific small island developing States.\nThe rising cost of global energy continues to pose\na serious challenge to our socioeconomic development\nand sustainability. Small island developing States such\nas Micronesia continue to rely heavily on imported\nfossil fuel despite the abundance of renewable energy\nsources. Our unique and particular vulnerabilities\noften translate into significantly higher costs for energy\ninfrastructure and fossil fuels. As a consequence, our\nGovernments spend a high percentage of our limited\nbudgets on fossil-fuel procurement alone, often at the\nexpense of the other sectors of our economies.\nTo mitigate that situation, small island developing\nStates adopted the Barbados Declaration on Achieving\nSustainable Energy for All in Small Island Developing\nStates, which has become an annex to the outcome\ndocument of the United Nations Conference on\nSustainable Development, adopted last June. That\nis a concrete expression of the small islands\u2019 own\ndetermination and ambition to promote renewable\nenergy, energy efficiency, energy access and low-\ncarbon development.\nHowever, our transition to renewable energy\nrequires financing and new, appropriate and affordable\ntechnology. To that end, I must recognize and commend\nthe bilateral assistance already provided in that area by\nthe European Union, Japan, China, the United States,\nFrance, Italy and Turkey, as well as others that are also\nassisting through other multilateral arrangements. We\nurge other partners to join us to ensure sustainability.\nWe also urge support for the Secretary-General\u2019s\ninitiative on \u201cSustainable Energy for All\u201d.\nOur health-care system is increasingly under\nstress and facing constant challenges from the growing\nburden of non-communicable diseases, which has\nreached epidemic proportions in the Pacific. While we\naccept that the primary responsibility for health rests\nwith our Government, we are seeking assistance from\nthe international community in capacity-building,\ninstitutional strengthening and policy formulation.\nWhile we recognize the contributing effects of nutrition\nand lifestyle in that epidemic, we are also mindful of the\nfact that climate change has magnified the challenge as\na result of the threat it poses to food security and the\ntraditional lifestyle of Micronesians.\nThe Federated States of Micronesia supports the\ngreater participation of women in social, political\nand economic development. We look to development\npartners to enhance our investment in ensuring that the\npotential of women is nurtured and realized through\nquality education, health-care services and security\nmeasures against domestic and gender-based violence.\nIt is only appropriate that measures to empower women\nto be true participants in nation-building should be\nlocally driven. We have embarked on mainstreaming\nwomen\u2019s views, interests and contributions into national\ndevelopment policies. We recognize and appreciate\nthe assistance extended by the United Nations system\nand our development partners to support our national\npolicies to enhance gender equality.\n\nTurning to our Organization, the single most urgent\nneed is to reform the Security Council. Naturally, such\nan important step must not be taken in haste. However,\nafter more than a decade of talking, we should be close\nto finding an acceptable formulation. Success on this\nissue will strengthen the Organization and stimulate\nand renew confidence in the Charter.\nMy country subscribes to the principles of peace,\nsecurity and prosperity, as enshrined in the Charter of\nthe United Nations. We are horrified by the senseless\nkilling of thousands of innocent civilians in Syria.\nOver the past two weeks, we have witnessed surges\nin violence. We join the international community in\ncondemning violence, in particular the attacks on\ndiplomatic missions, diplomats and personnel in Libya\nand Egypt. We must be bold in our actions to prevent\nsuch attacks. I call on Member States to continue their\nefforts to find peaceful solutions to these conflicts,\nespecially the most challenging ones.\nThe United Nations has the unique opportunity\nto address and solve the many challenges facing its\nweakest and most vulnerable States Members. The\nchallenge lies in how the Organization and its most able\nMembers can turn their many ambitious statements\ninto mobilizing the required resources to successfully\nprotect the citizens of the world.\nWe in the Federated States of Micronesia, facing\nour troubled world, continue to place our faith in the\nUnited Nations as we look towards future. Our isolation\namid the vast expanse of the Pacific Ocean no longer\nshields us from the threat of international terrorism.\nGlobalization has long had a foothold on our island\nState. Facebook links us to the world.\nAllow me to end with a quote from my Constitution:\n\u201cThe seas bring together, they do not separate us ....\nWe extend to all nations what we seek from each:\npeace, friendship, cooperation and love in our common\nhumanity\u201d."

That was a time when\ncomputers had barely been invented. The Internet\nwas decades away. And it was not always easy for\nthe representatives at that founding conference in\nSan Francisco to establish contact with their faraway\ncapitals for instructions that might be needed.\nThese days, we have instant access to the global\ninformation network. Tweets are being written as I\nspeak. There are more connected devices than there are\npeople in the world, and development is accelerating in\nevery respect. In 2012, we who are gathered here have\nall become representatives of the connected nations of\nthe world. But, connectivity also carries risks, as we\nsaw recently in our interconnected financial system,\nRecently, we also all followed with horror and\ndisbelief the fact that an odious film clip posted\nsomewhere on YouTube could lead to outrage and deadly\nviolence 10,000 miles away. But the opportunities\ncreated by connectivity are vastly more important\nthan the risks. Globalization, marked by more open\nsocieties in a more open world and facilitated by the\nenormous advances of science and technology, has\nbeen an incredible force for good. Mobile banking\nbrings financial services to East Africans. Skype\nreinforces messages from the Arab street. Virtual\nmarketplaces unleash entrepreneurial talent. More\ncontact, more movement and more trade \u2014 a more\nopen world \u2014 have already lifted hundreds of millions\nof people out of poverty and despair, and more is\ncertain to come.\nIn this world of connected nations, people around\nthe globe, including tens of thousands of Swedes of\nSyrian origin, are following the tragedy unfolding in\nDamascus, Aleppo and Homs with intense concern. We\nhave all been reminded of a simple truth \u2014 violence\nis easy to start but very difficult to stop. What began\nas a popular protest has now turned into a civil war,\nwhich, if unchecked, brings the risk of sectarian\nfragmentation across the wider region. We must do\neverything possible to prevent that from happening.\nWe call on the divided Security Council to put global\nresponsibilities above narrow national interests. In the\nstrongest possible terms, we urge the Al-Assad regime\nto stop killing its own people and start respecting its\nobligations as a Member of the United Nations. And\nwe remind those responsible for deadly violence and\nabuse that they should rest assured that they will be\nheld accountable one day.\n\nThere is no alternative to a political solution.\nTogether with our European partners, we offer our\nfull support to the Joint Special Representative,\nMr. Lakhdar Brahimi. Syria is a society that is rich\nin culture, history and traditions. Damascus is one of\nthe oldest continually inhabited cities in our world. To\npreserve and protect the mosaic that Syria represents\nis vital to its future, and, I would argue, to all of our\nfutures.\nBut we must also help those now so tragically\naffected by what is happening. A thousand people are\nbeing killed every week, according to the latest reports\nwe are receiving. We are witnessing an enormous human\ntragedy. More than 2.5 million people are in need of\nhumanitarian help. More than a million people have\nbeen displaced inside Syria, and there are a quarter of\na million refugees in the region as a direct consequence\nof the current crisis. The regime must give unhindered\naccess for assistance to the displaced and suffering, and\nthe countries that have generously opened their borders\nshould be commended and supported. Sweden, which\nis one of the world\u2019s largest humanitarian donors, has\ncontributed massively, and we stand ready to further\nincrease our support here and elsewhere around the\nworld where people in need are suffering.\nIn this world of connected nations, the human\nrights of every child, woman and man are a matter of\nconcern for us all. Protecting and promoting human\nrights is one of the central duties of the international\ncommunity. Not only is that a question of protecting\nindividual human beings \u2014 their life, their freedom,\ntheir future \u2014 but it is also crucial to promoting peace,\nstability and prosperity around the globe. And critical\nto those efforts is working for gender equality and the\nempowerment of women, because it is right, because it\nis smart and because it is fundamental to realizing the\neconomic and political potential of society.\nSweden, the largest financial contributor to\nthe work of the Office of the United Nations High\nCommissioner for Human Rights today, is a candidate\nfor a seat on the Human Rights Council for the period\n2013-2015. As a Council member, Sweden would be\nan active and reliable partner. We would work with\neveryone who shares our conviction, reach out to those\nwho disagree and support those who need it. But in that\narea as well, we must adjust to the world of connectivity.\nThe human rights and fundamental freedoms enshrined\nin the Universal Declaration of Human Rights must\napply in the modern world of today. Sweden will take\nevery opportunity to champion freedom of expression\nonline and the immense development potential that is\nvested in the Internet and all of the new communication\ntechnologies. Earlier this year, the Human Rights\nCouncil decided that the rights that apply off line apply\nonline as well, and called on all States to promote\nand facilitate access to the Internet. That landmark\nresolution (Human Rights Council resolution 20/8) was\nunanimously adopted in Geneva, and I hope that it has\nbeen duly noted here in New York as well. The fight for\nfreedom on the Internet is the new front line in the fight\nfor freedom in the world.\nIn this world of connected nations, we share a planet\nwith common development challenges. The world\u2019s\npoor \u2014 indeed, all of us \u2014 need development that is\ninclusive, equitable and sustainable. The international\ncommunity has met three of the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals well ahead of time, but we are\nlagging significantly behind in others. And while we\naccelerate efforts to reduce child mortality and improve\nmaternal health, we have started to look beyond the\nimmediate future. Sweden welcomes the high-level\npanel on the post-2015 development agenda and looks\nforward to contributing to its recommendations.\nIn Rio, world leaders recently launched a process\nfor working towards sustainable development goals.\nIt is up to all of us to take that agenda forward: to\ninvolve scientists and business, to explore the potential\nof information and communications technology and\ninnovation, to pursue all three dimensions of sustainable\ndevelopment and to ensure that democracy and human\nrights are part of the equation. And as an active partner\nand a major donor, Sweden will certainly do its part.\nIn this world of connected nations, geography is\nsometimes of little consequence. Distances might at\ntimes seem enormous. But the melting Arctic ice cap\nin the North can pose an existential threat to small\nisland States in the South. The Arctic today is warming\ntwice as fast as the global average. And right now as\nwe gather here, the Arctic Sea ice cover has receded\nso much that it has reached a new historical minimum.\nThere is less ice this autumn in the Arctic than ever\nbefore in recorded history.\nThe impact of climate change is global. The world\nis not on track for keeping the increase in global\naverage temperatures to below two degrees Celsius.\nWe therefore urgently need progress in the negotiations\nunder the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and effective implementation of the\nglobally agreed outcomes. Sweden calls on everyone in\nthis Hall to do their utmost to contribute to ensuring\nthat that occurs, and developed nations should take the\nlead.\nThere are severe challenges, but there are also great\nopportunities. Technology brings new possibilities \u2014 to\nreduce emissions, increase growth, and move towards\na truly sustainable future. As the current Chair of the\nArctic Council \u2014 comprising the eight nations whose\nlandmass extends beyond the Arctic Circle \u2014 Sweden\nwill make its contribution. Together, we will set an\nexample of positive cooperation in an area drawing\nrapidly increasing global attention and where, not long\nago, many were predicting competition and conflict.\nWe live in a new era. What happens in the Levant,\nthe Arctic or elsewhere has immediate implications\nfor us all. In order to deal with the challenges of this\nera, the connected nations of this world need a strong\nUnited Nations \u2014 a United Nations to discuss the\nissues of today and to truly seize the opportunities for\ncollective action in order to shape a better tomorrow; a\nUnited Nations where we convene in these days to say\nthat, while ridiculing what by others is held sacred is\nmean and offensive, it can never be used as an excuse\nfor violence, destruction and death.\nBut the United Nations \u2014 our United\nNations \u2014 needs to step up to the challenge. The\nSecurity Council must assume its responsibilities, in\nSyria and elsewhere. Member States must empower the\nUnited Nations to become better at conflict prevention\nand peacebuilding, and ensure that it can deliver\ndevelopment results effectively and as one.\nIt is up to us, the Member States, to meet our\ninternational human rights obligations, not just in order\nto protect the individual human being, but because\nrespect for human rights is also, as we have bitterly\nlearned throughout history, critical to peace and\nsecurity.\nIn these times of accelerating global change, with its\ngreat risks and even greater opportunities, Sweden will\nremain a steadfast member of this global Organization\nand, together with our partners in the European Union,\nwe will continue to promote an effective multilateral\nsystem with the United Nations at its core."

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt is an honour to join this\neminent gathering. Allow me to extend Jordan\u2019s sincere\ncongratulations to His Excellency Mr. Vuk Jeremi\u0107. I\nwould like to assure him of Jordan\u2019s full cooperation.\nMay I also express to the Secretary-General Jordan\u2019s\nappreciation for his untiring efforts. I welcome his voice\nand the voices of world leaders of many religions who\nstand with billions of Muslims worldwide in rejecting\nprovocations meant to divide those of different faiths.\nIslam teaches us to honour all human beings,\npromote tolerance and show mercy. As a Hashemite and\na descendant of the Prophet Muhammad \u2014 peace and\nblessings upon him \u2014 I condemn all acts that vilify the\nname of the Prophet or falsely use his name or the name\nof Islam \u2014 or any other religion, for that matter \u2014 to\njustify violence and evil acts such as we have recently witnessed. There are no sidelines on this issue. All\nof us of every faith everywhere must be proactive in\npromoting understanding and a much stronger global\ndialogue.\n\u201cTo unite our strength\u201d \u2014 these four words in the\nUnited Nations Charter are not just an old dream, they\nare a modern urgency. The United Nations and the\nGeneral Assembly \u2014 empowered and strong \u2014 are\nneeded today as never before.\nIn my region, we have important tasks ahead.\nWe must provide new and better opportunities for\nour people, especially our youth, to avert the dangers\nof regional instability and conflict and to fulfil the\nuniversal desire \u2014 the basic human right \u2014 to live in\nfreedom, dignity, justice and peace. The international\ncommunity has a crucial interest in supporting countries\nthat are taking risks for peace and reform.\nIn Jordan we have charted our course guided by our\nheritage, by our mutual respect and by moderation. Our\nArab Spring journey is one of opportunity to accelerate\nhome-grown reforms and achieve national goals. Last\nyear I stood before the Assembly and spoke about the\nreforms that were on the horizon (see A/66/PV.11).\nSince then, new and comprehensive constitutional\namendments, as well as new laws, have created a\nmatrix of institutions and principles to support our path\nof reform and democratization. And with the new year,\nwe will have our new Parliament, and our Jordanian\nSummer will begin.\nI would like to address the tragic situation in Syria.\nViolence must end immediately, and a transition\nmust begin now. There is no alternative to a political\nsolution that will end the bloodshed, restore security\nand stability and preserve the territorial integrity of\nSyria and the dignity and unity of its people.\nThe United Nations has an important part to play\nin helping people commit to a political solution. Jordan\nwill do all in its power to support the newly appointed\nJoint Special Representative of the United Nations\nand the League of Arab States for Syria, Mr. Lakhdar\nBrahimi.\nThe peoples of Jordan and Syria have long and\ndeep ties. Since the current crisis erupted, over 200,000\nSyrians have sought refuge in Jordan, putting heavy\npressure on our limited resources and our economy.\nYet we, as Jordanians, have opened our arms, as we\nhave many times in the past for others in need. As we continue to shoulder that responsibility, international\nsupport is essential. We are very grateful for the\ngenerous response of Governments, international\nbodies and dedicated United Nations agencies. The\nsomber reality is, however, that more will be needed, as\nthe camps grow more crowded with vulnerable families\nand the cold desert winter approaches. I call upon the\ncountries of the United Nations to work together to\nprevent a humanitarian disaster.\nWhile we deal with those challenges, we must never\nlose our focus on the crisis at the heart of the region. For\nalmost 65 years, the Palestinian people have been the\nexception to the United Nations promise. We pledge the\nshelter of international law and human rights, except\nnot yet; the dignity of living in freedom and security,\nexcept not yet; the right to self-determination, except\nnot yet. It is time to say, \u201cEnough!\u201d\nAs the Arab Spring demanded dignity for all, so it\ndemanded the end of exceptionalism. No single issue\ncauses greater anger than to tell an entire people that\nwhen it comes to global justice they do not count.\nThe Arab Summer cannot bear its full fruit until the\nPalestinian-Israeli conflict ends, and ends with a just\npeace and a Palestinian State living side by side with a\nsecure Israel at peace with the entire region.\nEarlier this year, in Amman, we succeeded in\ngetting both sides back to the table for exploratory talks.\nThen positive traction stopped again. Illegal settlementbuilding\nand unilateral actions have continued,\nconstituting direct threats to a negotiated peace. We\nare extremely concerned by threats to Jerusalem and\nthe sanctity of its Muslim and Christian holy sites. The\nAl-Aqsa Mosque compound of Al-Haram Al-Sharif\nin East Jerusalem is under Hashemite custodianship,\na special role recognized by the 1994 Jordan-Israel\nTreaty of Peace and protected as occupied territory by\ninternational law. It is Islam\u2019s third holiest site and its\nimportance to 1.7 billion Muslims, one quarter of the\nworld\u2019s population, is similar to the importance of the\nKa\u2019ba itself.\nLet me be absolutely clear, any invasion or division\nof the site of Al-Masjid Al-Aqsa would be viewed not\nonly as a breach of Israel\u2019s obligations but as a profound\nreligious transgression. The international community\nmust send a clear message that such a transgression,\nor any attempt to erase the Arab, Muslim or Christian\nidentity of Jerusalem, will not be tolerated. What is\nneeded now is the full weight of our nations, united. Neither the parties nor the world can afford continued\nhostility and insecurity. There may be a rare window\nof opportunity later this year, after the United States\nelections, to achieve what both sides so urgently need,\nnamely, two States at peace, Palestine and Israel, both\nsecure, both free to look forward on the basis of a just,\ncomprehensive and final settlement. That has always\nbeen and will remain a foremost priority for Jordan.\nLet me say now, as I have said before, that the\nArab world seeks peace. We mean by that real peace:\ndiplomatic relations, economic relations, trade and\ninvestment. We mean by that a new normality, in\npeace, where people are safe in their homes, where\ncommunities are able to build and where cooperation\nhelps the entire region prosper. All this has been on\noffer for over 10 years, since 2002, under the Arab\nPeace Initiative, through which 57 Arab and Muslim\ncountries reached out collectively to Israel. It is time for\nIsrael to turn around, look to the future we must share\nand make a just and lasting peace with the Palestinians.\nAlmost 70 years ago, countries from every continent\nchose to come together in hopes of a world united in\npeace and respectful of all humankind. After a bitter,\ndestructive global war, the United Nations was the right\nstep, the brave step. Today, almost three generations\nlater, we have learned that it is not enough to make the\nright choices. We must also pursue effective action. Not\nonly as nations but as nations united, we must take the\nright steps, the brave steps, now."

        "file_name": "ARG_67_2012.txt",
        "file_text": "\ufeffI would\nlike to begin my statement by confirming my personal\nposition and that of the Argentine Republic and the\nArgentine people with regard to our emphatic rejection\nand repudiation of the savage assassination of United\nStates Ambassador Christopher Stevens in the city of\nBenghazi, Libya. That ugly act of terrorism warrants\nthat we reflect upon certain interpretations of events\nthat took place in various Arab countries and were for\nmany Western leaders interpreted as or called the Arab\nSpring. But, in reality, from our point of view \u2014 and\nI say this humbly and with all respect \u2014 it reflected\nother situations that were not correctly perceived or\nunderstood by the main leaders in the West.\nIt is no accident that the death of Chris Stevens\noccurred in Benghazi, where the principal focus of\nresistance against Muammar Al-Qadhafi\u2019s regime\noriginated, and where those of us with an understanding\nof international politics clearly know that the main\nIslamic fundamentalists were located \u2014 not just\nopponents of Muammar Al-Qadhafi\u2019s regime, but those opposed to the very idea of peaceful coexistence\nbetween men and women of different races, religions,\nbeliefs or faiths.\nI say that because it is necessary to have a clear\nunderstanding of our problems and of the situations\nin the world, particularly in the Middle East. It is\nimportant to understand the need for different policies\ngeared to building true and lasting peace \u2014 a peace that\nmust always imply choosing the language of diplomacy\nbefore choosing the language of weapons. If one reviews\nrecent history, one can see that important figures or\npolitical factions that appear to be allied with the West\nfrequently end up becoming sworn enemies of Western\nvalues, perhaps as a result of poor interpretations or\npolicies ill suited to what was happening in the Middle\nEast and around the world.\nThe need to recognize the Palestinian State and\nthe need to recognize that Israel must live within\nlegally recognized borders in accordance with the 1967\nborders is the crux of the problem in the Middle East.\nThe Argentine Republic \u2014 and I believe we reflect the\ninterests of our region \u2014 maintains that it is necessary\nto have a response to an issue that has been calling\nfor a solution for decades. Yet, owing to different\ncircumstances, to Governments and to interests in\nthe West, which has an enormous responsibility of\nleadership in the issue, nothing constructive has been\nachieved.\nFor Chris Stevens, and for his family, there will\nbe no Arab Spring, but rather a terrible and eternal\nwinter. That is why it is absolutely necessary that we\nin the West rethink our strategies and policies with\nrespect to the Middle East. Otherwise, we run the risk\nof ending up embarking upon erroneous strategies that\nundermine our values and deepen the crisis. What will\nhappen is what happened in Benghazi, and we shall\nhave to mourn the death of a diplomat, regardless of his\nnationality. In this case, it was an American, something\nthat had not happened for a very long time.\nA similar situation could be described with respect\nto the other great crisis, which was apparently economic\nin nature and which is shaking the world. In 2008, when\nwe came to the General Assembly, Lehman Brothers\ncollapsed, causing a crisis that seemed triggered by\npoor people who could not pay off the mortgages on\ntheir homes \u2014 the famous sub-prime loans crisis \u2014 but\nit has ended up today as something greater than a crisis\nof the poor who cannot pay off their mortgages.\n\nIt has spread well beyond that issue. It has been\ndiscovered that it was precisely those financial\nadministrators of capital who were behind all this.\nActually, it was the wealthiest sectors of society who\ncreated this global crisis.\nIn Europe the eurozone crisis is basically a crisis\nof sovereign debt for countries that owe more than\ntheir gross domestic product (GDP). Also, families\nhave taken on more debt than they can pay off in the\nnext 20 or 30 years. At this very moment in Spain\nthere is repression against indignant citizens who are\ndemonstrating against the belt-tightening programme\nbeing imposed on their country. They are protesting\nthe same austerity programme that has been applied for\ndecades now and that has not borne any fruit.\nWhen we in Argentina discuss the problem we\ntalk about it with deep-seated knowledge of the\ntype of neoliberal policies that were the result of the\nWashington consensus, which was launched following\nthe problems in the 1990s and ended up exploding as a\ndefault on the most significant sovereign debt known\nin history. Argentina owed 160 per cent of its GDP, the\nresult of debt policies that in turn had resulted from the\nindustrialization and ongoing imposed adjustment and\nconsumption policies. Those policies were ferociously\nand methodically imposed on countries, just as we are\nseeing now with Spain, Greece and Portugal, with the\nresulting danger to the eurozone.\nEndangering the eurozone involves more than just\nthe undermining of an economic region. It is actually\nendangering the very stability of the world financial\nsystem. We should recall that some 65 per cent of\ninternational reserves deposited in central banks\naround the world are in United States dollars, and some\n24 per cent are in euros.\nIt is necessary to rethink all of this. We need to\nrethink the trade war that has exploded between\nvarious countries. Some countries have denounced it\nas protectionism. Basically, participants in such trade\nwars assert that such policies are needed to defend their\nsocieties, their workers, their labour markets and their\nbusinesses against developed countries\u2019 economies,\nwhich actually were the root cause of the crisis we are\nall experiencing today. The developed countries are\ntrying to push their problems off on to others. I keep\nasking, if one of our countries had had a deficit in its\ncurrent account, such as the United States is running\nright now, that country would no doubt have been\ncensored, punished and criticized. Of course, because\ndollars are the reserve currency \u2014 some 85 per cent\nof world transactions are in dollars \u2014 and the United\nStates has been considered the country that issues the\nmoney used as reserve currency par excellence, it ends\nup being outside of the whole system. It is not criticized\nand is not targeted by the International Monetary Fund\n(IMF). Yet the IMF continues to impose adjustment\npolicies. Even yesterday, there were threats issued to\ncountries like the Argentine Republic.\nThe IMF has tried to allude to sovereign debts\nas though the whole thing were just a soccer game. If\nArgentina were unable to accomplish certain things,\nthe country was going to be given a red card, just as in\nsoccer. I just want to say to the head of that organization\nthat this is not a soccer game. First, this is the most\nserious political and economic crisis in memory since\nthe 1930s. Secondly, my country is not a player in a\nsoccer game; it is a sovereign nation, which makes its\ndecisions on a sovereign basis. It will not be subject\nto pressures brought to bear from the outside nor any\nthreats of red cards. Finally, continuing with this\nanalogy between soccer and the economy, the President\nof the International Federation of Association Football\n(FIFA) does a much more satisfactory job than the head\nof the IMF.\nWith regard to organization and responsibility,\nFIFA organizes world matches every four years. Next\ntime, they will be in Brazil, and no doubt they will be a\nsuccess. The International Monetary Fund is in charge\nof organizing economies and has been doing so since\nthe 1980s, and yet it has been unable to carry out its\ntask effectively. However, it seems that it is countries\nthat should be criticizing themselves, whereas I do not\nhear any self-criticism from the IMF.\nWith regard to the statistics for Spain, what were\nthe statistics for Greece or Portugal, Ireland or Italy?\nWhat were the figures that allowed them to go more\ninto debt without any kind of control or oversight? Why\nare some countries being controlled and not others?\nThat is a question that we have to ask, and that we are\nasking from this rostrum. Since 2003, we have been\nsaying this.\nWhen President N\u00e9stor Kirchner came here for the\nfirst time he was representing an Argentina that had\nbeen devastated by the crisis, with poverty at levels\nthat we had never seen before: 25 per cent of Argentine\npeople had no work. People were losing their savings in dollars, roubles, pesos, pounds, whatever; they simply\nhad nothing left. They came to the United Nations\nand said that we needed an opportunity to grow. For a\ncountry to pay off its debt, it needs to be able to grow.\nThe dead do not pay off their debts. That is what the\nArgentine President said, and he was not mistaken.\nIn 2003, based on the policies he was able to put into\nplace, and without access to capital markets, Argentina\nwas able to restructure a significant part of its foreign\ndebt. We have been rigorously making every single\npayment since 2005. We will continue making those\npayments because we believe in policies that promote\nnational production.\nWe are working with the most vulnerable sectors\nof society and promoting social programmes. We\nhave dedicated more than 1 per cent of our GDP to\nthose programmes. We have put social policies and\nprogrammes in place, and they are the most notable\nin Latin America. They have allowed us to promote\ngrowth, which undoubtedly is the most significant seen\nin the last 200 years of the history of the Argentine\nRepublic.\nWe are not coming here to preach to anyone or to\nteach lessons. We do not think that we are teachers. We\njust want to tell the Assembly about the experience of\none country that went through a situation quite similar\nto that now being experienced by other countries in\nthe developed world. What we want to contribute is\nour empirical experience, not theoretical experiences.\nThere are still decisions that need to be taken, but that\nhave not been taken because many continue to follow\nthe practices of those who control the capital markets.\nThey hit one country and then another. One day,\nthe stock market goes up 20 per cent, skyrockets, and\nthen it plummets the following day. We may not be\neconomists, but we are not stupid either. We are talking\nabout incredible transfers of money, and those who end\nup being harmed are the same millions of people who\nlose their jobs and lose their hope. What I hope to see\nis that they do not lose patience. Usually, when people\nlose patience, that is when they hit the wall. When\npeople cannot find a job and do not have a State that is\nprotecting them, it becomes a political and institutional\ncrisis. That is what happened to us in 2001 in Argentina.\nI also believe that it is important to understand that\nwe have a new world before us now. This new world\nrequires more creative leadership.\nIt requires taking the risk of applying new ideas\nand new concepts. Trying to solve the current problems\nof the world with the same medicines that caused them\nis absolutely absurd. That has to be stated clearly.\nThen there is the matter of the current accounts\ndeficit, which is transferred from the United States to\nemerging countries, so that our currencies are devalued\nand we have to make immense efforts to build up our\nreserves. We also have to take measures to prevent the\ncentral countries from transferring cheap merchandise\nto us that undermines our economies \u2014 the economies\nof the emerging countries that, it bears saying, propped\nup the growth of the global economy during the past\ndecade.\nToday, as emerging countries, we are being\ncondemned as protectionist by the very countries that\nsurvived by protecting themselves through agricultural\nsubsidies and all sorts of special breaks at the expense\nof our economies and, above all, of millions of our\npeople who only now are being incorporated into the\nlabour force.\nIt is crucial for developed countries to understand\nthe contribution that emerging countries can make to\nthe international economic recovery with the millions\nof dollars we still owe, on top of our costs for social\nbenefits and production. Besides, we have paid down\nour debt to levels never seen before. Argentina, whose\nforeign debt represented 160 per cent of its gross\nnational product, today owes only 14 per cent of its gross\nnational product abroad; the remainder of its borrowing\nis intrasectoral public debt. We are at the lowest level\never of foreign debt and debt held by foreign sources.\nObviously, for some we are a bad example. Why?\nBecause when we restructured our debt \u2014 and I am\nnot proposing restructurization as a solution \u2014 we\nheld that under capitalism anyone who risked investing\ndollars in a country like Argentina, with interest rates\nin the 1990\u2019s between 15 and 16 per cent to ensure\nconvertibility, when the rate in rest of the world was\na mere two per cent, had to know that there was a\nsubstantial risk that that person, that bank or that\ninstitution would not repay the debt.\nOur thesis was that if they had taken the risk, they\nshould share it. We therefore proposed a restructuring\nwhereby both parties would share. The fact is that\nArgentina paid its stockholders more than Enron did.\nEnron paid, I believe, $1 per $100 share; Argentina paid\n$25 to $30 on $100. In reality, we were more generous and responsible than Enron was, not just towards the\nrest of the world but to the citizens of the United States.\nThat may of course annoy certain multilateral credit\ninstitutions, especially because, during the 1990\u2019s,\nArgentina was held up as an example of the way things\nshould be done, while in 2001 we were left to our own\ndevices and told to resolve things by ourselves. I believe\nthat is why some would censure us or fine us, so that\nour bad example does not spread, but if we think of the\nworld as a totality, we will understand that that is not an\neconomic problem, but a political one. Without leaders\nwho can point to a clear, specific path for overcoming\na world economic crisis of this magnitude, we are no\nlonger facing a problem of economics or economists;\nwe are facing a problem of politics for which there are\nneither solutions nor responses nor new models.\nWe know that some multilateral agencies are\nangry with Argentina, but we tell them there is no\npoint being angry with us. The important thing is to\nanalyse the mistakes that were made in both economics\nand politics and what was done wrong so that we can\ncorrect them, move forward and overcome this crisis,\nbecause if allowed to continue it will trigger not just\nsevere economic problems but severe political and\ninstitutional ones. Having been a political activist at\na young age and having experienced periods in my\ncountry when Western values were not respected, when\npeople were raped, tortured and disappeared \u2014 because\ndemocracy had disappeared \u2014 what I am most afraid of\nis that if there continues to be no solution to the present\ncrisis, many millions of people in the West will cease to\nbelieve that a democratic system can provide solutions.\nIf we examine human history, we can clearly see\nthat the most terrible totalitarian periods were preceded\nby severe economic crises that gave people no way out,\ndeprived them of hope and filled their ears with siren\nsongs that promised things we all know could never be\ndelivered.\nI wanted to speak emphatically about how to tackle\nthe problem, about how to conceive of it, so that the\nsituation can be brought back into line instead of\nlanguishing as it has since 2008. Unfortunately, we\nhave begun to see that the crisis in the developed world\nis starting to spread into emerging countries, which\nhave been the engine of global growth.\nI believe those things are connected. The lack of a\ncorrect interpretation, of an adequate classification, so\nthat political and economic events get jumbled together, gives rise to fallacies \u2014 for example, that the people in\ncertain political movements want to live like Westerners\nor that certain orthodox economic adjustments might\nlead to some way out or some solution \u2014 all false, of\ncourse.\nI would now like to address two topics that might\nbe called bilateral in nature. One, in the form of this\nlittle booklet in English and Spanish, was delivered to\neach of the Missions represented here and deals with the\nquestion of the colonial status of the Malvinas. Last June,\nI appeared before the Committee on Decolonization\nhere in New York to present our request for compliance\nwith resolution 2065 (XX), which urged both\ncountries \u2014 the United Kingdom and Argentina \u2014 to\nundertake a dialogue on the issue of the Malvinas. Next\nJanuary, it will have been 180 years since the United\nKingdom illegally usurped our Malvinas islands. Not\nonly has that country not ceased, it has not listened to\nor heeded any of the many allegations and resolutions\nof the United Nations, the resolutions of the Committee\non Decolonization, and the many resolutions of various\norganizations such as the Organization of American\nStates and other multilateral organizations such as the\nRio Group, which have asked Great Britain to sit down\nto a dialogue with Argentina. We are not asking them\nto say that we are right. That would not be dialogue; it\nwould be to impose a point of view. We are simply asking\nthem to sit down with us to comply with the United\nNations resolution and to undertake a dialogue on the\nsovereignty of the Malvinas, as well as to demilitarize\nthe South Atlantic so that it becomes a region of peace\nin South America, without regard to ethnic, religious or\nany other differences that could lead to clashes between\nus.\nThat is why we once again reiterate our appeal.\nThere is a clear double standard here: the permanent\nmembers of the Security Council have the right to\nviolate any and every requirement of the United Nations,\nwhile everyone else has to accept without demur any\nand every Council resolution. That is not building\nmultilateralism. It contributes nothing whatever to the\npeacebuilding that we all demand and need, and it leads\nto a growing feeling of injustice and inequality between\nnations, which significantly affects the possibility of a\nmore just world, of living in a world without violence.\nThat is why we say once again: this is not a\nbilateral issue between us and the United Kingdom. It\nhas become a global issue \u2014 doing away with the last\nvestiges of colonialism, which became one of the great contributions of the United Nations when it created\nthe Decolonization Committee, in 1961. Entering the\ntwenty-first century without colonies is a matter of\nhuman rights, rights that in my country we certainly\ndefend very strongly; our support for them is an\nexample to the world.\nFinally \u2014 and this relates to the early part of my\nspeech, when I repudiated and condemned the killing\nof Ambassador Christopher Stevens in Libya \u2014 I would\nlike to mention something that for us, the Argentine\npeople, continues to be an open wound, since in\nits case justice has still not been served. That is the\nbombings of the Asociaci\u00f3n Mutual Israelita Argentina\n(AMIA) in 1994 and of the Israeli Embassy in 1992,\nacts that should be utterly deplored and condemned.\nFormer President Kirchner and I both asked the Islamic\nRepublic of Iran, which stands accused by Argentina\u2019s\njudiciary of participation in that crime, for its\ncollaboration and cooperation. In 2010 and 2011, given\nthe lack of response to that request, I suggested, as an\nalternative, that if the Islamic Republic of Iran did not\ntrust the fairness and independence of the Argentine\njudiciary, the solution could be based on a case that the\nAssembly will recall, the Libyan terrorist attack on a\nBritish airplane, in which a trial was eventually held in\na third-party country to arrive at reparations \u2014 if one\ncan talk of reparations in the case of death \u2014 for some\nof the damages. Thus both countries would agree on a\nthird country where a trial would guarantee justice for\nboth sides. In the aftermath of that terrible event, what\nwas most important was the quest for truth.\nI began my statement by talking about international\nterrorism, and I am ending it on the same subject. I am\nnot talking about an act committed in a single African\ncountry against a single member of the diplomat corps;\nI am talking about what was done in my country, on my\nterritory, to my brother Argentines, in clear violation of\nterritorial sovereignty. Last Wednesday, 19 September,\nwe received a request from the Islamic Republic of Iran\nfor a bilateral meeting at which, as we understood it,\nthere would be a dialogue on this matter. My country,\nwhich has continued to ask for a dialogue and which\npromotes dialogue as a universal \u2014 and, in the case\nof the Malvinas, a specific \u2014 instrument, decided\nto instruct our Minister for Foreign Affairs to hold a\nbilateral meeting between the two ministries, here at the\nUnited Nations, as requested by the Islamic Republic of\nIran.\n\nI should say here that I am expecting results\nfrom that meeting, based on the fact that the Islamic\nRepublic of Iran showed that it wanted to cooperate\nand collaborate on the matter of the attack. If they do\nnot want to conduct the case in Argentina or in a third\ncountry, we hope that they will come forward with\nother proposals as to how we can address this deep-\nseated conflict, dating back to 1994. I would like to\nremind the Assembly that when President Kirchner had\njust become President, in 2003, nine years had elapsed\nsince the attack, without results. But I would also like\nto say that we hope this meeting will yield specific,\nconcrete results if the Islamic Republic of Iran has a\nproposal for making headway. It might not necessarily\nbe in the direction proposed by Argentina, but I would\nin any case, as a member of a representative and federal\nrepublican country, submit it for consideration by the\nrepresentative parliamentary bodies of my country. A\nproposal made by the Islamic Republic of Iran is too\nimportant to be resolved through executive power\nalone, quite apart from the fact that our Constitution\nrequires that the legislature and judiciary be involved\nin such an issue.\nThis is not a matter of casual or standard foreign\nrelations with another country. It concerns an event\nthat has marked the Argentine people and is enshrined\nin the history of international terrorism. The essential\nfact is that the families of the victims, to whom I feel\nvery committed, need answers. For six years I sat on\nthe bicameral commission of inquiry into both the\nEmbassy and the AMIA attacks, and I was always\ncritical of how the investigation was conducted. That is\nwhy I believe I have the authority to address the families\nof the victims \u2014 because they are the ones who truly\nneed answers; they need to understand what happened\nand who is responsible \u2014 and to assure them that this\nPresident will not take any decisions on any proposals\nput forward without first and foremost consulting them\nand the parliamentary representatives of my country.\nThey all have an obligation to voice an opinion publicly\non a matter of this importance.\nLastly, I would like to say to every member of the\nAssembly that in 2013 and 2014 Argentina will have\nthe great honour and responsibility of occupying a\nseat \u2014 a non-permanent seat, obviously \u2014 on the\nSecurity Council. I would like to make it clear that\nbeyond the fact of our taking a seat at that table, each\nand every country with serious aspirations to peace\nas a universal value will be represented by us in that seat. That is not a disingenuous or informal wish. It\nis a firm declaration that peace must go hand in hand\nwith truth, justice and equality. Peace is impossible in a\nworld where countries are not all treated equally. Peace\nis impossible in a world where people are growing\npoorer and becoming increasingly excluded. Peace is\nimpossible in a world where people do not tell the truth\nor state how things really are.\nWe believe that in peacebuilding the largest\nand leading nations of the world bear the greater\nresponsibility. Just as in a country\u2019s political system\nthe President bears the greatest responsibility and the\nchain continues down from there, the same is true in\nthe wider world.\nWe cannot, beyond the call for equality, turn a\nblind eye to hegemonies or to the importance of certain\ncountries in not only resolving conflicts but sometimes\nalso in triggering them.\nThe Argentine Republic will, from its seat, do\neverything in its power to promote the values that it\nhas always defended: peace and the unconditional\npromotion of human rights in all countries, whether we\nare on good terms with them or not. Human rights are\nuniversal values that should be respected by all types of\nGovernments throughout the world. It is the obligation\nof the Assembly and the Security Council to act on the\nbasis of a single standard so as to build the values of\npeace, human rights, equality and truth. That is the\nonly way to bring about a world that is more fair and\nequitable than the one of today."

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt is indeed a great privilege\nfor me to be able to address the General Assembly.\nLet me begin by congratulating Mr. Vuk Jeremi\u0107 on\nhis election to the office of President of the General\nAssembly at its sixty-seventh session. I assure him of\nour constructive support in his work over the coming\nyear.\nWe are assembled in New York at a time when we\nface multiple global challenges that transcend national\nboundaries. Developing countries are still to recover\nfrom the downturn in the global economy. Their quest\nfor poverty eradication and sustainable development\nremains an uphill task. Food and energy security as well\nas health and education for their populations remain\ndaunting challenges. The West Asia-North Africa\nregion is seeing unprecedented sociopolitical upheaval.\nThe question of Palestine remains unresolved. Threats\nemanating from terrorism, maritime piracy, drug\ntrafficking and the proliferation of weapons of mass\ndestruction continue to multiply. Those challenges\ndemand that we work for solutions in a concerted and\ncoordinated manner. That is the only path to success.\nAt the United Nations Conference on Sustainable\nDevelopment (Rio+20), the international community\nrenewed its commitment to sustainable development\nand recognized poverty eradication as the greatest\nglobal challenge. To act on that, it unequivocally\nreaffirmed the sanctity of the Rio principles. India\nremains committed to addressing climate change\nthrough a comprehensive, equitable and balanced\noutcome based on the principles of equity and common\nbut differentiated responsibilities. In less than two\nweeks, in Hyderabad, we will host the eleventh meeting\nof the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on\nBiological Diversity. We seek the support of parties to\nfashion an outcome that harmonizes strong biodiversity\naction with our basic development objectives.\nThe process to develop a set of sustainable\ndevelopment goals has begun. The Millennium\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) must be integrated in the\nnew framework so that the unmet development priorities\ncontinue to be the main focus. In the interim, with still\nthree years to go to the MDG target date of 2015, it\nis imperative to ensure that all efforts to achieve the\nMDGs are made. In the global discourse on the post-\n2015 development agenda, the focus ought to be on the\nword \u201cdevelopment\u201d. It ought to be firmly entrenched\nin the understandings and principles of Rio+20 and be\nanchored in the intergovernmental process at the United Nations. Priority must be given to the challenges of\npoverty, unemployment, food and energy, water, health,\nenvironmental sustainability, unsustainable lifestyles\nand, above all, economic growth.\nEnsuring gender equality and women\u2019s\nempowerment is essential to the pursuit of building\ninclusive societies. It is also an imperative for building\nstrong and resilient economies. We are happy to support\nthe efforts of the United Nations. We also need to pay\nparticular attention to upgrading the skills of young\npeople and to ensuring employment opportunities for\nthem. Children and youth are our future. We need to\ninvest in them to reap the demographic dividend to\nsecure our future.\nIndia remains firmly committed to scaling up\nour development partnership with Africa, including\nthrough the framework of the India-Africa Forum\nSummit. Similarly, we will continue to build on our\ncommitments for enhanced cooperation with least\ndeveloped countries, landlocked developing countries\nand small island developing States within the framework\nof South-South cooperation.\nIndia is a multireligious, multi-ethnic and\nmultilingual society. Our civilizational ethos has been\nunderpinned by peaceful coexistence and tolerance,\nvalues that the founder of the nation, Mahatma Gandhi,\nplaced at the core of India\u2019s national life. Those\nprinciples are enshrined in our Constitution, which\nprovides the foundation for our secular, democratic and\ninclusive society.\nMutual respect for deeply held religious sentiments\nis the bedrock of tolerance and coexistence. Unfortunate\nrecent events have highlighted the need for enhanced\ndialogue among faiths and civilizations. Violence\ncannot lead to greater understanding. It is necessary\nto uphold norms of peaceful international discourse.\nIn particular, the safety and security of diplomatic\npersonnel should be fully respected.\nTerrorism remains one of the most potent threats\nto international peace and security. The international\ncommunity must adopt a zero-tolerance approach to\nterrorism and must focus on efforts to dismantle the\ninfrastructure of terrorism, including its invidious\nnetwork of epicentres, training facilities and financing.\nIt is time we demonstrated the necessary political will to\nagree on a comprehensive convention on international\nterrorism so as to strengthen the normative framework against the increasingly sophisticated and globalized\nterrorist challenge.\nIndia continues to be gravely concerned by the\nmenace of piracy and armed robbery at sea. Apart from\nthe major economic and commercial consequences of\nthat scourge, it has serious humanitarian implications\nfor the large number of seafarers held hostage by\npirates. The need of the hour is once again concerted\ninternational action under United Nations auspices,\nwith special attention to addressing the welfare of\nseafarers and their families.\nPeacekeeping and disarmament are among the\nunique pursuits of the United Nations, because\nthey embody the promise and innate potential of the\nOrganization to make the world a better place. India\nhas a proud history of participation in United Nations\npeacekeeping operations dating back to the 1950s,\nhaving taken part in as many as 43 peacekeeping\noperations. The challenge before the international\ncommunity today is to ensure that United Nations\npeacekeeping is adequately resourced and enabled to\nmeet the realities of today, including in post-conflict\nand peacebuilding contexts. In that regard, we are\nhopeful that progress will be made on all outstanding\nissues between the Sudan and South Sudan.\nIndia is committed to achieving a nuclear-\nweapon-free world. The principles of the Rajiv Gandhi\naction plan of 1988 for achieving nuclear disarmament\nin a time-bound, universal, non-discriminatory,\nphased and verifiable manner remain relevant, even\nafter more than two decades. A renewed consensus\non non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament must\nbe forged. Meaningful dialogue among all States\npossessing nuclear weapons is needed in order to build\ntrust and confidence and to reduce the salience of\nnuclear weapons in international affairs and security\ndoctrines.\nMeasures must be taken to reduce nuclear\nrisks, including the grave risk of terrorists gaining\naccess to weapons of mass destruction, and thus\nto strengthen nuclear security. The Conference on\nDisarmament \u2014 the international community\u2019s sole\nmultilateral disarmament negotiating forum \u2014 deserves\nour support in discharging its mandate of negotiating\ntreaties on issues on the international disarmament\nagenda.\nThe crisis in Syria continues unabated and is a matter\nof serious concern for us. Any further militarization of the crisis can have catastrophic consequences for\nthe region. We urge all parties to commit themselves\nto resolving the crisis without any further bloodshed\nthrough an inclusive, Syrian-led political process\nthat can meet the legitimate aspirations of the Syrian\npeople. We support the efforts of the United Nations\nand urge all sides to cooperate in good faith with the\nJoint Special Representative of the United Nations and\nthe League of Arab States, Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi.\nSupport for the Palestinian cause has been a\ncornerstone of India\u2019s foreign policy. We were privileged\nto receive President Mahmoud Abbas in India earlier this\nmonth. We support Palestine\u2019s aspirations for enhanced\nstatus at the United Nations. It is imperative that there be\nan early realization of a sovereign, independent, viable\nand united State of Palestine, with East Jerusalem as its\ncapital, living within secure and recognized borders,\nside by side and at peace with Israel, as endorsed in\nthe Arab Peace Initiative, the Quartet road map and the\nrelevant United Nations resolutions.\nIndia desires constructive and friendly relations\nwith all its neighbours. We have a vision of a peaceful,\nstable and prosperous region with enhanced cooperation\nand connectivity linking us with Central Asia, the\nGulf and South-East Asia. Within South Asia, we have\nsought to enhance bilateral relations individually with\neach of our neighbours and through the aegis of the\nSouth Asian Association for Regional Cooperation.\nWe have embarked on a resumed dialogue process\nwith Pakistan and advocate a step-by-step approach to\nnormalizing our bilateral relations.\nAn unwarranted reference has been made from\nthis rostrum to Jammu and Kashmir. Our principled\nposition on the issue has been consistent and is well\nknown. The people of Jammu and Kashmir have chosen\ntheir destiny and reaffirmed it repeatedly through\nIndia\u2019s well-established democratic processes. We wish\nto make it abundantly clear that Jammu and Kashmir is\nan integral part of India.\nIndia supports the Government and people of\nAfghanistan in their endeavour to build a peaceful,\nstable, democratic and prosperous country. We are\nready to partner with the Afghan people as they rebuild\ntheir country in accordance with their own priorities\nand national circumstances. The continuing existence\nbeyond Afghanistan\u2019s borders of safe havens and\nsanctuaries for terrorists is the major impediment to the\nrestoration of peace and security in Afghanistan. India is committed to creating an enabling environment in\nwhich the Afghan people can live in peace and security\nand decide their future for themselves, without outside\ninterference, coercion or intimidation.\nThe United Nations and the norms of international\nrelations that it has fostered remain the most\nefficacious means for converting today\u2019s challenges\ninto opportunities. However, we need to ensure that the\narchitecture of global governance reflects contemporary\nrealities. Sticking to structures designed at the end of\nthe Second World War only constrains multilateralism\nfrom delivering on its promises.\nThe most important and decisive step towards\nremedying that situation pertains to the Security\nCouncil, which must be expanded in both the permanent\nand non-permanent categories. A reformed Council\nmust include countries that are capable of bearing, and\nwilling to bear, the additional burdens relating to the\nmaintenance of international peace and security, as well\nas willilng to sustain global campaigns against new and\nemerging global threats. Let me also stress that we must\naddress, sooner rather than later, the incongruity of the\nlack of permanent membership for Africa.\nEqually, India will promote and lend its weight to\nenhancing the voice and participation of developing\ncountries in decision-making in global economic and\nfinancial institutions. The quota reform process of the\nInternational Monetary Fund must be accelerated with\naltered quotas that reflect contemporary economic\nweight.\nSpeaking in the Assembly on 14 October 1968,\nPrime Minister Indira Gandhi said,\n\u201cThe United Nations is the trustee of the\nworld\u2019s peace and represents the hopes of mankind.\nIts very existence gives a feeling of assurance that\nthe justice of true causes can be brought fearlessly\nbefore the world. This Assembly and the agencies\nof the United Nations should, in all that they do,\nsustain those hopes and promote the causes of\npeace\u201d.\nThose words remain true to this day.\nLet me conclude by assuring the President and the\nmembers of the Assembly that India will continue to\nabide by the purposes and principles of the Charter of\nthe United Nations and will strive to strengthen the\nUnited Nations."

        "file_text": "\ufeffOn behalf of my\ndelegation, I have the honour to congratulate His\nExcellency Mr. Vuk Jeremi\u0107, President of the General\nAssembly at its sixty-seventh session, on his election.\nI assure him of the full support and cooperation of\nthe delegation of Barbados during his presidency. Let\nme also convey my appreciation to his predecessor,\nMr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser, President of the\nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-sixth session, for his able\nleadership during that session.\nThe theme of this year\u2019s session, \u201cBringing about\nadjustment or settlement of international disputes\nor situations by peaceful means\u201d, underscores a core\nprinciple of the Charter of the United Nations. In\nthe current global environment, where challenges to\ninternational peace and security are widespread, it is\nimportant to reaffirm the validity of that principle as\none of the cornerstones on which the Organization is\nfounded.\nAs a small island developing State, Barbados\nis severely challenged by the global financial and\neconomic crisis and the recession that has resulted from\nit. Moreover, climate change and other environmental\nchallenges continue to pose significant threats to the\nachievements of Barbados since its independence,\nin November 1966. As a relatively young nation, our\nindependence was achieved by negotiation rather\nthan by war. We have enjoyed the benefits of stability\nfor more than 370 years of unbroken parliamentary\nGovernment. We are a peace-loving, democratic nation,\nextremely proud of our political and economic stability.\nOur relatively peaceful situation does not mean that\nwe are insulated or isolated from the prevailing global\ninstability that is very evident today. Our political\nand social stability have facilitated the achievement of a standard of living that has led Barbados to be\nconsistently ranked among the top 50 nations in the\nUnited Nations Development Programme\u2019s annual\nHuman Development Index.\n\nSuch a status has been achieved as a result of the\ncommitment of successive Governments to invest\nheavily in our people, particularly in education, health\nand other social safety nets. As a nation poor in natural\nresources, we have placed priority on our greatest\nresource, our people. A significant factor in our ability\nto overcome our constraints at the national level has\nbeen the tripartite social partnership comprising\nGovernment, workers\u2019 unions and employers. The\npartnership grew out of an economic crisis during\nthe early 1990s and continues to function effectively\ntoday. Those strategies have been reinforced by our\ncommitment to observing the rule of law. We are a\nprincipled country that firmly adheres to the core\nvalues enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations,\nincluding respect for the rule of the law, respect for\nhuman rights and the principle of sovereign equality.\nWe have been classified as a middle-income\ndeveloping country. In reality, we are a small island\ndeveloping State, characterized by high debt, high\nvulnerability to external shocks, and susceptibility to\nthe impacts of climate change and natural disasters.\nThe global economic and environmental situation has\nhad a disproportionate effect on our successful, but\nnevertheless vulnerable, economy. We bear the burden\nof rising food and fuel prices and a decline in foreign\ninvestment. Our efforts to address those threats have\nbeen severely undermined by international financial\nand cooperation mechanisms that fail to take account of\nthe vulnerability and capacity constraints that we face\nBarbados and similar vulnerable countries have been\ngraduated from grant and concessionary financing by\nmultilateral institutions, such as the Inter-American\nDevelopment Bank and the World Bank, without regard\nfor our unique situation. There is a clear need for greater\nequity, fairness and transparency in the process used to\ndetermine classifications and resource allocation. The\npersistent use of international classification and ratings\nsystems that are solely based on gross domestic product\nper capita and other narrow criteria must be expanded\nin scope to take into account meaningful variables such\nas vulnerability.\nIn this context, we welcome the assertion by the\nSecretary-General that the use of per capita income to classify countries as a means of guiding development\ncooperation disregards the nature and multidimensional\nnature of development. Barbados endorses the need\nfor the adoption of new indices and measures of\ndevelopment and applauds the ongoing work of bodies\nsuch as the Commonwealth and the United Nations\nStatistical Commission to develop new indices.\nThere is no greater threat to the survival, viability\nand indeed the security of my country and other small\nisland developing States (SIDS) than the threat posed\nby climate change. Science continues to warn that we\nare on the threshold of irreversible and potentially\ncatastrophic changes to the global climate system.\nGlobal emissions, the main cause of human-induced\nclimate change, are rising at their fastest rate in history,\neven as we bear witness to massive and accelerating ice\nloss from the ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica\nand a doubling of the rate of sea-level rise.\nWe are at a major turning point in the history\nof mankind. Are we willing to sacrifice the most\nvulnerable members of the international community?\nThat is the stark choice we face. But after the islands\ndisappear, who will be next? Inaction or inadequate\naction is inexcusable and morally indefensible, given\nthe level of certainty of the scientific evidence before us\nand the technological and financial tools at our disposal\nto effect the necessary change.\nWhile some useful progress was made at the\nDurban Climate Change Conference in December\nlast year, we are not close to finding a solution to\nthe problem. Barbados welcomes the decision taken\nin Durban to launch negotiations on a new legally\nbinding agreement that would take effect after 2020.\nHowever, for us a post-2020 agreement is meaningless\nif ambitious actions are not taken now to reduce\nglobal emissions and provide finance and technology\nto vulnerable developing countries. That is essential\nif we are to adapt to the ever-worsening impacts of\nclimate change. The upcoming United Nations Climate\nChange Conference in Doha must therefore prioritize\nthe pre-2020 actions necessary to ensure that the\nworld is on track in 2020 to meet the below 2 degree\nor 1.5 degree globally agreed goals. Such actions will\nrequire clarity from developed countries on the scale of\nclimate finance after the end of the fast-start finance\nperiod this year and a greater sense of urgency and\nambition in reducing global emissions before 2020 to\nminimize and avoid potentially catastrophic impacts of\nclimate change. Barbados and other small island developing States\nhave thrown their full support behind the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s Sustainable Energy for All initiative. In May\nthis year, the Government of Barbados, in collaboration\nwith the United Nations Development Programme,\nhosted a High-level Conference of the small island\ndeveloping States on achieving sustainable energy for\nall in SIDS, focused on challenges, opportunities and\ncommitments. At that meeting the Barbados Declaration\nwas adopted, outlining an ambitious and action-oriented\nagenda for achieving the goal of sustainable energy\nfor all in SIDS. As a concrete expression of our solid\ndetermination, some 22 SIDS agreed to inscribe, in\nan annex to the Declaration, a spectrum of ambitious\nvoluntary commitments to promote transformational\nactivities in the areas of renewable energy, energy\nefficiency, energy access and low-carbon development.\nI commend the Governments of Australia, Denmark,\nNew Zealand, Norway and the United Kingdom for\npledging, in the Barbados Declaration, to support SIDS\nin the implementation of our ambitious commitments.\nWe urge other development partners to join us on\nthis journey to ensure our energy independence. For\nus, sustainable development is not possible without\nsustainable energy.\nBarbados shares the view of the Secretary-General\nthat the United Nations Conference on Sustainable\nDevelopment (Rio +20) in Brazil this year reached a\nnumber of important milestones. In the words of the\nPrime Minister of Barbados,\n\u201cRio +20 will be remembered as that unique moment\nin time when we decided not to yield to our fears,\nbut rather to transform this present period of global\nuncertainty and volatility into a major opportunity\nto set new agendas, which can then be developed\nmore fully over the next few years\u201d.\nBarbados welcomes the agreement at Rio to\nconvene the third Global Conference on SIDS in 2014,\nsome two decades after the convening of the first SIDS\nConference in Barbados. The international community\ncan be assured that Barbados will do its part to ensure\nthe success of the Conference.\nDuring this session, the Assembly will consider\na draft resolution on the sustainable development of\nthe Caribbean Sea. Within the Caribbean we have\nrecognized that an integrated management approach\nthat involves all stakeholders provides us with the\nbest option for protecting the Caribbean Sea, our most effort in the Association of Caribbean States to create\nthe Caribbean Sea Commission. The Commission\nrepresents an oceans governance framework to promote\ncooperation towards effective management of the\nCaribbean Sea area. Barbados calls on the international\ncommunity to support this initiative, including\nthrough the designation by the General Assembly of\nthe Caribbean Sea as a special area in the context of\nsustainable development.\nCitizen security remains a major concern for\nBarbados. The Caribbean Community subregion\nhas become a major transit and destination point\nfor the trafficking of illicit drugs and firearms. As a\nconsequence, the incidence of crime and violence\ncontinues to escalate in the region and threatens\nto reverse many of our economic and social gains.\nDeveloping countries like ours have been compelled\nto divert financial and other resources earmarked for\nsocial and economic development for use in combating\nthis transnational scourge.\nThe heavy toll that that takes on the populations of\nour region brings into sharp focus the importance of\nthe United Nations Programme of Action to Prevent,\nCombat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms\nand Light Weapons in All Its Aspects. It also emphasizes\nthe need for a strong, legally binding arms trade treaty,\nwhich sets the highest possible international standards\nfor the transfer of conventional arms. We share the\nprofound disappointment of many Member States at\nthe failure of the Arms Trade Treaty Conference to\nreach agreement on a treaty text before its conclusion.\nBarbados cannot envisage an arms trade treaty that\ndoes not include small arms and light weapons, their\ncomponents and ammunition. Barbados expects that,\ndespite the setback, negotiations on the arms trade\ntreaty will resume during this session.\nAt the national level, we are appreciative of\ncontinuing cooperation with bilateral partners and\nregional and international bodies like the United Nations\nOffice on Drugs and Crime (UNODC). These include\nprogrammes aimed at preventing and reducing levels\nof violence and crime in our society. We look forward\nto the imminent reopening of the UNODC Office for\nthe Caribbean subregion, which my Government has\noffered once again to host.\nIt is well recognized that peace, security and\ndevelopment are inextricably linked and mutually reinforcing. Barbados is therefore heartened that in\ndealing with conflict prevention, the United Nations\nhas moved beyond traditional preventive diplomacy.\nWe support the pursuit of comprehensive strategies\nthat address deep-rooted structural causes of conflict,\npoverty eradication and development, human rights and\nthe rule of law, elections and the building of democratic\ninstitutions.\nAs a family of nations, we continue to strive for\nthe achievement of the Millennium Development\nGoals (MDGs). Success has been mixed, and made\nmore difficult by the current global financial crisis. The\ntarget implementation date of 2015 looms large, and\nwe share international concerns that the MDGs may\nbecome casualties of the current environment. As we\narticulate the post-2015 development agenda, we must\nnot lose sight of the urgency of fulfilling these goals.\nLet me reiterate my country\u2019s commitment to\nthe rule of law and our unwavering commitment to\nthe principles enshrined in the Charter of the United\nNations. I take this opportunity to speak out against\nthe continued unilateral imposition of the economic,\ncommercial and financial embargo against Cuba by\nthe United States. Barbados joins the overwhelming\nmajority of Member States in opposing this action,\nwhich has persisted for too long. This situation merits\nimmediate resolution if the unnecessary hardship and\nsuffering it has wrought on the Cuban people is to\nend. We therefore encourage constructive engagement\nbetween the two sides.\nStrong, functioning democracies are the foundation\non which international peace, security and prosperity\nare built. As a democratic State with a longstanding and\nfirm commitment to effective multilateralism, Barbados\nreiterates the crucial nexus between development,\npeace, security and human rights. The United Nations\nis the only global body with the unquestionable\nlegitimacy to lead a global response to the challenges\nfacing humanity. Recognizing this, Barbados remains\nsteadfast in its commitment to the United Nations and\nall it stands for."

We also take this opportunity to\nshare our concerns and to meet, interact and try to offer\nour best commitment to finding appropriate solutions\nto current and future challenges.\nA year has passed since the last session, and the\nworld has continued to change. Development and\neconomic growth in many countries have raised\nhundreds of millions of people above the poverty\nline. Societies throughout the world are taking a stand\ntoday, demanding more rights and asking for effective\npolitical participation. Democracy, human rights and\nincreased participation by women in public and social life have all globally improved. Despite unprecedented\nglobal awareness, climate change remains a major\nsource of concern. The continuing deterioration of the\nglobal economic climate is also a permanent source\nof anxiety everywhere. Threats to peace and security\nin various parts of the world show how far we still\nare from achieving the global security we want. It is\ntherefore only fair that we expect the United Nations,\nthe Organization we have placed at the centre of our\ninternational architecture, to be more responsive,\nefficient, effective and transparent.\nThis year Albania celebrates the one hundredth\nanniversary of its independence. As we mark that\nimportant date and survey our history for the past 10\ndecades, we note with satisfaction that for more than half\nof that time the State of Albania has enjoyed successful\ncooperation and active participation in the life of the\nUnited Nations. Our commitment has grown over the\nyears and has embraced almost every aspect of United\nNations activity, including peacekeeping operations. In\nrecent years we have devoted particular attention to the\nongoing efforts to reform the Organization\u2019s system.\nAs that system has developed and its activities have\nbecome more complex, the need for greater coherence\nand efficiency within the Organization as a whole has\ngrown pressing. That is particularly evident in the area\nof United Nations development assistance.\nIn June, as one of the pilot countries for the\nDelivering as One approach, we hosted the fifth High-\nlevel Intergovernmental Conference on Delivering\nas One. The Tirana Conference adopted an outcome\ndocument with concrete and, we hope, valuable\nrecommendations in the light of the approaching\nquadrennial comprehensive policy review. We know\nnow that what started as a test idea has come a long way\nin a relatively short time. A growing number of countries\nare looking more clearly and closely at the benefits\nof seeing the United Nations operate and implement\nits assistance programmes with more coherence and\nefficiency. Delivering as One has convincingly shown\nin practice how the operational activities of the United\nNations can be delivered with greater efficiency and\nhow the system can do more and better and more with\nless in its efforts to help countries reach nationally and\ninternationally agreed development goals.\nI am proud to represent a country and society\nwidely known for their broadmindedness, tolerance and\nacceptance of others. Albanians are probably unique to\nour region in that, despite having endured centuries of difficulties in our history, we have always preserved\nand cherished the values of freedom and respect for\nthe other that are fundamental to the modern concept\nof human rights. Albanians\u2019 respect for one another\u2019s\nrights and individuality is expressed first and foremost\nin an exemplary religious harmony. They have shown\nan outstanding acceptance of, and respect for, other\ncultures, ethnicities and civilizations, and have devoted\nspecial care and attention to those who have come\nseeking safe refuge from the horrors of war. Albanians\nhave risked their own lives and far outspent their\neconomic capacity in order to rescue and save those in\nneed who came knocking at their door.\nIt is against that backdrop that Albania remains\na strong believer in dialogue among civilizations and\ncontinues to engage actively in bridging the differences\namong the wider membership on issues pertaining to\nthe human rights agenda. That is why Albania, which\ncurrently presides over the Council of Europe, has chosen\n\u201cUnited in diversity\u201d as its theme. The dialogue among\ndifferent cultures and civilizations should be seen as\nan ongoing process requiring dedication, goodwill and\ncare. We cannot allow the sporadic reckless actions of\ndisruptive groups to prevent us from making a genuine\neffort to reach a better understanding of one another in\na world that is becoming more globalized every day.\nAlthough we were saddened and embittered by the\nworthless video that deliberately targets what Muslims\neverywhere consider sacred, Albanians, Muslims and\nChristians alike have expressed their indignation by\nsimply ignoring such nonsense. We regret that the\nreaction to it in some parts of the world was different,\nused instead to fuel blind violence by angry, hopeless\ncrowds, with fatal consequences. We must be clear:\nany form of terrorism or extremist act on the part of\nisolated, malevolent groups should never be confused\nwith the position or identified with the attitude of an\nentire society or Government. No legitimate anger\ncan excuse illegitimate violent acts that Governments,\nsocieties and political and religious leaders should\nfirmly oppose. We condemn with indignation the\nterrorist act against American Consulate staff and\npremises in Libya and demand that the perpetrators\nbe punished. We also condemn any act of violent\nprotest against the Western embassies, whose mission\nit is to promote understanding and cooperation among\ncountries and nations.\nWith a foreign policy based on peace and good\nrelations with all nations, its modest but important\ncontribution to international missions aimed at\nsafeguarding peace and human rights through a policy\nof good neighbourliness, as well as its efforts to play a\nmoderate and constructive role in the region, Albania\nhas become a direct contributor to stability and security\non the regional and global levels. We are determined to\nmaintain and further build on that record.\nToday, Albania participates in peacekeeping\nmissions in several international operations within the\nframework of the United Nations and other regional\nsecurity organizations, including in Afghanistan,\nBosnia and Herzegovina, Iraq and more. My country\nacknowledges and supports every effort towards global\npeace and security and will continue to support the\nefforts of the United Nations, NATO and other actors to\npromote peace, stability and security around the world.\nGlobal peace and security continue to be challenged\nby tyranny and oppression in various parts of the world.\nWe reiterate our strong condemnation of the ferocious\nrepression of the freedom-loving people of Syria, whose\nblood is being shed through the primitive attacks on\nthe part of a regime that has irretrievably forfeited its\nlegitimate right to lead and represent the Syrian people.\nLet me join all those calling on the Security Council to\nstep up and comply with its duty, as mandated in the\nUnited Nations Charter, to preserve peace and security.\nIt is hard to believe that one can remain indifferent\nto events such as the terrible ones that have been\nunfolding every day in Syria for a year and a half, with\ntens of thousands of human losses and the widespread,\ndeliberate destruction and suffering that have already\nset the country back by decades.\nHave we not already learned the hard lessons of\nsimilar mistakes in the past tragedies in Rwanda and\nBosnia?\nAlbania fully supports the peace process between\nPalestine and Israel. Albania reiterates its position\nin support of the two-State solution: a secure State\nof Israel and a viable State of Palestine, living side\nby side with each other in accordance with United\nNations resolutions and the road map. The peoples of\nboth Palestine and Israel are exhausted by that never-\nending conflict, and their leaders should shoulder\nthe responsibility of undertaking a legitimate quest\nfor freedom and peace, with long-term vision and\ngoodwill, and against extremists. The world longs to\nsee the peace process in the Middle East shift from a pattern of stagnation and become an inspiring example\nof difficult yet indispensable compromises.\nAlbania remains deeply worried by the Iranian\nnuclear programme, which continues to raise serious\nquestions as to its nature instead of providing answers\nand guarantees, as requested over the years. We must\nprevent Iran from becoming a nuclear threat.\nIn November this year, my country will celebrate the\ncentenary of its independence. We will commemorate a\ncentury that saw a diversity of events, which were not\nalways among the happiest ones.\nMany have described the Albanian people as\nsurvivors of harsh chapters of history. They are not\nwrong: the Albanian people have suffered unwanted\nwars, forced movement from their lands, assaults and\nattempts to annihilate them, unjust partitions and,\nduring the second half of the twentieth century, bravely\nresisted five decades of communism. All this has come\nat a stiff price. Today we look to the future with hope,\nin a spirit of deliverance, and with strong confidence\nthat the coming century will be marked by continuous\npeace, economic progress, and cultural and intellectual\nrevitalization.\nOur region, which was once a troubled hotspot\nand a sick area of Europe, has been profoundly and\npositively transformed. Six new States have been born\nout of the former Yugoslavia in the course of the past\ntwo decades.\nWe all know that it has not been easy, and we all\nknow why. But what matters most is that everywhere\nin the region societies have evolved, the ghosts of the\npast have ceded their place to new realities, and people,\nin particular the young generation, are more than ever\nturned towards the future.\nLet me point out here that the establishment of the\nindependent State of Kosovo five years ago has become\nan important factor of peace and stability in the South-\neast European region. It has become stronger and\novercome all kinds of obstacles created by those who\nstill cannot accept reality and face the truth. As time\npasses, independent Kosovo is being recognized and\naccepted by an increasing number of States \u2014 close to\nhalf of the States Members of the United Nations.\nThe advisory opinion of the International Court\nof Justice on Kosovo (see A/64/881), rendered in 2010\nupon specific request from Serbia, clearly ruled that\nthe independence of Kosovo was in conformity with the international law. Just a few days ago, the Republic\nof Kosovo reached another level of State consolidation\nwith the end of the phase of independence supervised\nby the international community.\nI take this opportunity to congratulate the\nauthorities of Kosovo on their continued progress in\nbuilding and strengthening a democratic State and a\nmulti-ethnic society, and I call on all those countries\nthat have not yet recognized Kosovo to consider a\nreview and assessment of that irreversible reality in\nthe South-eastern European region. The recognition of\nKosovo is an act of justice for a people that has suffered\nfor too long, and represents a net contribution to peace\nand stability in the Balkans.\nWe have already heard, and we are prepared to\nlisten once again to the same old redundant arguments\nfrom Serbia regarding Kosovo. What war failed to do,\npropaganda will not achieve either. While Serbia\u2019s\nleaders speak of partition and the redrawing of borders,\nand while they make troubling statements denying\ngenocide in Srebrenica, one is right to ask whether the\npast continues to loom over the present there, obscuring\nreality and distorting their vision of the future.\nAlbania has maintained strong positive economic\ngrowth despite the impact of the global financial\nand economic crisis. The pursuit of macroprudential\npolicies and well-anchored structural reforms focusing\non privatization, fiscal probity, trade liberalization, the\nbusiness climate and the energy and financial sectors\nhave enabled Albania\u2019s economy to become the most\nresilient of the economies of South-east Europe. During\nthe period from 2007 to 2012, average economic growth\nhas been 5 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP),\npeaking in 2008 at 8 per cent of GDP.\nSince 2008, Albania has had a f lat tax of 10 per\ncent; corporate tax has decreased from 25 per cent to\n10 per cent; personal income tax has dropped from\n23 per cent to 10 per cent; and dozens of fees have\nsimply been eliminated.\nThe Global Competitiveness Report 2011-2012,\npublished by the World Economic Forum, ranks\nAlbania seventy-eighth out of 142 countries/economies.\nThe World Bank report Doing Business 2012: Doing\nBusiness in a More Transparent World ranks Albania\neighty-second out of 183 economies in terms of ease\nof doing business. In the areas of getting credit and\nof protecting investors, Albania ranks twenty-fourth and sixteenth, respectively, putting it among the top\nreformer countries.\nOn our road towards sustained development,\nprogress and prosperity, we remain fully engaged and\ncommitted to carrying out all reforms and taking all\nof the measures required to continue successfully on\nthe path to European Union integration. This is not an\nalternative but a long-term choice carefully pursued\nover the years, and we are determined to make it happen.\nIn the weeks ahead, we expect a favourable\ndecision by the Council of Ministers of the European\nUnion on our bid for the status of candidate country\nto the European Union. That merit-based decision will\nconstitute another milestone in Albania\u2019s journey to\nEuropean integration and will place our commitments\nand our responsibilities at a higher stage of the process.\nIn conclusion, let me assure the Assembly that\nAlbania remains committed to international cooperation\nand is determined to continue to offer its contribution to\nadvancing peace, freedom and security, and respect for\nhuman rights, fighting poverty, promoting sustainable\ndevelopment and prosperity, and, last but not least,\nprotecting the environment."

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt is an immense pleasure for me\nto join other Heads of State and Government at this\nsixty-seventh session of the General Assembly. I should\nlike to begin by congratulating the President upon\nhis election to steer the work of the Assembly at this session. His experience and abilities are well known\nand respected. We have full confidence that he will\ntake the Organization to greater heights. The Kingdom\nof eSwatini is ready to give him all the support that he\ndeserves in carrying out this mammoth task.\nI also wish to thank the Secretary-General for his\ndetailed report on the work of the Organization (A/67/1).\nWe have seen the staff of the United Nations working\nvery hard, sometimes in very difficult and hostile\nenvironments, dedicating their service to helping those\nwho require our assistance and support. The Kingdom\nof eSwatini commends the Secretary-General and his\ndedicated team for working tirelessly to ensure the\nrealization of all aspirations of the Organization.\nAs we gather here, we must always remember\nthat the role of the United Nations is to keep peace\nthroughout the world, to develop and to help nations to\nwork together in resolving challenges such as hunger,\nunemployment, conflicts, disease and illiteracy, among\nothers. The United Nations also aims to be the centre\nfor harmonizing the actions of nations to achieve our\naspirations.\nWe are meeting here at a time when the whole\nworld is facing numerous challenges, such as the\neconomic and financial crisis. The Kingdom of\neSwatini believes that the United Nations is the\nappropriate forum to deliberate on these challenges\nin order to come up with united global solutions. As\npart of the global community, the Kingdom of eSwatini\nhas not been spared from this economic predicament.\nOur social development programmes that enhance the\ndelivery of the Millennium Development Goals and\nnational projects, such as job creation and poverty\nalleviation strategies, have been adversely affected\nby the prevailing situation. The gains we have made\nin the fight against HIV and AIDS through the rollout\nof antiretroviral treatments remain threatened by the\nuncertainty around the financial sustainability of the\nprogramme.\nWe wish to acknowledge the support we continue\nto receive from the Global Fund to fight HIV/AIDS,\nTuberculosis and Malaria in mitigating all diseases.\nThe Fund has gone a long way in injecting resources\ninto our national programme of promoting health as\na key national priority. The need to work together to\novercome these challenges could not have been more\nessential. In our efforts to address global economic challenges,\nwe should be conscious of the social implications of\nsome of the proposed solutions. Our strategies should\nnot create more hardship, but rather find answers that\nmitigate the difficulties we face. I am confident that,\nwith our wealth of different experiences, we stand\nto benefit from valuable strategies, especially from\nthose States that have not been seriously affected by\nthe financial crisis. We urge those countries to share\ntheir experiences for the benefit of all Member States.\nThe Kingdom of eSwatini calls on the United Nations\nto consider making these challenges among its top\npriorities during this session.\nThe Kingdom of eSwatini last month converged\non Sibaya for dialogue on social, economic and\npolitical issues with a view to crafting solutions and\nagreeing on a way forward that would best improve our\nlivelihoods. Sibaya is a place where every citizen is free\nto participate irrespective of gender, creed, religion or\naffiliation, among other things. We believe in the full\nparticipation of all citizens at the grass-roots level in the\ndecision-making process. This forum is an institution\nwhere key national pronouncements are made and\nnational sustainable development strategies conceived.\nOur national Constitution and National Development\nStrategy are outputs of this structure. This practice has\nbeen passed on from generation to generation, and has\ncontinued to serve us well, since it allows the people to\ncontribute to their own welfare.\nLike many other States Member of the Organization,\nthe Kingdom of eSwatini has been working hard\ntowards the ratification of United Nations conventions,\nas well as of continental and regional protocols. I am\npleased to inform the Assembly that the Sibaya forum\nprovided the whole nation with an opportunity to\ndiscuss those conventions and protocols, which have\nsince been ratified by Parliament and deposited with\nthe Secretary-General. We are pleased that we can now\nbe counted among the countries that have successfully\nratified United Nations conventions and protocols.\nThe world we live in has become a complicated\nplace with the advent of modern technology. We remain\nfaced with the challenge of how best to take advantage\nof this technology, such as social media, to promote\npeace and stability. If there is anything we need to do, it\nis to promote peace in the world. It is true, and we fully\nagree with the assertion that there is no need to promote\nviolence of any kind, be it the killing of diplomats, the\nforced removal of Governments, or any other form. In this world, we must all live together in peace, whether as\nMuslims, Christians or any other traditional believers.\nWe must learn to respect each other irrespective of\nrace, creed or religious affiliation. If we practiced those\nprinciples, the world would be altogether a different\nand better place. As human beings, we must turn the\npage, forget the past and live together for the benefit of\ngenerations to come.\nOn the African continent, we are encouraged by\nthe concerted efforts of our fellow brothers and sisters\nwho are committed to resolving their differences in\na peaceful manner. We encourage speedy resolutions\nin areas where pockets of conflict remain, such as the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, the Sudan and some\nNorth African countries, to mention but a few.\nThe Assembly knows that Somalia has also been\nwithout a stable Government for a long time, and we\nhope that new developments will bring about lasting\npeace. In that vein, the Kingdom of eSwatini welcomes\nthe recent development that has taken place in Somalia.\nWe hope that the election of the President will bring the\ndesired stability.\nWe extend the call for peace beyond Africa, to the\nMiddle East, where we continue to witness conflict. The\nwar in Syria has claimed the lives of too many citizens\nand must come to an end. We appeal to the people of\nSyria to discourage the use of force in resolving their\ndifferences. We encourage the use of dialogue in cases\nwhere they do not see eye to eye. We implore the Syrian\nGovernment and the other stakeholders to sit down in\ndialogue in order to find a lasting solution to the current\nimpasse. The barrel of the gun will bring nothing but\nmisery.\nThe United Nations and the League of Arab States\nhave sent a Joint Special Representative to work with\nthe people of Syria. We hope that all stakeholders will\nmake good use of the Joint Special Representative\ntowards finding a peaceful and lasting solution to their\ndifferences. The Kingdom of eSwatini urges States\nMembers of the United Nations to work together in\nsupporting all efforts aimed at helping the people of\nSyria to resolve the conflict.\nWe also note that the Israel-Palestine conflict\nremains unresolved. A peaceful settlement of the issue\nis deeply desired and urgently necessary. Our position\nis unambiguous. The most viable solution is to have the\ntwo States of Israel and Palestine coexisting side by\nside in peace and harmony. We must commend the recent positive developments\nwith regard to relations between the Republic of\nChina on Taiwan and mainland China, which are\nsteadily improving. Indeed, it is very encouraging\nas it demonstrates that the tensions between the two\ncountries have subsided. We hope that one day they\nwill be able to resolve all of their differences and live\nhappily with each other. We are witnessing increasing\ntrade, as well as f lights, between the two countries.\nRecently, it was also interesting to see mainland China\nhost an African summit, to which the countries that are\nfriends of Taiwan were also invited.\nAs an African country, we would like to thank\nmainland China for its continued support to African\ncountries. We have no doubt that the potential of the\ntwo peoples working together side by side will make\na significant difference in the world. We hope that the\nnew developments will pave the way for Taiwan to\nparticipate fully in all United Nations entities, because\nthe people of Taiwan desire to become part of the global\ncommunity.\nPeace will continue to elude us until we properly\naddress the issue of weapons of mass destruction.\nIt is clear that those weapons are not necessary to\nhumankind. Their mere presence is a recipe for conflict\nas each country seeks to gain power over others. The\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons,\nadopted by many Member States, must be enforced to\nensure the complete elimination of these weapons.\nWe have not seen any tangible proof of compliance\nwith the internationally agreed time frames, which\nis a cause for serious concern requiring urgent\nattention. The mere existence of those weapons creates\nunnecessary tension that could result in a very hostile\nworld environment. We implore those countries\nendowed with uranium resources to use them for other\nessential economic development needs, such as power\ngeneration.\nThe Kingdom of eSwatini recognizes the important\nrole that the Security Council plays in the pursuit of\ninternational peace and security. The Charter of the\nUnited Nations clearly stipulates an international order\nthat ensures the rule of law. We call upon the General\nAssembly at this session to deliberate on Security\nCouncil reform, as not all regions are well represented.\nWe wish to reiterate the African position on the Security\nCouncil, claiming two seats in the permanent category\nand five seats in the non-permanent category. The\nfull representation of all regions in the Council will ensure that we all own the decisions of that important\nsecurity organ. We should all be given equal treatment.\nNo region or country should impose its influence over\nothers. We wish to see finality in that urgent matter,\nsince it has dragged on for a very long time now.\nThe high-level meeting on sustainable energy for\nall, which was held alongside this session, gave Heads\nof State and Government a forum to deliberate on issues\nthat promote the protection of our environment. That\nmeeting provided us with an opportunity to revisit the\ncommitments made towards sustainable energy for all.\nThe destruction of the environment has had\ndevastating effects on many of our countries. The\nUnited Nations must expedite the processes towards\nprotecting the environment by enforcing the use of\nenvironmentally friendly technologies and practices by\nMember States. We call upon the developed countries\nto honour their commitments made prior to the United\nNations Conference on Sustainable Development in Rio\nde Janeiro.\nFinally, allow me to say that as we meet during\nthis session, let us adopt resolutions that will provide\nlasting solutions to the challenges faced by humankind\nthe world over. We wish the United Nations every\nsuccess as it pursues its objective of creating a peaceful\nenvironment and coexistence among all the nations of\nthe world. Let honesty, peace, stability and tolerance\nprevail across the globe."

        "file_text": "\ufeffLeadership is about making\nchoices. It is about the ability to make the right decision\nat the right moment and to have the stamina to deliver\naccordingly. It is about the will to help shape the future of individuals, nations and the planet. And it is about\nthe courage that comes with seeking peace with one\u2019s\nenemies, as Yitzhak Rabin once told us. Leadership is\nalso about creating the conditions for people to choose\nhow to live their lives. Freedom is more than the mere\nabsence of physical or legal obstacles.\nThe very purpose of the United Nations is to\npromote freedom for all people \u2014 freedom from want,\nfreedom from fear, and the freedom to live in dignity.\nPeople are only truly free when they are able to choose\nthe way they want to live their own lives, regardless\nof race, gender or sexual orientation. It is the freedom\nof a woman to choose when to have children and also\nwhen not to have them. It is about her freedom from\nintrusion of her physical integrity, as well as her right\nto think and say what she wants. It is about the freedom\nthat allows mother and child to survive birth, and the\nfreedom that allows every child to live a healthy life,\nreceive education and walk to school without fear of\nland mines or cluster munitions. It is about the freedom\nof every man and every woman to organize, to speak\nout and to have their say as society progresses.\nThose freedoms lay the ground for development and\nprosperity. They give men and women a chance to build\na better future for themselves and for their families.\nSome people can only dream about those freedoms, but\nwhen they do exist they are often the result of collective\naction by families, communities, regions and States and\nat the global level. At the end of the day, that is why we\nare here in this Assembly.\nIn Syria, mass atrocities are continuing. The crisis\nin Syria started with a call for freedom and dignity\nthrough peaceful protests. The Syrian Government\nbears the primary responsibility. The privileges of the\nfew should no longer stand in the way of the aspirations\nof the many. The regime of Bashar Al-Assad has lost all\nlegitimacy and must cede power. The violence in Syria\nmust stop.\nEven in war, there are rules. All parties have clear\nresponsibilities under international humanitarian law.\nTo any party that commits violations of these principles,\nI say this: \u201cYou are all individually responsible. When\njustice prevails, you will be held accountable for the\ncrimes you have committed. Do not expect to be\npardoned by stating that your opponent committed the\nsame crime.\u201d\nWhen the United Nations was formed in San\nFrancisco in 1945, we collectively decided to establish a Security Council to act on our behalf. The permanent\nmembers were then entrusted with the right of veto. My\ncountry\u2019s delegation at the time was led by Mr. Trygve\nLie, who would later become the Organization\u2019s first\nSecretary-General. On behalf of my country, he cast his\nvote in favour of the right of veto for the five permanent\nmembers, as did many other small and medium-sized\ncountries. They did so not only to reflect the world\norder of the day, but also to ensure that the Council\nwould have genuine authority to make decisions and be\nable to act on our behalf. They did not do so because\nthey held certain States to be superior to others.\nTherefore, and in the light of the Syrian drama, my\nmessage to the members of the Security Council is that\npeople in the Arab world, in Europe, in Asia, in Africa\nand in the Americas are watching with horror how\nhistory is repeating itself. Once again, the permanent\nmembers of the Security Council are divided and\nunable to protect people on the ground. In its absence,\nextremists on all sides are free to kill, maim and rape.\nWe now expect the members of the Council to act. We\nexpect them to put away outdated ideas of zero-sum\ngames or spheres of influence and to strive to seek a\ncommon position. Enough blood has been shed.\nThe verdict is harsh against those who choose the\nwrong side of history. They must not allow narrow\nself-interest to block the winds of change that the\nvast majority of members of this Assembly applaud.\nPresident Al-Assad of Syria was not forced to take the\npath of conflict and confrontation; he could have opted\nfor compromise and cooperation. Elsewhere in the\nworld, quite different choices are being made.\nToday in this Assembly, we have heard how\nMyanmar\u2019s reformist President Thein Sein is opening\nthe door for a free and democratic Myanmar. I commend\nthe courage shown by the Myanmar Government. I also\ncommend the courage of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi. She\nhas chosen to talk to the very people who once held her\nin confinement.\nEarlier today in Addis Ababa, the leaders of the\nSudan and South Sudan made the choice to end the\nbloody conflict that has marred their peoples\u2019 lives for\ndecades. The Sudan and South Sudan had again been\non the brink of war, but by signing today\u2019s agreements\nthey have opted for peace. We salute the African Union,\nwhich has, in close partnership with the Security\nCouncil, helped make that choice possible. In Colombia, the Government and representatives\nof the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia\nhave made the wise choice of entering into formal\nnegotiations in order to end another age-old conflict.\nAs Norway\u2019s Foreign Minister, I am the Chair of\nthe Ad Hoc Liaison Committee for the Coordination\nof International Assistance to Palestinians. We met on\nthe eve of this session of the General Assembly. I want\nto take this opportunity to share with Member States\nmy deep concern about the state of play in the Israel-\nPalestine relationship. Exactly one year ago, we agreed\nhere in New York that the Palestinian State-building\nprocess had reached a level where the institutions of\nState were in place. Great expectations were created,\nonly to be frustrated.\nTime is running short \u2014 shorter than many seem\nto understand. There is significant fatigue among the\nPalestinian population. They may become inspired\nto look for alternative options \u2014 options that would\nseverely hamper the prospects of Palestinians and\nIsraelis alike. I see a similar fatigue emerging among the\ncountries that are funding the Palestinian authorities.\nThe two-State solution is the only path to sustainable\npeace, but the prospect of realizing a Palestinian State\nbased on the two-State solution is diminishing as the\nexpansion of Israeli settlements continues. Those\nactions remain the main obstacle to peace and they must\nstop. To get the peace process back on track, we need\nto break the impasse and reinstall the trust in a political\nhorizon based on the final status issues. Negotiations\nremain the key to achieve that; they must start now.\nLeadership is also about trust. To achieve our\ngoals, we need a strong United Nations. I applaud the\nSecretary-General\u2019s tireless efforts aimed at reforming\nthe internal workings of the Organization. We have\nelected a Secretary-General to lead, but we must allow\nhim to do so. Intergovernmental micromanagement\nof what would be the chief executive\u2019s prerogative in\nany modern organization is nothing but the opposite of\nmaking the United Nations work.\nTo conclude, leaders have real choices. Leaders\nhave real responsibilities. Humankind shapes its own\nfuture. Failing to solve the most critical challenges\nof our time not only harms those who suffer under\npoverty, war or oppression; it also deprives people of\nthe conviction that they too can shape their own future.\nAnd that very conviction, that belief in oneself and each\nother, is what will make freedom from want, freedom from fear and the freedom to live in dignity possible for\nall. That is the purpose of our leadership."

The President can be assured of\nmy delegation\u2019s full support and cooperation during his\ntenure.\nThis body was a very different place when Minister\nPaul-Henri Spaak, another presidential predecessor,\nopened the first session of the General Assembly. The\nworld had just emerged from the most devastating\ncarnage it had ever seen, and the United Nations\nhad the enormous task of stitching civilization back\ntogether again. Finding common purpose among the\noriginal 51 Member States promised to be a Herculean\neffort \u2014 a similar endeavour had faltered only a decade\nearlier \u2014 but the stakes were far too high for failure to\nbe an option. Accordingly, the Organization embarked\nin earnest on the long process of strengthening the\nrule of international law based on the principles of\nnon-aggression and the sovereign equality of all nations.\nIt is a testament to the success of those early\nefforts that the membership of the United Nations has\nswelled to 193 countries and the past 67 years have\nbeen a period of relative stability. While the benefits\nof multilateralism during this time were often shared\nunequally, as were the costs, the promise of a more\nstable and secure future for all imbued the United\nNations with the legitimacy it needed to pursue its\nambitious mandate. But we must never forget that the\nlegitimacy underpinning our essential work here is not\na birthright; we must earn it. When our words become\nhollow, that legitimacy is threatened.\nThe work of our early predecessors was one of\nconstruction. The task at hand today, perhaps even\nmore challenging, is one of restoration. We are awash in\nunfulfilled promises stretching back decades. Barring\na brief resurgence in the early 1990s, multilateralism\nhas for the most part deteriorated into a scramble for\nfinite resources, a destructive fight for a bigger piece\nof the economic pie, sugarcoated with empty rhetoric.\nLook at the beginning of any international agreement\nand you will find reaffirmation upon reaffirmation of\nour non-binding commitments to live up to our lofty\nideals. Perhaps their greatest value is as a reminder of how often very little has been achieved. Our words\nmust have meaning if our multilateral institutions are\nto remain effective in addressing emerging global\nchallenges. Once again, the stakes are too high for\nfailure to be an option.That dynamic could not be more\nevident than it was in the climate change negotiations.\nThis summer, we were treated to a new round of truly\nterrifying news. Arctic sea ice dropped to its lowest\nextent in recorded history, shattering the previous\nrecord by a jaw-dropping 18 per cent. Some scientists\nare now predicting that the Arctic Ocean could be\nice-free during summer in as little as five years. The ice\nmelt is already wreaking significant havoc on weather\npatterns around the globe and has probably contributed\nto the historic heat waves that struck many places this\nyear.\nJust last week, a new study found that half of all\ncoral reefs could be lost with a temperature rise above\n1.2 degrees Celsius. The scientists further concluded:\n\u201cThere is little doubt... coral reefs will no longer be\nprominent within coastal ecosystems if global average\ntemperatures exceed 2 degrees Celsius...\u201d That would\nbe devastating for the economies of small islands and\ncoastal communities around the world, not to mention\nthe staggering and irrevocable loss of biodiversity\nthat would be incurred by our shared natural heritage.\nMore and more studies are concluding that the door to\nlimiting temperature rise to even 2 degrees is rapidly\nclosing, if it has not closed already.\nMeanwhile, greenhouse-gas emissions continue\nto climb higher each year, with no end in sight. Small\nislands may be the canary in the coal mine, but we all\nare staring a global catastrophe right in the face.\nIt is revealing just how much our ambition to\naddress the crisis has been downscaled in just three\nyears. The fifteenth session of the Conference of the\nParties to the United Nations Framework Convention\non Climate Change, held in Copenhagen, was the\nconference to save the world. The United Nations\nClimate Change Conference, held in Canc\u00fan, Mexico,\nwas the conference to save the process. The Conference\nof the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to\nthe Kyoto Protocol, held in Durban, South Africa, it\nseems, was the conference to save the rest for later.\nInstead of increasing the urgency of our work to\nrespond to the growing climate crisis, we have instead\nseen the steady dismantling of the international\nregime and a concerted effort to delay additional\naction until 2020. Such an outcome is unacceptable. If\nmultilateralism is to have any credibility, then we must\nmove to an emergency footing, and those countries\nwith the greatest capacity must immediately begin\nmobilizing the significant resources necessary to\nremake the energy infrastructure that powers the global\neconomy. That must begin at the eighteenth session of\nthe United Nations Framework Convention on Climate\nChange in Doha with the reprioritization of pre-2020\nmitigation ambition and the mobilization of means\nof implementation, including finance, technology and\ncapacity-building.\nNauru\u2019s delegation will arrive in Doha prepared\nto make its contribution to the global effort. We have\nadopted a very ambitious renewable energy goal of\n50 per cent by 2015. We think we can achieve it, but\nwe will need climate financing from international\nsources to do so. As with most developing countries,\nobtaining the means of implementation will be the key\nto unlocking our ambition.\nThe ultimate objective of the Convention on Climate\nChange is to stabilize greenhouse gases at a level that\naverts dangerous interference with the climate system so\nthat ecosystems can adapt naturally, food production is\nnot threatened and economic development can proceed\nin a sustainable manner. We should stop pretending that\nthis is still within reach.\nWe must realize that we have polluted the\natmosphere so much that many dangerous climate\nchange impacts are now unavoidable. Therefore,\nthe United Nations system must begin analysing and\naddressing the security implications of climate change.\nClimate change will become an increasing driver\nof conflict in the future if we do not take steps now.\nIncreased competition over dwindling natural resources,\nfood and water insecurity, and forced migration are\njust a few of the security issues that climate change\nis expected to exacerbate. For that reason, the Pacific\nsmall island developing States (SIDS) have called for\nthe appointment of a special representative on climate\nand security, supported by adequate resources, to\nbegin analysing the security threats of climate change\nand to work with interested Member States to build\ntheir resilience. In addition, the Secretary-General of\nthe United Nations should be requested to conduct an\nassessment of the United Nations system\u2019s capacity\nto respond to the various security implications of\nclimate change. Member States, particularly the most\nvulnerable, must have confidence that the international community has the tools and resources to respond to\nthe crisis.\nSome countries have been sceptical of Security\nCouncil involvement in climate change. That is\nunderstandable because the Council\u2019s current\ncomposition does not accurately reflect the diversity\nof United Nations membership. The time has come for\nthis to be remedied. However, reform should not be\nlimited merely to membership. The Council must also\nprovide a forum for addressing the security challenges\nof all countries, not just those of concern to the most\npowerful.\nThe United Nations sustainable development\ninitiatives have been graced with an abundance of\nlofty rhetoric but few resources. Many countries,\nincluding my own, are not on track to meet their\nMillennium Development Goals, and in some cases\nhave suffered setbacks because of the recent global\neconomic downturn. At the same time, the f low of\nofficial development assistance from some channels\nhas diminished, further jeopardizing our ability to\nachieve our MDGs.\nWe often forget that oceans cover 70 per cent of\nthe Earth\u2019s surface and that healthy marine ecosystems\nare vital to the sustainable development and sustainable\nlivelihoods of small islands. For many of us, the only\nvaluable natural resource we have is our fish. It forms\nthe cornerstone of our efforts to eradicate poverty and\nprovide livelihoods for our people. For us, fishing is\nnot just another economic sector \u2014 it is often the only\nsignificant economic sector, and we must jealously\nguard our modest natural wealth so that it can provide\nfor many generations to come.\nWhile the outcome document of the United Nations\nConference on Sustainable Development in Rio had\nfew concrete deliverables, it did capture the Pacific\nSIDS vision of a blue economy. If fully implemented,\nthe new provisions could help stem the steep decline\nin fish stocks. We welcome the recognition of ocean\nacidification as an emergent threat, and we must work\ncollectively to build the resilience of marine ecosystems\nto climate change impacts. The commitments made in\nRio must be backed by real resources so they can be\ntranslated into concrete results on the ground.\nRio also infused new energy into making islands\na model for sustainable development by agreeing to\nconvene the third Global Conference on the Sustainable\nDevelopment of Small Island Developing States, which is to be held in the Pacific in 2014. The Conference will\nprovide an opportunity for the international community\nto make good on the promises of the Barbados\nProgramme of Action and the Mauritius Strategy for\nImplementation by setting specific goals and mobilizing\nreal resources. We call on the international community\nto provide support for the Conference and to summon\nthe political will necessary to make it a success. It was\nagreed at the first Earth Summit that the sustainable\ndevelopment of SIDS would be the first test of the\nglobal partnership. We must demonstrate to the world\nthat this partnership means something.\nA central aspect of that work must be enhancing\nthe international system to better target the unique\ncombination of challenges faced by SIDS, which\nshould include the creation of a formal SIDS category\nat the United Nations. It is clear from 20 years of\nexperience that the current arrangements for improving\nthe sustainabIe development prospects of SIDS are\nineffective. We must demonstrate that the multilateral\nsystem is nimble enough to evolve in response to the\nshortcomings that have been identified.\nNauru welcomes the attention that the theme of\nthis year\u2019s general debate brings to the need to address\ndisputes by peaceful means, and it commends the\nefforts made by Taiwan and China to reduce tensions\nand increase cooperation. I call on Member States to\nsupport continuing dialogue between the two sides of\nthe Taiwan Strait and the parties concerned in the East\nChina Sea dispute to recognize Taiwan\u2019s positive role\nin consolidating peace and stability in East Asia. Nauru\nurges a rapid and peaceful settlement of the situation\nin South Ossetia and Abkhazia in a manner that treats\nthose affected with dignity and that respects their rights\nas a sovereign nation.\nNauru continues to support the right of Israel to live\nfree from the fear of terrorism. We also acknowledge\nPalestine\u2019s right to statehood as part of a two-State\nsolution, which can be achieved only through peaceful\nmeans.\nThe challenges facing the international community\nare great and can be solved only by concerted\nmultilateral action. President Jeremi\u0107\u2019s task and ours\nis to begin the process of rebuilding the Organization.\nThat process must restore the integrity of the institution\nentrusted with the protection of human dignity. It\nwas accomplished once before in the aftermath of a\ncatastrophe. This time, our goal must be to prevent one.\nI pledge Nauru\u2019s full support in that endeavour."

        "file_text": "\ufeffI should like\nto start by conveying to the friendly Republic of Serbia\nand to President Jeremi\u0107 personally my most heartfelt\ncongratulations on his election to the presidency of\nthe General Assembly at its sixty-seventh session. I\nshould like also to congratulate Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz\nAl-Nasser, President of the Assembly at its previous\nsession, as well as Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for the efforts that\nthey have undertaken in favour of all peoples\u2019 aspirations\nthat are aimed at achieving stability, peace, security\nand development throughout the world. I should like to\nconvey to them the congratulations of my people, who,\nthrough the revolution of 17 December 2010, entered\nthe fraternity of free people and democratic States.\nI should now like to express our views regarding\nthe major issues facing our world today.\nToday we are witnessing the great evil perpetrated\nby a few groups that are using the media to disseminate\ntheir destructive and chaotic views. That makes clear the\ngreat chasm that exists with respect to the psychological,\nsocial and economic crises of our societies, which,\nunfortunately, exacerbate the phenomena of violence\nand extremism. Those warning signals need to be\naddressed very seriously. The First and Second World Wars did not happen in a vacuum; they were the result\nof extremist statements and policies that led to human\ncarnage and claimed tens of millions of lives.\nWe in Tunisia believe that we must work under the\nauspices of the United Nations to bring about peace\nfor all humankind and to avert confrontations between\ncivilizations. Tunisia\u2019s access to this forum of free and\ndemocratic peoples came at a very high cost. Tens of\nthousands of political prisoners, as well as exiles, were\ntortured before the revolution; they were the ones who\npaid the price. During the revolution, more than 300\ncitizens were killed and 2,000 others injured.\nA year and a half after the revolution, Tunisia\ncontinues to move forward. We are, however, faced by\na great many difficult economic and social problems,\nthe legacy of a regime that lasted for more than two\ndecades and whose practices included corruption,\nfraud and repression. But that price is negligible when\ncompared with that paid by our brothers in Egypt,\nYemen and Libya, and, of course, by our brothers in\nSyria, more than 25,000 of whom have been killed and\ntens of thousands injured, along with the destruction\nof the country\u2019s infrastructure. All of that will forever\nmark the Syrian people and affect their future for\ndecades to come.\nThat high price is something we all should\nremember in facing the difficulties that hamper us in\nthe building of an international system that will work\nto avert, lay siege to and curtail those accursed political\nsystems that threaten the freedom of peoples and peace\namong peoples. The Republic of Tunisia, which has just\nemerged from dictatorship and which is well aware of\nthe high toll taken by such a regime, proposes that we\ncreate a new mechanism to fight dictatorships, which\nare a disease threatening peace, stability and security\nas well as the prosperity of peoples. They not only have\nan impact on the freedom of people in a given country,\nbut they also give rise to hatred and wars.\nEurope was able to enjoy peace, stability and\nprosperity only after the fall of the fascist, Nazi and\nCommunist dictatorships. In the medical field, methods\nwere developed by the World Health Organization that\nmade possible the elimination of polio in the twentieth\ncentury; that would have seemed pure fiction to doctors\nin the nineteenth century. We have acquired political\nmaturity and awareness in the face of dictatorship,\nwhich, more than diseases, poses a serious threat to the\nlives of hundreds of millions of people.\nBecause the United Nations, through its Charter\nand institutions, has at its disposal a legal arsenal that\ncan serve to bring about basic freedoms and peace\namong peoples, we invite the Organization to declare\nthat dictatorship is a social and political scourge that\nmust be eliminated through the combined efforts\nof all peoples throughout the world. It behoves us\nto implement a bold and ambitious programme to\neliminate dictatorship in the same manner in which we\ngot rid of polio and smallpox.\nThe creation of the International Criminal Court\n(ICC) demonstrates that we are on a historic journey of\nbuilding international institutions that has not yet been\ncompleted. The ICC is but a further step in the direction\nof the complete elimination of dictatorship. However,\nthe Court tackles crimes only after their commission;\nwhat we require are mechanisms to prevent dictatorship\nfrom taking root in the first place.\nContemporary dictatorships are based on the use\nof excessive force and give themselves false legality\nthrough the holding of fraudulent elections. They use\nthe appearance of democracy to undermine democracy\nitself. Those kinds of elections took place in Tunisia\nin 1999, 2004 and 2009. Our deposed dictator was\nprepared to remain in power forever. He intended, for\nthe 2014 elections, to rewrite the Constitution so he\ncould run for a third term. Each time he re-imposed the\nstatus quo because he knew that no internal domestic or\ninternational mechanisms existed that could rein in his\npolitical activities.\nDuring that entire period, the Tunisian democratic\nopposition could not but note the paralysis of domestic\nand international laws and legal mechanisms. It was\nsimply impossible for the opposition to turn to a\nTunisian or international constitutional court. Although\nit was normal that such a constitutional court did not\nexist in the country, it certainly was not normal that\na mechanism to that effect should fail to exist within\nthe United Nations, because the Charter of the United\nNations and the Universal Declaration of Human\nRights, as well as many other international conventions\nand instruments, backed by General Assembly\nresolutions, all are texts that could be viewed as being\nthe charter of humankind. The only thing missing is an\nimplementation mechanism.\nThe Republic of Tunisia therefore proposes the\ncreation of an international constitutional court similar\nto the ICC, which could be seized of challenging illegal constitutions or charters, or fraudulent elections. Such a\ncourt would have to be competent to consider a number\nof disputes and issues, to rule on the legality or illegality\nof elections that are not in line with the Charter of the\nUnited Nations. All systems, especially democratic\nones, would face the clear duty of being recognized by\nthe international constitutional court. The court would\nalso make recommendations and provide the necessary\nadvice to all those who so request. The body could serve\nas a deterrent against any despot, any tyrannical regime,\nin the case of any such regime forging election results.\nThe court would contribute to the very disappearance\nof those regimes, because it would strengthen the role\nof peaceful civic resistance. Otherwise, the only choice\nwould be to live under oppression or to turn to violence.\nWe all know just how expensive that can be.\nTunisia strongly advocates the protection of\nthe environment to ensure that we leave succeding\ngenerations a sustainable world.\nWe also want to leave a world living in peace and\nto douse the flames of war in Afghanistan, Mali, the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, the Sudan and\nthe Middle East. Tunisia requests rapid humanitarian\nintervention to help save the heroic Syrian people and\nto ensure the departure of President Bashar Al-Assad\nand his criminal regime. We call for the deployment of\nan Arab peace force to guarantee the transition and to\ncreate a democratic State, which would be pluralistic\nand that could live in peace.\nTunisia wishes to reiterate its support for the\nPalestinian people and their right to a just peace and\nthe release of thousands of prisoners. We support the\ncreation of a Palestinian State with Al-Quds as its\ncapital and with membership in this Organization.\nWe condemn violence against women and children.\nWe denounce the fanaticism, the anti-Semitism and the\nIslamophobia that one often sees. We call for tolerance\nto allow all religious minorities, including Muslims in\nBurma and Christians living in all Muslim countries, to\nexercise their faith freely. The chasm between the rich\nand the poor must be reduced.\nDuring the upcoming Nuclear Materials\nConference, Tunisia will insist on the need to free\nthe Middle East from nuclear weapons and all other\nweapons of mass destruction.\nWe champion pluralistic, tolerant civilian societies\nand institutions. Tunisia is the country of peaceful\ndemocratic revolution. Tunisia asks the General Assembly to draw upon\nArticle 22 of the Charter of the United Nations, by which\nit may establish such subsidiary organs as it deems\nnecessary, and create an international constitutional\ncourt and to include this item in the agenda of its\nsixty-eighth session. I hope this proposal will enjoy\nthe broadest possible support by democratic States and\nthe mobilization of the international community, which\nplayed such an important role in the creation of the\nInternational Criminal Court. We hope that the same\nwill be done to ensure that the proposed international\nconstitutional court becomes a part of a comprehensive\nsystem that would enable our people and succeeding\ngenerations to avoid a scourge of blood and tears like\nthat which has cost us so dearly."

        "file_text": "\ufeffAs with most sessions of\nthe General Assembly, we are sharing, yet again, our\ncommon fears and frustrations in a world that is going\nwrong. We have no stories, only f leeting moments,\nwith which to fill our sinking hearts with hope in a\nnear or distant future. Ours is a narrative of mounting\nchallenges and doubts. Deep in our hearts, we know that\nour very survival on this fragile planet is under threat.\nYet, we share no common vision and fail to think and\nact in concert and with faith. And so we find ourselves\nbeing overwhelmed by the forces that our irresponsible\nand discordant actions have unleashed. All that we have\nachieved individually, as nations, as regions and as a\nspecies, faces the threat of loss and reversal. As we\nargue and falter, the world we have built is falling apart.\nClimate is changing and ecosystems are dying. The\ngrowing extractive industry spurred by consumerism is\nexhausting our natural resources, and conflicts are rising\nin number and more are looming on the horizon. Food\nand energy are becoming costlier, thereby deepening\npoverty, inequality and discontent. Economies are\nunravelling; jobs and security are being lost. For too\nmany, basic human rights and dignity remain beyond\nreach, and the relevance of Governments and States is\nin question. Families and communities are losing their\nresilience, and society is crumbling.\nI have reminded the Assembly each year that the\nsolutions we speak of and the measures we take to\nmeet all these challenges and many others plaguing\nmankind are of the kind that address the symptoms but\naggravate the deeper malaise. We are discovering that\nour problems \u2014 be they economic, social, ecological\nor even political \u2014 are interconnected and rooted in the folly of mankind\u2019s pursuit of the wrong ends in\nwrongful ways.\nAlthough the United Nations has been a house of\ngloom in recent years, it does have its shining moments,\nprojecting rays of hope. The Secretary-General referred\nto some of these in his address that focused on sounding\nthe alarm about our direction as a human family. One\nsuch moment came when this great body resolved that\nit was time to accept human well-being and happiness\nas a developmental goal binding all of humankind\nwith a common vision and pursuit, and that it should\ntherefore bring about a holistic, sustainable and\ninclusive approach to development. That determination\ncaused my country to host a high-level meeting here at\nthe United Nations, which brought together more than\n800 participants from all walks of life and all over the\nworld. I was awed, humbled and indeed inspired by the\nphenomenal response to our call. It was a gathering of\nextraordinary minds and concerned citizens, moved by\nthe urgent need for change \u2014 to blaze a new global path\nto human happiness and the well-being of life on earth.\nYet another moment came just months ago when the\nGeneral Assembly declared 20 March the International\nDay of Happiness, thereby bringing together all human\nbeings, at least once a year, to reflect on the meaning\nand purpose of life and realign our thoughts and actions.\nThree months ago, 40,000 representatives\ngathered for the United Nations Conference on\nSustainable Development. The outcome document\n(resolution 66/288, annex) fell far short of what we\nought to have achieved. Many saw it as a missed\nopportunity. Not so for my country and people, who,\nwith minimal expectations, came away with cause for\nhope. The agreement to develop universal sustainable\ndevelopment goals that would integrate the economic,\nenvironmental and social dimensions of development\nwas a substantive outcome, consistent with relevant\nGeneral Assembly resolutions and the efforts that my\nown country is making. My country hopes to participate\nactively in this work and sees it as evidence of the\ngrowing convergence in the belief that we need to make\na break with the past and agree on a collective vision.\nIt is our expectation that such sustainable development\ngoals will steer the post-2015 international development\nagenda and set humankind on the right course.\nWhat inspired me most at Rio was the indomitable\nspirit of the hundreds of side events, several of which I\nwas honoured to participate in. These were organized by\ncivil society, grass-roots organizations and the private sector. They came to share best practices and learn\nfrom each other, and, more important, to demonstrate\nthat sustainable development is not just an idle dream\nbut that there are individuals and organizations who are\nbreathing and living lives to realize what is profound\nand necessary. While many of them went home\ndisappointed by the outcome document, I know it is not\nin their creed to despair. They are the pioneers, taking\nthe lead where Governments fear to tread, and giving\ncourageous expression to humankind\u2019s basic goodness\nand inherent wisdom. They are the torchbearers of a\nbrave new dawn, and we too must have the wisdom and\nhumility to follow their lead.\nI am also inspired by the appointment of a high-level\npanel by the Secretary-General to advise on the global\ndevelopment agenda beyond 2015, which, we note,\nconvened its first meeting earlier this week. Moreover,\nthe launch of the Sustainable Development Solutions\nNetwork, led by Jeffrey Sachs, is to be welcomed,\nas is the Secretary-General\u2019s personal commitment\nto enriching the discourse on the future of our race.\nFor our part, I would like to submit that Bhutan has\ninitiated a number of steps in the same direction,\npursuant to the recommendation issued at the 2 April\nHigh-level Meeting on Well-being and Happiness here\nat the United Nations.\nIn July, His Majesty the King of Bhutan established\na working group of international experts, comprising\nover 50 thought leaders, to elaborate the details of\nthe new proposed development paradigm over the\ncoming two years. Their work will be made available\nfor consideration at the sixty-eighth and sixty-ninth\nsessions of the General Assembly, in 2013 and 2014.\nSimultaneously, His Majesty the King appointed a\nnational steering committee to guide and support this\nprocess.\nThe working group will elaborate and refine the\nfour themes of well-being and happiness, ecological\nsustainability, fair distribution, and the efficient use\nof resources. It will prepare detailed documentation,\nincluding thorough literature reviews and examinations\nof existing best practices on how the new paradigm\ncan work. They will look at its potential accounting\nand measurement systems, regulatory and financial\nmechanisms, and trade, governance, and other\ninstitutional arrangements. We believe the findings\nwill complement and contribute to the efforts being\nundertaken by the Secretary-General\u2019s high-level panel.\nTowards this end, my Government also looks forward to the early establishment of the intergovernmental\nopen working group tasked with designing sustainable\ndevelopment goals, as agreed at the United Nations\nConference on Sustainable Development in Rio.\nThis month, Bhutan enters its forty-second year of\nmembership in the United Nations. During this period,\nBhutan has been a beneficiary of the international\ncommunity, whose support and generosity have helped\nto bring about tangible improvements in the lives of the\nBhutanese people. In return, Bhutan\u2019s contributions\nto the work of the United Nations have been modest\nbut focused. We have endeavoured to demonstrate\nour dedication to the causes of peace, development\nand the rule of law. As a responsible member of the\ninternational community, committed to the principles\nenshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, Bhutan\nis now prepared to engage directly in the process of\nbuilding a more secure world through non-permanent\nmembership in the Security Council. This we regard\nnot only as a privilege, but also as a responsibility of\nUnited Nations membership.\nIt was in this context that in 1999 Bhutan informed\nthe Asian Group of its aspiration to seek membership\nin the Security Council for the term 2013-2014. Having\nnever held nor sought membership in the Council before,\nwe are convinced that all States, regardless of size,\npopulation or level of development, must be permitted\nthe opportunity to contribute by bringing diversity of\nthought, approach and, indeed, their will to the work of\nthe Council. As a small State, we have always attached\nthe highest importance to multilateralism and the\nprimacy of an effective United Nations that serves the\ninterests of all its Member States.\nThe election of non-permanent members to the\nSecurity Council next month will, I believe, provide\nthe opportunity for the international community, as\nrepresented by all Member States, to demonstrate its\ncommitment to the fundamental precept of sovereign\nequality as enshrined in the United Nations Charter and\nto the principles of democracy and rotation that give it\nmeaning."

        "file_text": "\ufeffAs\nPresident of the Transition of Madagascar, it is a great\nhonour for me to participate in the general debate of\nthe United Nations for the second time. The theme of the sixty-seventh session is akin to a call for unity,\nfor shared contemplation and for generally revisiting\nexistential questions and human values in the face of\nsituations around the world where peace is extremely\nprecarious.\nThe last few years have indeed been marked by\ndifferences of opinion, political disputes and conflicts\nof interest. The world today faces new challenges to\nstability and the maintenance of peace. Various efforts\nand initiatives have been undertaken to deal with\nconflicts that are not homogeneous and disputes that\ndo not always play out along the same lines. People\u2019s\ninterests differ and their approaches are not all equal.\nToday the list of the forms that global conflicts\ntake leads us to an obvious reality: geostrategic\nvariations conform to no one rule, and they are in\nperpetual f lux. The wise words of Secretary-General\nBan Ki-moon in his statement at the opening of the\nsixteenth Summit of the Non-Aligned Movement seem\nparticularly revealing in that context. Did he not stress\nthat among the challenges that must be met, there are\nall too many political disputes between member States\nof the Non-Aligned Movement itself? Did he not urge\nthe protagonists in the Syrian crisis to immediately\ninstitute a ceasefire and a halt to the violence? And yet\nwe can only deplore the fact that his call produced no\nresult. Scores of innocent people are still dying every\nday, and over recent months they now number in the\nthousands. We firmly condemn this loss of human life.\nThe Earth continues to run with the blood of innocents,\nspilled violently not only in Syria but in other parts of\nthe world as well.\nGiven this state of affairs, despite the complexity\nof the challenges those conflicts present, the Secretary-\nGeneral has not stood idle. We can only commend his\ndetermination to strive tirelessly to seek a negotiated\nsettlement. States and other bodies must join forces\nto maintain peace, stability and security in the world.\nWe cannot be passive witnesses to current or future\ndisasters. The Republic of Madagascar sets particular\nstore by the relevance and importance of the principles\nset forth in the United Nations Charter, as a source\nof inspiration as well as a pillar of support for the\ninterdependence of nations and peoples. That being the\ncase, human rights, the law of States, the rule of law\nand the other international regulatory tools place before\nleaders their responsibilities.\nThe League of Nations defined the rule of law as a\nprinciple of governance based on the submission of all individuals and institutions, including the State, to the\nadopted and published laws, without distinction as to\nsocial or economic status; on the equality of everyone\nbefore an independent, impartial justice system; and on\nthe harmonization of national laws with international\nhuman rights standards. No one should be above the\nlaw, and the culture of impunity must be banished.\nMr. Benmehidi (Algeria), Vice-President, took the\nChair.\nNational conflicts today transcend borders and are\nbecoming international problems. More than ever, the\nrole of diplomacy and international negotiations face\ndifficulties. The consequences of disputes play out in a\nnumber of ways, including with problems of impunity,\ninstability in the Arab and Muslim world, the case of\nSomali piracy, illegal immigrations, persons displaced\nby war, problems regarding the Rom issue, religious\nconfrontations, management of land and sea borders,\nand food insecurity. It is undeniable that much remains\nto be done to save human lives, because still civilian\npopulations remain the primary victims of conflicts\nand disputes throughout the world.\nThe world is in upheaval, and many countries are in\na situation of transition. Their peoples demand change\nand hope for sustainable development. Those countries\nneed to be supported and encouraged, not sanctioned.\nIn that context, allow me to highlight the case of my\nown country, Madagascar.\nMadagascar is a country emerging from crisis,\nthanks to the involvement of the bodies of the Southern\nAfrican Development Community and the support of\nthe African Union, the Indian Ocean Commission and\nthe International Organization of la Francophonie. A\nroad map was signed and adopted by the Malagasy\npolitical parties in September 2011. Thus, several\nsignificant steps have been taken. The Malagasy parties\nhave honoured their commitments. All the transitional\ninstitutions have been set up, including a national unity\nGovernment and the transitional Parliament. The road\nmap, which we can call a political agreement, has\nallowed us to launch the electoral process.\nMadagascar needs to take its destiny into its own\nhands, to write its own history, and to end the cycle of\npolitical instability through the holding of credible and\ntransparent elections, guaranteed by the establishment\nof the Independent National Electoral Commission\nof the Transition. Above all, recently, in concert with\nUnited Nations experts, the electoral timetable for Madagascar was officially announced, including the\nholding of presidential elections scheduled for 8 May\n2013. Thus I launch a solemn appeal to all international\npartners, all Member States and friends of Madagascar\nto support us and encourage us in that approach, which\nis the only and most democratic path forward.\nProfoundly committed to the values of solidarity,\ntolerance and peace, Madagascar is now searching for\nswift development and a better future. During the three\nand a half years of transition and despite all attempts\nat destabilization, we have worked tirelessly every day\nto honour our commitments and ensure the protection\nof our countrymen, all the while addressing social\nproblems. In spite of challenging times, and despite the\nsuspension of international aid and subsidies, which\nonce accounted for 60 per cent of the State budget, we\nhave been able to keep the administration functioning\nnormally and have honoured all our commitments and\ndebts.\nMadagascar is indeed one of the least developed\ncountries. Nevertheless, it is one of the least indebted\ncountries in the world since its debt amounts to only\n5 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP), compared\nto other countries whose debt rate can reach up to\n238 per cent of GDP. Therefore, it is possible to develop\nour country and create our wealth through our own\nresources. That is the challenge that we are meeting.\nNow it is high time to embark on in-depth reform\nto create an effective system that meets the highest\nexpectations of our respective populations \u2014 not\nforgetting, obviously, the need to double or even triple\nour commitments to fighting poverty and promoting\nsustainable development. Here today, I launch an appeal\nfor international solidarity to channel the transition\ntowards the building of a more promising future \u2014 but\nwithout stif ling us.\nThe Malagasy people need their full and entire\nindependence, but above all they must be able to\nhold transparent and therefore democratic elections.\nI know that everyone here is sincerely willing to lend\nus support. So allow me to give the Assembly the\nsolution. The best way to help us is to trust us, honour\nthe commitments made and let us shoulder our own\nresponsibilities. In the name of universal values and\nprinciples, anyone meeting the conditions of eligibility\ndictated by law is fully entitled to exercise that liberty.\nThat is a fundamental principle, and all States must\nrespect it. The Malagasy people alone \u2014 not other\ncountries or external pressure \u2014 have the sovereign right to decide who should guide their destiny. The\nMalagasy people alone will choose the man or woman\nwho will lead Madagascar.\nIf confidence is shown in the Malagasy people, they\nwill be grateful. The concepts of non-interference and\nrespect for the sovereignty of each country establish\nmutual trust, which is a basic rule for all international\nnegotiations. They are among the peaceful means\nneeded to build lasting peace. Efforts must be made\nto put an end to the inequalities in how countries in\npolitical crisis are treated. The realities on the ground\nand popular aspirations must be acknowledged in order\nto avoid making the wrong decision.\nDespite our disagreements and our differences on\nhow to achieve a peaceful settlement of our conflicts,\nwe the States Members of the United Nations are\nunanimous in our firm desire for peace. The United\nNations system cannot just be the police of the world;\nit also needs to be a source of hope and of values. Our\nsocieties need to exist and find their way through\ntheir own values, because it is social and economic\nills, injustice, the lack of protection for vulnerable\npopulations and intolerance for minorities that often\ncause States to collapse.\nAs far as its modest means allow, the Republic of\nMadagascar is determined to contribute to achieving\nour shared goals. The peace accord is fragile and needs\nto develop. To quote Martin Luther King, Jr., \u201cAll\nprogress is precarious, and the solution of one problem\nbrings us face to face with another problem\u201d. It is our\nduty and responsibility to provide a better future for the\ngenerations to come. Global stability requires tolerance,\nassistance, the creation and equitable sharing of wealth,\nand poverty reduction through sustainable development\nand reconciliation. The principles of adjustment or\nsettlement of international disputes by peaceful means\nrequires a return to our values, gender balance and\nequality, and, above all, democratic alternation. God\nbless our nation!"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt is an honour once again\nto address the United Nations. This year I would\nlike to focus on responsibility. The recent years of\neconomic and financial turbulence have demonstrated\na strong correlation between economic prudence and\nresponsibility in fiscal matters. We have realized, I\nhope, that sustainability is not a term we apply only\nto development, but concerns all of us. Responsibility\nand sustainability apply to the three broad topics I shall\naddress today: human rights, good governance and\ndevelopment. But before doing so, I would like to speak\nabout diplomacy.\nThe purpose of diplomacy is to prevent war.\nWhen diplomats are attacked we are all less secure.\nWe know what we are talking about \u2014 we too have\nhad our diplomats attacked, mercifully without the\nhorrific consequences that occured in Benghazi.\nTherefore, the recent assaults in many parts of the\nworld on diplomats, embassies and consular premises are deplorable. Regardless of their motivations, such\nacts are unjustifiable and must be universally and\nunequivocably condemned. All countries must fulfil\ntheir international legal obligation to protect diplomatic\nand consular properties and personnel.\nAs recent events have demonstrated, when it\ncomes to human rights it is not enough merely to keep\nyour own house in order. As a conscientious member\nof the international community, Estonia feels the\nresponsibility to do more globally. That includes paying\nattention to human rights violations in places torn by\nconflict, as well as doing more to stop and prevent the\nviolation of the rights of women and the child. It also\nmeans making the most of new technologies in the\nservice of fundamental rights and freedoms. The need\nto take responsibility and do more is also why Estonia\nlooks forward to becoming a member of the Human\nRights Council and to working proactively towards the\nfulfilment of its mandate.\nPermit me to touch upon the developments in\nSyria. We have witnessed the complete breakdown of\nany semblance of the rule of law. We continue to see\nextensive human rights and international humanitarian\nlaw abuses. It appears that both sides have committed\nserious international crimes. Yet we still see no solution.\nWe cannot look on and wait for the violence to spread\neven more widely. The Security Council \u2014 especially\nits permanent members \u2014 must overcome their\ndifferences and find a solution to the bloodshed. The\nleast that all parties must do is to allow for humanitarian\naid to be safely delivered and to guarantee the security\nof humanitarian workers. Without an end to the armed\nconflict, without peace, there can be no political\nprocess.\nBut it is not only Syria that needs our attention.\nWe should not avoid the problem of protracted conflicts\nthat have already waited for years to be solved. We\nshall speak with one voice against continuing violations\nof the territorial integrity of sovereign States and for\nthe secure return of all forcefully displaced persons.\nMoreover, more attention to conflict prevention would\nhelp to avoid such violations in the future.\nA stronger commitment to conflict prevention and\nto the enhancement of the rule of law can help to avoid\nviolent conflicts and the most heinous international\ncrimes. Under the principle of the responsibility to\nprotect, States committed in 2005 to protect their\npeople from ethnic cleansing, genocide, war crimes\nand crimes against humanity. Today the content of the responsibility to protect is not debated. The difficulty,\nhowever, lies with its application: when Governments\ndo not live up to their responsibility, the international\ncommunity must react and act.\nThe international criminal justice system,\nespecially the International Criminal Court, plays a\ncrucial role in providing timely and decisive responses\nto such crimes. Investigations by the Court may deter\nfurther atrocities, prevent their escalation or accelerate\ntheir end. It is therefore essential to cooperate with the\nCourt and apprehend those it has indicted.\nAs a result of the evolving nature of military\nconflicts, civilian casualties tragically are on the\nrise. Among civilians, women and children are the\nmost vulnerable. When we take that into account,\nSecurity Council resolution 1325 (2000), on women,\npeace and security, takes on a whole new immediacy.\nFurthermore, conflict-related sexual violence requires\nmore attention. Such violence can easily lead to further\nwar crimes and crimes against humanity. Moreover,\nin advancing the rights of the child, the International\nCriminal Court\u2019s recent decision to convict Thomas\nLubanga Dyilo was a significant achievement and will,\nwe hope, have a strong deterrent effect in the future to\nprevent crimes against children.\nThe Crimean War, in the 1850s, brought the world\nthe first extensive photographic reports of conflicts.\nToday, new media make it even more difficult to hide\nwar crimes both on and off the battlefield. Modern\ntechnology brings home the reality and horror of war.\nWe must therefore recognize the important role of\ntechnology in advancing human rights.\nFreedom of expression is a human right, whether in\nthe city square, the press or in cyberspace. For the third\nyear in a row, Freedom House has ranked Estonia first\nin the world in Internet freedom. We have joined the\ncoalition Freedom Online, a group of States working\nclosely together to advance human rights online. In\naddition, Estonia looks forward to discussing actively\nmatters relating to Internet freedom in the Human\nRights Council, which adopted a resolution on that\ntopic this year (resolution 20/8). The resolution was a\ngenuine milestone affirming that fundamental rights\nin the virtual world must be protected with the same\ncommitment as in the real world.\nInternationally, there are worrisome developments\nrelated to Internet governance. Too many countries\nspeak about the dangers of a free Internet from a security perspective. The truth is, as we know well,\nthat cybersecurity is needed to prevent oppressive\nGovernments and criminals from wreaking havoc. It is\nnot to prevent peaceful individuals from speaking their\nminds or gathering information and exchanging ideas.\nDespite having experienced extensive cyber attacks\nduring the so-called Web War One, five years ago, Estonia\ndoes not support more rigid regulation and censorship\nin cyberspace. Estonia is committed to an open, secure\nand reliable Internet. It is therefore imperative to ensure\nthat the International Telecommunication Union\u2019s new\nregulation does not lead to the restriction of Internet\nfreedom and unnecessary limits to the free f low of ideas\nand information. In fighting cybercrimes, the Budapest\nConvention on Cybercrime provides the appropriate\nand primary legal framework at the global level.\nGlobally, there is a deficit of good and responsible\ngovernance. Its lack is the root cause of countless\nother ills. But again, some progress has been made.\nI was proud to represent Estonia when I signed on\nto the Open Government Partnership, along with\nrepresentatives of 42 other countries. That multilateral\ninitiative aims to take concrete steps to institute a new\nmodel of governance to maximize the potential of new\ntechnologies and, most important, to tackle corruption.\nThe information revolution we experience these\ndays has assisted Estonia to successfully and rapidly\ntransform itself into a rule-of-law-based democratic\nsociety. Estonia was the first country where people\ncould cast their vote online in parliamentary and\nmunicipal elections. Just a few months ago we\nconducted our census for the first time to a large extent\nonline. This year more than 90 per cent of taxpayers in\nEstonia filed annual income tax returns via the Internet.\nE-government, e-school, e-medical prescriptions\nand e-parking are examples of Estonian innovation\nin the field of citizen-friendly public services. They\nincrease transparency and help to prevent and cut\ndown corruption. They reduce costs. Most importantly,\nhowever, they have increased the possibility to exercise\nfundamental rights and freedoms and improve inclusive\nand responsible governance. Therefore, Estonia wishes\nto share its e-governance skills and to continue to\nfacilitate exchanges with partners worldwide.\nMy comments on the need to do more apply to the\nUnited Nations too. Without reform, its global mission\nwill be unsustainable. We need change, ranging from\nreforming the United Nations in the broadest sense to\ncutting the waste of paper. In an information age it is increasingly necessary to distinguish noise from signal,\nto distinguish genuine data from spin.\nI have spoken thus far about what Governments\ncan and must do. In our increasingly interconnected,\nwired and wireless world, civil society and the private\nsector play an ever-greater role. Governments benefit\nfrom involving non-governmental organizations,\nentrepreneurs and private individuals in governance.\nEstonia and many other countries increasingly and\nsuccessfully do so. The challenge, however, is for the\nUnited Nations system \u2014 a multilateral organization\nbased on modern, post-Westphalian States \u2014 to embrace\nthose other actors and to involve them in finding\nsolutions and decision-making.\nAllow me to continue by sharing some thoughts\nrelated to development and responsibility.\nSustainable development is not a clich\u00e9d utopia;\nnor is it something forced on us from above. True\ndevelopment can be nothing other than sustainable. Yet\nwe have seen unsustainability masked as development,\ndespite the contradiction in terms.\nConsider the global financial crisis. Burdening our\nchildren and grandchildren with mountains of debt is\nimmoral, as is living at the expense of others. Growth\nwithout responsibility is illusory. We have learned that\nthe hard way. Let us not make the same mistake again.\nWe are another year closer to the deadline we set\nourselves for achieving the Millennium Development\nGoals (MDGs). Were they too ambitious? I do not think\nso. Aiming high is the least we can do. There is no point\nin setting targets that we can be confident of achieving\neffortlessly. Yet we must resist the temptation to sell\neverything as a success if that is not the case. Failure to\nachieve all the MDGs is no excuse not to set new targets.\nThe world needs sustainable development goals. We are\nstill in a preliminary phase of the discussion. Let us aim\nhigh and do our best.\nDespite the world\u2019s best efforts, millions\nremain in poverty. The information technology (IT)\ntransformation will create massive opportunities all\nover the world. We must, however, avoid a digital\ndivide that would stymie this historic chance to\naccelerate development in all parts of the world. I was a\nmember of Kofi Annan\u2019s high-level panel of experts on\ninformation and communication technology \u2014 already\na decade ago \u2014 and I continue to be concerned about\nthe gap between the digital haves and have-nots,\nespecially because, by investing in IT, countries such as mine have leapt into modernity and transparency. New\ninformation and communications technologies have the\npotential to trigger the next industrial revolution, but\ngovernments cannot achieve it alone.\nEntrepreneurs expanding the range of global\nknowledge networks are key partners in fighting\npoverty and creating a more transparent economy.\nThey can also make an outsized difference in their\ncommunities and the world. However, Governments\nmust provide a secure and fruitful environment for\nthose sorts of ideas to emerge and prosper. Twentyone\nyears after restoring our independence, Estonia is\nan example where a combination of responsible free\nenterprise, e-governance, international partnerships\nand eco-friendly policies can put a country in the fast\nlane of development.\nExperience shows that if we fail to act responsibly,\nwe will, in the end, be forced to do so. Let us begin by\nacting responsibly."

        "file_text": "\ufeffI would\nlike to begin by extending my warmest congratulations\nto the President on his election to the presidency of\nthe General Assembly at its sixty-seventh session.\nI have no doubt that his skills and long experience\nin international matters are the best guarantee of the\nsuccess for our work during this session. I also wish\nto express my strong gratitude to his predecessor, His\nExcellency Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser, for his\nexcellent guidance of our work and for the efficiency\nhe showed during difficult moments throughout the\nsixty-sixth session. I wish him every success in his new\nresponsibilities.\nThe global economic and financial context remains\nmore troubling than ever. The successive and increasing\neconomic and financial crises that began in 2008 affect\nus all. Both developed and developing countries face\nan uncertain environment, with economies slowed if\nnot in recession, sluggish growth, crushing debts and\ndeficits that threaten certain States with bankruptcy, as\nwell as growing unemployment rates. In such a context,\ndeveloping nations, in particular the least advanced, are\nseverely impacted economically as well as socially. The\nnegative consequences for achieving the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) have been enormous. In\nmany African countries, reaching those Goals by 2015\nis jeopardized despite the fact that they have spared no\neffort to step up implementation before the deadline.\nIt is in times of difficulty that we must show\nresponsibility and solidarity by honouring our respective\ncommitments. It is therefore important that the fate of\nthe least advanced African countries be examined with\nparticular attention with a view to helping them lighten\ntheir burden, improve their productive capabilities and\nfacilitate access for their products to world markets\nunder more favourable conditions. My Government calls\nfor the comprehensive implementation of the Istanbul\nProgramme of Action for the Least Developed Countries\nfor the Decade 2011-2020 (A/CONF.219/3/Rev.1).\nThe current financial and economic crises have\nmultidimensional consequences in Africa; any effort\nto resolve them must take into account Africa\u2019s\nspecific needs and must ensure that commitments\nmade at international meetings are implemented. I\ntake this opportunity to welcome the establishment of a United Nations monitoring mechanism to review the\ncommitments made related to Africa\u2019s development.\nThe United Nations Conference on Sustainable\nDevelopment (Rio+20) in June was an opportunity\nfor all Governments to renew their commitment to a\nsustainable development that embraces the economic,\nsocial and environmental spheres. It is important that our\nshared political will be swiftly transformed into action\nand that the work we put into the Rio commitments for\n\u201cThe future we want\u201d becomes a reality.\nThe elimination of poverty remains an absolute\npriority on the path to sustainable development. It is\na major challenge for many countries of the world,\nincluding those of the Horn of Africa. Our region is\nsuffering enormously from the adverse effects of climate\nchange, and has been for a number of years. Trapped\nin the cycle of chronic droughts and f loods, our most\nvulnerable people are seeing their means of subsistence\ndestroyed and their productive capacity and access to\nsufficient, nutritious food hampered. Our Government\nhas implemented social policies designed to relieve the\nburden of extreme poverty and its corollary, hunger, and\nhopes its partners will continue their support by acting\nin accord with the national priorities, within a long-term\napproach that will enable us to move from emergency\noperations geared to the relief of affected populations\nto a perspective of sustainable development.\nThat means, from the emergency stage onward, a\ncomprehensive global approach accompanied by efforts\nto guarantee women, children and men the right to\nfood. Guaranteeing food security to our fellow citizens\nremains our priority. I am convinced that the goals\nof the Secretary-General\u2019s Zero Hunger initiative are\nachievable, because they have been developed within\nthe perspective of an integrated, effective strategy to\neliminate hunger that involves all actors.\nI wish to acknowledge the support of our partners,\nwho have spared no effort to help us reach that goal,\nespecially in the efforts to reduce the disparities\nbetween rural and urban populations and to develop our\nagricultural production. In that regard, my country has\nimplemented a number of agricultural infrastructure\nprojects, including the development of arable land in\nneighbouring countries such as Ethiopia and the Sudan\nand a project to capture the water of the Awash River on\nthe Ethiopian border when it f loods.\nAccess to potable water and water purification\ncontinue to be a critical goal for my country, which is unfortunately on the list of those deficient in potable\nwater and which is considered a country at risk of water\nshortages in the next 25 years. For most countries in\nour situation, the effects of climate change accentuate\nexisting disparities.\nSustainable development must take an approach\nfocused on meeting the needs of populations. Women,\nchildren and young people should be the target of\nany implementation policy derived from the Rio+20\noutcome document (resolution 66/288, annex) and of\nall discussions geared to formulating the post-2015\ndevelopment agenda. Human capital is my country\u2019s\nmain asset, and that is why my Government devotes\nparticular attention to its development. Social policies\nare being developed around the goal of promoting and\nenhancing the rights and well-being of young people\nand women. It is a national priority to guarantee\ngender equality and to empower women through access\nto health care and protect them from all forms of\ndiscrimination and violence. My Government therefore\nwelcomes the African Union initiative recommending\nthat at its sixty-seventh session the Assembly adopt\na draft resolution aimed at intensifying efforts to\neliminate female genital mutilation from the world.\nWe welcome the measures undertaken by the African\nGroup in New York to that effect.\nYouth, which is our future, constitutes a sure asset\nfor the African continent. Indeed, almost 65 per cent\nof the African population is under the age of 35. It\ngoes without saying that addressing their present and\nensuring their social well-being is the way to success\nfor our country. The challenges are enormous given\nthe global economic stagnation. My Government has\ntherefore set up social policies and programmes in\norder to respond to the specific needs of young people\nin the areas of education, health care and employment.\nOn behalf of the Republic of Djibouti, I would like\nto reiterate my warmest congratulations to the new\nPresident of the Somali Republic, Mr. Hassan Sheikh\nMohamud, and to his people on having taken the first\nstep towards the reconciliation and stabilization of\nSomalia and on having found the necessary resources\nto overcome all obstacles on the way. The civil and\npeaceful climate among the candidates at the time of the\nelection and the maturity that they showed throughout\nan historic and inclusive electoral process must be\ncommended. Those realities are the best guarantee of\nsuccess for the future. The hope of seeing a reconciled\nand peaceful Somalia is in sight. A new phase in the country\u2019s political life is\nbeginning for the Somali people after more than\n20 years of suffering and violence. The momentum\nand enthusiasm prompted by those elections among\nSomalis in the diaspora and within the country are\nunprecedented. However, at this point it is crucial to\naddress two major challenges. The short-term priorities,\nnamely, security, good governance and economic\nrecovery, are challenges that the Somali Government\ncannot overcome alone.\nSomalia is at a crossroads and will need more than\never the support and cooperation of all its partners\nand friends. Donors and the international financial\ninstitutions must stand beside the new Somali leadership\nin order to help fulfil its new vision and to improve\nthe lives of Somalis as soon as possible. Their action\nmust be strengthened, coordinated and consistent with\nthe priorities of the new Government as there are many\nchallenges to overcome. Those challenges range from\nrestoring the security services to access to justice and\nfrom establishing the rule of law to respect for human\nrights, not to mention the problems of terrorism and\npiracy off the Somali coast, which will not disappear\nin the short term.\nIn short, it is clear that the end of the transition\nin Somalia does not mean the completion of the peace\nprocess. Politically, it is important that all phases of\nthe road map be implemented and that the political\ndialogue continue. From the humanitarian point of\nview, the situation remains critical. Millions of Somalis\nneed humanitarian assistance and have no means of\nsubsistence. The problem of refugees and internally\ndisplaced persons also remains a source of concern.\nRestoring security and maintaining it is not the\neasiest thing in Somalia giving the new upsurge in\nthe terrorist acts and guerrilla tactics of extremist\ngroups, such as Al-Shabaab, despite the undeniable\nsuccess of the troops of the African Union Mission in\nSomalia (AMISOM) and of the Somali and Ethiopian\nsecurity forces.\nI would like to pay tribute here to the memory of the\nlate Meles Zenawi, former Prime Minister of Ethiopia,\nwho made peace his centrepiece. I would also like to\nexpress admiration for the tireless efforts and heavy\nsacrifices of the AMISOM troops, the Somali Security\nForces and the allied forces. Their contribution was and\nremains invaluable to improving the security situation in\nMogadishu and the surrounding areas. The international\ncommunity must ensure the continued, predictable and reliable financing of the AMISOM troops so that the\nreconciliation, stabilization and peacebuilding strategy\ncontinues and reaches all Somalia.\nIn that regard, strengthening the security gains\nis crucial. The countries in the region \u2014 Uganda,\nBurundi, Ethiopia, Kenya and Djibouti \u2014 have done\nuseful work and continue to serve the noble cause of\npeace. However, the transformation of the AMISOM\nforces into a United Nations peacekeeping force now\nseems inevitable. We can no longer avoid that issue. It is\nup to the Security Council to take that timely decision.\nI would also like to launch an appeal for the\nconvening of a donor conference in order to mobilize\nresources for the reconstruction of the Somali economy.\nI am convinced that we are all aware of the necessity\nof meeting the individual recovery, reintegration and\nreconstruction needs of countries emerging from\nconflict. Somalia is no exception. Here at the United\nNations, we must consider the steps to be taken, in\nparticular by the Peacebuilding Commission.\nThe theme of the General Assembly this\nyear \u2014 \u201cBringing about adjustment or settlement\nof international disputes or situations by peaceful\nmeans\u201d \u2014 is relevant given the many conflicts in the\nworld that threaten international peace and security.\nOur region, the Horn of Africa, has unfortunately not\nbeen spared. As members know, my country, which\nhad successfully preserved the peace, was attacked and\nbrought into a border conflict by Eritrea in June 2008.\nSince then, the Government has spared no effort\nto resolve the dispute peacefully within regional and\ninternational organizations. In the conviction that\ndialogue is possible, my Government accepted the\ngood offices of His Royal Highness the Emir of Qatar\nand his mediation. On the ground, that took the form\nof deploying Qatari troops at the border between\nDjibouti and Eritrea and the withdrawal of Eritrean\ntroops from Ras Doumeira and Doumeira Island. The\nSecurity Council adopted resolutions 1862 (2009), 1907\n(2009) and 2023 (2011) to express the concern of the\ninternational community in the light of that new crisis\nin the Horn of Africa.\nTo date, two and a half years after the signing\nof the mediation agreement, we are still waiting for\nthe demarcation of the border and the return of our\nprisoners of war. The request for the release of the\nDjibouti prisoners and the implementation of resolution\n1862 (2009) remain sensitive issues for my country. My Government remains convinced that mediation\nis the path that will enable us to achieve peace. We will\nnever stop believing in the virtues of dialogue, which\nis the only way for our region to strengthen the gains\nof peace.\nThe events that have taken place in the world\nin recent weeks following the dissemination of an\nanti-Islam film and of caricatures denigrating the\nimage of the Prophet of Islam cannot and must not leave\nthe international community indifferent. The tragic\nconsequences that led in particular to the loss of human\nlives demand our attention. Political and religious\nleaders and all people of goodwill must form a common\nfront against extremist and fanatical excesses of all\nkinds. Given the desire of some to spread religious\nintolerance, States Members of the United Nations must\nensure that the provisions of the Human Rights Council\nconsensus resolution 16/18 and General Assembly\nconsensus resolution 66/167 provide the answer.\nWhile all legal steps must be taken to ensure freedom\nof expression, it is just as important that malicious acts\nthat incite people to religious hatred, discrimination,\nviolence and intimidation through negative stereotypes,\nas well as violence and discrimination on the basis of\nreligion, in particular against Muslims or any other\ngroup, must be condemned and rejected, in accordance\nwith the relevant human rights instruments.\nGiven their increasing role in our modern societies,\nthe media and social networks have responsibilities\nand must be on the side of those who contribute to\nunderstanding and respect among the various cultures\nand civilizations. It is more urgent than ever to be\non the side of tolerance, moderation and reason. All\ninitiatives and actions that promote peace in minds and\nhearts and mutual understanding among peoples must\nbe encouraged.\nThe establishment of the United Nations gave rise\nto immense hope in the world following the Second\nWorld War and symbolized the will of all peoples of\nthe world not to be plunged again into the throes of\nwar. The Organization has been a forum for all nations\nunder colonization and a platform for them to acquire\nsovereignty and to free themselves from domination.\nHowever, it seems that, since 1947, there has\nbeen an exception, to the detriment of the Palestinian\npeople. Palestine still lives under occupation,\nwhich today is morally reprehensible and politically\nunacceptable. It is high time that justice be delivered to the Palestinian people and that the peace process\nbetween the Palestinian authorities and the occupying\nforce succeed. Freedom, justice, dignity and respect for\nhuman rights are the only bastions against extremist\nexcesses. The international community has a moral\nduty and a political responsibility to put an end to the\nsuffering of the Palestinian people, which has lasted for\nmore than 60 years.\nHistory is on the side of those that show the\npolitical courage required to achieve peace and to\ngive the peoples concerned hope for a better life. The\nrecognition of a Palestinian State as a fully-fledged\nMember of the United Nations by the General Assembly\nis the first step in the solidarity that the international\ncommunity owes to the Palestinian people, who have\nshown patience and self lessness until now."

        "file_text": "\ufeffFor over a year and a half, the situation in the\nMiddle East and North Africa has been the nerve centre\nof global politics. The deep changes that have swept\nover the region intertwine with the key problems of\nmodern international relations and require everyone to\ntake a comprehensive approach and to reject simplistic\nand ideology-driven patterns and double standards.\nRussia has consistently supported peoples in their\naspiration to determine their destiny and to pave the\nway to more effective models of public governance.\nWe believe it is particularly important to carry out\nthose transformations in a non-violent way and without\noutside interference. We strongly believe that all\nmembers of the international community should be\ninterested in making the Middle East-North Africa\nregion peaceful, stable, democratic and free from\ndomestic and inter-State conflicts. So far, however,\nthere has been no progress in reaching unanimity in\nthe efforts of outside players to create conditions for\nachieving that goal.\nOf particular concern is the deepening internal\nconflict in Syria. We have consistently called for\nconsolidated efforts by the international community\nto compel the Government and its opponents to\nimmediately cease the violence, come to the negotiating\ntable and work out a compromise on the content and\npace of reforms that would satisfy all Syrians and\nensure the safety and rights of all ethnic and religious\ngroups. That was the substance of the consensus\nrecorded in the final communiqu\u00e9 of the Action Group\nfor Syria (S/2012/523, annex), agreed upon in Geneva\nas a follow-up to the Kofi Annan plan.\nWe call upon all members of the Action Group\nto fully abide by the commitments we all took on in\nGeneva. That is the fastest way to stop the loss of human\nlife in Syria. We proposed a Security Council resolution\nendorsing the Geneva communiqu\u00e9 as the basis for\nnegotiations at the beginning of the transitional period, but that proposal was blocked. Those who oppose the\nimplementation of the Geneva communiqu\u00e9 bear an\nonerous responsibility. They insist on a ceasefire by\nthe Government alone and encourage the opposition\nto intensify hostilities, in fact pushing Syria even\ndeeper into the abyss of bloody internecine strife. The\nmilitarization of the conflict continues, with calls for\nopen intervention.\nExtremist organizations including Al-Qaida\nhave become more active in Syria. They perpetrate\nterrorist attacks against innocent civilians and civil\ninfrastructure. The number of war crimes is growing, on\nthe part of both Government forces and the opposition,\nas recorded in the recent report of the Human Rights\nCouncil\u2019s commission of inquiry (A/HRC/21/50).\nRussia resolutely condemns any violence, wherever\nit comes from, and is convinced that there is still an\nopportunity to undertake collective action. Practical\nsteps to overcome the crisis need to begin with a\ncomprehensive ceasefire, the release of prisoners and\nhostages and the provision of additional humanitarian\naid. That would create the conditions to start an\ninter-Syrian dialogue. We hope that Lakhdar Brahimi,\nJoint Special Representative of the United Nations and\nthe League of Arab States, will be able to bring his vast\nexperience to bear on moving towards an agreement on\nsuch arrangements, with the support of the international\ncommunity. Russia will provide its full support to\npromote the success of his mission.\nThe changes taking place in the Middle East\nshould not marginalize the Palestinian problem. The\nachievement of a comprehensive, just and lasting Arab-\nIsraeli settlement, which should lead, among other\nresults, to the establishment of an independent, viable\nand contiguous Palestinian State, coexisting in peace\nand security with Israel, would be a major contribution\nto the normalization of the overall regional situation.\nThe Arab Peace Initiative fully retains its relevance,\nand we support the efforts of the League of Arab States\nto move it forward.\nI also wish to stress the importance of implementing\nthe decision on convening in 2012 a conference on\nestablishing in the Middle East a zone free of weapons\nof mass destruction and their means of delivery (see\nNPT/CONF/2010/50 (Vol.I)). It is clearly necessary to\nensure the participation in the conference of all States in\nthe region, and they should agree on key arrangements among themselves. In that matter, the League of Arab\nStates should play an important role.\nOn the whole, we support closer ties between the\nUnited Nations and regional entities. I would note\nthat in our part of the world today a memorandum on\ncooperation was signed between the secretariat of the\nCollective Security Treaty Organization and the United\nNations Department of Peacekeeping Operations. I am\nconvinced that it will increase the efficiency of common\nefforts to ensure stability and security.\nAll our actions should be founded solidly on the\nUnited Nations Charter, which makes no provision\nfor the right to change regimes. It is unacceptable to\nimpose a political system on a country and its people.\nOur position was clearly stated by President Vladimir\nPutin speaking at the Kremlin on 26 September. The\nentire sequence of events in the Arab world and other\nregions proves the futility of any such policy, which can\nlead to dangerous interethnic and interreligious clashes\nin international relations.\nWe believe it is an obligation of all States to protect\nfrom provocations and blasphemy the religious feelings\nof people of any religious affiliation. At the same\ntime, of course, there can be no justification for acts\nof terror, regardless of where they are committed, be\nthey in Libya, Syria, Iraq, Yemen or anywhere else.\nAttacks against diplomats or United Nations personnel\nare absolutely unacceptable.\nIn general, we are convinced that today, when the\nworld is going through a transition period characterized\nby instability in the spheres of the economy, politics and\ninter-civilizational relations, it is particularly important\nfor United Nations Member States to be able to rely\non accepted rules of conduct and to agree on a joint\nresponse to the threats to global stability. We should\nnot allow irresponsible actions dictated by expedient\ninterests to shatter the system of international law. The\nworld order is threatened by arbitrary interpretation\nof such essential principles as the non-use or threat of\nforce, the peaceful settlement of disputes, respect for\nthe sovereignty and territorial integrity of States and\nnon-interference in their domestic affairs.\nThose are the key principles of the United Nations\nCharter, which confers the primary responsibility for\nthe maintenance of international peace and security on\nthe Security Council. In advancing the reform of the\nUnited Nations, it is essential to preserve the capacity of\nthe Security Council to perform those functions. Their erosion would deprive the international community of\nan essential mechanism for developing joint approaches\nto the settlement of crisis situations.\nIt is appropriate to mention the compulsory\ninstruments at the disposal of the United Nations. Under\nthe United Nations Charter the imposition of sanctions\nfalls exclusively under the jurisdiction of the Security\nCouncil. Decisions must be made on a collegial basis,\nwith the understanding that sanctions should not lead\nto isolation of the State targeted for sanctions, but\nrather encourage it to engage in a dialogue to remove\nquestions that the Member States may have. It is\nessential that sanctions should be well-measured and\nthat they not cause any suffering to the population. In\nthe past the Security Council has discussed the issue of\nthe humanitarian limits of sanctions, but somehow the\ndiscussions have faded away. We believe it is important\nto resume them.\nAnother issue that needs to be discussed in the\nSecurity Council is the consequences of unilateral\nsanctions imposed by a State or a group of States\nsidestepping the United Nations to advance their\npolitical goals. We have no doubt that such sanctions,\nespecially when they are applied extraterritorially,\nweaken the unity of the international community\nand undermine the effectiveness of its efforts. For\nmany years, the commercial, economic and financial\nrestrictions imposed by the United States on Cuba\nhave remained an illustration of the negative impact\nof unilateral sanctions. Russia, together with the\noverwhelming majority of members of the international\ncommunity, calls for the swift lifting of the blockade,\nwhich is a relic of the Cold War.\nSpecial attention should be given to the practical\nenforcement of Security Council decisions regarding\nsanctions against non-State actors and illegal cross-\nborder formations. In general, the events of recent\nyears have clearly shown that unilateral action which\nviolates international law and circumvents or distorts\nthe decisions of the Security Council does no good.\nOf course, the legal norms of international affairs\nwill be further adjusted as necessary. But these\ntransformations should be treated with the greatest\nsense of responsibility and full consciousness of the\nserious risks involved. Consensus should be the sole\nroute to their adoption. Violations of international\nlaw should not be portrayed as some sort of creative\ndevelopment.\n\nAll of this is related to the debate regarding the\nconcept of the so-called responsibility to protect. Further\ndiscussion of this concept should be held on the basis\nof the approach agreed on at the 2005 World Summit,\nwhich reaffirmed the need to observe the principles of\nthe Charter of the United Nations when responding to\nconflicts within States. The protection of civilians is an\nissue far too serious to be exploited to achieve political\ngoals. The ambiguity of the so-called responsibility-\nto-protect concept can be better understood in light of\ninitiatives formulated by Brazil and several other States\nto move towards consensus.\nLet us not forget that the founders of the United\nNations, in their wisdom, agreed upon and endorsed\na Charter that enshrined principles for the regulation\nof a multipolar world order. Now that the abnormal\nbipolar period of the Cold War is over, and now that\nit has become clear to all that there is no place for\nmonopolarity in the modern world and international\naffairs can only be polycentric, we have a unique\nchance to fully implement the original potential of that\nCharter.\nThis is a difficult challenge. International relations\nare clearly experiencing a lack of credibility. We regard\nthis as the main obstacle to practical progress towards\nthe establishment of universal foundations for equal\nand indivisible security, whether in the Euro-Atlantic\narea, Asia-Pacific region or other parts of the world.\nSuch a state of affairs clearly contradicts the concept\nof collective security embodied in the Charter and the\ndeep interdependence of the modern world, where most\nchallenges and threats are common to us all and have a\ncross-border dimension.\nStrengthening confidence and collective principles\nin international affairs, with the emphasis on\nnegotiating the pursuit of compromise solutions, would\nhelp substantially reduce the level of instability and\nmove forward in the settlement of crisis situations, not\nonly in the Middle East, but also with respect to Iran,\nAfghanistan, the Korean peninsula and other situations\nthroughout the world.\nThe final goal of the efforts to settle a conflict is\nto ensure the right to life and other fundamental human\nrights, be they political, economic or social. The events\nof recent years confirm that, without lasting peace and\nsustainable development, it is impossible to ensure\nhuman rights. In turn, the protection of human rights\nshould contribute to security and development, rather than serve as a pretext for illegal interference in the\ndomestic affairs of States.\nThe Universal Declaration of Human Rights states\nthat everyone is entitled to an international order in\nwhich their rights can be fully realized. Those who use\nmilitary force and sanctions, bypassing the Charter,\nengage in illicit supplies of arms, or provide cover for\nterrorists grossly violate this right.\nRussia stands for the implementation of the\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights and respect for\nthe traditional values on which human civilization is\nbased and where all world religions converge. This is\na moral foundation of modern society. It is the cement\nthat bonds together nations and peoples. In recent\nyears, these values have been put to the test by displays\nof immorality, extremism and racial intolerance. Of\nsimilar concern are the even more assertive actions\nof those who, citing freedom of speech, condone the\nglorification of the Nazis and their accomplices and\ndesecrate the memory of the victims of the Second\nWorld War and the victors of fascism. Such actions are\nincompatible with the obligations of States under the\nCharter of the United Nations.\nLet me recall that the International Covenant\non Civil and Political Rights directly prohibits the\npropaganda of war and incitement of national and\nreligious discord. This means that freedom of speech\nand assembly cannot be used to justify the promotion\nof Nazi or other radical or extremist views, in violation\nof the basic principles and norms of international law.\nYesterday, the Human Rights Council endorsed a\nresolution proposed by Russia on the interrelation of\nhuman rights and traditional values. It is regrettable\nthat a number of Western States voted against this\ndocument, which is especially relevant today.\nProgress towards genuine partnership in\ninternational relations is possible only on the basis\nof equality and mutual respect. The course of events\nin the world leaves no alternative for anyone but to\njoin efforts in order to build a stable, equitable and\ndemocratic international system. It would be possible\nto resist this objective trend and try to preserve the old\norder for some time, but such resistance would cost yet\nmore lives, suffering and destruction. Let us display\nour vision and, instead of looking back at the history of\nprevious centuries, take the side of the events unfolding\nbefore us today, and answer the call for strong collective\nstatesmanship."

        "file_text": "\ufeffYour presidency of the\nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-seventh session, Sir, is\na great honour for Serbia. In congratulating you on\nthe appointment to that post, I express my belief that\nyou will discharge such responsible duties with full\n\ncommitment to respect for the values and principles\nenshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. I am\nsure that you, Mr. President, will rise to the tasks\nentrusted to you by all Member States that supported\nyour appointment.\nThe Republic of Serbia pays particular attention\nto strengthening cooperation within the framework of\nthe United Nations. The Charter of the United Nations,\nwhich unites us, its purposes and principles and the\ninternational system based on it are the only foundation\nfor the development of international relations, the\npromotion of human rights and the maintenance of peace\nand security. Those purposes cannot become obsolete.\nThey must always remain current, and therefore require\nthat we be resolute in our goal to join forces and efforts\nin order to ensure a brighter and safer future for all\nhumanity.\nThe world in which we live and the changes brought\nabout by development in many areas on a daily basis\nmake it incumbent upon us to change together and to\nface the numerous challenges that none of us can deal\nwith individually. For that reason, we must always\nbear in mind the responsibilities vested in us as the\nrepresentatives of our countries and the consequences\nof the decisions that we take.\nThe challenges facing the world have been further\nexacerbated by the continuing global crisis having\nlonger lasting consequences than expected. Today,\nmore than ever before, we need cooperation and\nunderstanding in order to overcome problems and to\nachieve the Millennium Development Goals.\nWe have no choice but to get to grips with problems\nand end the recession, which can be measured against\nthe crisis of the 1930s, and to hope that it will not last\nlonger than that calamity. The crisis, from banking\nto the balance of payments, mortgages and debts, is\naffecting all countries without exception. However, by\nfar the greatest burden is borne by the most vulnerable:\npoor countries and countries in transition that have not\neven caused it.\nWe are faced with a serious threat to international\nintegration and to the further definition of national and\nsupranational policies. The problem is not insoluble.\nThe solution lies in greater responsibility, coordinated\ninternational activities and the appropriate correlation\nbetween the actions of countries and their national\ninterests.\nThe growing poverty in many countries and\nthe widening gap between the rich and the poor are\nbecoming increasingly alarming and an unwarranted\nand unacceptable trait of the great scientific and\ntechnological progress of the modern world. In many\ncases, we see sanctions and isolation exacerbating the\nproblem.\nPoverty reduction is one of the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals. In that context, I would like to\npoint out the importance of support for and solidarity\nwith underdeveloped and developing countries. We need\nsolidarity. Be mindful that today, poverty and starvation\nare not only a characteristic of underdeveloped\ncountries. The continuing global economic crisis has\nalso highlighted the issues of poverty and a lack of\nfood and drinking water in some developed and, until\nrecently, wealthy countries. Those phenomena are, at\nthe same time, a real source of serious security risks.\nConsequently, I take this opportunity to call upon the\nrich and powerful countries drawing special benefit\nfrom globalization to direct a part of their wealth\ntowards the economic and social development of\nunderdeveloped countries.\nA more equitable distribution of assets, solidarity\nand support to underdeveloped and developing countries\nshould be jointly agreed upon along, with systematically\nplanned and organized solutions. Such measures would\nfoster implementation of the principles enshrined in\nthe Charter of the United Nations in the real world of\ntoday. An economy based on renewable energy sources,\nenergy efficiency, responsible utilization of resources\nand socially responsible commerce would significantly\ncontribute to reducing poverty and starvation in the\nworld.\nI underline our political commitment to the idea of\nsustainable development and welcome the initiative of\nthe Secretary-General of the United Nations regarding\nrenewable energy sources for all. I hope that it, along\nwith other provisions of the Declaration adopted at\nthe United Nations Conference on Environment and\nDevelopment, will be among the agenda items to which\nthe General Assembly will pay special attention at its\nsixty-seventh session.\nI consider it our joint obligation to preserve planet\nEarth in a way that it deserves. The idea of a better\nworld involves this planet that we will preserve for the\nnext generation. We should understand that the Earth\nshould be treated like a living organism, and we can only hope for the better if we look after it on a daily\nbasis.\nWithin the limits of its possibilities, Serbia will\ncontribute to research into renewable sources of energy,\ndevoting special attention to the education of younger\ngenerations on ways of achieving harmony among\nefforts in planet conservation, development and profit.\nClimate change is one of the problems affecting\nus today that we were not sufficiently aware of in the\npast. In the opinion of many, climate change is the\ndirect consequence of irresponsible behaviour on the\npart of mankind towards nature and the immediate\nenvironment.\nI wish to stress our principled position that it is the\ncollective obligation of all of us to fight the negative\nimpact of climate change through cooperation, tireless\nresearch, the sharing of knowledge and experience and\nby defining and strictly applying measures designed to\nrespond to the new climatic conditions. The survival\nand progress of mankind are the eternal ideals of each\nhuman community, while sustainable development is a\nnecessary precondition to achieving those ideals.\n\nPoverty, famine and limited access to clean water\npose grave threats to human health. Anything is possible\nfor a healthy man, although he may have many problems;\nhowever a sick man has only one problem \u2014 how to\nget healthy. Therefore, I would like to particularly\nemphasize the importance of quality medical care for\nchildren and women, in particular mothers, as well as\nthe importance of the continuing struggle against all\ncommunicable and non-communicable diseases.\n\nWhen it comes to the progress of humanity, the\nimportance of education must not be ignored. I believe\nthat investing in education is the best way to invest in\nfuture development. Furthermore, access to knowledge\nand education should not be the privilege of the chosen,\nbut the standard available to all. Only when a computer\nand book replace a gun in the hands of young people\nwill happier pages of human history be written.\n\nFor several decades, my country has spared no effort\nin contributing, within its capabilities, to multinational\noperations mandated by the United Nations. Thousands\nof Serbian soldiers have been deployed in missions to all\ncontinents. Even today, under new national legislation\nin line with modern defence and security strategies,\nmembers of the Serbian Army and the Serbian police are\ntaking part in the international effort to keep the peace\nfrom the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Liberia\nand C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, to Lebanon, Cyprus and Haiti. Our\nactive participation in the coming period will be even\ngreater and more visible.\nDespite the great efforts made by nearly all\ncountries, terrorism continues to pose a threat to\ninternational stability. That phenomenon is not only\ncharacterized by sporadic attacks, but today represents\na danger to the core values of the United Nations and\na threat to international peace, security and the rule of\nlaw.\nTerrorism is an attack against fundamental human\nrights, including the right to life and individual civil,\npolitical, economic, social and cultural rights. In\naddition, it undermines the development of countries in\nevery sense of the word. Given the fact that all countries\nare vulnerable to various manifestations of terrorism,\nonly by joining forces will we be able to fight that evil.\nSerbia has aligned its legislation regulating\nits security sector with the relevant international\ninstruments. Through regional cooperation, my country\nstrives to contribute to global and regional efforts\naimed at countering terrorism. In that context, it is of\nvital importance to make progress on the adoption of a\ncomprehensive convention on international terrorism.\nAt the same time, Serbia has undertaken various\nactivities to suppress organized crime, which is often\nlinked with terrorism, as well as to fight trafficking in\nnarcotic drugs, human beings and arms.\nEncouraging dialogue among various cultures and\nfaiths is increasingly important in today\u2019s world. The\nRepublic of Serbia is a country of religious people, who\nworship God in Christian churches and cathedrals or\nin mosques and synagogues. I can proudly say that my\ncountry is a place where various cultures and religions\nhave intermingled, and spiritual and material heritages\nhave incorporated traditions and elements derived\nfrom various completely different religious and ethnic\naffiliations, which have continued to intermix and\nwhose wealth will be passed on to future generations.\nNo one should suffer or be humiliated because\nof their religion. Religious feelings are sacrosanct\nand safeguarded as fundamental human rights. No\nlife should be lost in religiously motivated clashes.\nIrresponsible individuals ridicule relics that others\nworship, yet certain people who have been hurt have\nreacted inappropriately. That is why we strongly\ncondemn attacks on innocent people, who should be especially protected. On behalf of the Serbian people,\nI offer our sympathies to the United States over the\nkilling of the United States Ambassador to Libya.\nSerbia plays an active role in regional organizations,\nincluding the Organization of the Black Sea Economic\nCooperation. That regional cooperation mechanism is\nbased on the principles of understanding and mutual\nrespect aimed at achieving common goals. Serbia\nhas successfully presided over regional initiatives,\nincluding the Organization of the Black Sea Economic\nCooperation, the Central European Initiative, the\nMigration, Asylum, Refugees Regional Initiative, the\nSouth-East European Cooperation Process and the\nAdriatic and Ionian Initiative.\nSerbia truly wishes to become a full-fledged\nmember of the European Union (EU) and is patiently\nbuilding relations of confidence and peace in a region\nthat is burdened with the heavy legacy of the past.\nSerbia wishes to head for a better and more prosperous\nfuture, on an equal footing with all nations of the world.\nMuch has been achieved so far in the implementation\nof reforms, the fight against crime and corruption and\nthe harmonization of its laws with the regulations of the\nEuropean Union.\nIn that sense, Serbia has performed even better than\nsome countries that have already become EU members.\nUnfortunately, despite its strong commitment to strict\ncompliance with international law and all fundamental\ninstruments regarding the work of the United Nations,\nthe Republic of Serbia is now faced with a violation\nof certain fundamental principles enshrined in the\nCharter of the United Nations in a part of its territory.\nOn 17 February 2008, the authorities of the self-\nproclaimed Republic of Kosovo unilaterally declared\nthe independence of the territory of Serbia\u2019s southern\nprovince. I am not a prophet, but I must say that the\nunilateral declaration of independence by the province\nof Kosovo constitutes a dangerous precedent and a\nlong-standing threat to the stability of the region of the\nWestern Balkans and beyond.\nThat unilateral act also violated the bedrock\nprinciples of the Helsinki Final Act and Security\nCouncil resolution 1244 (1999). I wish to emphasize that\nthe majority of Member States of the United Nations\nhave refrained from recognizing the unilaterally\ndeclared independence of Kosovo, thus remaining\ntrue to the obligation to respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of Serbia, which is\nan obligation derived from the Charter.\nI take this opportunity to express our gratitude\nto those countries for their support and solidarity, as\nwell as my hope that, in spite of any pressure and with\na view to maintaining peace and stability, they will\nnot recognize any solution that is not the outcome of\nnegotiations and a clearly defined agreement between\nthe Serb and the Albanian parties.\nSerbia is a peace-loving country that is open to the\neast, west, north and south and has friends all over the\nworld. It stands ready to discuss all outstanding issues\nwith all parties and will do its utmost to ensure that all\nits citizens live well, including in Kosovo and Metohija.\nAccording to our Constitution, Kosovo and Metohija is\nan integral part of Serbia, and the territorial integrity\nand the sovereignty of United Nations Members form\nthe cornerstones of key international documents. Serbia\nis a sovereign and independent State and a Member of\nthe United Nations, with defined and internationally\nrecognized borders and a part of its territory is under\nthe administration of the family to which it belongs, the\nUnited Nations.\nAs a Member of the United Nations, Serbia is a\nvictim of the application of double standards. The\nprinciple of respect for territorial integrity implies the\nnon-acceptance of bids for secession and the prevention\nof efforts to change the internationally recognized\nborders of other States. For the country I represent,\npeace and respect for international law come before\nall other interests and objectives. Political and armed\nviolence are not nor will ever be acceptable means for\nachieving State interests in international affairs. Our\nbattle against the unilaterally declared independence of\nKosovo and Metohija is part of the general struggle to\npreserve the principle of respect tor territorial integrity.\nToday, the struggle for the territorial integrity of Serbia\nis also the struggle for peace in all countries of the\nworld and for the rule of law in international relations.\nSerbia is proud of having excellent and substantive\nrelations with most countries and it is proud of its own\nhistory. As is true in all nations, some individual Serbians\nhave made mistakes and even committed crimes. We\nhave turned over those of our own citizens suspected\nof having breached international law to international\njustice. For that reason, we rightfully expect justice\nfor our country and its people, who were on the side of\nlaw and justice in both World Wars. We paid a heavy price fighting fascist and totalitarian ideologies, losing\nalmost half of our population, and we fought shoulder\nto shoulder with the Allies, along with whom we then\nfounded this Organization. A community is based on\njustice, which implies reconciliation and trust. How\nis it possible that the rules of international law and\njustice have been violated to such an extent that, in the\ncase of Serbs in Serbia, one can reasonably speak of\ndiscrimination?\nAmerican President Dwight Eisenhower said, in a\nspeech delivered on 31 October 1956,\n\u201cThere can be no peace without law and there can be\nno law if we were to apply one code of international\nconduct to those who oppose us and another for our\nfriends.\u201d\nIs it possible to have negotiations in which one party gets\neverything, including territory and even many of the\nother party\u2019s people, and the other party gets nothing in\nreturn, except further pressure and new conditions? We\nare more and more frequently forced by the powerful\nand mighty to face the tough choice between giving up\nKosovo and Metohija and membership in the European\nUnion. What kind of a choice is that? Am I to tell our\ncitizens that they are going to live better if they abandon\ntheir own interests? Has Serbia ever asked anyone to\nmake such a decision? I hope that no one in this Hall\nwill ever have to face such a choice.\nSerbia is seeking a lasting, sustainable and\nacceptable solution to all problems. It aspires to\nmake progress towards a European future and is fully\ncommitted to a process that will result in enduring peace\nbetween Serbs and Albanians. The Republic of Serbia\nand myself, as its democratically elected President, are\nready to participate constructively in the negotiating\nprocess, because Serbia cannot move forward without\nKosovo and Metohija, and the inhabitants of Kosovo\nand Metohija cannot move forward without Serbia. We\nstrongly desire that the talks be continued in good faith\nand with good intentions, taking into account, among\nother things, that it is important to carry forward\nEuropean integration involving Serbia and the Western\nBalkans as a whole in order to ensure long-term\nprogress and stability for the entire region.\nSerbia has made committments and will fulfil\nall obligations it has undertaken as a State in the\nagreements reached thus far, even though to my\neye they represent essentially the wish list of the\nAlbanian party with some concessions made by our leadership at that time under heavy pressure. At the\nsame time, it should be understood that Serbia is not\nready to recognize, and cannot nor will ever under any\ncircumstances recognize, either explicitly or implicitly,\nthe unilaterally declared independence of its southern\nprovince of Kosovo and Metohija. The issue of Kosovo\nand Metohija can be resolved and will be resolved in\na peaceful manner. Serbia will enter the follow-up\nnegotiations ready to help all citizens of Kosovo and\nMetohija to live a better life in democratic and secure\nconditions, but it will not negotiate the implementation\nof the independence of the so-called State of Kosovo.\nThe situation will come to an end, even though\nwe constantly hear that the status of Kosovo is\nnon-negotiable and that it is not up to us to decide it.\nI wonder, then, what the subject matter of negotiations\ncould be and what entity has any authority to determine\nit? Serbia offers a concrete proposal: direct negotiations\nat the highest political level. An agreement can be\nreached only through consensus without unilateral\ndecisions and actions.\nI take this opportunity also to condemn most\nstrongly the attempt by the so-called Republic of\nKosovo to dispossess Serbs of the tangible heritage of\nthe Serbian medieval State, the spiritual heritage of the\nSerbian people and the property of the Serbian Orthodox\nChurch in the territory of the southern Serbian province\nof Kosovo. I can only understand the attempt to turn four\nmonasteries of the Serbian Orthodox Church into a part\nof the cultural heritage of the so-called Kosovo State\nas an effort f lagrantly to falsify history, as historical\nrevisionism and as an attempt to obliterate any trace\nof the existence of the Serbian people in Kosovo and\nMetohija.\nI am particularly concerned over the fact that,\neven now in the twenty-first century, such an attempt\nto falsify history and to steal the cultural heritage of a\nnation is taking place before the very eyes of the entire\ninternational community. That sets a very dangerous\nprecedent, encouraging each and every secessionist\ngroup in the future to take over the history of the\nexpelled people after illegally separating the territory\nfrom the State in question. In the case of Kosovo,\n220,000 people were driven out of their homes.\nSerbia urges an investigation into the allegations\ncontained in the report by Mr. Dick Marty, Special\nRapporteur of the Parliamentary Assembly of the\nCouncil of Europe. Some people ought to have a guilty conscious because of the fact that two years have\nelapsed since the publication of the report cataloguing\ncases of harvesting and trafficking in human organs\nbefore, during and after the events of 1999. We are\nsimply asking for the truth. We seek to uncover the\ndestiny of hundreds of Serbs missing from Kosovo and\nMetohija, who are reasonably believed to be the victims\nof illicit trafficking in human organs and of other\ncrimes committed in Kosovo and Metohija. In the name\nof my people, I simply demand justice for the innocent\nvictims. For the sake of the truth an investigation should\nbe carried out, bearing in mind that Serbs were always\nunjustly portrayed as the sole perpetrators of crimes,\nand never as victims,\nSerbia is merely asking for the same obligations and\nrights for itself as for others, for the same appreciation\nof its interests as for those of others and for the same\nkind of attention to itself as to others, so as not to\nbecome unworthy of its ancestors and so as not to fail\nin its debt to its born and unborn children.\nI conclude by affirming that the Republic of Serbia\nwill make a self less contribution to achieving the\nobjectives of the General Assembly and its Member\nStates. I am convinced that the accomplishment of\nthose objectives is only possible through respect for the\nfundamental principles of the United Nations Charter\nand through an active involvement of all Members in\nthe promotion of multilateral cooperation."

        "file_text": "\ufeffI wish first to express my Government\u2019s\ncongratulations to His Excellency Mr. Vuk Jeremi\u0107,\nPresident of the General Assembly at its sixty-seventh\nsession and a former Minister for Foreign Affairs of\nSerbia, on his country\u2019s election to preside over the\nAssembly. We are very happy about that because, both\nin the past and currently, his country has played an\nactive role in eliminating tensions and inequality and in\nstrengthening the rule of law in international relations.\nWe are firmly convinced that, during his tenure, the\nproceedings of the General Assembly will be conducted\nin a climate of consensus and solidarity among Member\nStates.\nThe current session of the General Assembly\nis being held at a time of turmoil, when many States\nare experiencing internal tensions, there is an acute\neconomic crisis, developing countries and their\nemerging economies are encountering difficulties, the\nenvironment and the atmosphere are deteriorating, and\nother major catastrophes have caused the loss of human\nlives and the destruction of infrastructures vital to\nhumankind.\nThe major efforts made by the Secretary-\nGeneral through the United Nations system have not\nbeen sufficient to have a decisive impact. Greater\ncommitment, joint action and unified approaches\non the part of all States are required to combat with\ndetermination the problems of concern to everyone\ntoday. In point of fact, the Secretariat has stressed\nthe main outlines of the problems, which constitute\nthe agenda for the current session \u2014 for instance,\ndeveloping countries\u2019 need for economic growth, the\nmaintenance of international peace and security, the\ndevelopment of the African continent, the promotion\nof human rights and the provision of humanitarian\nassistance, the promotion of justice and international\nlaw, disarmament, and the need to combat drug\ntrafficking, terrorism, the use of mercenaries, piracy\nand other crimes.\nThe Republic of Equatorial Guinea wishes to stress\nthat of all those problems none has been more destructive than underdevelopment, which the United Nations must\nnot look upon with indifference. The annual victims of\nhunger and the diseases in the developing world exceed\nthe number of victims of hostile confrontations recorded\neach year worldwide. The adverse effects of illiteracy,\nthe lack of housing, and malnutrition experienced in\ndeveloping countries are greater than those caused\nby natural disasters. In our times, ignorance and the\nlack of scientific and technical know-how owing to\nunderdevelopment are more detrimental to a human\nbeing than terrorism and drug addiction. In view of\nall those adverse circumstances, we propose that the\nEconomic and Social Council adopt special programmes\nto assist the least developed countries, with a view to\ntheir overcoming the lack of basic infrastructure which\nis hampering their development \u2014 programmes that the\nmore developed countries should commit to supporting\nand that could serve as a basis for mutually beneficial\ncooperation among affected States.\nWe cannot imagine the promotion of human\nrights in a society subject to the restrictions of\nunderdevelopment. From basic human dignity itself to\nall the other rights necessary for a dignified existence,\nincluding physical and moral integrity, freedom and,\nfinally, well-being \u2014 these are what determine whether\npeople fully enjoy their universally recognized rights.\nThere can be no question as to which comes first,\nhuman rights or economic development. We must\nrecognize that human rights cannot be be enjoyed by\npeople engulfed in underdevelopment.\nWith respect to combating underdevelopment,\nwe welcome the fact that Africa has already begun\npromoting programmes for economic development and\nmodern democratic systems, which are liberating their\npeoples from underdevelopment despite many obstacles\nthat still obstruct progress and attempts at perpetuating\nnew colonialist interests in Africa. Most of the internal\nconflicts in Africa are supported by foreign interests that\ntry to ensure their continued presence in the continent.\nAs the saying goes, \u201cIf the river runs backwards, it is\nthe fishermen who win\u201d.\nWe ourselves in Equatorial Guinea are very\nhappy with the progress made in our economic\ndevelopment programme, which seeks to achieve\nan emerging economy by 2020 through the use of\nthe resources provided by the exploitation of oil and\nnatural gas. Thanks to those resources, we are more\nthan meeting most of our needs in infrastructure,\nincluding roads, hospitals, schools, vocational training centres, universities, ports, airports, the drinking\nwater supply, telephone communications, air, sea and\nland transportation, urban development, housing and\nelectricity. In parallel to that programme, we have\nadopted radical political reforms, appropriate to the\nrapid development that the country is experiencing,\nso as to ensure the strictest possible control of the\nGovernment\u2019s activity, to give greater freedoms to the\npeople and to protect human rights to the utmost. Under\nthose reforms, a leader may not remain in office for\nmore than two terms. Parliament is being expanded\nfor a more universal representation of the people.\nEconomic and social decisions are to be taken on the\nbasis of technical criteria and in the interests of society.\nThe President must by law be assisted by an advisory\nbody. The independence of the judicial and legislative\npowers is being strengthened. A body to monitor and\naudit public and private economic activity is being\nestablished. Lastly, an authority to protect and ensure\nhuman rights is being set up. A transition Government\nhas been formed to implement those reforms within\neight months.\nMy Government has always been very responsive\nto the issue of humanitarian assistance. In that regard,\nEquatorial Guinea proposes the establishment of a\ntrust fund of the Food and Agriculture Organization of\nthe United Nations (FAO) for food security in Africa\nthat will be open to less developed countries. From\nthis rostrum, we announce an initial contribution of\n$30 million. We call on African countries and other\ndonors to make their contributions in support of that\ninitiative.\nMy Government\u2019s humanitarian spirit has\nalways aspired to setting up initiatives that support\nhumankind\u2019s development. Equatorial Guinea therefore\nestablished the Equatorial Guinea UNESCO prize to\nencourage the scientific community to research the\npossibility of finding life-saving cures, in particular for\nthose suffering from AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis.\nThe Director-General of FAO agreed to the initiative to\nset up such a fund.\nWith regard to the other important items on our\nagenda, we understand that international peace and\nsecurity essentially depend on respect for the principles\nof international law: respect for the independence,\nnational sovereignty and territorial integrity of\neach State; the sovereign equality of nations and\nnon-interference in the internal affairs of other\nStates; respect for, and compliance with, international commitments; and the promotion of mutually beneficial\nand fair friendship and cooperation relations among\nStates.\nThose norms are the basis for promoting justice\nand law in international relations, and no State or\ngroup of States should step forward to police their\nimplementation. Such an act usurps the authority of\nthe United Nations and undermines its effectiveness.\nThe United Nations should impose its authority at the\ninternational level, avoiding any possible manipulation\nthrough external pressure from those that violate the\nspirit of its principles.\nMeanwhile, Equatorial Guinea endorses the wishes\nof the entire African continent to obtain a response to one\nof its legitimate demands, made on various occasions,\nnamely, Security Council reform by increasing the\nnumber of Council members in both categories and\nreserving two seats as permanent members and five\nas non-permanent members for the African region.\nDemocratic principles and the law are advocated at the\nUnited Nations. Africa claims its rights, including in\nthe Security Council. Africa wishes to participate in\nthe taking of decisions that affect its future.\nWith the assistance of all, we will succeed in\nadopting appropriate measures to reduce the tendency\ntowards unilateralism and hegemony in international\nrelations. We will succeed in mitigating the effects\nof policies that threaten the peace and sovereignty\nof States and that oppose the economic and social\ndevelopment of peoples, thereby significantly violating\nthe principles of international law.\nWith regard to disarmament, which Equatorial\nGuinea fully supports even though it is neither a\nmanufacturer nor a consumer of any sophisticated\nweapons of mass destruction, we believe that there\nshould be no ambiguity on that issue. One cannot have\nthe best of both worlds.\nWe do not believe there to be a threat from other\nplanets of the solar system or other bodies in outer\nspace. The possession of nuclear weapons or weapons\nof mass destruction is a disgrace to today\u2019s humankind,\nwhich is preparing its own destruction. So who should\narm themselves and who should be disarmed? The\nend of the Cold War was supposed to also mean the\nend of the arms race. It is now time for humankind to\nbuild its own future instead of wasting resources on\nextermination plans. Those that adopt embargoes against certain\nGovernments should not be insensitive to their\nrepercussions and to the suffering that they cause\nto the population, in particular the most vulnerable\nsectors. Such measures run counter to the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals adopted by the United Nations.\nSanctions and embargoes, whatever their real nature,\nshould always take into account the humanitarian\ncomponent with regard to the people who are suffering.\nTherefore, we would suggest that the rights of the\nindividual be given priority whenever any kind of\nsanctions are adopted. Accordingly, we appeal for the\nsuspension of the embargo against Cuba.\nWe will return to Equatorial Guinea with the\nsincere hope that the sixty-seventh session of the\nGeneral Assembly will be a milestone in the process of\nhumanizing international relations."

        "file_text": "\ufeffI would like to congratulate Mr. Vuk Jeremi\u0107\nand his friendly country, the Republic of Serbia, on his\nelection as President of the General Assembly at its\nsixty-seventh session and to wish him every success\nin conducting our work in a way that restores to the\nAssembly President his important and neutral role in\nfulfilling his duties without regard for any political,\nnational or international agendas that violate the rules\nof international law and contradict efforts to achieve\nsecurity and stability in the world. We also wish the\nSecretary-General every success in carrying out his\nduties and enhancing the purposes and principles\nenshrined in the Charter of the United Nations.\nOur world today faces many events that are\naffecting its States and continue to cast their shadow\non the international arena. Many countries are facing\npolitical, economic and financial crises, whose their\nnegative consequences exceed the capacity of States to\ncope with them individually.\nWhile the peoples of the world await effective and\ncoordinated international efforts to overcome those\ncrises, the situation indicates instead an escalation\nof hegemony and domination over the fortunes\nand potentials of nations and peoples in a way that\ncontradicts the principles and purposes enshrined in\nthe Charter and the norms of international law. Instead of seeking to contribute to the settlement of\nregional and international disputes by peaceful means,\nsome well-known countries continue to pursue new\ncolonial policies based on political hypocrisy in dealing\nwith those crises. Under the pretext of humanitarian\nintervention, these countries interfere in the domestic\naffairs of States and impose unilateral economic\nsanctions that lack any moral or legal basis. Under the\npretext of concepts such as the responsibility to protect,\nthe drums of war are beaten and the seeds of sedition\nand unrest are sown to damage the structure of national\nsocieties. Perhaps worse of all, permanent members\nof the Security Council, who have launched wars\nunder the pretext of combating terrorism, now support\nterrorism in my country, without any regard for United\nNations resolutions that established the regulations and\nmechanisms for concerted international efforts to fight\nthis scourge without political polarization or double\nstandards.\nFor over a year now, my country has faced organized\nterrorism that has affected our citizens, our human and\nscientific cadres, our national institutions and many of\nSyria\u2019s historic and archeological landmarks through\nterrorist bombings, assassinations, massacres, looting\nand acts of sabotage that have horrified citizens in\nmany parts of the country. The most recent example\nis the terrorist bombing that took place in Damascus\non 26 September. A terrorist group under the name of\nthe Al-Nusra Front, one of Al-Qaida\u2019s affiliates, took\nresponsibility for that attack.\nIt is no surprise that the Security Council has\nfailed to condemn this and other terrorist bombings,\nas some of its members support such acts. This\nterrorism is externally supported and is accompanied\nby unprecedented media incitement seeking to ignite\nreligious extremism sponsored by well-known States\nin the region. Those States facilitate the f low of arms,\nmoney and fighters through the borders of some\nneighbouring countries. They also turn a blind eye to\nthe activities of terrorist groups crossing their borders,\nwhile others provide active material and logistical\nsupport from their territory for such groups.\nThese facts lead me to question whether the\ninternational consensus among Member States on\ncombating terrorism was serious or merely ink on\npaper. How should we understand the explicit request\nby the United States to the armed terrorist groups\nnot to surrender their arms in response to amnesty\ndecrees and decisions issued by the Syrian leadership?\nWe also wonder about the statements by Qatar, Saudi\nArabia, Turkey, the United States, France and others\nwho explicitly induce and support terrorism in Syria\nwith money, weapons and foreign fighters. To what\nextent are those statements in line with those countries\u2019\ninternational responsibility to combat terrorism?\nOne of the ironies that we face today is evident in the\nefforts to encourage extremists in countries within and\noutside our region to go to the Syrian border and enter\nthe country to carry out terrorist acts under the banner\nof jihad, in collaboration with terrorists from within\nthe country. This is a fact that has been confirmed by\nreports by both international and Arab observers. To\nthis very day, and as a result of this terrorism, Syria\nhas lost thousands of martyrs from among its military\nranks and its civilians. This is the price that Syria has\npaid for its efforts to defend the integrity of the Syrian\nState and its citizens in the face of that global terrorist\ncampaign.\nThe Syrian Government called for dialogue at the\nbeginning of the events in my country, but there was\nno positive response from most opposition parties.\nMoreover, my Government responded positively\nthroughout the crisis to each and every sincere\ninitiative aimed at finding a peaceful solution based\non national dialogue among Syrians, rejecting external\nmanipulation, stopping the shedding of Syrian blood\nand preserving the unity of Syria and its future.\nBased on this principled position, Syria cooperated\nwith the Arab observer mission and the subsequent\ninternational initiatives linked to the work of the Joint\nSpecial Envoy, Kofi Annan. We did so despite the\nconviction of the Syrian leadership that there are no\nsincere intentions on the part of certain regional and\ninternational parties who push for the escalation of the\nSyrian crisis, fuel its fire and prolong it by thwarting all\nattempts for dialogue, and insist on creating a state of\ninstability to ensure the need for foreign interference.\nSyria, on the basis of its principled position,\nreceived the United Nations Supervision Mission in\nthe Syrian Arab Republic (UNSMIS), and furnished it\nwith all the facilities needed to enable it to deploy in\nrecord time. The Syrian leadership also announced its\nfull commitment to the implementation of the six-point\nplan presented by Mr. Annan and started the practical\nimplementation of its provisions. It also welcomed the\nGeneva communiqu\u00e9 (A/66/865, annex) that stressed\nthe need for the implementation of those provisions. However, the armed groups sought to exploit the Syrian\nGovernment\u2019s commitment to the plan and the Geneva\ncommuniqu\u00e9 in order to make gains on the ground\nand expand the area of their presence. In addition, the\nstatements issued by some Western and Arab countries\nexposed the actors and States working to thwart these\ninitiatives.\nSyria welcomed the appointment of Mr. Lakhdar\nBrahimi as the Joint Special Representative, succeeding\nMr. Annan, and stressed its willingness to cooperate\nfully with him based on the principles agreed on by the\ninternational community, in particular the six-point plan\nand the Geneva final communiqu\u00e9 (S/2012/523, annex).\nI should point out that, in addition to the commitment of\nthe Syrian Government, the success of any international\neffort requires that the States supporting armed groups\nin my country \u2014 in particular Turkey, Saudi Arabia,\nQatar and Libya, among others \u2014 stop arming, funding,\ntraining and harbouring armed terrorist groups, and\ninstead encourage dialogue and renounce violence.\nFor more than a year now, we have said that what\nmy country is witnessing is a two-sided problem: one\nside is based on the need for the political, economic\nand social reforms that the public demands; the other\nis based on the exploitation of those public needs and\ndemands in the service of goals that are completely\nunconnected to the demands of the Syrian people and\ntheir interests, and for which those peaceful demands\nare being used as a vehicle for armed groups working\nto sow sedition and undermine security in my country.\nI referred to that in my statement from this rostrum\nlast year (see A/66/PV.25). I have returned today to\ntell the Assembly that the Syrian Government has\ntaken serious and important steps towards reform,\nculminating in a new Constitution that embraces\npolitical pluralism and that has been adopted by popular\nreferendum. As a result, parliamentary elections open\nto multiple political parties were held. I can also say\nthat Syria is continuing to work with patriotic members\nof the opposition to build a new and pluralist Syria that\nis responsive to its people\u2019s aspirations. At the same\ntime, Syria is determined to fulfil its duty to protect its\npeople from jihadist and takfiri terrorism, which armed\nterrorist groups are using to spread chaos and sedition\namong Syrians, threatening their peaceful coexistence.\nThere have been calls from this rostrum and at\nother forums asking the President of the Syrian Arab\nRepublic to step down, made by people who are ignorant\nof or ignore the facts, or who have a stake in distorting them. That is blatant interference in the domestic affairs\nof Syria, which undermines the unity of its people and\nthe sovereignty of its decision-making. Only the people\nof Syria have the right to choose their own future and\nthe form of their State \u2014 one that accommodates all\ngroups and parties covering the entire spectrum of\nthe Syrian people, including those who have been\ndeceived and misled. It is the Syrian people who will\nchoose their leadership through the ballot box, which is\nthe most important tool of democracy and democratic\nexpression.\nIf some of the countries that are interfering in\nSyria\u2019s internal affairs are proud of their democracy and\ntheir people\u2019s freedom to choose, it would be better for\nthem to support us on our democratic path and leave the\nSyrian people to choose their leaders through elections,\nwhose form has been set by the new Constitution and the\nrelevant legislation, after which the ballot box will have\nthe final say. I say to those countries that we have had\nenough of illusions, and I invite the national opposition\nto work together to stop the shedding of Syrian blood, to\nsit at the negotiation table and to participate in building\nthe present and future.\nWe are not betting on any party or faction apart from\nthe Syrian people, who are uniformly determined to\nreject all forms of foreign interference in their domestic\naffairs and to defeat the advocates of sectarianism,\nextremism and terrorism, because in my country the\nlinks between State policies and the aspirations of the\npeople are very strong.\nDespite everything I have described about what my\ncountry is experiencing, we still believe in a political\nsolution as the essential way out of this crisis. From this\nrostrum I call, first, on all parties and political groups\nand factions, inside and outside Syria, to engage in a\nconstructive dialogue under the aegis of our homeland.\nThe doors of Syria, like its heart, are open to anyone\nwho wants constructive dialogue. To that end, I call\non all countries represented in the General Assembly\nto exert pressure to end the violence in my country by\nputting a stop to the arming, financing, harbouring and\ntraining of armed terrorist groups. Secondly, the results\nof that national dialogue, after being agreed on by all\nparties, will determine the map and future direction of\nthe country towards establishing a more pluralistic and\ndemocratic Syria.\nThe events in Syria have produced a surge in\nhumanitarian needs in several key sectors in areas\naffected by takfiri terrorist groups, which has led to deteriorating living conditions for Syrian citizens\nwho live there. While my Government is working\nhard to meet the basic needs of citizens who have\nbeen forced to f lee their homes by the violence of\narmed groups, some have sought to fabricate a refugee\ncrisis in neighbouring countries by inciting armed\ngroups to intimidate Syrian civilians in border areas,\nforcing them to f lee to those countries. There they are\naccommodated in military training bases or camps that\nresemble places of detention, in arid or rugged regions.\nTheir plight is being exploited in order to secure aid\nthat is mostly spent on things that have nothing to do\nwith humanitarian purposes. I appeal to those Syrian\ncitizens from this rostrum to return to their towns and\nvillages, where the State will guarantee their safe return\nand dignified lives, free from the inhuman conditions\nthey are enduring in those camps.\nAt this point, I would like to ask a legitimate\nquestion about the credibility of those who claim\nto care about providing humanitarian assistance in\nresponse to Syrian citizens\u2019 needs, and about how such\nclaims correspond with a policy of tightening unilateral\neconomic sanctions that have a severe effect on those\nsame citizens\u2019 living conditions, whose interests\nthose imposing the sanctions claim to serve. How can\nimposing sanctions on the banking, health, transport\nand other sectors be consistent with caring for Syrians\u2019\nbest interests?\nI also wonder if the legitimate public demands of our\ncitizens, to which the Syrian leadership has responded\ntransparently and sincerely, justify their being used by\nsome as an excuse to continue providing every kind\nof military, financial and media support to those who\nare killing innocent people in Syria \u2014 who include\njournalists, doctors, university professors and even\nreligious figures. Or is this simply another practical\ninterpretation of the concept of creative chaos, which\ncontributes only to strengthening Western hegemony\nover Mediterranean countries, and serves only Israel\u2019s\nexpansionist interests?\nWhat is happening in my country must not lead\nus to lose our basic focus, which is Palestine and the\nSyrian Golan. The Syrian Arab Republic therefore\nreaffirms its natural right to recover all of the occupied\nSyrian Golan up to the 4 June 1967 borders. Syria\nunderscores its rejection of all measures taken by Israel,\nthe occupying Power, to change the natural geographic\nand other aspects of the Golan, in clear violation of the resolution 497 (1981).\nSyria renews its support for the legitimate call\non the international community to recognize a free\nand independent Palestinian State on the Palestinian\nterritories occupied in 1967. As everyone knows, the\nfailure of efforts to achieve a just and comprehensive\npeace in the Middle East on the basis of the international\nterms of reference endorsed by the international\ncommunity as a basis for peace between Palestinians\nand Israelis is due to the unilateral positions and actions\nof Israel, especially Israel\u2019s insistence on continuing its\nsettlement policy and its evasion of the requirements\nof peace.\nMy country renews its call for the international\ncommunity to work to rid the Middle East of all\nweapons of mass destruction. In that context, we recall\nthe initiative put forward by Syria in late 2003, during\nits tenure as a non-permanent member in the Security\nCouncil for the period 2002 to 2003, and we call on the\nCouncil to adopt it. Syria stresses that ridding the region\nof all weapons of mass destruction cannot be achieved\nwithout forcing Israel, the only nuclear Power in the\nregion, to adhere to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation\nof Nuclear Weapons and to place its nuclear facilities\nunder the comprehensive inspections regime of the\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency. At the same time,\nwe emphasize the Treaty\u2019s provisions guaranteeing the\nright of every State to acquire nuclear technology for\npeaceful purposes.\nThe insistence of the United States and countries\nof the European Union and others to impose unilateral\neconomic measures violates the rules and norms of\ninternational law and the principles of free trade. It\nalso raises questions about the legality and morality of\nsuch practices. On that basis, we call for the lifting of\nthe embargo that the United States has imposed against\nCuba for decades. We also renew our call for ending\nall unilateral coercive measures imposed on the peoples\nof other countries, such as the Bolivarian Republic of\nVenezuela, Belarus, the Islamic Republic of Iran, the\nSyrian Arab Republic and the Democratic People\u2019s\nRepublic of Korea.\nOur aspiration to achieve a positive reform of this\ninternational Organization stems from our desire to\ncreate a world based on justice, security and prosperity\nfor all the peoples of the world, free from the colonial\nand hegemonic tendencies of some countries that seek to exploit the United Nations to achieve their own\ninterests at the expense of other countries.\nWe hope that the United Nations can take the\npeoples of the world to a better future that fulfils their\naspirations for life, coexistence, development and food\nsufficiency, free from all forms of tension, confrontation\nand war, in accordance with the purposes and\nprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations, which\nseek to preserve the sovereignty and equality of States\nin rights and duties."

        "file_text": "\ufeffThe meetings we hold at the United Nations are\nalways very important events at which we debate\nsocial, environmental, political and economic issues\nthroughout the world. I commend the President of the\nGeneral Assembly on having chosen as our central\ntheme the peaceful settlement of disputes throughout\nthe world.\nI wish to take the great opportunity of my presence\nhere today at the United Nations to inform the\nAssembly about a dispute between Chile and Bolivia.\nIn 1879, as the result of an unjust war \u2014 an unjust\ninvasion \u2014 masterminded by Chilean oligarchical\ninterests, with the participation of transnational\ncorporations with an eye on Bolivia\u2019s natural resources,\nwe lost our corridor to the Pacific Ocean.\nBolivia was founded in 1825 and lost access to the\nsea in 1879. In the early 1900s, a treaty was signed that\nhas not been complied with. It is for that reason that I\nhave come here to take advantage of the theme of our\ndebate, the peaceful settlement of disputes, to say that\nmajor disputes among States have been resolved and\ninjustices rectified through the resolve and goodwill of\nthe relevant authorities.\nChile cannot disregard Bolivia\u2019s rights or the\npronouncements of an entire continent, much less\nprolong indefinitely our forcibly imposed landlocked\nstatus. An unjust, imposed and non-implemented treaty\ncannot be allowed to continue to harm a people that is\nonly calling for justice and for an end to its country\u2019s\nstatus as a landlocked country.\nThe intangibility of treaties means that they are\nnot dogma. Treaties, like all other creations of human beings, can be changed. I say that because when we state\nthat Chile must return our sea corridor, we are asked,\nwhat treaty? I therefore wish to take this opportunity\nto speak of a treaty signed in 1903 between the United\nStates and Panama on the Panama Canal.\nIn 1903, a treaty on the Panama Canal was signed\nunder which the United States was authorized to build the\nPanama Canal and received sovereignty, in perpetuity,\nover the territories on both sides of the Canal and the\narea of the Canal. In other words, according to the\nTreaty of 1903, that country would be the owner for all\neternity of the Panama Canal. However, a renegotiated\ntreaty was signed in 1977 that gradually transferred\nsovereignty over the Canal zone from the United States\nto Panama, and in 1999 Panama recovered control and\nadministration of the Canal through the Panama Canal\nAuthority.\nHow did the United States return the Panama Canal\nto Panama when, through the first treaty, it had to be\nthe owner of the Canal in perpetuity? And how is it\npossible for Chile not to return Bolivia\u2019s sea corridor?\nI wish also to take this opportunity to say that\ntoday, in this millennium, is a time of integration and\nof focus on the protection of humankind, not a time of\ndomestic or external colonialism. That is why I wish to\nreaffirm once again that the Malvinas are for Argentina\nand the sea is for Bolivia. These demands, conflicts and\ndisputes have to be resolved peacefully, and Bolivia is\na peace-loving country, in keeping with the State\u2019s new\npolitical Constitution.\nBolivia appeals once again to the Government of\nChile, here before the Assembly, to resolve definitively\nthe issue of our landlocked status through peaceful\nsettlement mechanisms. We call on the international\ncommunity to support us in that endeavour, so that this\nconflict, which does great harm to the integration of the\nAmerican continent, may finally come to an end.\nAmong the Bolivian people, among children and\ngrandparents alike, there is a strong sense of the need\nto recover our sea corridor. Bolivia was born with a sea,\nand it is not possible that oligarchies and transnational\ncompanies, in order to plunder our natural resources,\ncan be allowed also to wrest from us our territory. We\nneed the support of all those at the helm of the United\nNations to put an end to a historical injustice on the part\nof international Powers. Yesterday I listened to the various statements on\nissues related to democracy, human rights and peace,\nand I feel that the statements we make here as Presidents\nshow that we agree in theory. All of us here are great\ndefenders of human rights who want peace and defend\ndemocracy. But we are divided. The United Nations is\nnot united, and that makes a great difference. I listened\nvery carefully to the statement made by Secretary-\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon telling us that we have to change\nthe world. We very much agree that we have to change\nthe world. But how can we change the world if we do\nnot change the United Nations? How can the United\nNations be responsible for interventionism on many\ncontinents?\nI have listened to two or three addresses by several\ncountries, and I was very pleased. There seems to be a\nrebellion on the part of States against powers, authority\nand capitalism. I am very pleased, because when I came\nhere for the first time in 2006, only the countries of the\nBolivarian Alliance for the Countries of Our America,\nwith great ideological, political and programmatic\nclarity, stated that everything was for the people. I\nknow some countries on other continents \u2014 very timid\nand fearful countries \u2014 feel that today are losing their\nfear of the Powers. I would like to say to them, to their\nrepresentatives and to their Presidents that we should\nnot be afraid. We should not be afraid of empires or\ncapitalism. Capitalism and imperialism are not the\nsolution to life or to humanity.\nWe are living in times of the crisis of capitalism,\nof a crisis in food. I remember when I was still a\ntrade union leader, we conducted campaigns to have\nthe external debt of underdeveloped countries \u2014 at\nthat time, they were called underdeveloped countries,\ninstead of developing countries \u2014 cancelled. Now I\nrealize that our debt as poor countries can be paid, but\nthe debts of capitalism are impossible to pay. That is\nwhat the world we are living in today shows.\nWe speak here of democracy. We have to defend\ndemocracy and, in order to do that, we have to\nintervene in some countries. But if we really wanted to\nbe democratic, we would respect all of the resolutions\nof the United Nations. Just to cite an example, does the\nGovernment of the United States of America respect\nUnited Nations resolutions on the economic embargo\nagainst Cuba? It has never respected them. That is due\nto pride on the part of the rulers, not of the American\npeople. The rulers are never going to respect those resolutions, but they speak of democracy and of\ndefending democracy.\nIn that connection, I must express our full backing for\nthe Cuban people. Their commander, former President\nFidel Castro, the most caring person in the world that\nI have ever known \u2014 and I admire that revolutionary\npeople \u2014 is, despite the embargo, engaged in continuous\nbattle at the side of his people. It is not possible that in the\ntwenty-first century an economic embargo continues\nagainst the Cuban people, a genocidal embargo that\nhas failed and which violates the rights of an entire\npeople. The embargo has been condemned by almost\nall of humankind and the international community,\nincluding the allies of the United States of America,\nfor its extraterritorial character and its imposition in\nviolation of humanitarian and international law. Bolivia\nalso denounces the unjust inclusion of Cuba on the list\nunilaterally assembled by the United States in its report\nentitled \u201cState Sponsors of Terrorism\u201d, the purpose of\nwhich is to justify the embargo and continue imposing\nnew sanctions on the regime and the people of Cuba.\nWhat authority does the Government of the United\nStates have to include a country in the list of terrorist\ncountries? Do not all the peoples of the world realize\nthat the number one terrorist country practicing State\nterrorism is the Government of the United States?\nThere have been so many interventions, so many dead\nand wounded, so much killing \u2014 under the pretext of\ndefending democracy.\nMoments ago, a fellow president spoke about an\nintervention in Libya to restore democracy, which is\na lie. They intervened in Libya not for its people but\nto recover oil for the Powers. We have to be sincere\nand straightforward with humankind, but where there\nare presidents who stay in power without practicing\ndemocracy but are in favour of capitalism and\nimperialism, there is no intervention because they are\nallies of the United States Government; they are allies\nof the empire; they are allies of capitalism. Where there\nare natural resources, like oil, in the hands of the people,\nthey have to intervene under any pretext \u2014 terrorism,\ndictatorship or drug trafficking \u2014 all of it to recover or\nto plunder the natural resources.\nFurthermore, I would also like to launch an appeal\nfor the immediate release of five Cuban anti-terrorist\npolitical prisoners in the United States. Their release\nwould show a political will to defend human rights.\nThe President of the United States could release them;\nthe power to do so is in his hands. I hope that justice will be done to our five Cuban brothers, who have been\nimprisoned unjustly.\nIn truth, I do not understand it when the presidents\nwho speak in defence of human rights are never the\nones who respect human, either within or outside\ntheir own countries. I do not understand how one can\nspeak of peace while there are economic inequalities\nin the world. While there is an economic policy that\nconcentrates capital in the hands of a few and which\nimpoverishes many, there will never be justice, there\nwill never be peace or respect for human rights. Indeed,\nthe economic models that concentrate capital in a few\nhands provoke injustice and create uprisings.\nI feel that now is the best time \u2014 I am referring\nto various meetings at the United Nations \u2014 to gain\nbetter understanding of the situation of all the peoples\nof the world. We had requested the revision of some\nimportant international treaties concerning a very\nimportant product for the indigenous peoples of the\nAndean region, the coca leaf. Although the coca leaf has\nmedicinal and ritual properties, it has been penalized\nunder the 1961 Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs.\nTherefore, Bolivia, which wishes to remain faithful to\nits commitment to fight drug trafficking, has requested\nadherence to the Single Convention with a reservation\nthat preserves the right to use coca leaf for cultural\npurposes, especially medicinal purposes, within our\nterritory.\nIn some states of the United States, it is legal to\nsell cocaine, but the United States does not allow us to\nconsume coca leaf \u2014 which is not cocaine. I welcome\nthe support for the proposal on the part of many\ncountries of the continent and the world \u2014 non-aligned\ncountries \u2014 recognizing, after thousands of years, the\nconsumption of coca leaf as legal. I respectfully request\nthat the Assembly, acting on behalf of the United\nNations, correct a historical prejudicial act.\nUnfortunately, since there is an illegal market for\ncoca leaf, that is, a market for cocaine or drugs, a portion\nof the harvest is diverted to the illegal market \u2014 but we\nare fighting that. We in Bolivia say that there will be no\nfree cultivation of coca, but there cannot be zero coca\nleaf.\nI commend the United Nations for issuing a report a\nfew weeks ago affirming that, for the first time, Bolivia\nhad reduced the cultivation of coca by more than 12 per\ncent. That is a Government achievement without any\ndead or wounded; previously, that kind of reduction resulted in many dead and wounded. Now, while\nmaintaining respect for human rights and appealing\nto the conscience of my coca-producing brothers and\nsisters, we have had a net reduction.\nCoca cultivation has increased in some countries,\nwhich are subsequently decertified by the United States\nof America. But the United States has also decertified\na country like Bolivia, even though it has reduced the\ncultivation of coca by 12 per cent. Do we then have to\nplant more coca for the Government of the United States\nto certify us? One cannot understand it. Of course,\nsince we are an anti-capitalist and anti-imperialist\npeople and Government, we have been decertified. That\ndecertification is a political statement; it does not take\ninto account the efforts made by the Bolivian people\nthrough its Government.\nWe are not interested in whether we are certified\nor not. That is the least of it. What we are interested\nin is the United Nations data. Honestly, the United\nNations works in a transparent manner to recognize\nthe work that our Government has done to reduce coca\ncultivation.\nI would also like to take this opportunity to talk\nabout the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).\nBolivia was previously a little-known country that had\nbeen abandoned, living on foreign aid. We welcomed\nforeign aid. I would just like to present what we have\nachieved since we took charge in Bolivia, in the context\nof the MDGs.\nBolivia was supposed to reduce extreme poverty\nto 24.1 per cent by 2015. I would like to report that,\nby 2011, we had reduced extreme poverty to 20 per\ncent. We have a plan. By the time Bolivia celebrates its\nbicentennial, we will have eradicated extreme poverty.\nThe numbers from international organizations confirm\nthat, last year, 10 per cent of the population went from\nextreme poverty to the middle class. That is 1 million\nBolivians.\nThe second figure to note is that, according to the\nMDG targets, 78.5 per cent of the population should\nhave access to safe drinking water by 2015. I would\nlike to say that, as a result of our programme, this year\nwe reached 78.5 per cent of the country, especially the\nindigenous rural communities. We have a programme\ncalled \u201cMy Water\u201d to promote greater investments\nin water. What I did personally was to bring together\nall of the projects on safe drinking water or water for\nirrigation from every municipality in the country. For\nthe second year in a row, we have invested $300,000 per municipality, and that has been rather helpful, in\naddition to other programmes by the Ministry of the\nEnvironment and Water, in particular in cities and in\nrural areas. Those programmes for drinking water mean\nthat we have achieved our goal in 2012, not in 2015.\nHopefully, by 2015 we will have achieved 90 or 100 per\ncent drinking water coverage. That is our programme.\nAnother of the Goals pertains to coverage in terms\nof hospital births. The MDG target for 2015 is 70 per\ncent. I am here to report that by 2009 we had achieved\n70 per cent coverage, not to mention other programmes\nsuch as the one that provides subsidies for pregnant\nwomen and children under the age of two. We are\nmaking good progress, although with slow steps.\nWhy has there been such rapid change? Social\nprogrammes and structural changes have allowed us to\nchange Bolivia. One example is telecommunications.\nBolivia has 339 municipalities. In 2006, telephone\ncoverage or mobile phone coverage in rural areas existed\nin only 90 municipalities. The day after tomorrow, I\nam going to inaugurate mobile communication in the\nlast municipality, the furthest from the cities, in the\nBolivian Amazon. Now my brothers and sisters living\nin rural areas have telephones or mobile phones in all\n339 municipalities. Entel, our telephone service, had\nbeen privatized. We took it back, nationalized it, and\nbegan to invest in it in order to provide better service.\nWe have made progress for the following reason.\nAs President, I received a mandate from the Bolivian\npeople to recover or nationalize our natural resources.\nThe biggest company in Bolivia is Yacimientos\nPetrol\u00edferos Fiscales Bolivianos (YPFB). For 20 years,\nneoliberal Governments worked to privatize our natural\nresources. They sold our natural resources, especially\noil, to transnational corporations. Bolivia received only\n18 per cent of all the profits, while 82 per cent went\nto transnational corporations. In addition, what did\nthe contracts signed by neoliberal Governments say?\nWho was the owner? The oil transnational corporations\nacquired the right of ownership at the mouth of the\nwell. The Governments would tell us that the oil and\ngas continued to be ours as long as it was under the\nground. But once it came to the mouth of the well, it\nbelonged to the transnational corporations. We fought,\nwe mobilized, we raised awareness among the Bolivian\npeople as to the importance of retaking or nationalizing\nthat natural resource. On 1 May 2006, we nationalized\nthat industry without any misgivings. That act changed the national economy. In 2006,\nour international reserves stood at $1.7 billion. Our\ninternational reserves now stand at more than $13 billion.\nIn 2005, YPFB had $300 million in revenue. This year,\nit has $3.5 billion. In 2005, total public investments\namounted to $600 million. Out of that $600 million,\n70 per cent came from aid and loans and only 30 per\ncent came from the national treasury. This year State\ninvestments will amount to approximately $6 billion,\nwith an additional $6 billion in private investments.\nHow did that change come about in such a short period\nof time?\nOf course, Bolivia is a small country. But we\nhave managed to change our national economy. That\nis why I say to countries whose natural resources,\nincluding oil and gas, are still in private hands that my\nrecommendation is for them to nationalize and recover\ntheir natural resources. Natural resources cannot\nbelong to transnational corporations; they belong to the\npeoples of the world, under State administration.\nI would also like to say that there have been\nsocial changes. Through a constituent assembly, we\nhave guaranteed basic services as a human right.\nConsequently, they cannot be in private hands.\nIt is a task for the State. Water, electricity and\ncommunications \u2014 we have nationalized them and\nturned them into human rights. It is very important that\nthose basic services be human rights. While we still\nhave some problems in Bolivia with electricity, we will\ncontinue to work to ensure that that basic service is a\nhuman right as well.\nI am here to share our brief experience with\nGovernments, presidents, ambassadors and prime\nministers. Where there is the will to change, there will\nbe change. It depends to a large extent on willingness,\nconstant efforts to educate our people and transparent\nwork. Of course, we still have so many demands to\nmeet \u2014 sometimes, too, exaggerated demands from a\nparticular social sector or region \u2014 but regardless of\nour interests or claims, our homeland and humankind\nas a whole come first.\nDealing as we are with the problems we have in\nBolivia and the world with climate issues, I would like\nto take this opportunity to convey an invitation to an\ninternational meeting on 21 December to greet a new\nera, an invitation to the celebration of the end of the\ncycle of non-time and the beginning of a new cycle of\nequilibrium and harmony for Mother Earth. It would take too long here to go into the knowledge of our\nindigenous brothers in Mexico, Guatemala, Bolivia and\nEcuador, but basically we are issuing this invitation to a\nvirtual \u2014 and actual \u2014 debate on the following topics.\nFirst, the global crisis of sapitalism; second, the\ncrisis of civilization \u2014 world Government, capitalism,\nsocialism, community and the culture of life; third,\nthe crisis of climate \u2014 human beings\u2019 relationship to\nnature; fourth, the energy of community and change;\nfifth, awareness of Mother Earth; sixth, recovering\nancestral practices and customs and the natural cosmic\ncalendar; seventh, living the right way as a solution to\nthe global crisis \u2014 because once again we affirm that\nwe cannot live better by plundering natural resources,\nand that is a profound debate that we should have with\nthe whole world; eighth, food sovereignty and security\nthrough food sovereignty; ninth, integration \u2014 through\nbrotherhood, community, economy, complementarity,\nthe right to communication, and community learning\nfor life; the new human being with an integrated\nidentity; complementarity; self-knowledge, awakening\nand, of course, health, which is so important.\nI would like to say that according to the Mayan\ncalendar, 21 December marks the end of the non-time\nand the beginning of time. It is the end of the\nmacha \u2014 the darkness \u2014 and the beginning of the\npacha \u2014 communitarianism; it is the end of selfishness\nand the beginning of brotherhood; it is the end of\nindividualism and the beginning of collectivism. As\nscientists know very well, 21 December this year\nmarks the end of the era of anthropocentrism and the\nbeginning of biocentrism. It is the end of hatred and\nthe beginning of love, the end of lies and the beginning\nof truth, the end of sadness and the beginning of joy, it\nis the end of division and the beginning of unity. This\nis a theme to be developed, and that is why we invite\nall those here, those who are betting on humankind, to\nshare their experiences for the good of humankind.\nAs always, I would like to thank the President for\nthese debates at the United Nations. We are always\nthinking about new generations and about the good\nof humankind, although sometimes sectoral interests\nintrude \u2014 but as representatives who come here from\ntime to time, we have an obligation to think about how\nto shoulder our responsibilities, and that means, as\nsomeone said just now, bringing an end to the powers\nthat be. This is not a time when we can continue to praise\nthose powers; we are living in a time when peoples must\nbe freed and where we must constantly seek economic and social equality for all human beings, a time to bring\ndignity to every citizen.\nI would like to commend those statements that\nquestioned interventionism, military bases and troops.\nThere will be social peace only when we change such\npolitical and economic policies and put an end to\nmilitary bases and interventionism. My respect goes to\nthose who resist military intervention by the Powers,\nwhich is not a solution. That is something we have\nlearned, and that is why we hope that these debates will\nserve to help us think about life and humanity."

        "file_text": "\ufeffMay peace be upon us all.\nI am honoured to represent my country, Indonesia, at\nthis year\u2019s General Assembly debate to discuss how we\ncan find better ways to peacefully resolve or manage\nconflicts around the world.\nThis, of course, is what the United Nations is all\nabout: to end the scourge of war, and to create a peaceful\nand equitable world order based on international\ncooperation.\nIn the decades since its founding, the United Nations\nhas developed a number of instruments to address\nconflicts in all their manifestations. During those\ndecades, many inter-State and intra-State conflicts have\nbeen resolved \u2014 those in Angola, Bosnia, Cambodia,\nTimor-Leste, as well as many others.\nThe question we must now ask is whether those\ninstruments are adequate to address the whole spectrum\nof conflicts that the world community now faces.\nThat is clearly evident in the Syrian crisis. The\nworld community is witnessing, with great pain,\nthe worsening violence and unfolding humanitarian\ncatastrophe on the ground; at the same time, the United\nNations is in a state of paralysis in responding to the\nsituation. There is no end in sight to the conflict, and it\nappears that we have not yet seen the worst of the crisis.\nIndonesia therefore reiterates its call for the\nimmediate cessation of violence in Syria, which has\ntaken a high toll in innocent civilian lives. The Security\nCouncil must now unite and act decisively, as mandated\nby the United Nations Charter, to bring the situation\nunder control.\n\nClearly, whatever the explanation, the present\ninternational system cannot for now resolve the Syrian\nconflict. There is every likelihood that the community\nof nations will see similar conflicts in future. It will\nbe in a different corner of the world, and in a different\nform, with different actors. It will not help the cause\nof international peace if, once again, we end up being\ndivided and unable to positively alter the course of the\nconflict. The world community must develop ways to\naddress them more effectively, towards their peaceful\nend.\nWe must adapt to twenty-first century security\nchallenges. There is no question that the world we live\nin today is in much better condition than it was in the\ntwentieth century. Freedom has spread. The threat of\nnuclear holocaust is receding significantly. There is\nno prospect of a world war, the kind that twice created\nsuch destruction during the twentieth century. The\nglobal economy has expanded remarkably. Nations\nare becoming more interdependent. International\ncooperation and partnerships are flourishing.\nHowever, it is only relative peace, not total peace\nas yet. We have moved from the era of the cold war to\nan era of \u201cwarm peace\u201d. In this warm peace, the world\nremains stuck with an outdated international security\narchitecture that still reflects twentieth-century\ncircumstances, in contrast with the global economic\narchitecture, which has done much better in adjusting\nto the twenty-first century.\nIn this warm peace, the relationships between the\nmajor Powers are, for the first time, marked by relative\nstability and increased cooperation. But the question\nremains unanswered as to how they will accommodate\nthe growing ranks of emerging Powers that are\nreshaping the world order.\nIn this warm peace, old enmities and long-standing\nconflicts can still resurface in the new strategic\nlandscape, even carried on by new generations.\nIn this warm peace, we are seeing new security\nchallenges and opportunities arising from the seismic\npower shifts that are occurring in some regions. The\nsecurity implications of the political events in the\nMiddle East are still unfolding.\nIn this warm peace, the world community still has\nto contend with an array of unfinished business: the\nArab-Israeli conflict, nuclear disarmament, territorial disputes in the South China Sea, tensions in the Korean\npeninsula, and the like.\nIn this warm peace, new progress can easily regress.\nHard-won peace processes can stall or even crumble.\nStrategic miscalculations in disputed theatres may lead\nto rising tensions and armed clashes.\nAnd in this warm peace, pockets of hatred and\nbigotry, intolerance and extremism continue to litter\nour world.\nPerhaps we will have to live with this warm\npeace for decades. But I believe that we can lower the\ntemperature of this warm peace. Where possible, we\ncan resolve conflicts one by one. We can strengthen\nthe building blocks of peace. We can promote a new\nglobalism that can potentially change the dynamics of\nconflict resolution.\nIn order to do that, we need to try new approaches\nand be more imaginative. The first thing we have to\ndo is to evolve a new strategic mindset. Let us face it:\nremnants of the cold-war mentality still persist in parts\nof the geopolitical landscape, not least in our own United\nNations, where rigid, dogmatic, zero-sum calculations\nsometimes still come into play. For long-term peace, a\npeace born of trust and mutual confidence, we must get\nrid of that mindset. In that light, we must continue to\nwork towards a reformed Security Council, a Council\nthat reflects the strategic realities of the twenty-first\ncentury and provides security to all.\nWe must also work to perfect the instruments of\npeace, which include robust regionalism. We in the\nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) have\nseen how such regionalism can be a force for peace and\ncooperation. As a result of a strong regionalism, all of\nSouth-east Asia has thrived under ASEAN cooperation.\nSouth-east Asia, which was once the cockpit of border\nwars and the proxy wars of extra-regional Powers, has\ncome together.\nAfter ASEAN was founded, in 1967, it devoted\nthe early decades of its life as a regional organization\nto cultivating the habits of dialogue, consultation and\ncooperation, not only among its members but with its\ndialogue partners. Thus, each ASEAN country adopted\na new strategic mindset based on trust and a sense of\nhaving a stake in the success and progress of all the\nothers. Today the ASEAN family is united and at peace\nwith itself and with the rest of the world.\n\nAt the same time, we can also develop a universal\nculture of mutual tolerance and mutual appreciation of\none another\u2019s religious convictions. In such a world,\nthe voice of the moderates \u2014 the voice of reason and\ncompassion \u2014 would be heard clearly over the din of\nprejudice and bigotry. In a global regime of compassion\nand tolerance, no war is possible.\nAs a nation that celebrates its diversity of culture\nand religions, Indonesia calls for mutual respect and\nunderstanding among peoples of different faiths.\nDespite initiatives undertaken by States at the United\nNations and in other forums, the defamation of religions\npersists. We have seen yet another of its ugly faces in\nthe film \u201c Innocence of Muslims\u201d that is now causing\nan international uproar.\nThe Universal Declaration of Human Rights\nunderlines that, in exercising freedom of expression,\neveryone must observe morality and public order.\nFreedom of expression is therefore not absolute. Hence,\nI call for an international instrument to effectively\nprevent incitement to hostility or violence based on\nreligion or belief. As the product of international\nconsensus, that instrument should serve as a point\nof reference with which the world community must\ncomply.\nFor good measure, we also need to promote\na continuing process of dialogue among faiths,\ncivilizations and cultures. Of course, that dialogue\nshould not remain a dialogue, but should translate into\nactual cooperation so that peoples of different cultures\nand faiths can come together as a community and\ncare for one another. Those communities will become\nbulwarks for peace and they will make it difficult if not\nimpossible for any kind of armed conflict to erupt.\nWe must also master the art of preventive diplomacy.\nMost disputes are intractable; they simmer for what\nseems to be an eternity, but by a historical reckoning\nthey are not really long, drawn-out affairs. Sooner or\nlater, there comes a conf luence of factors and events\nthat provides a window of opportunity for resolving a\ndispute and removing conflict from the table of options.\nThat is what we in ASEAN have done with the\npotential conflicts in the South China Sea. The territorial\nand sovereignty disputes have been festering there for\nthe better part of a century. But we are managing them\nwith restraint, confidence-building and, at present,\nthrough earnest negotiations toward a legally binding\ncode of conduct in the South China Sea.\n\nFinally, the culture of peace, mutual tolerance and\nappreciation, and cooperation must be supported by the\nright kind of economics. People need to be fed, to be\nsheltered and to be assured of a future where they have\nopportunities for a living and a livelihood. That is the\nonly way for peace to be locked in for the long term;\nthat is, when it brings dividends that give human beings\nrobust confidence in the future.\nThe price of inequality between and within nations\ngives rise to tension born of grievances that can, unless\neffectively addressed, lead to radicalism and even\nviolence, which threaten international and national\npeace and security. The solution is to form a global\npartnership for poverty eradication and for achieving\nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), and then\nto formulate a post-MDG development agenda we can\nfully carry out.\nOur experience in the resolution of the intra-state\nconflict in the province of Aceh proves that, if we do\nenough for peace, if there is a conf luence of favourable\ncircumstances, and if we are prepared to seize the\nmoment, then peace can be achieved. The peace that we\nachieve will not only give temporary respite, it will also\nlast for generations.\nFor many years, peace has been treated as if it\nwere a science. There are whole libraries about how\nit can be achieved and preserved. I have come to the\nconclusion, however, that if peace has a technology it is\none born of experience. That experience can be shared\nand can be useful in creating new experience. And if\nthere is enough sharing of experiences \u2014 and that is\nwhat Indonesia is trying to achieve \u2014 and if there is\nsufficient political will to apply what is learned from\nothers to one\u2019s unique circumstances, then peace can be\nwidely spread. Peace can be effectively waged. And we\nwould have a gentler, better world."

        "file_text": "\ufeffIn a complex world, it is\nsmart economics and also smart politics to focus on\nprevention rather than cure. This holds true whether\nwe address the global economic crisis, sustainable\ndevelopment and poverty reduction, conflicts like\nthe one in Syria, or the arms trade and disarmament.\nIn that context, the inclusion of women in political\ndecision-making processes is not only the right thing\nto do, it is one of the most powerful drivers for positive\nchange.\nOur natural resources are increasingly under\npressure. By 2030, the world will need 50 per cent\nmore food, 45 per cent more energy and 30 per cent\nmore water. Thus, we must chart a new course for\nour common future and develop a new paradigm for\neconomic growth and development that will make it\npossible to deal with those challenges and to create\nopportunities for future generations.\nIn June, at the United Nations Conference\non Sustainable Development (Rio+20), we made\nsome progress, laying down the foundations for the\ntransformative process we need to pursue. But the\nhouse still has to be built, and the General Assembly\nmust provide some of the important building blocks\nto do this. Defining sustainable development goals as\npart of the overall post-2015 international development\nframework, establishing the new high-level political\nforum, and upgrading the United Nations Environment\nProgramme are all key parts of the agenda before us.\nDenmark strongly supports the Secretary-General\u2019s\nSustainable Energy for All initiative, launched\nin November 2011, and remains committed to its\nobjectives. Access to sustainable energy, improved\nenergy efficiency and increased use of renewable energy\nare all necessary conditions for achieving long-term\nsustainable development. At Rio+20, a green economy\nwas finally recognized as one of the important tools\navailable for achieving sustainable development.\nWe need to work in close partnership with both the\nprivate sector and civil society, if we are to succeed\nin transforming the global economy. The Danish\nGovernment, in partnership with the Governments\nof Mexico and Republic of Korea, last year created\na public-private partnership among progressive\nGovernments, global corporations, financial\ninstitutions and international organizations, including\nthe United Nations, called the Global Green Growth\nForum. At the second Forum meeting a week from now,\nin Copenhagen, the focus will be on resource efficiency\nand growth, reinforcing the need to decouple economic\ngrowth from unsustainable environmental pressures\nand to refocus efforts on the creation of decent jobs.\nWhile making the last push for achieving the\nMillennium Development Goals in 2015, we will start\npreparing the post-2015 international development\nframework and embark on the discussion on how to best\nformulate new and more ambitious goals beyond 2015.\nAs stated, the sustainable development goals should be\nan integrated part of this exercise. Denmark strongly\nsupports the promotion of human rights as a means to\ndevelopment, rights being understood as indivisible and\ninterdependent. Such a rights-based approach is about\nplacing people \u2014 men and women \u2014 at the centre\nand in charge of their own development. And let me\nadd, in the case of a woman, this also means the right\nto decide over her own body. That is why Denmark\nwelcomes today\u2019s launch of the high-level task force\nfor the International Conference on Population and\nDevelopment. Important parts of the rights-based\napproach are access to information, involvement in\ndecision-making and strengthening the voice of civil\nsociety.\n\nFour decades ago, the United Nations set a target\nfor developed countries to increase their official\ndevelopment assistance to 0.7 per cent of their gross\nnational income. Every year since 1978 Denmark has\nsurpassed the target, and our development assistance\nwill continue to increase over the years to come. We\ncall on other donors and potential donors, including\nemerging economies, to increase their assistance as\nwell.\nWe see a great need for support to fragile States\nlike Somalia, South Sudan, Yemen, Afghanistan and\nMali, where fragility and conflict hamper development\nand poverty reduction and may provide a breeding\nground for all kinds of instability. We see positive signs\nin those countries, but there are still many challenges,\nand we therefore require strong and continuous political\ncommitment, both within the countries themselves and\non the part of the international community, in order\nto succeed. We in the international community need\nto take a closer look inside our toolbox and find the\nright mix of development assistance and security policy\nresponse, including ways of addressing terrorism\nand in some cases piracy. In conflict-affected and\nfragile countries, there is a need to understand that\nwithout security there can be no development and\nthat without development there can be no security.\nDenmark actively participates in promoting the New\nDeal for Engagement in Fragile States, and we are\ncurrently co-chairing the International Dialogue on\nPeacebuilding and State-building. A peaceful and\nprosperous development in fragile States stands at\nthe heart of Danish development policy, most recently\nexemplified in the Sahel region. Denmark shares\nthe ambition of the International Dialogue to have\npeacebuilding and statebuilding goals firmly reflected\nin the post-2015 international development framework.\nWe must also use international cooperation to\nreduce the level of conflicts and to set clear rules for\nall to abide by. Unregulated and irresponsible trade\nof conventional weapons is often the direct cause of\nunbearable human suffering. It further destabilizes\nweak and fragile States and is a hindrance to\ndevelopment. There is an urgent need for a universal\nand legally binding arms trade treaty, and, together\nwith Germany, Denmark has encouraged the Secretary-\nGeneral to continue his strong personal engagement\nwith respect to the convening of a second arms trade\ntreaty conference early next year. Now is the time to\nact, and we call upon the members of the Assembly to successfully conclude negotiations on a treaty and to do\nso without delay.\nLet me use this occasion to once again call on\nthe Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, and more\nparticularly on Iran, to comply with international\nlaw and relevant Security Council resolutions. It is\nin Iran\u2019s own interest to take concrete steps to build\ninternational confidence in the exclusively peaceful\nnature of its nuclear programme. The Treaty on the\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons is a cornerstone\nof international cooperation on disarmament and\nnon-proliferation. In this context, Denmark actively\nsupports the work of the Finnish facilitator to organize\na conference on the Middle East as a zone free of\nweapons and materials of mass destruction.\nFor Denmark and the European Union, the rule\nof law is critical to international peace and security,\nhuman rights and development. It is a fundamental\nprinciple of good governance, whereby the State is\naccountable to its citizens and ensures their human\nrights and fundamental freedoms, as well as their\nparticipatory rights. We therefore welcome the outcome\nof last week\u2019s High-level Meeting on the Rule of Law\nat the National and International Levels (resolution\n67/1) and the commitments made by Member States.\nDenmark also looks forward to an effective follow-up\nto the High-level Meeting.\nInternational agreement on the responsibility to\nprotect at the 2005 World Summit was a clear statement\nby the international community that the atrocities\nand large-scale tragedies of the last century must not\nbe repeated in the twenty-first century. The global\nnetwork of national focal points on the responsibility to\nprotect \u2014 an initiative launched by the Governments of\nDenmark and Ghana, Costa Rica and Australia \u2014 is an\napproach to encourage and assist States in developing\ntheir national capacities and mechanisms for the\nprevention of mass atrocity crimes. We call on all\nStates to appoint national focal points and to join the\nnetwork, thereby demonstrating their commitment to\ndecisive and timely prevention and response.\nEven as I speak, we are witnessing in Syria a\nGovernment that is not living up to its moral and political\nobligations. Instead, it pursues a violent path of trying\nto quell the cry for freedom, for democratic reforms\nand for human rights. Despite several promises made\nto the international community during the last year, the\nAl-Assad regime has not stopped the violence. Instead we have only heard the sound of machine guns, heavy\nweapons and airplanes firing away at civilians. Since I\nstood here at this rostrum a year ago (see A/66/PV.29),\nthe situation has only deteriorated. Last year about\n2,600 people in Syria had died in the conflict. Now,\nmore than 20,000 people have suffered that fate. The\nSyrian people are f leeing from the shooting spree,\nand a quarter of a million of them are now refugees\nin neighbouring countries. More than a million people\ninside Syria are in need of humanitarian assistance.\nWe condemn the brutal violence and massacres of\ncivilians in the strongest terms. The time has come to\nstop the bloodshed and the suffering of the Syrian people.\nWe cannot look away while the increasing sectarian\nviolence spirals out of control, the humanitarian\nemergency escalates and the crisis spills over borders.\nPresident Al-Assad has lost all legitimacy and must\nstep aside to allow for a peaceful and democratic\ntransition. At the same time, those responsible for gross\nhuman rights violations must be brought to justice. We\ncommend the very valuable work done by the Human\nRights Council\u2019s Commission of Inquiry on Syria.\nWe note in particular that the Commission has stated\nthat it is likely that crimes against humanity have been\ncommitted by the Syrian regime. The international\ncommunity must act on that information. Denmark calls\non the Security Council to refer the case of Syria and\nthe serious violations of international humanitarian law\ncommitted in the country to the International Criminal\nCourt.\nWe urge the Security Council to unite and agree on\nstrong measures, including comprehensive sanctions,\nto enforce the six-point plan endorsed by the Council.\nWe cannot afford to continue waiting for a change of\npolicy on the part of the regime, which it shows no sign\nof ever making. The Syrian people need action. At the\nsame time, we strongly encourage the Syrian opposition\ngroups to agree on a set of shared principles for working\ntowards an inclusive, orderly and peaceful transition\nin Syria to a future free of Al-Assad and his brutal\nregime. While thanking former Secretary-General Kofi\nAnnan for his valuable contribution to finding a lasting\nsolution to the conflict, we now put our trust in the new\nJoint Special Representative of the United Nations and\nthe League of Arab States, Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi, and\nin his efforts at reaching a political solution.\nThe negative developments in Syria stand in sharp\ncontrast to the situation in other countries that have\nbeen affected by the Arab winds of change. Calls for reforms, economic justice, democracy and respect for\nhuman rights have been heard, and in countries like\nTunisia, Morocco, Egypt and Libya things are moving,\nand generally in the right direction. But there are also\nsigns that progress is not universal, for example, the\nrecent decision by the Bahraini Court of Cassation to\nuphold the convictions of 20 human rights activists,\nincluding a Danish national. Calling for reforms is not a\ncrime, as was rightly pointed out by the United Nations\nHigh Commissioner for Human Rights.\nLast month\u2019s election of the new Prime Minister\nin Libya by a democratically elected parliament is a\nconcrete example of progress, which makes it all the\nmore difficult to comprehend the terrible and tragic\nattack on the United States Consulate in Benghazi,\nwhich we have strongly condemned. It was a sobering\nreminder of the serious challenges that still persist in\ncountries in transition toward democracy. Democracy\ndoes not happen overnight. It takes years to develop, and\nattacks by extremists should not be allowed to derail a\nprocess that the majority of the people have fought so\nhard for. We stand firm by our commitments to Libya,\nand we stand firm in there being no justification for\nsuch attacks \u2014 none whatsoever.\nIt has been clear since the beginning of the Arab\nSpring that developments in the region make the Middle\nEast peace process and a negotiated solution even\nmore urgent and important. A year ago, the Quartet\nin its 23 September 2011 statement (SG/2178) called\nfor a peace agreement to be signed no later than the\nend of 2012. Regrettably, we face a reality which does\nnot augur well for that to happen. As things develop\non the ground, the prospects for a two-State solution,\nproviding for two independent, democratic, contiguous,\nsovereign and viable States living side by side in\npeace and security, are diminishing, not increasing.\nAs we approach the twentieth anniversary of the Oslo\nAgreement, it is indeed time to reach a final agreement.\nThe world is undergoing profound changes. Current\nand new challenges call for international resolve\nand multilateral solutions. They call for strategic\napproaches, focusing on prevention and early action to\ndismantle problems, rather than on belated responses\nand interventions to deal with them when it is too late,\ntoo inefficient and much more costly. And they call\nfor the United Nations, the strength of which lies in\nits unique legitimacy, to stand up and take the lead in\naddressing global challenges. The United Nations can make a real difference for the 7 billion people living\non this planet. It is up to all of us to ensure that it does"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI wish to say, before my\nprinted remarks begin, some words not circulated in the\ntext. It is a particular privilege and honour to represent\nmy country in this forum, having returned here through\nthe magic of democracy after five years. For the first\ntime since the general election in May, our country\nnow reaffirms its re-engagement in and with the world\ncommunity. We are part of the larger Caribbean region,\nand in that context we took part in a meeting with the\nSecretary-General of this body. We thank him for his\ncourtesy.\nHowever, it is important that the representation of\nthe Bahamas on regional engagement with the United\nNations not be misinterpreted as a complaint about\nlack of attention by the Secretariat. It was not based on\npetulance but on the simple fact that the United Nations\nin all its organs and manifestations must live up to its\ncreed that all nations in this body are equal, and not create the impression that some are more equal than\nothers. Our delegation will continue to ensure that the\nguiding principle of that equality and equity is adhered\nto strictly.\nI would like to congratulate Mr. Vuk Jeremi\u0107 on\nhis assumption of his duties as President of the General\nAssembly at its sixty-seventh session and to assure him\nof my delegation\u2019s support and cooperation throughout.\nI also commend his predecessor for his stewardship\nover the previous session.\nI also wish on this occasion to express thanks for\nthe stellar work and contribution to our country of\nour Permanent Representative to the United Nations,\nAmbassador Paulette A. Bethel.\nThe Bahamas commends the United Nations for the\nconvening and the outcome of the High-level Meeting\non the Rule of Law at the National and International\nLevels last Monday. The Bahamas has committed itself\nto the principle of the rule of law and to ensuring the\ncontinuation of good governance for the benefit of\nthe entire populace of the Bahamas. The Bahamas is\ncommitted also to adhering to the rule at law at the\ninternational level and to upholding the principles of\nthe Charter of the United Nations.\nThe Bahamas commends the convening in June\n2012 of the third biennial review of the United Nations\nGlobal Counter-Terrorism Strategy. The Bahamas\nunequivocally condemns terrorism in all its forms\nand manifestations and reiterates its commitment\nto the fight against terrorism and to the Strategy\u2019s\nfull implementation. The Bahamas renews its call\nfor the timely conclusion of negotiations on a draft\ncomprehensive international convention for the\nelimination of terrorism.\nThe Bahamas condemns in the strongest possible\nterms the violence that resulted in the deaths of\nAmbassador Christopher Stevens and three other\nUnited States diplomats a few weeks ago. We in the\ninternational community must commit wholeheartedly\nand sincerely to creating a culture of peace throughout\nthe world, underpinned by tolerance and understanding,\nthat precludes such outrageous occurrences and their\ncauses.\nThe level of armed violence and crime plaguing\nour society \u2014 due in large part to the illicit trade\nin small arms and light weapons and trafficking in\nnarcotics, neither of which our country manufactures or supplies \u2014 is increasing and cannot be allowed\nto continue if we are to save successive generations\nfrom a life steeped in violence and lawlessness. It has\nbeen more than a decade since the adoption in 2001 of\nthe United Nations Programme of Action to Prevent,\nCombat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms\nand Light Weapons in All Its Aspects. Yet there has\nbeen no abatement in the level and intensity of armed\nviolence impacting our country.\nThe Bahamas welcomes the recent convening and\nsuccessful outcome of the United Nations Conference\nto Review Progress Made in the Implementation of the\nProgramme of Action to Prevent, Combat and Eradicate\nthe Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons\nin All Its Aspects. The Government reiterates its\nunwavering commitment to the full implementation of\nthe Programme of Action. The lives of too many of our\nyoung people are being destroyed by the use of illicit\nweapons in our country. Now is the time to act.\nCreating a safe Bahamas is a top priority for the\nGovernment. We are committed to the creation of a\nnational intelligence agency and a national firearms\ncontrol strategy, including the establishment of a firearms\ndepartment and database, as well as to the enhancement\nof the operations of the country\u2019s Defence Force so that\nit can more effectively control the porous borders of the\nBahamas. I would like to take the opportunity to thank\nthe United Nations Office for Disarmament Affairs\nand the United Nations Regional Centre for Peace,\nDisarmament and Development in Latin America\nand the Caribbean for their support and provision of\nequipment and capacity-building assistance in the area\nof firearms destruction and stockpile management. The\nBahamas was pleased to conclude an agreement with\nthe United Nations Office for Disarmament Affairs last\nApril and to have participated in a number of regional\ntraining programmes and workshops sponsored by the\nRegional Centre on the illicit trade in small arms and\nlight weapons and the strengthening of border controls.\nThe Bahamas joins other delegations in expressing\nour profound disappointment at the outcome of\nthe United Nations Conference on the Arms Trade\nTreaty held in July and the failure of Member States\nto agree on a text despite six long years of protracted\nnegotiations. The Bahamas supports the views\narticulated by the delegation of Trinidad and Tobago on\nbehalf of the Caribbean Community during the month-\nlong Conference. What we say to thousands of innocent\nvictims is that their voices must be heard. But what do we say to them and their families, who are suffering as a\nresult of the irresponsible and unregulated international\ntransfer of conventional arms? Commitment and a\nreassessment of human life and dignity versus profit\nare critical if we are to prevail in our fight against the\nscourge of armed violence and terror plaguing our\nsocieties. We look forward to a successful outcome in\nthe next round of negotiations.\nThe Bahamas solemnly reaffirms its commitment\nto the three pillars of sustainable development:\neconomic, social and environmental. Advancements\ncontinue nationally in important areas pertaining to\nthe protection of our biodiversity and development\nof policies to promote renewable energy. Some argue\nthat finding out how to provide reliable and affordable\nenergy may be the single largest factor affecting the\nfuture development of the Bahamas. The issue of energy\nis so important that the Prime Minister has made it as\na personal mission to seek to solve the issue. We know\nthat we must do it sustainably.\nThe Bahamas has enacted legislation to foster the\nsustainable use and management of ecosystems through\nbetter land-use planning. Under the United Nations\nConvention on the Law of the Sea, we have initiated\nactions to preserve our fish stocks by introducing\npenalties for overfishing. We have also taken action\nto ban long-line fishing, to establish the Bahamas as a\nsanctuary for sharks and to establish and expand marine\nprotected areas. For the Bahamas, it is imperative\nthat those sustainable development strategies be\ncomplemented with appropriate actions taken by the\ninternational community. In that connection, we view\nthe historic outcome of the United Nations Conference\non Sustainable Development (Rio+20) as offering\nsignificant opportunities, particularly for small island\ndeveloping States (SIDS). We are encouraged by the\ninternational community\u2019s call for continued and\nenhanced efforts to assist SIDS in implementing the\nBarbados Programme of Action for the Sustainable\nDevelopment of Small Island Developing States and the\nMauritius Strategy for Implementation. The Bahamas\nalso welcomes plans to convene the Third International\nConference on Small Island Developing States and will\nparticipate actively in the upcoming General Assembly\nconsultations to determine the modalities of the meeting\nwith a view to ensuring a successful outcome.\nThe Bahamas is also encouraged greatly by\nthe decision taken at Rio+20 to undertake work on\nuniversal, action-oriented, sustainable development goals. In that work we must take into account different\nnational realities, capacities and levels of development\nand must respect national policies and priorities. The\nBahamas hopes to work in the context of the open-ended\nworking group for the development of the sustainable\ndevelopment goals as well as in the intergovernmental\ncommittee on financing, agreed at Rio+20, to ensure\nthat our special concerns are fully addressed.\nIn that connection, the Bahamas looks forward to\nthe recommendations of the Secretary-General\u2019s High-\nlevel Panel on global post-2015 development planning\nand commends the level of female participation therein.\nThe convening of the Panel offers a major opportunity\nto learn from the mistakes of the past and build a\nvision for global development beyond mere crisis\nmanagement. The Panel must be seen to operate with\nopen transparency. It should also incorporate the views\nof geographical and economic anomalies such as those\nof the Caribbean subregion, and be innovative and\nforward-looking.\nThe Bahamas welcomes the acknowledgement\nat Rio of the need to address the adverse impacts of\nclimate change.\nThe Bahamas believes that the United Nations has\na central role to play in global economic governance.\nThe Bahamas welcomes the efforts of the Group of 20\n(G-20), particularly Mexico in the role as current Chair,\nin helping to translate G-20 deliberations into effective\nactions on a global scale through broad consultation\namong Member States and with the United Nations itself\nto find solutions to many of the major challenges of our\ntimes, most particularly with respect to strengthening\nthe international financial system.\nThe Bahamas also envisions a greater role for the\nUnited Nations in the area of international cooperation\nin tax matters. The Bahamas, along with the wider\nGroup of 77 and China, continues to call for the\nconversion of the United Nations Committee of Experts\non International Cooperation in Tax Matters into an\nintergovernmental subsidiary body of the Economic\nand Social Council, in keeping with the Doha mandate.\nWe also continue to deplore the use by some States of\ntheir domestic laws for extraterritorial effect in such\nareas as human trafficking, financial services and drug\nsmuggling. We continue to believe that those laws\nwith extraterritorial effect are misplaced and put an\nunfair burden upon small States and that they may be\ninterpreted as a departure from the international norms of respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity\nof States.\nIn order to reverse current economic trends, one of\nthe core imperatives of the Government of the Bahamas\nis the strengthening of the domestic economy and the\nattendant creation of jobs, the broadening of Bahamian\nownership in the economy and the attainment of a\nhigher standard of living. Creating job opportunities\nand reversing the unacceptable unemployment situation\nin the country, which currently is at a high rate, have\nbeen identified at the highest political level as the\nmost critical near-term priorities for the Government,\nespecially in relation to young Bahamians. I wish to\nspeak especially on their behalf today. The young\nBahamian sector of our country has been most severely\naffected by the unemployment problem, and the rate of\nunemployment is unacceptable and cannot continue.\nWe are committed to solving youth unemployment.\nThe Bahamas underscores the need for enhanced\npolicy dialogue and international cooperation on the\nquestion of building green economies, which will indeed\nrequire new investments, skills formation, technology\ndevelopment and transfer and capacity-building.\nThe gross national income of the Bahamas is\nsignificantly affected by a small population of wealthy\nexpatriates whose high incomes skew the measure\naway from the true economic realities. The construct\nof per capita gross national income, therefore, takes\non a unique interpretation in the context of developing\ncountries like the Bahamas and, I would daresay, the\nCaribbean subregion. The Bahamas continues to be\ndeserving of considerations that will not deny us the\nright to develop sustainably, supported by financial,\nhuman and technological resources. Gross national\nincome per capita should not be used as a pretext to\nrestrict our access to financial assistance.\nThe General Assembly is set to consider, during\nthis sixty-seventh session, the scale of assessments for\nthe apportionment of the expenses of the United Nations\nregular budget and peacekeeping operations for the\nperiod 2013-2015. The Bahamas takes this opportunity\nto reiterate its long-standing position that per capita\ngross national income, for the reasons given, should not\nbe accorded overriding weight in determining capacity\nto pay.\nA representative, transparent, responsive,\naccountable, democratic and inclusive Security Council,\npredicated on an increased membership in both the permanent and non-permanent categories, as well as\non modification of its working methods, is overdue.\nMy delegation sincerely hopes that the next round of\nnegotiations on Security Council reform during this\nsession will result in tangible progress aimed at making\nthe Council all that it can and should be.\nOur desire for the realization of unfulfilled\npotential also extends to our regional partner, the\nRepublic of Haiti. The Bahamas has been unremitting\nand consistent in its support for the people of Haiti and\ntheir aspirations for peace, security and development.\nThe Bahamas commends the important role of the\nUnited Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti in\nproviding security in Haiti and in laying the foundation\nfor its long-term recovery and stability. Pledges made\ntoward Haiti\u2019s recovery and reconstruction must be\nhonoured and fulfilled so that the required work can be\nundertaken and completed.\nThe Bahamas welcomes increased dialogue on\nimproving international cooperation with respect\nto international migration and development. Illegal\nmigration from Haiti is a vexing issue for our country.\nWe agree that proper cooperation can certainly help to\nensure that migration occurs through safe and regulated\nchannels and to leverage the contributions that migrants\ncan make to the development of our country. The\nBahamas will continue to participate constructively in\nthe process leading to the second High-level Dialogue\non International Migration and Development, to be\nheld by the General Assembly in 2013, with a view to\naddressing those and other related issues so crucial to\nour development.\nGiven the events over the past year in the Bahamas\nwith regard to illegal migration, some of which have\nbeen tragic, as well as poaching in our seas by illegal\npersons from south of the country, the Bahamas will\nbe taking stronger measures over the next year to put a\nstop to those illegal activities. We appeal to all nations\nin the region to prevail upon their citizens to cease\nand desist from those unlawful activities. We intend to\nwork both bilaterally and with the broader international\ncommunity to stop these assaults on our national and\neconomic security.\nThe Bahamas has made significant strides in the\nareas of maternal and child health and HIV/AIDS in\nthis, the fiftieth year since women obtained the right\nto vote in the Bahamas. We are committed to the\nachievement of gender equality and the empowerment of women, as was affirmed by the Minister for Social\nServices during the consideration of the report on\nBahamas by the Committee on the Elimination of\nDiscrimination against Women at its fifty-second\nsession, held in July. The Bahamas, nevertheless,\nremains concerned about the increasing incidences of\nnon-communicable diseases among the population, in\nparticular women, who are disproportionately affected\nby such preventable diseases.\nWe can draw much strength, wisdom and\ninspiration from the remarkable successes of our\nnations\u2019 athletes nationally and subregionally at this\nyear\u2019s Olympics. On behalf of my delegation, I would\nlike to pay tribute to the youth of the world for their\nstellar displays of camaraderie and talent at the recent\nOlympics. In this forum, I wish to salute in particular\nthe gold medal athletes of the Bahamas, namely,\nDemetrius Pinder, Michael Mathieu, Chris Brown and\nRamon Miller. Indeed, the performances of the athletes\nfrom the entire Caribbean Community region are\nnoteworthy, particularly those of our sister countries\nGrenada, Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago. Those\nexamples can be seen as contributing as much to peace\nand development in our world as our deliberations\nand initiatives at this session, hence, our warmest\ncongratulations to them all.\nMy delegation also wishes to record in this forum\nthe passing of my late friend and brother, the late Paul\nL. Adderley, who was the longest-serving Minister\nfor Foreign Affairs of the Bahamas. His tenure\nincluded the most critical foreign policy challenges\nof an independent Bahamas to date. Sadly, he died on\n19 September. He believed in this world body and its\ntenets and exemplified how it can assist small States.\nIt is therefore only fitting that we mark and record his\npassing.\nThe Bahamas continues to believe that mankind can\naspire to and achieve a higher inner strength that not\ncan only cause us to excel even beyond our dreams, but\nalso can lift all around us, even nations and the entire\nworld. May each one of us therefore reach for that inner\nstrength, change our world and transform an agenda of\nproblems into covenants of partnerships. It remains as\ntrue as always that we need the United Nations."

        "file_text": "\ufeffOn behalf\nthe delegation of Guinea, which I have the great\nhonour to lead, I would like first of all to congratulate\nthe President on his election to guide the work of the\nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-seventh session at a time\nwhen our Organization is facing multiple challenges.\nThat mark of trust placed in him is a vibrant tribute\nto his country, the Republic of Serbia, as well as to\nhis recognized diplomatic qualities, which augur well\nfor the success of our deliberations. His predecessor,\nMr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser, of Qatar, deserves our\ngratitude and thanks for his excellent work. I should also\nlike to express my Government\u2019s highest appreciation\nto the Secretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for his\ndynamism and determination in the exercise of his\nmandate.\nThe theme of this session, \u201cBringing about\nadjustment or settlement of international disputes or\nsituations by peaceful means\u201d, lies at the very heart of\nthe uncertainty that weighs on the future of humanity.\nThe emergence of new forms of violence at the hands\nof numerous actors and non-State groups, international\nterrorism, and above all the proliferation of small arms\nand light weapons, all constitute grounds for concern.\nWhile inter-State conflicts have decreased in recent\nyears, intra-State conflicts in certain regions of the\nworld have led to political instability, general insecurity\nand human tragedies, with their attendant economic,\nsocial and environmental crises.\nIt follows that the peaceful settlement of disputes,\nas a fundamental principle of international relations,\nis becoming more indispensable than ever for the\nmaintenance of international peace and security. That\nprinciple requires sustainable preventive strategies and\nconcerted efforts on the part of regional and subregional\norganizations along with international development\npartners. The critical need for States to promote and\ndefend the purposes and principles of the United\nNations Charter and of international law is the bulwark\npar excellence against attempts against the territorial\nintegrity and sovereignty of States.\n\nInternational mediation as a means of prevention\nor a way to end violence through dialogue, along with\nnegotiation and the achievement of final agreements,\nshould be given pride of place. In that context, the\nGuinean delegation encourages the rapid deployment\nof mediators and experts. It also wishes to offer its\nemphatic support to the Secretary-General\u2019s initiative\nencouraging the role of women in the mediation process.\nIn developing States, especially in Africa,\nmediation and settlement mechanisms should be\nstrengthened through capacity-building and the\nallocation of sufficient resources to assure a holistic\nand effective approach. The institutionalization at the\nnational, regional and international levels of a culture\nof peace that includes dialogue between civilizations\nand religious tolerance is the irreversible path towards\na world of solidarity and peace.\nIn West Africa, where the northern part of our\nneighbour, Mali, has been occupied for months\nby terrorist and rebel groups, the strengthening of\ndemocratic institutions and the restoration of territorial\nintegrity constitute the primary challenges of note.\nGuinea reiterates its support for the initiatives of the\nEconomic Community of Western African States and\nthe African Union in their search for a solution to that\ncrisis, whose effects on the countries of the subregion\ncould well be devastating. In that regard, Guinea joins\nthe Government of Mali in urgently demanding the\nSecurity Council to deploy an international contingent\nto restore the territorial integrity of that brother country.\nIn Guinea-Bissau, the consolidation of peace and\nstability requires the restoration of all democratic\ninstitutions. With respect to the Great Lakes countries,\nwe support the efforts of the international community\nand the Central African Economic and Monetary\nCommunity, which seek to restore peace and security\nin the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the\nCongo, which is fundamental for the stability of that\ncountry and the region.\nIn the Horn of Africa, there has been encouraging\nprogress with respect to the peace process in Somalia.\nThe implementation of a new federal Parliament, the\nadoption of a new interim Constitution and the election\non 10 September of Mr. Hassan Sheikh Mohamud\nas President of the Republic, all demonstrate the\ncommitment of the Somali people, the Intergovernmental\nAuthority on Development, the African Union and\nthe United Nations to support peace, democracy and reconciliation in that country. The Government of\nGuinea would like, at this time, to express its warmest\ncongratulations to the African Union Military Observer\nMission in Somalia.\nGuinea also supports the ongoing negotiations\nbetween the Governments of the Sudan and South Sudan\nregarding post-independence issues, in accordance\nwith the African Union road map of 24 April 2011,\nas approved by the Security Council in its resolution\n2046 (2012). We welcome the agreement reached by the\nparties on sharing petroleum revenue.\nIn the Middle East, the restoration of lasting\npeace in the region must of necessity depend on the\ncreation of an independent Palestinian State, living\nin peace and security side by side with the State of\nIsrael. The situation in Syria increasingly cries out to\nthe international community. We urge the concerned\nparties to spare no efforts to halt the violence, protect\nthe population and restore peace. My Government\nreaffirms its support for the declaration on Syria of\nthe recent extraordinary session of the Organization of\nIslamic Cooperation.\nThe adoption on 21 June of the outcome document\n(resolution 66/288, annex) of the United Nations\nConference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20)\noffered the international community an opportunity\nto renew its political commitment to sustainable\ndevelopment in all its dimensions \u2014 economic, social\nand environmental. The priority of the international\ncommunity today should be the effective implementation\nof the commitments made to take into account the\nlegitimate concerns of all countries, in particular in\nAfrica. To that end, Guinea remains convinced that\ndefining a post-2015 development agenda must take\ninto account the complementarity of the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) and the sustainable\ndevelopment goals resulting from Rio+20 in order to\nensure maximum benefit from the subsequent synergy.\nIn consideration of Africa\u2019s post-2015 development\nagenda, at the proposal of my country, the fifth Joint\nAnnual Meetings of the African Union Conference of\nMinisters of Economy and Finance and the Economic\nCommission for Africa Conference of African Ministers\nof Finance, Planning and Economic Development, held\nin Addis Ababa in March, and the seventeenth session of\nthe High-level Committee on South-South Cooperation,\nheld in New York in May, agreed to promote South-\nSouth and triangular coalition. \n\nSouth-South and triangular cooperation is now\nbecoming a new modality for international cooperation\nin order to deal with the debt and financial market\ncrises and the lack of traditional official development\nassistance and implement international development\ngoals, such as the MDGs and the Istanbul Programme\nof Action, among others. From this rostrum, I would\nlike to launch an urgent appeal to all Member States\nand development partners to support that innovative\ninitiative of solidarity by the international community\ntowards Africa. The continent remains the weakest link\nin the international development mechanism despite its\nvast potential and its economic performance in recent\nyears.\nSince the election in 2010 of President Alpha Cond\u00e9\nto the highest office, the Government has undertaken\nan vast programme of democratization and political,\ninstitutional, economic and social reforms. At the\npolitical level, a law on the fair reconstitution of the\nIndependent National Electoral Commission, adopted\nby the National Transition Council, was approved by\nthe President. We hope that that will open the way for\nthe holding of legislative elections by the end of the\nyear.\nI would like to reiterate the Government\u2019s\ncommitment to continuing to promote human rights\nand to ensure public freedoms. To meet the various\nchallenges facing the country following the 2010\npresidential election, the Government has submitted\nto the Peacebuilding Commission a request for support\nand assistance in three priority areas, namely, national\nreconciliation and unity, security sector reform and\nyouth and women\u2019s employment.\nThose priorities resulted in a statement of\nmutual commitment, adopted here in New York on\n23 September 2011 in the presence of our Head of\nState. A year later, the implementation of those mutual\ncommitments has produced encouraging results thanks\nto the significant efforts of the Government, the United\nNations and other partners. I would especially like to\nwelcome the significant progress in security sector\nreform, in particular the biometric census of troops and\nthe retirement of nearly 4,000 soldiers.\nIn order to build on those achievements, we believe\nthat Guinea and its partners should benefit from the\nmomentum and trust created by those initial steps to\ncontinue the reform by extending it to all components\nof the security sector, in particular the police and the judiciary. We are convinced that strengthening the\nsecurity and stability of the country and of the subregion\ndepend on that.\nIn the economic and social field, there has been\nsignificant progress in combating the macroeconomic\nimbalances and in improving prospects for growth and\npeople\u2019s living conditions.\nThose policies enabled Guinea to reach the\ncompletion point of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries\nInitiative a few days ago, following meetings of the\nExecutive Boards of the International Monetary Fund\nand the World Bank. The subsequent foreign debt relief\nwill make it possible to release significant financial\nresources to investment in basic social services to\nalleviate poverty. The normalization of relations with\ncreditors, restoring the State\u2019s credibility, will promote\naccess to new foreign financial resources. However,\nthe Government of Guinea is aware that reaching the\ncompletion point is only a first step and that many\nchallenges must be overcome to launch the country\non the path of sustainable growth. Our objective is to\nrapidly raise the country to the ranks of an emerging\neconomy through the exploitation of its natural\nresources.\nI would like to conclude by reiterating Guinea\u2019s\nfirm support for efforts to reform the General\nAssembly and the Security Council so as to strengthen\nthe effectiveness and democratic governance of our\nuniversal Organization."

I would also like to commend the\nexcellent work done under the presidency of Mr. Nassir\nAbdulaziz Al-Nasser during the sixty-sixth session. I\nwholeheartedly express my deepest thanks to Secretary-\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon for the particular attention he\nfocuses on our post-conflict country, where the quest\nto achieve and build peace remains a major challenge\non the road to reconstruction and development. I also\ncommend his tireless efforts to strengthen the role of\nthe United Nations and to consolidate ever more firmly\nthe moral authority of the Organization.\nBefore conveying our assessments and perspectives\non the main recurring themes of the general debate,\nwhich constitute a litany of global concerns, let me\nfirst say that my country welcomes the initiative in\nconvening at the outset of the current session the\nHigh-level Meeting on the Rule of Law at the National\nand International Levels. That is an issue of critical\nimportance, considering that the rule of law itself is\nbeing harshly put to the test all over the world. All\nStates and all international institutions should strive to\npromote the rule of law at both the national and the\ninternational levels. Strengthening the rule of law and\ndemocratic institutions is of the utmost importance,\nbecause they represent the guardians of sovereignty\nand peaceful coexistence.\nThe real battle at the national and international\nlevels is to enforce respect for the rule of law wherever\nchaos prevails. Many challenges remain in maintaining\nthe rule of law. Hotspots persist and old conflicts erupt\nanew in many parts of the world, causing tragedy and\nthreatening to unravel the rule of law.\nIn Africa the rule of law is particularly at risk of\nbreaking down, threatened by tensions, disputes and\nconflicts in a number of high-tension areas, especially\nMali, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the\nSudan, South Sudan and Somalia. The same applies\nto other crises all over the world, carrying untold risk\nto governance and stability within countries, not to\nmention to international relations.\nThe Government of the Central African Republic\ngoes to great lengths to support efforts to promote\nthe rule of law, justice and transparency through its\nmanagement of the national institutions charged with\nenforcing the rule of law. Without peace and stability\nat the global and regional levels, national security and stability are out of the question, and therefore so is the\nrule of law.\nAll around the globe we hear cries for freedom and\ndemocracy. Since 1989 the world has been in a period\nof change that has sparked much political fire in Africa.\nWith the international transformations of the 1990s,\nmany African States, including the Central African\nRepublic, have begun to move towards democratizing\ntheir political systems. Democracy, good governance\nand human rights are interdependent. We can say that\nthere can be no rule of law unless those values are\nrespected, both by Governments and the governed.\nThe support and programmes designed to respond to\ncitizen\u2019s expectations must take those shared values\ninto account, and the Government of the Central\nAfrican Republic strives to achieve that every day. The\nCentral African Republic has returned to democratic\npractices, and there is no question that through the\nevolving democratic process efforts have been made to\nimprove the management of public affairs politically,\neconomically and socially. But we must admit that\nmuch remains to be done, and it is something that the\ninternational community must commit to collectively.\nMy country\u2019s commitment to human rights has\nbeen demonstrated, not only through its full accession\nto many if not almost all, of the relevant international\nand regional instruments, but also in practice, through\nits encouragement of those rights. Under the leadership\nof General Fran\u00e7ois Boziz\u00e9, President of the Republic\nand Head of State, we adopted a new Constitution on\n27 December 2004. The Constitution enshrines the\nprinciples of good governance, maintains the rule\nof law and respect for human rights, and broadens\nthe scope of individual and collective liberties. The\nConstitution also provides for recognition of the\nprinciple that international conventions ratified by the\nCentral African Republic take precedence over national\nlegislation, thus encouraging the harmonization of our\nlaws with our international commitments.\nIn expressing its political will within the framework\nof the defence of civic and political rights protected by\nthe African Charter of Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights, the\nCentral African Republic implements the provisions\nof that Charter, which have been incorporated into its\nlaws. The Government is also making efforts to protect\nand encourage vulnerable groups, such as women and\nchildren and minorities, through social policies that\nbenefit them.\n\nWe are aware that the press is the fourth estate in\nevery democracy. In order to guarantee the exercise\nof the freedom of the press in the Central African\nRepublic, the Government enacted, on 22 February\n2005, Ordinance No. 05002, concerning freedom of\ncommunication, which relaxes the laws concerning\npress offences, notably by replacing prison terms with\nordinary fines for any contravention of the laws in\nquestion.\nIn an effort to avoid post-electoral political crises,\nthe Government, the political parties \u2014 both the\nmajority and the opposition parties \u2014 trade unions and\ncivil society are currently reviewing the electoral code\nin order to correct dysfunctional areas that were noted\nduring the election campaigns of January 2011. The\nwork being done will enable Central African political\nactors to undertake reforms and essential improvements\nfor the next electoral cycle in a spirit of dialogue and\nconsensus.\nThe state of the world should make us aware of\nthe urgent need to strengthen multilateralism in order\nto avoid the collective disaster we face, if we do not\nspeedily come up with appropriate and agreed-on\nsolutions to our global problems. The fundamental\ngoals of disarmament and the non-proliferation of\nweapons of mass destruction continue to be held\nhostage to the policy of the double standard, along with\nthe discriminatory practices and lack of respect for\ncommitments undertaken on the part of certain nuclear\nPowers.\nThe fight against terrorism and violations of\nhuman rights around the world, which is approached\nselectively, and the biased implementation of\ninternational humanitarian law has given rise to\nlegitimate doubts as to whether those noble causes are\nbeing exploited for political ends. That calls for action\nby the Organization. Issues of climate change and the\nprotection of the natural world also demand a changed\napproach that takes into account the aspirations of all\npeoples. Floods and energy and drought-induced food\ncrises continue in some parts of the world, and such\ncrucial issues require greater mobilization on the part\nof the international community.\nThis year we will renew the debate on the central\nrole of the United Nations system, while putting\nparticular emphasis on the global governance that it\nembodies. The Organization remains the keystone of\nthe new world order and the conscience of humankind. That is why the need is greater than ever for a United\nNations that can take on a more leading role in that\nglobal governance, a groundbreaking organization\nthat will be at the forefront of actions promoting an\ninclusive framework and global and lasting solutions\nto all the crises that trouble our world and have direct\nrepercussions for human rights.\nIncreasing multipolarization and economic\nglobalization, the recent evolution of world economic\ngovernance and growing cooperation between\nemerging countries have all presented valuable\ndevelopment opportunities to many countries around\nthe world. The United Nations is the most universal and\nrepresentative intergovernmental organization with the\ngreatest authority, and it is the most important platform\nfor achieving multilateralism. Since its establishment it\nhas played a huge and irreplaceable role in maintaining\nworld peace, promoting shared development and\nstrengthening international cooperation. In today\u2019s\nworld its role must be reinforced, not weakened.\nThe Central African Republic will continue to\nsupport the essential and rational reform of the United\nNations in line with the evolution of the international\nsituation, in order to increase its authority and\neffectiveness, strengthen its capacity to deal with\nnew threats and challenges and better implement\nthe mandates entrusted to it by the Charter. Both\nthe revitalization of the General Assembly and the\nnecessary reform of the Security Council in order to\nmeet the legitimate aspirations of developing countries,\nin particular in Africa, are certainly valid.\nThe issue of civilian resources needed in postconf\nlict situations takes us back to the Organization\u2019s\ninitial purpose: to be a centre for the coordinated efforts\nof nations to maintain international peace and security\nthrough peaceful means. The Charter has given rise to\ntwo texts on the peaceful settlement of disputes: the\nGeneral Assembly Manila Declaration on the Peaceful\nSettlement of International Disputes of 1982 (resolution\n37/10, annex) and the 1988 Declaration on the Prevention\nand Removal of Disputes and Situations Which May\nThreaten International Peace and Security and on the\nRole of the United Nations in this Field (resolution\n43/51, annex). We could also mention resolution 47/120,\nentitled \u201cAn Agenda for Peace\u201d, drawn up following\nthe summit meeting of the Security Council in January\n1992 convened to establish a doctrine of preventive\ndiplomacy in order to anticipate crises or to facilitate\ntheir settlement through the mechanisms of good offices, mediators and special envoys of the Secretary-\nGeneral supported by the Mediation Support Unit.\nIn that context, the Government of the Central\nAfrican Republic welcomes the African Union\u2019s\nlaunching of the African Solidarity Initiative in July. Its\naim is to mobilize contributions of all kinds in support of\nthe various reconstruction phases in African countries\nemerging from conflict. Post-conflict reconstruction is\ncomplex and requires short-, medium- and long-term\nprogrammes to prevent violence from escalating and\nthe reoccurrence of violent conflict and to strengthen\nand consolidate a lasting peace.\nUnder the presidency of President Boziz\u00e9, the\nCentral African Republic, a post-conflict country that\nowes much to the virtues of dialogue, quickly noted\nthe significance of such a tool in the prevention and\nsettlement of national crises. In that regard, I would\nlike to draw the international community\u2019s attention to\nthe fact that the Central African Government has made\nthe issue of mediation a priority concern in its work\nplan. To that end, it established the National Mediation\nCouncil.\nWe should perhaps go further in establishing\ncivilian mediation bodies for the restoration of peace,\nwhose members would be charged with visiting the\nwarring parties in order to establish dialogue between\nthem and to help them to settle their disputes through\npeaceful means.\nThe Central African Republic affirms that there\ncan be no rule of law without respect for and the\npromotion of rights and freedoms, including that of\nreligion, which should be practiced without extremism,\nthe consequences of which often lead to a clash of\ncivilizations. Regional and international meetings have\ntaken place in the context of the dialogue of civilizations.\nHowever, violence and intolerance continue to affect\nsocial relations.\nThis is the place to express to the American\npeople the sincere condolences of the Central African\nGovernment over the attacks on the United States\nconsulate in Benghazi, which led to the death of\ninnocent victims."

        "file_text": "\ufeffI warmly\ncongratulate Mr. Jeremi\u0107 on his election as President of\nthe General Assembly at its sixty-seventh session, and I\nthank Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser for his excellent\nleadership of the Assembly during the previous session.\nI also thank Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his\nefforts on behalf of the United Nations in the past year.\nOur new world is experiencing popular uprisings,\nintra-State conflicts, climate change disasters, global\nfinancial crises, food and energy insecurity, human\nrights violations, terrorism and so forth. These and\nother experiences call for collective efforts towards\npeaceful resolution at the United Nations. I therefore\ncommend the theme for this year\u2019s deliberations,\nnamely, \u201cBringing about adjustment or settlement of\ninternational disputes or situations by peaceful means\u201d.\nIn that context, I would like to recall the role of\nmy father, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the\nFather of the Nation, who from this rostrum 38 years\nago espoused the principles of friendship towards\nall and malice towards none, the peaceful settlement\nof disputes, the renunciation of the use of force in\ninternational relations, and contributing to global peace\nand security. In essence, his policy at home and abroad\nwas based on justice and peace. At home, during my\nlast tenure as Prime Minister, in 1997, those policy\nguidelines inspired me to settle a 20-year conflict that\nhad cost more than 20,000 lives, through the signing of\nthe Chittagong Hill Tracts Peace Accord. In February\n2009, during my current tenure, I was able to peacefully\nsettle the volatile mutiny of our border guards, thus\naverting a dangerous crisis.\nWe have also put increased emphasis on improving\nexternal relations. I was able to resolve a 25-year-old\nissue with India on sharing the water of the River\nGanges with the signing in 1996 of the 30-year Ganges\nWater Sharing Treaty. Last year the 2011 Protocol to\nour 1974 Land Boundary Agreement settled a border\ndemarcation issue that had gone unresolved for 64\nyears. We also addressed mutual concerns about a\ndam proposed by India across a common river. With\nour other neighbour, Myanmar, we reached a peaceful\nsettlement of a 41-year maritime boundary dispute\nthrough the International Tribunal for the Law of the\nSea.\nOur national and international commitment to peace\nhas also been demonstrated by our position among the\ntop contributors to United Nations peacekeeping and as a\nfounding member of the Peacebuilding Commission. As\nthe current Chair of the Commission, on 25 September\nwe held an event entitled \u201cPeacebuilding: the way\nforward towards sustainable peace and security\u201d, in\nwhich many here participated. As a member of the\nHuman Rights Council and of the Economic and Social\nCouncil, we promote justice, peace, democracy, gender\nequality, secularism, the rule of law and the rights of\nminorities and vulnerable groups. As a member of the\nexecutive bodies of the United Nations Development\nProgramme, the United Nations Population Fund, the\nUnited Nations Office for Partnerships, UNESCO,\nthe Food and Agriculture Organization of the United\nNations, the International Maritime Organization and\nthe Universal Postal Union, we advocate setting global\nnorms and standards.\nIn my four decades in politics for the welfare of\nthe people, I have learned that peace prevails when\njustice prevails, both within States and in relations\nbetween States. Only justice can ensure peace, which\nis so vital for development, and justice is possible\nonly through democracy, which empowers people.\nThe alternative \u2014 the absence of democracy \u2014 means\nsocial injustice, poverty, inequality, deprivation and marginalization, which encourage extremism and\nterrorism. We are therefore strengthening democracy\nand justice by empowering people by eradicating\npoverty, hunger, inequality and deprivation and\nby establishing social safety nets, creating jobs,\npromoting inclusiveness, sustained growth and human\ndevelopment, and by countering terrorism.\nThe principles to which I have just referred\nalso encouraged me to present a model for people\u2019s\nempowerment and development at the sixty-sixth session\n(see A/66/PV.22). The model encompasses six mutually\nreinforcing peace multipliers: first, eradicating poverty\nand hunger; secondly, reducing inequality; thirdly,\nmitigating deprivation; fourthly, including excluded\npersons; fifthly, accelerating human development;\nand sixthly, eliminating terrorism. That model was\nendorsed by the Assembly in resolution 66/224, adopted\nby consensus last year. In Dhaka, on 5 and 6 August\n2012, we held an international conference to discuss\nthe model, and the 62 participating countries supported\nits consideration at the sixty-seventh session of the\nGeneral Assembly. I highly appreciate their support. I\nalso seek the Assembly\u2019s support for disseminating the\nmodel.\nIn our efforts to achieve people\u2019s empowerment,\nparliamentary standing committees were established\nduring the first session of the Parliament that was\nconstituted immediately after the general elections of\n2008. There are 50 such committees, and many are\nchaired by members of Parliament from the opposition\nbench. We also introduced the Prime Minister\u2019s question\ntime and strengthened commissions on anti-corruption,\nhuman rights and information. We ensured an\nindependent, proactive judiciary, strengthened the rule\nof law and established human rights, accountability,\nsecularism and rights of minorities. We proceeded\nwith regional multimodal connectivity to empower\nall people. We modernized education in madrasas. We\nentrenched the election commission and democratic\ninstitutions for holding 5,182 elections in a completely\nfree and credible atmosphere. We freed and expanded\nthe media, with 24 private television channels, 7 news\nagencies, 11 FM and 14 community radio stations, 320\ndaily newspapers and 151 periodicals.\nSince justice is the basis for empowering people for\npeace and development, women should have an equal\nrole. To expedite the process of their empowerment,\ngirls are provided free education up to higher secondary\nschool under our new education policy. Women are also\nencouraged to be active in our national life. Women\u2019s\nleadership has been developed from the grass-roots\nlevel to the national level. Their participation in politics\nhas been increased since the general elections in 2008.\nSo far, 12,838 women have been elected to local\nGovernment bodies, and 69 women are members of the\nParliament, constituting 20 per cent of the total number\nof members of Parliament. Besides my being the Prime\nMinister and Leader of the House, other women include\nthe Opposition Leader, the Deputy Leader of the\nHouse, five Cabinet ministers and a Whip. Of general\nGovernment posts, 30 per cent are reserved for women,\nsome of whom serve in very senior positions in the\njudicial, administrative and diplomatic fields, as well\nas in the armed and law enforcement services and as\nUnited Nations peacekeepers.\nOur efforts to empower people in my present\ntenure have so far helped in reducing poverty by 10 per\ncent, attaining a gross domestic product growth rate of\n6.5 per cent and enhancing per capita income by 34.6 per\ncent. They have helped to reduce overall inflation\nfrom double digits to 4.97 per cent, with food inflation\ndeclining from 13 per cent in 2008 to 2.25 per cent at\npresent. Our efforts have assisted in the employment of\n7.5 million in the private sector and half a million in the\npublic sector. Exports have increased annually by 19 per\ncent over 2009 figures to $24.3 billion in 2011-2012. We\nhave helped to arrange overseas jobs for 1.87 million\nnationals, increasing annual inward remittances by\n10 per cent over 2009 to $12 billion in 2011-2012.\nWe have maintained macroeconomic stability. We\nhave expanded information and communications\ntechnology facilities among the lowest tier of local\nGovernment to ensure the availability of e-services to\nrural people. Nearly 100 per cent of school-age children\nare enrolled in in primary schools. We have achieved\ngender parity in primary and secondary education and\nhave established 12,000 community clinics to ensure\nnutrition and health care for rural people, especially\nmothers and children. A climate change trust fund has\nbeen set up to implement adaptation and mitigation\nprogrammes. All those undertakings have helped in\nachieving Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)\n3, 4 and 5, on gender parity and infant and maternal\nmortality, ahead of 2015.\nOur achievements have earned us global recognition\nthrough MDG, South-South and Food and Agriculture\nOrganization awards. Importantly, the Secretary-\nGeneral has acknowledged those achievements by including me as a member of the Scaling Up Nutrition\nLead Group and as a champion for the Education First\ninitiative. We welcome his high-level panel on the\npost-2015 development agenda, which should consider\ncoherence with the sustainable development goals and\nshould prioritize poverty, hunger, nutrition, global\nfood and energy security, climate change and global\npartnership for sustainable development.\nI hope that the high-level panel will also consider\nformulating a position on the painful plight of autistic\nand disadvantaged children, who constitute about\n1 per cent of the world\u2019s population. At home, we have\nput in place 55 special-needs schools and a centre for\nneurodevelopment and autism in children. In July 2011,\nwith the collaboration of the World Health Organization\nand Autism Speaks, we launched a global autism public\nhealth initiative. At the current Assembly session we\nwill submit a draft resolution on the autism spectrum\ndisorder, which I hope will receive the Assembly\u2019s\nsupport.\nOur efforts are hindered by unjust developments\nresulting from climate change, such as increasing\npoverty, property loss, human displacement and the\nconsequent terrorism. The inevitable sea-level rise will\ncreate mass movements of displaced migrants. A new\nlegal regime ensuring social, cultural and economic\nrehabilitation of climate migrants \u2014 which I called for\nat the Assembly\u2019s sixty-fourth session \u2014 must be put\nin place.\nIt was also emphasized at the Dhaka meeting in\n2011 of the Climate Vulnerable Forum that an alliance of\ncountries most vulnerable to climate change and rising\nsea levels has to be forged. As the current Chair of the\nForum, Bangladesh launched the second edition of the\nClimate Vulnerability Monitor yesterday in New York.\nI also reiterate my call for an international agreement\nlimiting greenhouse-gas emissions on the principle of\ncommon and differentiated responsibilities, on early\noperationalization of the Green Climate Fund for, inter\nalia, adaptation, mitigation and technology transfer.\nClosely linked to climate change is global food\nand energy security. The increase of food and energy\nprices due to climate change can be very disturbing\nindeed. It has dangerous implications for least\ndeveloped countries, which is why they need greater\ninternational support for socioeconomic security, for\nduty-free and quota-free access of their products to\nall markets, for the fulfilment of official development\nassistance commitments, for an equal voice in Bretton\nWoods institutions and other international financial\ninstitutions, and for free movement of labour to all\ncountries. In fact, we should immediately implement\nMode IV of the General Agreement on Trade in Services\nto benefit both sending and receiving countries.\nWe should also ensure documentation, safe\nmigration and the protection of the rights of migrant\nworkers, especially women and children, as a shared\nresponsibility of sending and receiving States in the\nWorld Trade Organization.\nThe blatant injustice perpetrated against, and\nmurder, torture and humiliation of the Palestinian\npeople by Israel marks a shameful chapter in human\nhistory. Deep frustrations at the injustice in Palestine\nand in other places also fuel terrorism. It is vital to\nresolve the Palestine and similar burning questions\nthrough justice and the establishment of democratic\nrights.\nIn Bangladesh, from 2001 to 2006, an environment of\nterrorism prevailed. Under the patronage of the previous\nBNP-Jamaat Government, such internationally banned\nterrorist outfits as Jama\u2019atul Mujahideen Bangladesh,\nHarkatul Jihad, Hizb ut-Tahrir and Lashkar-e-Toiba,\namong others, carried out bomb and grenade attacks\nwith impunity, every other day, to eliminate the secular\nand progressive parties. Prominent instances were the\nbomb attacks on four cinemas killing 19 people on\n5 December 2002; the grenade attack on the British\nHigh Commissioner on 21 May 2004; bomb blasts at\n500 places in 63 out of 64 districts within a span of half\nan hour on 17 August 2005; grenade and firearm attacks\nthat killed former Finance Minister and Executive\nDirector of the Economic and Social Commission\nfor Asia and the Pacific Mr. S.A.M.S. Kibria, MP,\nMr. Ahsanullah Master, MP, Mr. Mumtazuddin, MP,\nand two popular judges inside the court premises.\nI was myself a target of a grenade attack at a public\nmeeting on 21 August 2004, which left 24 people dead\nand nearly 500 injured. Somehow, I miraculously\nsurvived. Another heinous kind of terrorism that we\nexperienced in Bangladesh was the brutal assassination\nof my father and the Father of the Nation, Bangabandhu\nSheikh Mujibur Rahman, and 18 members of our family\non 15 August 1975 by some misguided army personnel\nseeking to usurp State power. At that time, I was abroad\nwith my sister, Sheikh Rehana, and thus escaped\ndeath. In view of our nation\u2019s tragic experiences with terrorism, my Government has adopted a firm policy of\nzero tolerance of terrorism and all forms of extremism.\nI conclude by joining the vast majority of United\nNations Members in stressing once again the urgent\nneed to reform the United Nations, the Bretton Woods\nInstitutions and other international financial institutions.\nTheir structures and decision making processes reflect\na balance of power that is 60 years old, serving the\ninterests of a privileged few and ignoring the large\nmajority. The new millennium, with its large number\nof independent sovereign States and globalization,\nhas ushered in a new world order. Today, we speak\nboldly of justice, equality, democracy, freedom, human\nrights, environment and the adverse impact of climate\nchange, among other things. These are the priorities of\nour time, which we must acknowledge in place of the\nbitter experiences of the past. The new world order of\nnations has to be based on justice, mutual respect and\nsovereign equality if we are to evolve towards the world\nof peace and hope that we wish to leave to our future\ngenerations.\nMay Bangladesh live forever! Long live the United\nNations!"

We also wish to express our appreciation\nto the outgoing President, His Excellency Mr. Nassir\nAbdulaziz Al-Nasser, for his dedication to the work\nof the Organization. We especially thank him for his\nefforts to encourage us all to meet successfully the\nconsiderable challenges now being posed by life in the\ntwenty-first century.\nAt the same time, we would also like to thank\nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his constant\nwillingness to apply the core values of the United\nNations directly whenever he has been asked to act\non our behalf. We particularly welcome the five-year\nAction Agenda he has set out and the common vision\nit offers us. At its heart, the vision is one of tolerance,\nrespect and understanding among nations.\nSadly, over the past two weeks, we have witnessed\nevents that present a very different vision. In considering\nthem, Brunei Darussalam has stated its unreserved\ncondemnation of their cause. We have equally strongly\nadvised all our people of our Government\u2019s absolute\nrejection of the violence and extremism that have been\ntheir result. Here at the United Nations, we congratulate\nthe Secretary-General on his statement about the\nmatter. In doing so, we reaffirm our commitment to the\nuniversal values of tolerance and respect. Similarly, we\nuphold the institutions, structures and due processes\nof international affairs that this great Organization\nembodies.\nTurning now to the theme for this year\u2019s general\ndebate \u2014 \u201cBringing about adjustment or settlement\nof international disputes or situations by peaceful\nmeans\u201d \u2014 for me the key word is \u201cadjustment\u201d. I think\nit is well chosen. It suggests change that is carefully and\ngradually done. It does not invite confrontation. For us\nin Brunei Darussalam, it matches the main purpose\nof this annual meeting. We see it as an opportunity to\nexpress our satisfaction and our concern about how\nsuccessfully the United Nations is managing the process\nof globalization that we have nationally embraced.\nIn other words, are we satisfied with things as\nthey are; or do we see a need for some adjustment?\nIn answering that question, we would like to start by\nexpressing considerable satisfaction with many aspects\nof the Organization\u2019s work. The media constantly\nheadline the supposed defects, failures and setbacks of\nthe United Nations. But beneath all of that we observe\nthe enormous contribution of the United Nations to the welfare of future generations. I would therefore\nlike to express our deep satisfaction with the work of\nUnited Nations agencies and international bodies. We\nbelieve they are providing us with the opportunity\nto move out of nineteenth-century colonialism and\ntwentieth-century national interests. In the spirit of\nour theme here, they are helping us to adjust to twenty-\nfirst century regionalism and eventually, we hope, to\nsuccessful globalism.\nI would therefore like to suggest three particular\nareas we find especially important. In each, we believe\nthat the United Nations is helping to create a world\nin which the people it represents can look to a better\nfuture \u2014 one of hope rather than anguish, confidence\ninstead of fear, and trust in the place of despair.\nThe first area is the difficult long-term work being\ndone on sustainable development. We were impressed\nby the results of the Rio de Janeiro United Nations\nConference on Sustainable Development, which was\nheld in June and built on 20 years of effort. Sustainable\ndevelopment is now far more than an academic topic;\nit is firmly part of the United Nations long-term\ndevelopment agenda. Work has moved from theory into\nmany practical ideas, projects and activities.\nThe second area is covered in the United Nations\nDevelopment Programme\u2019s Millennium Development\nGoals Report 2012. We especially noted the following\nstatements by the Secretary-General in his foreword.\nThe target of reducing extreme poverty by half has\nbeen reached five years ahead of the 2015 deadline.\nThe target has been achieved on halving the proportion\nof people who lack dependable access to improved\nsources of drinking water. The conditions for more\nthan 200 million people living in slums have been\ngreatly improved. The primary school enrolment of\ngirls has equalled that of boys. There is accelerating\nprogress in reducing child and maternal mortality. We\nare especially encouraged by his conclusion that the\nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals by\n2015 is challenging but possible.\nThe third area is the sum of the ongoing efforts of\nUnited Nations agencies such as the United Nations\nDevelopment Programme, UNICEF and the Food\nand Agriculture Organization, which are operating in\nalmost 150 countries. Their work is both wide-ranging\nand specific in its emphasis upon the basic components\nof everyday life for the people we represent. Success in those three areas means that our\nchildren and grandchildren will live in a world where\nordinary people and their families have a real chance to\nlive together in hope and confidence. That is the reason\nfor our satisfaction with the work of the United Nations\nas a global Organization. In other words, in terms of\nthe fundamental work of the United Nations, we see\nno need to undertake what our theme here describes as\nadjustment.\nRather, it is in the structure of the Organization that\nwe see a need for some things to be adjusted. The reason\nappears clear to many of those of us who are small\nboth physically and politically. The current structure\nappears far too often to be the deep-seated cause of the\nheadline news I referred to. We see it as a twentieth-\ncentury structure designed to meet twentieth-century\nrealities. It is personified in the 64 years of suffering\nby the ordinary people of Palestine, and in all other\ndesperate situations in which the root causes of conflict\nand confrontation are still buried in the past century.\nSimply put, that must change. In our globalized\nworld, we are all equally interdependent and equally\nresponsible. But, like many other members in the\nAssembly, we believe that the current structure does not\ntruly reflect those realities. As such, it needs adjusting\nso that ancient political fault lines are repaired.\nThe form we hope it will increasingly take should\nresemble that of some regions today that operate on\nthe basis of consensus, rather than compromise and\nconfrontation. That is what we have accepted in our\nown region of South-East Asia. It is the spirit behind\nthe present focus of the Association of South-East\nAsian Nations (ASEAN) on building a peaceful and\nmutually respectful community of nations, regardless\nof background, economic resources or national\npreoccupations.\nThat is why we greatly appreciate the strong\nsupport and goodwill that is constantly shown us by our\nmany partners from outside the region. It is also why\nwe in Brunei Darussalam, the smallest of all Member\nnations, feel honoured and privileged to assume the\nchairmanship of ASEAN next year. That organization\nis an association of neighbours that have deliberately\nchosen to adjust their region\u2019s previous identity. Until\n45 years ago, ours was one of the most unstable regions\non Earth, a confrontation point for the national interests\nof great Powers and a focal point of the Cold War. Now, our region has adjusted, and is determined to\noperate in the interests of its community of 600 million\ncitizens. It will continue to do so not by conflict or\nconfrontation and not by compromising national\nvalues, but by peaceful consensus. In the same way, we\nhope that the structure of the United Nations can be\ngradually and carefully adjusted."

I assure him of Malaysia\u2019s full cooperation and\nsupport throughout his presidency. I would also like to\ntake this opportunity to thank the previous President,\nHis Excellency Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser, for\nhis leadership and guidance throughout the sixty-sixth\nsession.\nThe release of the distasteful and insulting film\nInnocence  of  Muslims caused a wave of widespread\nprotests across the Muslim world. The problem was\ncompounded by the publication of offensive caricatures,\nwhich further angered Muslims. It is hard to understand\nhow those responsible could resort to such actions,\nknowing that they would offend and provoke 2 billion\nMuslims, as anything other than blatant and malicious\nintent and purpose.\nIt is our obligation as peace-loving people and\nresponsible Governments to prevent a small minority of\nbigots from sowing the seed of hatred between Muslims\nand the Western world. We categorize those people as\nextremists. They insult Islam and advocate religious\nhatred. Such extremists have shown absolutely no\nregard for the implications of their actions. While\nwe condemn the irresponsible actions of those who\nintentionally incite hatred, we are equally saddened by\nthe violent reaction that ensued.\nExpressing anger by resorting to violence, killing\nand destruction does not offer any solution to the\nproblem and only results in further division and\npossibly more damage and loss of innocent lives.\nWe condemn those responsible for the death of\nAmbassador Christopher Stevens and his colleagues\nin Benghazi. We are equally saddened by the loss of\ninnocent lives, including those of women and children,\nduring emotionally charged demonstrations. A life\nlost is one too many. Those who made the video and\ndrew the caricatures, as well as those who resorted to\nkilling, are equally guilty of extremism and must be\nheld accountable and brought to justice.\nI believe that it is time to look deeper into the heart\nof the problem and dwell on the real debate \u2014 the\nrelationship between freedom of expression and social\nresponsibilities, duties and obligations. The events we\nhave witnessed cannot be defended under the pretext of human rights, freedoms and liberties. A line should be\ndrawn when the prejudicial effect outweighs everything\nelse. Malaysia has always maintained that freedom,\nincluding the freedom of expression, comes with\nresponsibility. The drafters of the Universal Declaration\nof Human Rights, I am sure, did not have denigration in\nmind when they cited the need to promote and protect\nthe freedom of expression.\nHuman rights need to be guaranteed by taking\ninto account the cultural and historical sensitivities\nof a society. Nevertheless, they should also be\napplied without selectivity or discrimination. When\nwe discriminate against women, it is called sexism;\nwhen African-Americans are criticized and vilified, it\nis called racism; when the same is done to the Jews,\npeople call it anti-Semitism; and laws are legislated\nto persecute the perpetrators. But why is it that when\nMuslims are stigmatized and defamed, it is defended as\nfreedom of expression?\nIn his statement during the International Day of\nPeace on 21 September, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon\nrightly said: \u201cWe cannot let the voices of extremists\ndominate the debate and inflame tensions. We need\nvoices of moderation and solidarity\u201d (SG/SM/14522).\nThe Prime Minister of Malaysia, two years ago in the\nAssembly, advocated a global movement of moderates\nand called for all people of the world to join the chorus\nof moderates so as to drown out the voices of extremists.\nEmbracing moderation is an important value that\nshould be ingrained in every society. Moderation\ncomes with a high degree of tolerance, trust and mutual\nunderstanding. It uses dialogue as an important tool to\nresolve disputes. With relative political peace comes\neconomic stability and socioeconomic development\nin the given country. It is therefore important that we\ncontinue to practice moderation as we face the rising\ntide of extremism. Moderation is the best response to\nextremism.\nThe first international conference of the Global\nMovement of Moderates held in Kuala Lumpur in\nJanuary this year was well attended by over 500\nparticipants from all over the world. It affirmed\nthe importance of moderation in the context of its\napplication to global issues and situations, especially\nto matters that relate to social, financial, religious\nand international politics. The Global Movement of\nModerates has gained the recognition and support\nof the Commonwealth of Nations, the Non-Aligned\nMovement and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. We believe that the Global Movement of\nModerates provides an effective platform for the global\nresponse to extremism.\nThe theme of the sixty-seventh session of the\nGeneral Assembly, \u201cBringing about adjustment or\nsettlement of international disputes or situations by\npeaceful means,\u201d is timely because it reiterates the core\nprinciples and values of the United Nations in facing\ncontinuing conflicts and situations around the world.\nWe continue to have serious concerns regarding the\nsituation in the Syrian Arab Republic. We condemn the\nviolence and senseless killing that have taken place and\nthat continue to take place. As we contemplate the next\nstep forward, we have to bear in mind that any measure\nwe take must be in the interests of the Syrian people. It\nis not about who is wrong or right; it is about putting an\nend to the bloodshed and suffering, bringing a peaceful\nand inclusive resolution to the conflict.\nThe unabated violence and killing must stop\nimmediately. The parties involved have an equal\nresponsibility for ensuring the end to the appalling\natrocities. Military aggression and armed confrontation\nwill serve only to exacerbate the problem and can never\nbe a solution to the crisis; instead, they diminish any\nlittle hope there is for peaceful settlement. We earnestly\nhope that with the appointment of Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi\nas the new Joint Special Representative of the United\nNations and the League of Arab States for Syria, a\npeaceful solution to the Syrian crisis will be found.\nTowards that end, the support of all parties, including\nthe involvement of the United Nations, is very crucial.\nThe situation in the occupied Palestinian territories\nremains bleak. For more than six decades, day after\nday, month after month, the people of Palestine have\ncontinued to see their lands confiscated to make way\nfor illegal settlements. They have continued to see their\nfamilies, including their children, displaced and forced\nfrom their homes. Elsewhere, we are quick in calling\nfor action against those who force others to live under\noppression and without freedom and dignity. But we are\nunashamed in not taking strong and decisive action to\nensure that the long-deprived Palestinians can exercise\ntheir right to their homeland and regain their dignity\nwithin the community of nations.\nSurely, the international community, especially the\nmore powerful and inf luential nations, could do more\nto bring Israel to the negotiating table for a two-State\nsolution, whereby the State of Israel and the State of Palestine could exist side by side in peace and security.\nHow can we continue to live in the face of that glaring\ninjustice without feeling an iota of guilt for not doing\nenough to bring to an end this long-standing issue?\nLike others in this Hall, Malaysia welcomes the\nconvening of the inaugural High-level Meeting on the\nRule of Law held earlier this week. At that meeting,\nwe adopted a solemn Declaration that the rule of law\nshall apply to all States equally (resolution 67/1). We\nrededicated ourselves to resolving disputes by peaceful\nmeans and in conformity with the principles of justice\nand international law. We also committed ourselves to\nupholding the right to self-determination of peoples\nwho remain under foreign occupation, and to end\nimpunity for violations of international humanitarian\nand human rights law. With that declaration, it is time\nfor the international community to put pressure on\nIsrael to fulfil its international obligations.\nAt the same time, Israel must stop all illegal\nsettlement activities in the West Bank as well as in East\nJerusalem. We are particularly concerned by the threats\nto invade or divide the site of Al-Aqsa Mosque, which\nwould be a breach of Israel\u2019s obligations as an occupying\nPower. It is a holy site for Muslims and Christians alike.\nFurthermore, Israel must lift the illegal blockade over\nGaza that has caused too much hardship for the people. It\nmust also protect the people under its occupation, fulfil\nits international obligations and respect international\nlaw. Most importantly, it ought to have direct talks\nwith the Palestinian Authority in conditions that clearly\ndemonstrate its goodwill and sincerity. A peaceful two-\nState solution, accompanied by sustainable peace in the\nregion, should be the ultimate goal for all concerned.\nRecognizing Palestine and welcoming it into\nthe community of nations has become a contentious\nissue. Palestine is punished for wanting to become a\nrightful Member of the United Nations. The feasibility\nof a two-State solution is being questioned. However,\nwhat choice does Palestine have? Furthermore, how\nwould becoming a Member of the United Nations harm\nPalestine\u2019s sincere efforts for independence?\nThe issue of Palestine\u2019s membership of the United\nNations is tied to another bigger issue that is of\nparticular concern to Malaysia. Allow me to elaborate.\nOne hundred and thirty-two countries recognize the\nState of Palestine. That number reflects more than two\nthirds of the membership of the United Nations. Yet, the\nSecurity Council \u2014 or more accurately, those members on which veto power has been conferred \u2014 are given\nthe authority to determine the fate of Palestine\u2019s\nmembership, irrespective of the opinions of the\nmajority.\nThat is just one of a host of reasons that the United\nNations, especially the Security Council, needs to be\nreformed. The Security Council will need to be able\nto cope with the many challenges that the international\ncommunity faces.\nThere are so many instances when it has failed\nto take action when action was needed most. It has\nfailed to do so because of the veto power that has been\nconferred on the five permanent members. Thus, time\nand again, it has become the victim of its own creation.\nThe composition of the Security Council should also\nreflect current global realities. It should be democratic\nand accountable so as to be able to fulfil its mandate to\neffectively maintain international peace and security.\nIt is ironic that the very institution that was formed\nin 1945 to promote and defend democracy among its\nMember States should itself be undemocratic.\nVirtually every aspect of reform has been argued\none way or another. There have been many proposals on\nthe table, but none has made any headway. Therefore,\ndespite the many years that the issue of Security Council\nreform has been on the agenda of the United Nations,\nwe are no closer to actual reform than when we first\nstarted. We call on all Member States to be realistic\nand to find workable solutions to reform. There is a\nneed to approach reform with renewed political will if\nwe genuinely want to see progress towards achieving a\nmore efficient and effective United Nations. How long\ncan we go on like this? How long can we avoid the need\nto reform the Security Council as well as the United\nNations as a whole?\nIt would be remiss of me not to mention the\nmeeting that many consider the most important one\nto have taken place this year \u2014 namely, the United\nNations Conference on Sustainable Development, held\nin Brazil last June. Although the summit is over, much\nwork remains. The actions mandated in the outcome\ndocument need our close follow-up, monitoring and\nparticipation for their successful implementation.\nStrengthening sustainable development and\nenvironmental institutions, formulating a financial\nstrategy and developing the mechanisms for facilitating\ntechnology transfer are among the important areas on\nwhich we need to act in the year ahead. Accordingly, we need to launch a process to determine sustainable\ndevelopment goals. The goals should be supported by\nconcrete action plans, with details on the various areas\nmentioned in order to implement them. Malaysia looks\nforward to working constructively and contributing to\nthat process.\nI believe that we share similar concerns on all the\nissues I have raised today. Bringing about adjustment\nor settlement of disputes or situations does not concern\nonly the parties involved in a dispute or situation, but\nis the joint collective responsibility of the international\ncommunity. In line with this year\u2019s theme, we assure\nthe Assembly of our commitment to ensuring lasting\nglobal peace and security through peaceful means by\nembracing the principles of moderation."

        "file_text": "\ufeffI wish to congratulate\nMr. Vuk Jeremi\u0107 on his election as President of the\nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-seventh session. I also\ncommend his predecessor, Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz\nAl-Nasser of Qatar, for his fine leadership during the\nlast session. In addition, I thank the Secretary-General,\nMr. Ban Ki-moon, for his tireless efforts in advancing\nsecurity, development and human rights, the three\npillars of the United Nations Charter.\nGlobal security remains a serious challenge\ntoday. States are increasing their military capabilities\nand arms sales have tripled in the last year and are\nreaching record levels. Closer to home, in the Asia-\nPacific region, new Cold War lines are being drawn\nand low-intensity territorial disputes are brewing. That\nsituation provides the option of unilateral action, which\nundermines the rule of law at the international level.\nThose challenges now demand an effective multilateral\ninstitution that responds meaningfully in real time to\nuphold the rule of law. In that regard, Solomon Islands\nwelcomes this year\u2019s theme on adjustment or settlement\nof international disputes or situations by peaceful\nmeans. It is our desire that States that find themselves\nin international disputes adhere to the rule of law and\nwork towards ensuring global peace.\nSolomon Islands emerged from an internal conflict\nsome 10 years ago. A regional peace initiative known\nas the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands\n(RAMSI) has helped restore law and order and created\nan environment for nation-building and development.\nOur gratitude goes out to all our regional neighbours.\nA national truth and reconciliation commission that\nwas set up in 2009 to investigate the causes of the conflict  submitted its report early this year. The Commission\nhas facilitated the national reconciliation and healing\nprocess, and the Government has established a working\ngroup to carefully consider the recommendations in the\nreport.\nSolomon Islands commends the General Assembly\nfor convening the High-level Meeting on the Rule of\nLaw at the National and International Levels this week.\nThe rule of law is fundamental in guiding the conduct\nof actors and addressing the realities within national\nand international jurisdictions.\nSince regaining peace and stability, Solomon\nIslands has achieved some social and economic\nprogress. For example, economically, the country has\nenjoyed steady growth in the last five years. External\nreserves continue to improve and, as of February 2012,\nthey stand at 10 months import cover. In addition,\nSolomon Islands is one of the 11 countries identified\nby the World Bank in 2012 as having most improved\nthe ease of doing business in the country across several\nareas of regulation. An economic core working group\nhas also been established to coordinate donor assistance\nand is playing an important role in public finance\nreforms, including debt management, and in creating\nfiscal buffers that enable us to cushion external shocks.\nIn the health sector, I am pleased to report that we\nhave almost eradicated malaria from two of our nine\nprovinces. Infant mortality has significantly decreased\nfrom 80 to 35 per 1,000 live births, and the maternal\nmortality rate has also decreased from 500 to 200\ndeaths per 100,000 live births. The Government and\nits development partners continue to fund medical and\nhealth centres to deliver the services needed by our\npeople.\nMajor improvements in the law and order situation\nhave resulted in the reduction of major crimes and\ncreated a safer environment in the country. We have\nalso successfully hosted a number of international\nevents, such as the Oceania football tournament of the\nInternational Federation of Association Football, the\nFestival of Pacific Arts and recently the visit by the\nDuke and Duchess of Cambridge. We have regained\nour image of the country known as the happy isles in\nthe Pacific.\nAs part of our efforts to address governance\nissues, Solomon Islands has intensified its national\nconsultations to determine the appropriate mechanisms\nto improve political integrity and stability. National\nconsultations have been conducted to obtain feedback\nfrom the community on the required institutions and\nprocesses. Strengthening governance is expensive and\nneeds international partnership. I take this opportunity\nto thank the Department of Political Affairs for its\nassistance towards our electoral reforms.\nAfter almost 10 years, RAMSI is now in its\ntransitional phase. The Government is working closely\nwith the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands\nto ensure a smooth transition as the responsibility for\nsecurity and development is placed back in the hands of\nthe Government and community. My Government will\nengage with various stakeholders, including United\nNations bodies, to consolidate the gains that have been\nmade so far and in building a resilient State.\nSolomon Islands continues to strengthen its\nrelationship with the United Nations. This year we\nopened a second diplomatic Permanent Mission in\nGeneva. We are also pleased to see that the World Health\nOrganization office in Honiara has been upgraded from\na liaison office to the level of resident representative. We\nrequest the United Nations Development Programme\n(UNDP) to follow suit. I believe a stronger United\nNations presence at the country level will further\nenhance understanding of the country\u2019s development\npriorities and challenges. The United Nations will only\nbe strengthened with a secretariat that represents the\ndiversity of its membership.\nSolomon Islands recognizes the sovereignty,\nindependence and territorial integrity of Fiji.\nWe will continue to dialogue with Fiji and call on\nthe region and the international community to support\nFiji\u2019s \u201cEngaging with the Pacific\u201d process and its road\nmap to the 2014 general elections. We welcome Fiji\u2019s\ncommitment to hold its general elections in 2014.\nSolomon Islands has also strengthened its mediating\nrole at the subregional level through the Melanesian\nSpearhead Group (MSG). The MSG is made up of Fiji,\nPapua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Vanuatu and the\nFront de lib\u00e9ration nationale kanak socialiste. Within\nthe MSG secretariat, a peacekeeping unit has been\nestablished. However, Solomon Islands and the other\nMSG members believe that the United Nations remains\nthe bedrock of international peace and security.\nThe promotion of human rights is fundamental\nto creating a culture of peace and security. Solomon\nIslands welcomes the ongoing intergovernmental\nprocess to strengthen the effectiveness of human rights treaty institutions during this session. We recognize the\nuniversality of human rights and call for the elimination\nof double standards and the politicization of human\nrights violations.\nOn the situation in the Middle East, I believe\nthe United Nations is uniquely placed to provide a\ncomprehensive solution to the region\u2019s complex issues,\nincluding the current situation in Syria. It is a region that\ndeserves freedom, democracy and long-term security.\nSolomon Islands continues to support the work of the\nQuartet and the good offices of the Secretary-General\nin defusing tensions and advancing political discussion\non a two-State solution for Israel and Palestine.\nThere is no justification for the killing of innocent\ncivilians, wherever it may occur. We therefore join\nthe international community in expressing our deep\nconcern about the sad events in Benghazi.\nWith respect to Non-Self-Governing Territories in\nthe Pacific, Solomon Islands supports New Caledonia\u2019s\naspirations to self-determination. I wish to inform\nthe Assembly that, last month, members of the MSG\nundertook a second ministerial visit to the territory\nto monitor progress under the Noumea Accord. We\nencourage all efforts to enable the Kanaks to assume\nleadership in determining their future. Solomon Islands\nalso joins its regional neighbours in supporting the\nreinscription of French Polynesia in the list of countries\nto be decolonized. We also support other peoples\nwithin the Asia-Pacific region that aspire for self-\ndetermination and independence.\nI welcome the work done by the General Assembly\non strengthening the smooth transition process for\ncountries graduating from the group of least developed\ncountries. In working towards graduating from the\ngroup, we are embarking on a number of development\ninitiatives. Under the Istanbul Programme of Action,\nSolomon Islands is pursuing three high-value national\ninvestments. First, with support from New Zealand, a\nsecond international airport is being constructed in the\nwestern part of our country. Secondly, the submarine\nfibre-optic cable project is expected to go on line by\n2014. Thirdly, Solomon Islands is in the process of\nestablishing two tertiary universities, the Solomon\nIslands National University and the University of South\nPacific Solomon Islands Campus.\nThose national projects place Solomon Islands on\na path to transforming its economy and ensuring that\ninclusive and equitable economic growth takes root in the country. We have done this by unlocking domestic\nand regional resources through the establishment of a\ndebt strategy in partnership with the private sector and\nthe Asian Development Bank.\nFurthermore, we are taking steps to maximize\nreturns from our natural resources. As a party to the\nNauru Agreement, we have closed off pockets of high\nseas between our exclusive economic zones in a bid\nto protect and manage fish stocks. In that regard, we\nhave adopted the Vessel Day Scheme to guarantee an\nequitable share of benefits. We hold the position that the\nScheme must be embodied in bilateral and multilateral\nfisheries agreements. We call on all distant-water\nfishing nations to respect that principled position.\nIn the mining sector, we are now a member of the\nExtractive Industries Transparency Initiative, and we\ncontinue to develop policy and translate it into local laws\nand regulations. Mining presents a major opportunity\nto broaden our economic base. In that regard, we will\nbe granting mining leases to a major nickel-mining\ncompany before the end of the year. It is estimated that\nthe company will produce around 69,000 tons per year\nand generate significant job opportunities.\nAt the United Nations Conference on Sustainable\nDevelopment (Rio+20), we charted a new course to\ndevelop an improved paradigm for advancing and\nmeasuring the three pillars of sustainable development.\nThe full and timely implementation of the Rio+20\noutcome (resolution 66/288, annex) is crucial. As we\napproach 2015, we must accelerate efforts to achieve the\nMillennium Development Goal targets in the remaining\nthree years.\nSolomon Islands is implementing its national\ndevelopment strategy for the period 2011-2020.\nWe call on our development partners to align their\nassistance with the priorities that are contained in our\nnational development strategy. The proposed post-\n2015 development agenda must take into account any\nshortcomings in the implementation of the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals, and the sustainable development\ngoals must be viable economically, community-based\nand time-bound. We look forward to working with\nthe experts who will be establishing the framework.\nSolomon Islands is pleased to be one of the 50 countries\nthat UNDP will consult in developing the post-2015\nglobal development agenda. We request that this\nconsultation process also mainstream issues of concern\nto small island developing States into the agenda of the 2014 Global Conference on the Sustainable\nDevelopment of Small Island Developing States.\nI join my colleagues in the Alliance of Small Island\nStates in reiterating that climate change is an urgent\nand irreversible threat to humanity. Solomon Islands is\ndeeply troubled by the current low ambition level of the\npledges by developed countries. There is a discrepancy\nbetween what has been pledged and what is necessary to\nstabilize temperature decrease. That means mitigation\nmust be prioritized at the eighteenth ordinary meeting\nof the Conference of the Parties to the Convention\non Biological Diversity in Doha and greenhouse-gas\nemission levels meaningfully decreased. We need to\nhave certainty that we are working towards a temperature\nincrease of no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius, and not\n3 to 5 degrees Celsius, in order to ensure the survival,\nviability and sustainable development of small island\ndeveloping States and least developed countries.\nWe deeply regret that some countries have opted\nout of the Kyoto Protocol, some have refused to take\na second commitment and others have remained\nundecided on taking a second commitment.\nHowever, at the national level I am pleased to\nannounce that, in June, Solomon Islands launched its\nnational climate change policy, which mainstreams\nclimate change into all sectors of the country. Solomon\nIslands is a country with rich biological and cultural\ndiversity. It is a member of the Coral Triangle Initiative\non coral reefs, fisheries and food security. This year, 22\nPacific Island countries and territories came together\nin Solomon Islands to showcase their cultural diversity\nand heritage. The region has indigenous biological and\ncultural diversity, which makes it an indigenous and\nbiocultural hot spot. That hot spot remains fragile and\nexposed to threats and needs international support. We\nwill be seeking ways and means of having that initiative\nfeatured on the global agenda.\nThe reform of the Security Council must keep pace\nwith the changing global realities. We support the call\nto make the Security Council more representative,\nrelevant and effective. After four sessions, we are\nconcerned about the slow progress of negotiations and\nhope to see progress during this session.\nMy Government recognizes Taiwan\u2019s flexible,\nmoderate and rational foreign policy, which continues\nto promote friendly cross-Strait relations. Solomon\nIslands continues to support Taiwan\u2019s meaningful\nparticipation in the United Nations system, including its aspiration to be a member of the International\nCivil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and the United\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change\n(UNFCCC). Although not a member of ICAO, Taiwan\nmanages more than 1 million f lights and 40 million\npassengers per annum. Similarly, Taiwan is the twenty-\nsecond-largest emitter of greenhouse gas, but it is not\na member of UNFCCC. I firmly believe that it is our\nshared responsibility to engage Taiwan in our efforts to\nadvance sustainable development and address climate\nchange.\nWith regard to Cuba, I thank the Government and\npeople of Cuba for the support they have provided to\nthe medical students of Solomon Islands. We join the\ninternational community in calling for the immediate\nlifting of the United States economic and trade embargo\nagainst Cuba. Solomon Islands encourages the United\nStates to respect the principle of good-neighbourliness.\nFinally, with regard to gender equality and the\nempowerment of women, I would like to thank Member\nStates for their confidence in electing Solomon Islands\nto the Executive Board of UN-Women. I also welcome\nthe call by the Secretary-General to convene the World\nConference on Women in 2015. Solomon Islands further\nacknowledges the $320 million in regional assistance\nfrom Australia to support gender programmes for\nPacific island countries. Women play a very important\nrole as peacemakers and leaders in Solomon Islands\nsociety. Our gender challenge has grown with time.\nToday we have national gender programmes that\nsupport empowerment. We look forward to working\nclosely with Australia and the other Board members in\nadvancing the cause of women and girls.\nSolomon Islands is committed to working closely\nwith the President in establishing an inclusive,\ntransparent and effective multilateral system. I would\nalso like to assure him of our support for our common\nendeavour to build a peaceful and secure world for our\nchildren and future generations."

        "file_text": "\ufeffFirst of all, allow me to\nextend to Mr. Vuk Jeremi\u010d my sincere congratulations\non his election as President of the General Assembly\nat its sixty-seventh session. I am convinced that his\nextensive professional experience will contribute to the\nsuccessful work of the this session of the Assembly of\nour universal Organization.\nIt is my great pleasure to convey my greetings to\nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon and to express my\ncountry\u2019s sincere appreciation for his tireless efforts\ntowards achieving the goals of the United Nations.\nOnce again, recent world developments have\nproved that it is impossible to address global and\nregional issues without strengthening the central role\nof the United Nations in international affairs or without\ncollective initiatives in world politics that fully respect\nthe norms of international law. In that regard, it has\nbecome obvious that the Organization needs rational\nreform, as a result of which a renewed United Nations\nwill emerge that will be able to respond quickly and\nappropriately to world developments and to effectively\nmeet the numerous global challenges and threats of the\nnext generation.\n\nThe efforts to strengthen United Nations\npeacebuilding activities deserve further comprehensive\nsupport. In that regard, it is my pleasure to note\nthat Tajikistan continues to make a considerable\ncontribution in that area by participating in United\nNations peacekeeping operations.\nTajikistan is convinced that respect for cultural\nand religious diversity, as well as dialogue among\ncivilizations, is essential for global peace and\nunderstanding. In that regard, we are deeply concerned\nat the increase in many parts of the world of attempts to\ndenigrate religions, in particular Islam, by misusing the\nfreedom of expression. We strongly condemn such acts.\nThere is no doubt that the establishment of\ncomprehensive legal norms on human rights is one of the\nmajor accomplishments of the United Nations. Human\nrights, along with peace, security and development, are\nthe pillars of the United Nations system. As a signatory\nto the major international treaties on human rights,\nTajikistan consistently implements measures aimed at\nensuring the protection and promotion of human rights\nin the country.\nWith the intent of making a greater contribution\ntowards the implementation of the noble goals of the\nHuman Rights Council, the Government of Tajikistan\nhas decided to present its candidature to that important\nbody for the term 2015-2017. In that regard, we sincerely\nhope that Member States will render their valuable\nsupport to our candidature.\nWithin the context of the withdrawal of the\nInternational Security Assistance Force from\nAfghanistan, scheduled for 2014, the Afghan issue\nwill acquire critical importance not only for the\nregion but for the entire world. We believe that the\nsocial and economic development of Afghanistan is\nkey to ensuring stable peace in that country. For that\nreason, international assistance to Afghanistan should\naim first and foremost to fully restore its economy, to\nfurther strengthen its social well-being and to create\nemployment. In that regard, the completion of projects\nto build railroads, motorways, power transmission\nlines and gas pipelines that connect Afghanistan with\nTajikistan and other countries of the region is of the\nutmost importance.\nLast March, Tajikistan hosted the fifth Regional\nEconomic Cooperation Conference on Afghanistan,\nwhich submitted specific proposals and projects in\nvarious areas that will contribute to regional cooperation and include the participation of Afghanistan. As\na close neighbour of Afghanistan, Tajikistan has\nparticipated actively in the rehabilitation of the Afghan\neconomy and the country\u2019s social infrastructure. We\nare convinced that the processes of multidimensional\nregional cooperation should fully involve Afghanistan.\nThe prevention of drug trafficking is one of the\nimportant areas requiring cooperative efforts on the part\nof the international community. It is essential that the\ninternational community coordinate measures aimed at\nreducing both the demand and the supply of drugs, and\nintegrate efforts undertaken at the national level into\nan international strategy for drug control. Tajikistan\nhas designed its own anti-narcotics strategy, which\nincludes short- and long-term programmes of action,\ncooperation and interaction on bilateral, regional and\nmultilateral bases, and has begun to develop a new\nanti-narcotics strategy for the period 2013-2020.\nThe Ottawa Convention calls on the international\ncommunity to put an end to the suffering and casualties\ncaused by anti-personnel mines, which kill and maim\nhundreds of people, mostly innocent and defenceless\ncivilians, especially children, and that obstruct\neconomic development and reconstruction. Regrettably,\nthe suffering and misery that anti-personnel landmines\ncause is a serious burden on those citizens of my country\nwho live along the border with neighbouring States. In\nthat regard, we are committed to the full and effective\nimplementation of the Convention, in cooperation with\nall parties concerned. Tajikistan is a strong advocate of\na mine-free Central Asia.\nThe year 2012 will be remembered as a historic\nmoment. Two decades after their first meeting in Rio\nde Janeiro, national representatives gathered there\nagain to discuss and identify the most effective ways of\nachieving sustainable development. The United Nations\nConference on Sustainable Development reiterated our\ncommitment to a path towards sustainable development\nand to ensuring an economically, socially and\necologically sustainable future for our planet: the future\nwe want. Ensuring sustainable economic development\ndesigned to improve people\u2019s living standards and\nquality of life is a strategic goal of the Government of\nTajikistan. We give special attention to the effective,\nrational and protective use of natural resources, the\nprimary dimension of a green economy.\nMaking access to energy a priority is the key to\nachieving all the Millennium Development Goals.\nIt is especially crucial for developing countries and remote mountain territories located far from major\ninfrastructure. My country is no exception to that, and\nour access to energy is the key to social and economic\ndevelopment and poverty reduction. Regrettably,\nhowever, we are compelled to state that due to a lack of\nmutual understanding and cooperation in the region and\nto disregard for Tajikistan\u2019s legitimate rights and vital\ninterests, for the past 10 years our country has suffered\nfrom a severe power shortage during the winter.\nBecause of its lack of other energy sources, it is\nvitally important for Tajikistan, which has enormous\nhydro-energy potential, to develop hydropower\nin a planned and integrated manner. According to\ninternational treaties, Tajikistan has every right to use\nits natural resources, including hydropower, for the\nbenefit of its people. At the same time, we wish to make\nit clear from this rostrum, with full responsibility, that\nin developing its hydropower potential, the Republic\nof Tajikistan has no intention of exclusively pursuing\nits own interests at others\u2019 expense. On the contrary,\nwe sincerely advocate mutually beneficial regional\ncooperation and partnership. It is against that backdrop\nthat we should view Tajikistan\u2019s active cooperation\nwith the World Bank in developing a technical,\neconomic, social and ecological assessment of the\nRogun hydropower station, a project of vital importance\nto my country. Similarly, we expect that while the\nassessment is being carried out, the parties concerned\nin the region will abstain from hasty and unconsidered\nstatements and actions that may run counter to existing\ninternational agreements and to the spirit of friendship,\ncooperation and good neighbourliness.\nTajikistan attaches great importance to the\ninterests of landlocked developing countries, whose\nlocation makes them vulnerable. It is obvious that\nTajikistan\u2019s geographic isolation and lack of access to\nthe sea constitute a serious obstacle to its sustainable\ndevelopment. Under the circumstances, it is clear that\na network of reliable and unimpeded transportation\nand communications arteries connecting Tajikistan to\nthe outer world via its neighbours is becoming vitally\nimportant. In that regard, we call for the elimination\nof any artificial and economically unsupported barriers\nand obstacles to transportation and communication\nlinks among the countries of the region that do not\ncontribute to developing and strengthening regional\ncooperation and partnership. We hope that the relevant\nUnited Nations missions in the region will pay due\nattention to this issue. International Year of Water Cooperation, initiated\nby Tajikistan, which coincides with the twenthieth\nanniversary of the proclamation of 22 March as World\nWater Day. To implement the goals of the International\nYear of Water Cooperation, Tajikistan proposes holding\na number of events in 2013, including, in particular, a\nGeneral Assembly thematic session and an international\nconference dedicated to water cooperation issues. In\nthat regard, my country will present a draft resolution\nfor consideration by the Second Committee. I would\nlike to take this opportunity to express our sincere hope\nthat Member States will support this initiative.\nTajikistan, as a strong supporter of broad and\ncomprehensive cooperation, believes that only\ncollective, coordinated efforts and effective regional\nand international cooperation can serve as a foundation\nfor joint success, render the world a better and safer\nplace and make the lives of the people of our planet\nhappier and more dignified."

        "file_text": "\ufeffI wish at\nthe outset to extend my heartiest congratulations and\nthe assurances of my cooperation and highest esteem\nto President Jeremi\u0107 on his election to the presidency\nof the General Assembly at its sixty-seventh session.\nAntigua and Barbuda looks forward to his leadership\nand guidance throughout this session.\nI extend congratulations also to your predecessor,\nMr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser, on a job well done\nand for his continued service to the international\ncommunity.\nThe theme of the sixty-seventh session of the\nGeneral Assembly, \u201cBringing about adjustment or\nsettlement of international disputes or situations\nby peaceful means\u201d, is judicious, for it accurately\nsummarizes how we as nations need to act in these\nprecarious times of insecurity and uncertainty. These\ntimes and circumstances call for a heightened sense of\nurgency and a stronger will among all nations to work\nwith and through the United Nations in embracing\nmultilateralism in its truest form.\nThe sixty-seventh session of the Assembly is\ntaking place in an environment of continued challenges\nto international peace and security; international\ndemocracy is being tested; there is unbearable poverty\nthroughout the world; the sluggish recovery of the world\u2019s economy provides little hope; and disasters\ninduced by climate change are becoming more rampant.\nAs we look around our global community, we ask\nourselves what we can do to solve the many problems\nwe face, and how we can find and maintain the peace\nthat we so desire. Maybe if we ask ourselves not as\nindividuals but as nations what peace is, then, perhaps,\nwe can collectively resolve to find the answer so as to\nachieve peace.\nFor Antigua and Barbuda, peace means respect\nfor human rights and the differences of others and the\nprotection of women, children and the elderly. Peace is\ndevoid of greed that ends in unparalleled wealth for a few\nand nauseating poverty for many. Peace means global\nhealth awareness, protection and accessibility for all.\nPeace means democracies with active global citizens,\nby non-violent change. Peace means eliminating nuclear\nweapons and controlling small arms.\nPeace is free of violence and requires the\nacceptance of differences in race, gender and religion.\nPeace is a position from which to value the limits of\nnature\u2019s resources, and it is characterized by the\nabsence of the ignorance and shortsightedness that\nleads some to selfishly plunder Earth\u2019s plenty. Peace is\nthe understanding that climate change is real and that\nsustainability should be our priority. Peace means fair\ntrade and equality of equity in globalization.\nPeace is the elimination of corruption in Government.\nPeace is the understanding and the recognition that the\nworld\u2019s problems can be solved only by the inclusion\nof all countries. Peace therefore involves a wider and\nequal representation in the Security Council rather than\nmembership by a selected few.\nIn 2011, we celebrated the International Year for\nPeoples of African Descent. That year has passed,\nand gone from the international agenda is the issue\nof reparations for slavery, which is central to fighting\nracism and racial discrimination and nurturing a\nculture of peace among nations. The legacy of racial\nviolence, segregation and slavery against peoples of\nAfrican descent has severely impaired our advancement\nas nations, communities and individuals across the\npolitical, social and, most importantly, the economical\nspectrums. In the words of Kwame Nkrumah, we can\nno longer afford the luxury of delay. The time has come\nfor us to revisit the issue of reparations for slavery and\nplace it at the top of the international agenda.\n\nOver 200 million persons in the Americas depend\non us. That is why I am reiterating a call I made in\nthe Hall in 2011 for former slave States to begin the\nreconciliation process by issuing formal apologies for\nthe crimes committed by the nations or their citizens\nover the 400 years of the African slave trade. While\nnations in the developing world continue to grapple with\nthe effects of a world economic crisis that is not of their\nown making, I call on former slave States to back up\ntheir apologies with new commitments to the economic\ndevelopment of those nations that have suffered from\nthat human tragedy.\nTransnational crime is threatening the very\nexistence of peace in Antigua and Barbuda. Our small\nsize and lack of human and financial resources make\nit difficult for us, as a small island nation, to address\nthat problem in an effective manner. The crime and\nviolence fuelled by the illicit trade in small arms and\nlight weapons are jeopardizing our major industries,\nincluding tourism. Our health-care systems are weighted\ndown, and families are being torn apart. Nevertheless,\ncrime prevention and small arms control is a priority\nfor my Government. It is important to note that neither\nAntigua and Barbuda nor our Caribbean Community\nbrothers and sisters manufacture small arms or light\nweapons, yet one recent estimate indicates that there\nare 1.6 million illegal firearms in the region.\nAdditionally, Antigua and Barbuda is deeply\nsaddened by the fact that, despite significant efforts,\nstrong will on the part of the majority of States and\nthe fact that a compromise was potentially within\nreach, there was no agreement on a text for the recently\ndiscussed legally binding arms trade treaty. The\nAssembly can rest assured that Antigua and Barbuda\nwill not give up, and we will continue to advocate for a\nlegally binding treaty that will eliminate the threat that\nis crippling our region.\nAntigua and Barbuda is committed to the rule of law\nand the process it enables for direct political dialogue\nand cooperation among all States and international\nactors. The rule of law facilitates international peace\nand security, human rights and development for all. Our\njoint responses to the threats to peace and security, along\nwith the opportunities arising from various political,\neconomic and social instabilities, must be guided by the\nrule of law, as it is the basis for friendly coexistence and\ninterdependence between and among States.\n\nMy Government upholds the ideals of the recently\nconcluded High-level Meeting on the Rule of Law at the\nNational and International Levels and stands committed\nto upholding that very important principle.\nThe Caribbean has been known as a zone of peace.\nWe value our ability to live and work together despite\nour different religious and political beliefs and ethnic\nbackgrounds. Antigua and Barbuda therefore condemns\nthe brutal killing of the United States Ambassador to\nLibya and the destruction of the United States Consulate\nin Libya. We condemn any acts of violence or killings\ndisguised as actions to defend religious belief. If we are\nto build an environment of peace around the world, we\nmust show tolerance for all peoples and beliefs.\nThe dangers posed by non-State actors acquiring\nweapons of mass destruction are real and should be\nseen by all countries, large and small, as the single most\ndestructive element threatening international peace and\nsecurity. Antigua and Barbuda is particularly concerned\nby the lack of progress in the area of disarmament and\nnon-proliferation. There should be no compromise on\nthat issue. Antigua and Barbuda remains resolute in our\ncontinued call for a nuclear-weapon-free world.\nThe recently concluded Rio+20 Conference on\nSustainable Development provided an international\nplatform from which to address the social, economic and\nenvironmental challenges affecting the international\ncommunity. Those challenges are direct threats to\nhumankind and oftentimes jeopardize peace and\nsecurity for all.\nIn resolution 66/288, entitled \u201cThe future we want\u201d,\nAntigua and Barbuda saw the Rio+20 Conference as\nsecuring comprehensive and inclusive sustainability\nfor small island nations, whose survival is contingent\non an outcome of commitments and actions from the\nConference.\nAt the recently concluded summit of the Alliance\nof Small Island States, my country joined with other\nsmall island States in sending a strong message to\nthe international community on the need for bold and\nambitious actions. We cannot wait for our lands to\ndisappear before we act. We must act now to respond to\nthe climate crisis and ensure that not a single country is\nsacrificed, no matter how small.\nThe threat is real. Our sea levels are rising, there is\ncoral bleaching beyond our shores, and hurricanes are\nbecoming more recurrent and severe. The Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework\nConvention on Climate Change needs to take concrete\nsteps in order to protect small island developing States\nand other exposed countries from the threats of climate\nchange.\nThe responsibility to mitigate climate change\nshould be at the forefront of the collective consciousness\nof both developing and developed countries. However,\ndeveloped countries should accept their responsibilities\nas the leading contributors to the extremely high\nlevels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, which\nare now threatening the welfare of present and future\ngenerations. It is my Government\u2019s hope that the selfish\nact of inaction will dissipate in Doha and that a positive\noutcome in the climate change negotiations will usher\nin new hopes for humanity and compassion for our\nplanet.\nAntigua and Barbuda is doing its part to protect\nMother Earth. My Government has embarked on a\nrenewable energy mandate. We are now shifting our\nfocus towards harvesting water and wind to meet our\nenergy needs. We are protecting our ecosystem with\nstrong legislation, and we are replanting mangroves\nand protecting areas that are sensitive to pollutants.\nClimate change and sustainability are high on my\nGovernment\u2019s development and investment priorities,\nand we are ensuring that new and refurbished private\nand commercial investments are in line with our green\napproach to our society.\nMy Government also joins with member States of\nthe Alliance of Small Island States in calling on the\nGeneral Assembly to designate 2014 as the International\nYear of Small Island Developing States in order to raise\nawareness of the special situation of our members\nand mobilize international support for our sustainable\ndevelopment.\nOver the past year, the United Nations Stabilization\nMission in Haiti has made important progress in its\nsupport to the Haitian people\u2019s efforts to consolidate\ndemocracy, stability and the rule of law and to move\nforward on the path to social and economic development.\nIn spite of the progress made, the situation in Haiti\nremains fragile, as the country strives to overcome its\ndaunting political, social and economic challenges.\nI therefore stress the need for adequate funding\nand continued implementation of the Mission in Haiti. I\nwould like to reiterate my Government\u2019s strong support\nfor the Mission in Haiti and to stress that peace will only be achieved if we simultaneously address issues of\nsecurity, national reconciliation and development. I also\ncall on those nations that pledged assistance to Haiti to\nhonour their commitments. Those pledges are urgently\nneeded, now that the rebuilding phase is progressing\nunder a new Administration.\nIt has been nearly fi ve years since we started to see a\nsharp downturn in the world\u2019s economy. Unfortunately,\nAntigua and Barbuda is among the small and developing\nStates that have yet to see significant improvements.\nWhile we have made several attempts to curtail the\nhaemorrhaging of our fragile economies, it must be\nsaid that we need greater cooperation, flexibility\nand inclusion on the part of our developed partners.\nGross domestic product can no longer be the criterion\nused in accessing concessionary financing and other\ninternational financial relief; instead, mechanisms\nshould be put in place that take into consideration a host\nof other elements, including the fragility of economies.\nWe are still in a crisis, a crisis of confidence in\nglobal governance and the institutional capacity\nfor managing the international financial system,\ninternational trade and international development\npolicies. We are also living in the era of globalization\nwhere cooperative collectives \u2014 and not ambitious\nand selfish empires \u2014 must be the order of the day in\ninternational financial governance. A privileged few\nshould never be allowed to make financial decisions\nthat impact the socioeconomic livelihood of millions\nwithout regard for that excluded majority. Economic\nprosperity should be shared equally among countries\nand within countries. The exclusive clubs of the\nGroup of Eight and the Group of 20 cannot repair the\nfragmented international financial system without\ntaking due consideration of the majority of nations left\non the outside with much to offer.\nMy Government calls on developed countries\nand the countries of the Organization for Economic\nCooperation and Development to guarantee that their\nresponse with regard to international tax matters will\ninvolve improved international cooperation on tax issues\nthrough comprehensive and supportive frameworks that\nensure the involvement and equal treatment of small\njurisdictions like Antigua and Barbuda without the\nnuances of inappropriately branding us as tax havens.\nAntigua and Barbuda has been proactive in its\napproach to diversifying our economy. We entered\ninto the international gaming sector abiding by all prescribed international standards. Unfortunately,\nour friend and developed partner, the United States\nof America, was of the view that our gaming sector\ncontravened its domestic laws. Antigua and Barbuda\nfound it appropriate to seek international redress on\nthe matter through the dispute resolution mechanism\nat the World Trade Organization. We prevailed, and\nthe United States was ordered to compensate Antigua\nand Barbuda for its losses. Yet, years later, Antigua and\nBarbuda is still engaging in negotiations with the United\nStates. I therefore call on the Government of the United\nStates to work with us to quickly resolve the matter so\nthat we can arrive at a settlement that is fair and just.\nI also call on the United States to work cooperatively\nwith Antigua and Barbuda and other remote gaming\njurisdictions to forge an enlightened, reasonable and\nreasoned way of addressing the regulation and licensing\nof remote gaming services.\nWhile we are on the matter of trade disputes, it\nhas been decades since the United States instituted its\nembargo on Cuba. Time and time again the international\ncommunity, acting through the General Assembly, has\ncalled on the United States to lift that trade embargo.\nHowever, it continues unabated. Since its inception, the\nembargo has inf licted untold economic damage on the\nCuban people, caused shortages and needless suffering\nto the Cuban population, limited and restrained the\ndevelopment of the country and seriously damaged\nthe Cuban economy. Through all of that, the Cuban\npeople have managed to preserve their sovereignty,\nindependence and right to self-determination. As a\ncountry committed to the norms of the multilateral\ntrading system and to the freedom of trade and\nnavigation and a country that rejects the extraterritorial\napplication of another country\u2019s national laws, Antigua\nand Barbuda calls on the United States to immediately\nand unconditionally lift its economic embargo against\nthe people of Cuba. It is time to turn a new page of\npeace, cooperation and understanding, a time for global\nhealing and international community-building. The\ncontinuation of the embargo further destroys the very\nfabric of hope that we have created as a community of\nnations in order to resolve the world\u2019s issues.\nThe world is changing. Economies, policies and\ncountries are becoming more intertwined than ever\nbefore. Antigua and Barbuda sees those relationships of\nintegration as positive steps towards achieving a world\nthat is not dominated by a few but represents rather a unification of leadership in the hope of combating most\nof the world\u2019s shortcomings.\nThe smaller developing countries in the Caribbean\nand the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States\n(OECS) are poised to make great strides in our integration\nagenda. The ratification of the OECS Economic Union\nis a major step in that direction. We have a stable\nshared currency, with a monetary council that has been\ninstrumental in preventing further deterioration of our\neconomies. There have been renewed commitments\nby all of the Caribbean Community countries to work\ntirelessly to realize the full potential of the Caribbean\nSingle Market and Economy. Antigua and Barbuda has\njoined the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our\nAmerica, an institution that is built on the principles\nof solidarity, complementarity and cooperation.\nThe Community of Latin America and Caribbean\nStates \u2014 a new integration arm within our region \u2014 the\ngeographical position of our countries, our shared\ncultures and values and our desires as developing\npartners for a more just global community that is built\non fairness and peace give my Government hope that\nall is not lost as regards multilateralism.\nAntigua and Barbuda faces many challenges in the\nprevention, care and treatment of non-communicable\ndiseases (NCDs). Heart disease, diabetes, cancer,\ncardiovascular disease and chronic respiratory diseases\ncontinue to be the leading causes of death in Antigua\nand Barbuda, with cancer and heart disease being the\ntop two causes. The burdens of the cost, the loss of\nproductivity and the disabilities as a result of chronic\ndiseases continue to weigh heavy on our health-care\nsystem, since treatment for those diseases and their\ncomplications, including dialysis, chemotherapy\nand drug therapy, continue to be offered free of cost\nto patients. The fight against NCDs remains high,\ntherefore, on Antigua and Barbuda\u2019s health agenda.\nFollowing our participation in the United Nations\nHigh-level Meeting on the subject last year, the\nGovernment of Antigua and Barbuda approved the\nestablishment of a multisectoral NCD commission\nto provide leadership in that critical area, drafted\nlegislation for tobacco control, engaged civil society\nand non-governmental organizations in drafting an\nNCD policy and action plan and has supported plans for\nthe development of a comprehensive cancer treatment\ncentre in Antigua and Barbuda to serve the OECS.\nThe Ministries of Health and Agriculture continue to collaborate in the development of a food policy that will\naddress some of the risk factors for NCDs.\nThe fight against HIV/AIDS in my region is also\nreal. The figures are heartbreaking, and the outlook is\ntroubling. Despite some progress, much still needs to\nbe done to achieve the 2015 goal of universal access\nto HIV prevention, treatment, support and care. My\nGovernment is in the process of updating the code of\nconduct to prevent discrimination in the workplace\nagainst persons living with HIV/AIDS. We will not\ntolerate injustice, intolerance and violence of any kind\nagainst persons living with HIV/AIDS.\nMany might believe that for countries like Antigua\nand Barbuda, as a small island developing State, our\nonly concern is for development, but I stand here today\nwith grave concern that the disregard for world peace\nand security threatens the very existence of humankind\nand will push the international community into further\nchaos and destruction. We cannot ignore from our tiny\npeaceful shores the images that glare from our TV\nscreens of unrest, protest and demonstrations from\nvarious corners of the world. The images are daunting,\nthe voices of change are deafening and the use of\nforce or threat of use of force to suppress the voices of\ndemocracy is intolerable. The United Nations has to be\nunified in its response so as to act in a peaceful manner\nwhile protecting the rights of populations near and far.\nThe situation in Syria is disheartening. Children,\nwomen and the elderly must be protected. I call on\nboth sides to exercise restraint and allow humanitarian\nrelief supplies to enter Syria. I also call on all nations\nto cease supplying arms to the two sides in the conflict.\nAs leaders, our priority must be to urge all parties in\nSyria to implement a ceasefire and stop the violence\nimmediately and completely. Every effort must be\nmade to implement Mr. Annan\u2019s six-point proposal and\nthe relevant Security Council resolutions. The United\nNations and the Arab League must lead in that process.\nAny threats of war must be suppressed, and negotiation\nand mediation should be the order of the day. If it is not\naddressed, the Syrian crisis will soon pose a serious\nthreat to international peace and security. Antigua\nand Barbuda will continue to give its support to a just,\npeaceful and appropriate settlement of the Syrian crisis\nat an early date.\nThese are undeniably perilous times. An event can\noccur in a distant part of the globe that can severely\nimpact Antigua and Barbuda domestically, an event that completely ignores the importance of achieving\ntolerance by peaceful means. Our response may be\none of indignation but also a sense that we live in a\nperilous atmosphere characterized by the intolerance of\npeace. The multiplicity and interconnectedness of the\nmany global threats and challenges we face will test the\nabilities of this Assembly. Is the United Nations up to\nthe task?\nI am confident that by sharing our collective wisdom\nand using it as a resource, the General Assembly at its\nsixty-seventh session will take decisions of meaningful\nand enduring benefit and peace for the peoples of the\nworld. I am equally confident that our deliberations\ncan lead to solutions that will ensure the protection of\nall our peoples. I therefore call on all of us, as world\nleaders, to rise to the challenges and move with haste to bring peace to the citizens of the world. We are leaders\nand caretakers of humankind and, as such, our response\nto those challenges will be recorded in the books of\nhistory, which will reveal whether we had the ability to\nact with constraint, effectiveness and fairness in order\nto achieve stability through peaceful means. Let peace\nreign."

        "file_name": "MEX_67_2012.txt",
        "file_text": "\ufeffBy virtue of its historical conviction, Mexico has\nalways been a strategic ally of the United Nations. As\none of the founding Members of the United Nations, we\nfully share its fundamental precepts.\nThis is the last session of the General Assembly I\nwill attend as President of Mexico. Over the past six\nyears, my country has taken part in many different\nforums to pave the way for United Nations initiatives.\nWe have endeavoured to make it the main body for\ndialogue, peace and security, and for the rule of law,\nincluding, in particular, the effective exercise of\ninternational law.\nToday the world faces challenges that threaten the\nvery existence and viability of humankind. The first\nof those is the current economic emergency and the\nurgent need to promote global trade and growth with\nstrong job creation. That problem has plunged entire\npopulations in crisis and prevented developing nations\nfrom overcoming setbacks with respect to poverty,\nignorance and marginalization.\nWhen Mexico became President of the Group of\n20 (G-20) in 2012, our mission was clear: to reconcile\nthe apparently competing interests of developing and\ndeveloped nations. It is no secret that at the previous\nmeeting of the G-20, in Cannes, we were unable to\nmake as much progress as we would have liked towards\nadopting measures to advance the global economy.\nFor that reason, the Mexican Government made it a\npriority to build a broader consensus. We brought as\nmany countries as possible into the process, along\nwith representatives of the widest possible range of\nsectors, including unions, entrepreneurs, civil society organizations and youth, and we took their proposals to\nthe plenary meeting of the G-20.\nWe held many preparatory ministerial meetings\nover many months and managed to bring apparently\ndivergent positions closer together. That work was\ncritical in ensuring that the G-20 Summit in Los\nCabos last June achieved significant progress. While\nit is true that months ahead of time there were doubts\nabout the viability of the euro as the sole currency for\nmany European countries, the meeting in Los Cabos\nsolidified the Group\u2019s commitment not only to that\ncurrency as a monetary unit but also to financial, fiscal\nand political unity in the eurozone. The commitments\nof the international financial institutions were spelled\nout in greater detail and broadened, in particular those\nof the European institutions, but also those of the\nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF).\nAmong the most significant achievements agreed\nat the Los Cabos G-20 Summit, I should like to mention\nthe long-term action plan that proposes to tackle the\ncurrent economic situation as well as to move forward\ntowards the full and lasting economic recovery that we\nall yearn for. It is also very important that we agreed\nto provide the greatest contribution to the resources of\nthe IMF in the history of the organization. More than\n$450 trillion was committed, and is available to help\ndeveloping or developed countries facing a critical\nfinancial situation as a result of the current economic\ncrisis.\nIt is true that financial problems in some European\ncountries persist. Those are problems that will take a\nlong time to recover from. But, from our point of view,\nthere is now more promise for a solution than there was\nbefore the G-20 meeting. The commitment on the part\nof the G-20 countries has been a valuable element, so\nmuch so that today the global economy is beginning to\nshow more optimistic signs of medium-term recovery\nthan we saw a little more than a year ago. That is why I\nbelieve that we are starting to see a turning point when\nit comes to economic prospects. We must all contribute\nto ensuring that the recovery in fact takes place through\nthe implementation of the commitments undertaken.\nThat should not keep us from undertaking further\nefforts. On the contrary, we must step up our efforts\nin order to overcome, once and for all, the global crisis\nand promote development in our societies.\nI would like to underscore that the Los Cabos\nSummit did not look only at the international crisis, and certainly not only at Europe. We also dealt with\nvarious pressing and important topics. We wanted to\nensure that countries would recover growth through a\nsustainable approach. We included several other items\nof extreme importance on the agenda, including green\ngrowth \u2014 to which I will refer later \u2014 food security\nfor our peoples and financial inclusion for the poorest.\nIn that regard, approximately 3 billion adults in the\nworld do not have access to financial services. That is\na clear obstacle to justice, but also to the efficiency and\ngrowth of our economies. That is why we in Mexico\nhave expanded people\u2019s access to financial services.\nToday, banks offer simplified requirements for opening\naccounts. We are establishing a completely new bank\nthat functions through the use of cell phones, which\n80 per cent of the population own. We are offering,\nthrough bank intermediaries, financial services in the\nmost remote places.\nNot only has my Government been introducing\nprogrammes to promote justice and fight poverty,\nbut the majority of the support that we give to the\npoorest sectors of the population today is done\nthrough a financial inclusion effort. Our Opportunities\nProgramme is an innovative financial transaction\nprogramme for 6.5 million families, or over a quarter\nof the total population of Mexico, including the poorest\nfamilies. They receive monthly economic support to\npurchase food and cover basic needs as long as mothers\ntake their children to schools and to the doctor, as that\nis one of the best ways of structurally breaking the\ncycle of poverty. That support is delivered through\ndebit cards linked to an individual bank account, which\nthose 6.5 million poor families have perhaps never had\naccess to before.\nFood security was another other topic that we\nexplored at the G-20 Summit. The increase in food\nprices around the world largely explains why, besides the\npolitical reasons that might exist in any nation, people\nin North Africa and many other parts of the world have,\nfrom 2010 to the present time, taken to the streets. If the\npoorest families devote half of their income to buying\nfood and the price of that food increases by 10 or 20 per\ncent, we are talking about a net global impoverishment\nthat is higher than those percentages. We are saying\nthat one of the most tragic problems in the fight against\npoverty is preventing such enormous rises in global\nfood prices.\n\nConcretely, we achieved agreements to promote\ngreater investment in technology and greater public\nand private investment in agriculture, so that, with the\nsame resources and the same land and water, we can\nproduce more and better food globally. Mexico took\nan active part in the green revolution at the beginning\nof the 1970s. Now we need another green revolution to\nproduce food. Mexico wants to be an active participant\nin that transformation of technology, public policy and\nfinancial cooperation that could provide food to the\npoorest people in the world. At the G-20 Summit, we\nshowed that it is possible to find a solution to urgent\nand topical problems, as well as to long-term problems.\nThe second challenge of the four I would like\nto mention today has to do with the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs), which the United\nNations so wisely established. It is very clear that they\nencapsulate the yearnings of all of our peoples for a\nharmonious, humane and sustainable development.\nMy country, despite the unexpected rise in global food\nprices and the worst global economic crisis in living\nmemory, has made real progress in reaching the Goals.\nI would like to stress that Mexico is close to achieving\nthe MDGs. Three years from the deadline, we have\nachieved one of the greatest aspirations of any nation,\nwhether developed or developing, namely, universal\nhealth coverage. What does that mean? It means that\ntoday in Mexico we have doctors, medicine, treatment\nand hospitals for every Mexican man or woman who\nrequires it. That will allow us to comply with the\ncommitments taken on in the area of reducing mother\nand child mortality. We are also energetically tackling\nsuch problems as HIV/AIDS. In Mexico, we provide\nfree medical care and free antiretroviral drugs to all\nHIV/AIDS patients, thereby contributing to overcoming\nthat serious global challenge.\nFurthermore, not only have we achieved universal\nhealth coverage, but we have also provided universal\ncoverage when it comes to primary education. Today,\nevery boy and girl of school age \u2014 between 5 and\n13 years of age \u2014 has a place in a free public school.\nWe have also closed the gap between men and women\nso that they participate equally in basic education at\nalmost every level.\nWe have achieved important progress. We have\nbuilt over 1,200 new hospitals and clinics in six years\nand established 140 universities. Those are new free\npublic universities, where every year we train 113,000\nengineers who are, besides enhancing their earning power, also revolutionizing the competitiveness of\nMexican industry.\nWe have also achieved progress beyond the agreed\ngoals in terms of access to drinking water, information\ntechnologies and decent housing. Almost 650,000\nmortgage credits for as many houses are provided every\nyear in our country, especially to workers who earn less\nthan $20 a day. All of those achievements put us on\ntrack to comply with one of the MDGs within the time\nframe established.\nGlobally, Mexico is aware of the fact that progress\nis uneven, but that should not be a reason to abandon\nour efforts. We must reinforce the progress we have\nmade and ensure that it continues.\nThat is why Mexico would suggest that we move\ntowards a second generation of MDGs that would be\nuniversal, measurable and adapted to distinct national\nrealities in areas such as gender equity, environmental\nprotection, green growth, education, food, access to\nwater and international democratic governance. That\nshould be a central part of the 2015 development agenda.\nThe third challenge is that of climate change. Its\nimpact could be irreversible, both for societies and in\nterms of national resources. I know that, in all of the\ncountries represented here, there is currently either\nan unprecedented drought or unprecedented f looding.\nHere in Manhattan, less than two years ago, there was a\nhurricane on Fifth Avenue for the first time in history.\nThere were also tornadoes in Maine and Massachusetts.\nClimate change is affecting all nations. This is a\nchallenge that threatens to overwhelm humankind. If\nwe do not tackle it today, the cost for each country to\ndeal with its consequences will be significantly greater.\nMexico is seeking to engage all of its capacities in\nprompting a sense of responsibility when it comes to\nthe fight against global warming. That is why we have\nset up a special unilateral programme to fight it. We\nare committed to reducing our yearly carbon dioxide\nemissions by 50 million tons for this year. We made that\ncommitment in 2008, and we are meeting it: by the end\nof the year we will have reached our goal.\nWe are also the first country to deliver a national\nmessage in the context of the United Nations Framework\nConvention on Climate Change. We have delivered four\nmessages to date, and today I will deliver Mexico\u2019s\nfifth such message in that regard. I will report on how\nwe have complied with our commitments, as well as illustrate how we have managed to uncouple Mexico\u2019s\neconomic growth from its greenhouse-gas emissions.\nIn the past two decades, our emissions have increased\nat a rate that is 40 per cent lower than our economic\ngrowth rate.\nWe are doing this because to challenge a false\nnotion that we have heard expressed here at the United\nNations and in every economic forum around the world.\nThe idea seems to be that we either grow or we tackle\nclimate change, we either put an end to poverty or we\nput an end to global warming. It would seem that we\ncannot do both at the same time, but I am here to say\nthat we can. I would even say that we should. We have\nto overcome the false dichotomy that exists between\nprotecting the environment and promoting economic\ngrowth, and between fighting poverty and fighting\nclimate change.\nIn Mexico, we are doing both at the same time.\nThrough Pro\u00c1rbol, for instance, which is a programme\nthat pays for environmental services, and is perhaps the\nlargest in the world to do so, we are paying poor and\nindigenous communities who live in forests and jungles\nfor the water that they give us and for the oxygen that\nwe breathe. We are paying them not to cut down trees,\nto restore their water basins so that those environmental\nservices will remain for us. With this programme,\nas we take care of our forests, we are also providing\nincome to the poorest communities, who have never had\nincome before. In the six years of the programme, we\nhave planted 1.3 billion trees in our country. I recall a\nUnited Nations programme five years ago that aimed at\nplanting 1 billion trees around the world. We took part\nin that programme enthusiastically. We have planted\n1.3 billion trees in six years and designated 3.5 million\nhectares as protected natural areas.\nA promising result of that effort is that, according\nto the Food and Agriculture Organization, Mexico has\nreduced its net deforestation rate from 350,000 hectares\nannually in the 1990s to 150,000 between 2005 and\n2010. I am sure that we will have reduced it further\nbetween 2010 and 2012. Our hope is that not only will\nwe achieve a rate of zero this decade, but that we will\nreverse deforestation around the world.\nWith respect to that challenge, working with\nthe United Nations, we were pleased to organize the\nsixteenth Conference of the Parties to the United\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change\n(COP 16) in Canc\u00fan, Mexico. Against all predictions, COP 16 was a rather successful meeting. We reached\na first ever agreement on implementing an emissions\nreduction scheme for deforestation and degradation,\ncalled REDD-plus, which will enable developing\ncountries to contribute to reducing emissions while\npreserving and augmenting forests and jungles.\nThe greatest riches that poor countries have are their\nnatural capital, and developing countries do not pollute\nwith industries that they do not have. The greatest riches\nare forests and jungles, and carbon emissions come\nfrom deforestation. If developing countries are given\nthe support they need to preserve forests and jungles,\nwe will be contributing to reducing carbon emissions\nand helping to raise the income of those communities.\nWe agreed on that in Canc\u00fan at COP 16.\nThat success also points to a possibility that was\nfirst raised in the context of the fight against global\nwarming. We have managed to overcome the differences\nbetween developed and developing countries. We have\nmanaged to set aside the perverse game of blaming\neach other by saying either that the rich are to blame\nbecause they are the ones polluting, or that the poor are\nto blame because they are the ones emitting greenhouse\ngases. In this we are all responsible, and we all have to\nfind the solution. We are all responsible for the planet\nthat we share, which does not recognize our borders\nwhen it comes to the environment.\nThat is why the principle of common but\ndifferentiated responsibility enabled us to reach\nreasonable agreements in Canc\u00fan. We set up the Green\nFund to fight climate change, as proposed by Mexico.\nWe established by consensus the clearly set threshold\nof an increase of no more than 2 degrees in the planet\u2019s\ntemperature in the long term, a commitment to reduce\nemissions, an institutional framework for the adaptation\nto climate change and mechanisms for the financing\nand transfer of technology. Those achievements revived\nmultilateralism on the issue of climate change and were\nfolowed by the successful Climate Change Conference\nheld in Durban in 2011.\nThe fourth challenge \u2014 and I would like the\nAssembly\u2019s special attention as I address this problem,\nwhich is responsible for more violent deaths around the\nworld than any other \u2014 is a problem that is costing\nthousands of young people their lives, in particular in\nour beloved region of Latin America and the Caribbean.\nI am talking about transnational organized crime, which\nis cutting short the lives of thousands of young people and constitutes one of the most serious global threats\nof our time. Criminal organizations form operational\nnetworks covering major illicit f lows not only of drugs\nbut also of arms, money and, unacceptably, of people.\nThey use violence to control their markets, supply and\nclients and to seize the income of the honest citizens of\nthe places they dominate. In that way, they seek to control\nterritories and co-opt Governments. They challenge\nthe strength of States themselves and take advantage\nof institutional weakness or bare-faced corruption to\nestablish power and impunity. They become entrenched\nin communities and control everything they can. They\nclaim money from honest people for their work. They\ncollect quotas from businesses and working people and\ncontrol other criminal activities such as extortion, theft\nand kidnapping.\nOrganized crime is one of the leading causes of\ndeath today. It is a leading engine of violence, which\nthe United Nations has an obligation to fight. It is one\nof the greatest threats facing democracy in the twenty-\nfirst century.\nMexico has suffered the consequences of this\nscourge, which, lamentably, has resulted from of years\nof inaction in the face of the unbridled expansion of\nsuch criminal activity. That is why protecting the\nfamilies and people of Mexico from criminality has\nbeen, for my Government, not only a constitutional\nlegal imperative but an absolute ethical and political\none as well. We have fought robustly, decisively and\ncourageously against that unacceptable threat to our\npeoples. We have done that based on our belief that our\nprincipal duty as a Government is to protect families.\nAt the same time, we have promoted a truly\nhistoric transformation of the institutions charged with\nenforcing the law by developing new and improved\npolice and judicial capacities in the fight for security. We\nrequire new and better capabilities that can cope with\nthe task of defending freedom and legality. However,\nwe regret that our efforts are not being matched in\nall the countries where they are needed. I would like\nto explicitly express my regret before the Assembly\nthat the diplomatic conference that took place here in\nJuly failed to reach an agreement on the adoption of\nan arms trade treaty. Such a treaty would have laid the\ngroundwork for controlling the irresponsible sale of\npowerful weapons to transnational organized criminal\ngroups.\n\nOver the past six years, my Government has\ndecommissioned more than 150,000 weapons that had\nbeen in the hands of criminals. That is why Mexico\nadvocated for a treaty that would limit or ban, or at\nleast regulate, the transfer of conventional weapons,\nbecause we know there is a risk \u2014 we know that that\nhappens \u2014 that those weapons do not end up in the\nhands of good citizens who want to defend themselves;\nthey end up in the hands of criminals. That is why\nsuch a business exists, namely, to commit horrible and\nunprecedented violations of international law against\npeoples.\nThe trafficking of arms is only one aspect of that\nvery complex problem. Today, we have to acknowledge\nan undeniable truth: the illegal drug consumption\nin many developed countries is killing thousands of\nyoung people in producing and transiting countries. It\nfuels violence that our peoples do not deserve. Drug-\nconsuming countries have not made progress \u2014 or at\nleast not significantly \u2014 in reducing drug consumption.\nThere is much work to be done in that regard, both in\nterms of reducing demand and in preventing addiction.\nWe need to step up our efforts to deal with this public\nhealth problem through preventive policies, fighting\naddiction and media and information campaigns that\nwould make young people around the world understand\nthat drug addiction is the slavery of the twenty-first\ncentury. It is a heavy chain choking our young people\nto death.\nIn addition, we must also bear in mind the origins\nof the greatest power of criminal organizations. Where\ndoes it come from? It comes from the billions of dollars\nof economic resources financing them, which in turn\nf low from the drug-consuming countries. If we do not\nstop that avalanche of funds from consumers, organized\ncrime will continue to undermine peace and challenge\nwhole societies and Governments.\nThat is why here, in this pre-eminent global forum,\nI would like to say with the utmost clarity that the time\nhas come for consuming countries to ask themselves,\nhonestly and sincerely, whether they have the will and\nthe ability to reduce drug consumption significantly\nand substantially. Otherwise, if they cannot reduce that\nconsumption, they must urgently take decisive steps at\nleast to reduce the extraordinry f lows of money that\nend up in the hands of criminal organizations.\nI know that to date the approach taken has been\nwell intentioned, seeking to keep drugs out of the hands of young people by pursuing the battle against drug\ntrafficking via legal means. But there is a fundamental\nproblem with that approach: it fuels the black market.\nThe enormous earnings that have been made possible\nthrough that market owing to the prohibition have in\nturn further fuelled greater ambitions among criminals\nand further increased the massive f low of resources\ntowards their organizations. That has allowed them to\ncreate powerful networks and given them an almost\nunlimited ability to corrupt. They are able to buy entire\nGovernments and entire police forces, leaving societies\nunarmed and families defenceless, especially in the\npoorest countries.\nWhile it is clear that powerful countries have\npowerful judicial authorities and police forces, what\nabout the poorest countries in our continents? I am\ntalking about our countries in Latin America and the\nCaribbean. But what will happen in Africa or Asia, or\nin the very many nations that do not have the economic\npower to tackle such criminals?\nLet us grasp once and for all that the ever-growing\ndemand for drugs gives the criminals an economic\npower that in some cases translates to political power\nsufficient to bend the will of the authorities to their own.\nI want to stress that all that money builds in them such\noverweening confidence that they abandon all scruples\nand commit the worst atrocities and acts of cruelty that\nhumankind has ever seen. Drug users\u2019 money causes\nthe deaths of many thousands of young people in Latin\nAmerica and the Caribbean as a consequence of drug\ntrade violence. The countries that suffer most acutely\nthe devastating effects of the situation are countries like\nours that lie between the production zones in the Andes\nand the largest consumption market, the United States:\nColombia, Venezuela, Guatemala, El Salvador and\nHonduras, and, in the Caribbean, Haiti, the Dominican\nRepublic, Jamaica and all other countries in that path.\nI would like to report that in December of last year\nthe heads of State and Government of Central America\nand of Mexico, Colombia and Chile met for what we\ncalled the Tuxtla cooperation mechanism and issued a\nvery important statement, the M\u00e9rida Declaration. It\nproclaims the urgent need to make a tangible reduction\nin demand for illegal drugs in consumer nations. We\nalso said that if that is impossible the authorities of\nthose countries have the moral obligation to explore\nevery possible means to eliminate the astronomical\nfinancial gains of criminals, including regulatory or\nmarket options.\n\nSome months later we convened representatives of\nall the countries of the hemisphere for the sixth Summit\nof the Americas in Cartagena, Colombia, where several\nLatin American leaders reiterated our concern, and\ncountries from Canada to Chile reached an agreement\nto give a mandate to the Organization of American\nStates to make a scientific analysis of all possible\noptions to battle the scourge more effectively. We also\nagreed unanimously to establish a hemisphere-wide\nplan against transnational organized crime to foster\nreal-time cooperation among all the hemisphere\u2019s law\nenforcement agencies.\nToday I formally propose that the United Nations\ncommit to making an in-depth assessment of the scale\nand limits of the current prohibitionist approach to\ndrugs. That does not mean giving up the fight or ceding\none inch to criminal organizations. We will never do\nthat. But what it does mean is that countries must take\nresponsibility, both the common responsibilities we all\nshare and differentiated responsibilities, in accordance\nwith each nation\u2019s capacities..\nIn any case, irrespective of the regulatory\nframework, all nations, especially emerging ones\nlike Mexico, must implement a coherent policy, with\na three-pronged approach. The first obligation is to\nfight crime, not to run away from it and not to allow\ncriminals to establish territories as if they were a State.\nThe second is to strengthen laws and law enforcement\nagencies and institutions. In particular, we must purge\nand strengthen police forces, public prosecutors,\nGovernment ministers and judicial authorities. The\nthird and most important is to restore the social fabric.\nWe must increase opportunities for young people in the\nareas of education, health, employment and leisure. We\nmust do it through universities, music groups, soccer\nteams and clinics to prevent and treat drug addiction.\nWe must establish active and massive prevention\nand treatment policies for young people, including\nteenagers.\nWe are already doing that in Mexico. The\nthree-pronged approach is crucial for any democratic\nState, regardless of its political philosophy. Every State\nmust fight crime, improve law enforcement institutions\nand create opportunities.\nToday I call upon all States Members of the United\nNations to assume that responsibility, which so far has\nnot measured up to the magnitude of the problem of\norganized crime, which, I repeat, is the main cause of violent death in the world. That is something the\nUnited Nations must look at. If the developed countries\nthat consume ton upon ton of drugs on a daily basis\ncannot or do not want to reduce drug consumption, then\nat least they should stem the f low of money they are\nsending to criminals and stop the exorbitant f low of\nmoney whereby users finance the deaths of thousands\nof young people. If they cannot do so, I emphasize\nthat this is the time to explore different alternatives to\nreduce consumption.\nNow is the time for the United Nations not only to\ntake part in such an analysis but to lead in earnest a far-\nreaching international discussion, in order to take stock\nof the scale and limits of the current prohibitionist\napproach and to assess the brutal, unacceptable\nviolence generated by the production, distribution,\ntrafficking in and use of drugs. It is painful to say this,\nbut the drug trade has made Latin America and the\nCaribbean the most violent region in the world. That\nassessment must be done with lucidity, academic rigour\nand global responsibility. Taking a world perspective,\nwe must explore alternatives, specifically regulatory\nor market alternatives, to see what are and what are\nnot real options that would allow all nations, working\ntogether, to put an end to the scourge that claims tens of\nthousands of lives in our region.\nAs the United Nations considers and finds solutions\nto global problems that threaten the integrity, health\nand lives of millions around the world, as it deals with\nfamine, starvation in the Horn of Africa, epidemics such\nas the H1N1 virus in Mexico, and as it tackles climate\nchange, so it must also take action to stop the wave of\ndeath and suffering with which the drug trade blights\nthe lives of our people. I respectfully urge and exhort\nthe United Nations not only to take part in but to lead a\ndiscussion, devoid of prejudgments, that addresses the\nscale of the twenty-first century challenge, encouraging\nall of us to seek new and effective approaches to solving\nthis dire problem.\nMy tenure will end in a few months. I am proud\nthat Mexico can now count on an economy that is\nsolid, increasingly competitive and able to generate\n700,000 new formal jobs annually. I can say with\nsatisfaction that today Mexico is a stronger, more\nfair and more prosperous country, as our indices of\nhuman development for education, health, housing and\nemployment show.\n\nI would also like to say that beyond tackling the four\nchallenges I referred to earlier, as a world community\nwe should strengthen the United Nations from the inside\nso that it is equipped to meet global challenges. The\ninitial task in that area is realistic, democratic reform\nof the Security Council to make it more representative\nand maintain its capacity for action by improving its\nworking methods and the accountability of its members.\nMexico also welcomes the fact that the President\nproposed \u201cBringing about adjustment or settlement of\ninternational disputes or situations by peaceful means\u201d\nas the main theme for this session. It is a crucial subject\nfor civilized coexistence and cooperation. As a country,\nMexico is committed to cooperation and the settlement\nof disputes. We are very concerned, as we know the\nAssembly is also, about the weakness and, at times,\nthe inertia of the Organization in the face of f lagrant\nviolations of international law. The grave situation in\nSyria, for example, is a danger to world peace and an\nindignity for all of us.\nWe condemn unreservedly the Damascus regime\u2019s\nrepression and the violence it has inf licted on the\ncivilian population, which has lead to a refugee crisis in\nneighbouring countries. The paralysis of the Security\nCouncil in the face of such crises must drive us to renew\nour political will to change the Organization. Just as we\nhave transformed and embellished the United Nations\nbuilding and removed the asbestos residue that we\nlived with for so many years, so it is important that we\nrenovate the Organization in order to bring it in line\nwith the demands of the twenty-first century.\nWe also condemn the premeditated terrorist attack\non the United States Consulate in Benghazi and the\nassassination of the United States Ambassador and\nseveral members of his staff in Libya.\nI reiterate that Mexico will fully comply with\nthe Millennium Development Goals established by\nthis great Organization. That is evident in our human\ndevelopment indices for education, health, housing,\nemployment and social security. In the area of security,\nwe have steadfastly fought criminal groups, updated\nour laws and thoroughly restructured our institutions.\nAt the same time, we have continued to consolidate a\ndemocratic culture and respect for human rights. In\nMexico today we have enacted reform whereby any\nhuman right recognized in any international treaty\nsigned by Mexico also becomes internal law for\nMexican courts.\n\nI am proud to leave a Mexico that has close relations\nof friendship and cooperation with every nation; a\nMexico that is an active participant in building a world\nof peace, justice, security and development. We want\nfreedom for men and women; justice and respect for\nhuman rights in our societies; an environment that we\nrespect and that will allow our beloved planet Earth to\nlive forever; and democracy, without which there is no\nfreedom or development. And, of course, we seek and\ndesire peace on Earth, goodwill to men, and peace to all\nthose in this Hall."

        "file_text": "The events of recent\nmonths have illustrated once again the importanceof the United Nations as a multilateral forum for\naddressing today\u2019s crises and challenges. The conflicts\nin Syria and Mali and the ongoing reform processes in\nmany parts of the Arab world demonstrate that we can\nface such challenges only through concerted action.\nIn Syria, thousands have lost their lives in their\nstruggle for freedom and reform owing to crimes\ncommitted by a regime that denies them every basic\nhuman right in order to stay in power. Austria condemns\nthe systematic human rights violations and bloodshed\nin Syria in the strongest possible terms. The more than\n27,000 victims and some 2.5 million people in dire\nneed of humanitarian assistance are a stark reminder\nfor each and every one of us that it is high time for the\nUnited Nations to finally act. The Security Council, in\nparticular, must assume its responsibilities in relation\nto the ever-worsening situation in the country. Violence\nhas to stop immediately, and both sides have to engage\nin a meaningful dialogue facilitated by Joint Special\nRepresentative Lakhdar Brahimi. There will be no\nsolution unless President Al-Assad steps aside and\ngives way to the forces of reason and reconciliation.\nAustria continues to fully support the ongoing\ntransition processes in the Arab world. We welcome\nthe efforts undertaken so far to lay the foundations\nfor more open, inclusive and prosperous societies. We\nencourage the newly empowered authorities to fulfil\ntheir mandate for democratic change responsibly. The\naspirations of the people for dignity and freedom must\nbe satisfied, thereby contributing to peace and stability\nin the region.\nIn that context, let me reiterate my strongest\ncondemnation of the recent attacks on diplomatic\nmissions and personnel, especially the murder of\nAmbassador Chris Stevens and three of his colleagues\nin Benghazi. Violence is never an acceptable response\nto the exercise of the fundamental right of freedom of\nspeech. To attack an Embassy and its personnel is not\nonly contrary to international law but an attack on the\nvery ideals that the United Nations stands for, namely,\nthe peaceful cooperation of Member States to build a\nbetter future together.\nThe still unresolved Israeli-Palestinian conflict\ncontinues to gravely destabilize the Middle\nEast. The terms of a negotiated and sustainable\nsolution \u2014 two States with secure and mutually\nrecognized borders \u2014 have been discussed over and\nover again and are broadly supported by the people and the international community, and yet we experienced a\ncomplete lack of progress in the last year. We therefore\ncall on the leadership on both sides to finally assume\ntheir responsibilities and enable a lasting peace and\nsecurity to be established for their children and future\ngenerations.\nThe situation in Mali also continues to be a\nmatter of grave concern. Austria has been dismayed\nby the political turmoil, with its disastrous effects on\nthe Malian population. Growing insecurity and the\ncontinued deterioration of the humanitarian and human\nrights situation call for concerted action. The high-level\nmeeting held on Wednesday was an important signal\nthat we are moving in that direction. We fully support\nthe efforts by the Economic Community of West\nAfrican States and the African Union to try to find,\ntogether with the United Nations, a lasting political\nsolution to the crisis in Mali and the Sahel region as\na whole. Austria will advocate for increased support\nfrom the European Union to contribute to that end.\nIn the light of the crises and challenges the\ninternational community is facing, Austria welcomes\nPresident Jeremi\u0107\u2019s timely choice of theme to highlight\nthe peaceful settlement of disputes in this year\u2019s\ngeneral debate. Prevention is always better \u2014 and\ncheaper \u2014 than a cure. The progress made in Sierra\nLeone, Kyrgyzstan, Nepal and Myanmar testifies how\nsuccessful sustainable mediation efforts can be.\nThe peaceful settlement of disputes can be achieved\nonly through open dialogue, based on mutual respect.\nAustria has a long-standing tradition of promoting\nintercultural and interreligious dialogue. We are proud\nto host the fifth Global Forum of the United Nations\nAlliance of Civilizations in Vienna. It will take place on\n27 and 28 February 2013, under the title \u201cResponsible\nLeadership in Diversity and Dialogue\u201d. Austria highly\nvalues the contribution of youth as a transformative\nforce. Therefore, the day before the Global Forum will\nbe dedicated to the Alliance of Civilizations youth\nevent in order to benefit from their views.\nIn that context, I am also pleased to inform that\nthe King Abdullah Bin Abdulaziz International Centre\nfor lnterreligious and Intercultural Dialogue will be\ninaugurated on 26 November in Vienna. The Centre,\na joint initiative of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia,\nthe Kingdom of Spain and the Republic of Austria,\nwill certainly offer a significant contribution to the\npromotion of dialogue.\nWe need to be clear that sustainable peace and\ndevelopment go hand in hand with respect for human\nrights, democracy and the rule of law. These are universal\nvalues that no human being should be denied. We must\nnot falter until this goal is achieved. In 2011, Austria\nwas elected to the Human Rights Council. We fully\nsupport the Council and its mechanisms, especially the\nuniversal periodic review. The Council is best placed\nto react swiftly in case of human rights emergencies.\nIts special sessions on Syria and Libya illustrated that\nthe international community will not turn a blind eye\non gross human rights violations and indiscriminate\nattacks against the civilian population. Human rights\nabuses must not go unpunished. Violations must be\nthoroughly investigated and perpetrators must be\nheld accountable before credible judicial institutions,\nincluding the International Criminal Court.\nOur membership of the Human Rights Council\nis an opportunity to continue working on the key\npriorities that Austria pursued during its Security\nCouncil membership in 2009 and 2010: the protection of\ncivilians, the safety of journalists, the implementation\nof resolution 1325 (2000) on women, peace and security,\nthe freedom of religion and belief, and the protection of\nchildren from violence and abuse.\nThe High-level Meeting of 24 September was an\nimportant opportunity to renew our commitment to\nthe rule of law at the national and international levels.\nIt now needs an adequate follow-up. As chair of the\nGroup of Friends of the Rule of Law, Austria will\nprovide concrete proposals for the upcoming report of\nthe Secretary-General.\nThe various United Nations headquarters in Vienna\nare a hub for promoting peace and security. The work\nof the International Atomic Energy Agency is more\nrelevant than ever. I am pleased that we can now also\ndraw on additional services from the new office of the\nOffice for Disarmament Affairs established in Vienna.\nAustria is deeply concerned about programmes\nfor weapons of mass destruction and proliferation\nactivities in several regions of the world. The creation\nof a zone free of nuclear weapons and other weapons of\nmass destruction in the Middle East is more urgent than\never. In that respect, let me underline that Iran must\nfinally give credible evidence for the peaceful nature of\nits nuclear programmeme and engage in earnest in the\ntalks with the European Union three plus one group.\nThe continued inability to even initiate substantive  multilateral disarmament negotiations is unacceptable.\nAustria is committed to working with other interested\nStates to move forward on that crucial issue. I would\nlike to thank the Secretary-General for his continued\nsupport in that matter.\nWe need to move beyond a strictly military security\napproach that originates from the Cold War period. It\nis time to change the discourse on nuclear weapons.\nAny use of nuclear weapons would be devastating for\nthe whole world in its humanitarian and environmental\neffects. In the twenty-first century, such an existential\nthreat to humankind can no longer be handled\nexclusively by a few States as a national security matter.\nAustria is committed to strengthening and further\ndeveloping international law and a humanitarian\napproach to advance the global disarmament and\nnon-proliferation agenda. A lot has been achieved in\nthe past two decades, as evidenced by the successful\nconclusions of the conventions to ban anti-personnel\nmines and cluster munitions. We hope that similar\nprogress can be achieved on the arms trade treaty in the\ncoming months. Other Member States should join the\nemerging consensus on regulating the trade in arms in\na comprehensive manner.\nVienna and its United Nations headquarters also\nserve as a platform for the discussion on sustainable\ndevelopment. We welcome the decision of the Secretary-\nGeneral to establish an implementation office for his\nSustainable Energy for All initiative. That will help\nto advance this important agenda. Universal access to\nenergy and the improvement of energy efficiency, along\nwith a higher share of renewable energy, are goals that\nwill help bring electricity to the billion and a half people\nworldwide lacking access. Equally, it will help control\ngreenhouse gas emissions and global warming, which\nthreaten the very existence of many Member States.\nThis year\u2019s United Nations Conference on\nSustainable Development marked the beginning of a\nnew era, renewing the prospects for future generations\nvia the sustainable development goals, as tailored to\nthe needs of different countries or groups of States\nand regions. While implementing those new global\ngoals, we should not cease our efforts to achieve the\nMillennium Development Goals by the target date of\n2015.\nAustria remains fully committed to an effective\nmultilateral system. Therefore we will support the\nefforts of the President of the Assembly and of the\nSecretary-General to further increase the effectiveness\nof our Organization in order to better enable us to face\nthe challenges of our time."

I would also like to take this opportunity to\nthank the Secretary-General for his report on the work\nof the Organization (A/67/1).\nOwing to its geographical location and historical\nties with its neighbouring countries, Cyprus has been\nclosely following and has taken particular interest in\nthe developments in the wider Middle East and North\nAfrica over the past 18 months. The sovereignty of\npeoples was and remains a fundamental principle of\nthe Organization and the functioning of States. As the\ninternational community, we should, in our opinion,\naddress events there through that prism, respecting the\nright of each people to determine its own future.\nDuring that period, we witnessed transformations\nin Tunisia, Egypt, Yemen and Libya. We stand by those\npeoples through that transition and encourage their\nefforts on the difficult road to consolidating democracy\nand the rule of law. We look forward to new structures that are inclusive of women and minorities and that\ncreate the conditions for the further participation of\ncitizens in political life.\nIt is with great sadness, however, that we are\nwitnessing the loss of human lives in the region.\nIncreased violence in Syria continues, and the potential\nspillover effects to neighbouring countries are a great\ncause for concern. We strongly condemn the violence\nand the massacres of innocent civilians in Syria and\ncall for their immediate cessation. There is undoubtedly\na humanitarian crisis there that needs urgent attention.\nRecent consultations in the Security Council have\nemphasized that. The Republic of Cyprus stands ready\nto contribute to international efforts to manage the\ncrisis, in particular as the fire is raging just outside\nour door.\nWe remain committed to respecting the sovereignty\nand territorial integrity of Syria and emphasize that\nthe continued violence and its recent intensification\nunderscore the need for a political solution. In that\nrespect, I join the rest of the international community\nin expressing our unequivocal support for the newly\nappointed Joint Special Representative for Syria,\nMr. Lakhdar Brahimi, with the sincere hope that he\nwill help bring the conflict to an end.\nAgainst that background of significant changes in\nthe region, the Middle East peace process continues to\nbe at an impasse. It is imperative to resume negotiations\nthat can eventually lead to the implementation of\nthe relevant Security Council resolutions and the\nestablishment of a free and independent Palestinian\nState on the basis of the pre-1967 borders. At the same\ntime, the solution must address Israel\u2019s legitimate\nsecurity concerns.\nNo viable solutions can be achieved in the absence\nof political dialogue. As you, Mr. President, wisely\nproposed upon your election, the \u201cBringing about\nadjustment or settlement of international disputes\nor situations by peaceful means\u201d is the overarching\npurpose of the United Nations. It nevertheless also\nremains a timeless challenge. I can personally attest to\nthat.\nCyprus still faces the consequences of foreign\nintervention, namely, the Turkish invasion and\noccupation. More than one third of my country\u2019s\nterritory is still under the military occupation of Turkey,\na fellow Member State of the Organization.\n\nOur participation at the United Nations requires\nengagement in the struggle for the protection of\nhuman rights. We share a commitment to the rule of\nlaw and are proponents of peace and security in the\nworld. Yesterday, we supported the Declaration of the\nHigh-level Meeting on the Rule of Law at the National\nand International Levels (resolution 67/1), affirming\nthe sovereign equality of States and respect for their\nterritorial integrity.\nYet Turkey, after invading Cyprus in 1974, has\ncontinued to occupy the northern part of the island for\nthe past 38 years, maintaining a strong military force\nand continuing the mass transfer of settlers from Turkey,\npursuant to its policy for the demographic alteration of\nmy country\u2019s population. Turkey continues to violate\nthe human rights and fundamental freedoms of tens\nof thousands of displaced persons, including usurping\ntheir property and violating the rights of the besieged\nand those who have lost their loved ones and continue\nto search for them.\nSince the assumption of my duties as President of\nthe Republic of Cyprus in 2008, I took the initiative,\nin collaboration with the Secretary-General, Mr. Ban\nKi-moon, to end the stalemate and to start a new process\nof direct negotiations with the then leader of the Turkish\nCypriot community, Mr. Mehmet Ali Talat, on the basis\nof a bicommunal and bizonal federation with a singly\nsovereignty, citizenship and international personality.\nWe came to an agreement on those conditions with\nMr. Talat. The process began under the auspices of the\nSecretary-General and is being facilitated by his good\noffices mission on the island.\nI believe that the Turkish Cypriot side, under\nMr. Talat, shared the vision of a solution, for the\nbenefit of all Cypriots, to terminate the occupation and\nestablish the conditions for lasting peace and security\non the island. Despite the difficulties posed by the\noccupation, at the time we achieved convergence in a\nnumber of important areas.\nSince 2010, however, despite committing itself in\nthe presence of the Secretary-General to continuing the\ntalks from where they had left off, the current Turkish\nCypriot leadership, under Mr. Ero\u011flu, has broken that\njoint commitment and has retracted from the agreement\nworked out with the previous Turkish Cypriot leader.\nIn addition, since last March, the Turkish Cypriot\nleadership, with Turkey\u2019s support, has abandoned\nthe negotiations in response to the assumption of the presidency of the Council of the European Union by the\nRepublic of Cyprus.\nFor our part, we remain committed to Security\nCouncil resolution 2026 (2011), which provides that\nan accord on the internal aspects of the Cyprus issue\nmust be achieved before convening an international\nconference on the international aspects of the matter\nwith the consent of the two communities.\nWe remain unchanged in our commitment to\nreturning to the negotiating table; to continuing the\nnegotiations in good faith; and to respecting in practice,\nnot just in words, the agreed basis for the solution of\na bicommunal and bizonal federation with a single\nsovereignty, citizenship and international personality\nand political equality, as defined in the relevant Security\nCouncil resolutions.\nWe are grateful to the Secretary-General, who\nhas willingly devoted his time and effort and invested\nin that process, despite the many challenges that this\ninternational Organization faces.\nI call on the Turkish Cypriot leadership to return\nto the table and to share our vision for a united and\npeaceful Cyprus. A solution to the Cyprus problem\nrequires the support of all concerned parties. Turkey\u2019s\npositive contribution and practical support for efforts\non the part of the two communities to take the process\nforward is crucial. Yet Turkey has instead been\npursuing \u201cgunboat diplomacy\u201d, with frequent displays\nof military strength around Cyprus.\nTurkey\u2019s alarming behaviour has been escalating\nsince September 2011, when Cyprus undertook\nexploration activities in its exclusive economic\nzone, based on its rights under international law and\nparticularly the 1982 United Nations Convention on the\nLaw of the Sea.\nTurkey has neither signed the aforementioned\nConvention nor abided by relevant customary\ninternational law. On the contrary, Turkey has carried\nout unilateral actions with respect to sea areas that are\nsituated patently beyond any reasonable geographical\nor legal limit of its continental shelf and potential\nexclusive economic zone and that clearly fall within the\nexclusive economic zone and continental shelf of the\nRepublic of Cyprus.\nTurkey is behaving as if the Republic of Cyprus\ndid not exist on the map of the region. Such behavior,\nby a country seeking to become a member State of the European Union and supposedly seeking to maintain\nzero problems with its neighbours, cannot and should\nnot be tolerated by the international community. I call\non Turkey, before this Assembly, to cease its provocative\nbehaviour. I repeat at the same time that in a reunified\nCyprus the natural resources, including hydrocarbons,\nwill be the common wealth of all Cypriots \u2014 both\nGreek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots alike.\nThe deadline set by the international community\nfor the achievement of the Millennium Development\nGoals in 2015 is nearing. We have seen much progress\nthus far but much more remains to be done, as poverty\nand hunger persist. In looking beyond 2015, we need\nto recommit ourselves to a solid new agenda aimed\nat poverty eradication, inclusive economic and social\ndevelopment, environmental sustainability and peace\nand security for all."

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt is a\nhappy coincidence \u2014 and one that gives me great\npleasure \u2014 that my fellow countryman, who is presiding\nat this meeting, has given me the f loor.\nDespite progress in the field of knowledge and\nforecasting, the evolution of humankind remains\nsubject to uncertainties. In that connection, the work of the United Nations, which is the appropriate forum\nfor seeking collective solutions to the many challenges\nthat make up our world, is markedly affected by those\nuncertainties.\nThe persistence and resurgence of hotbeds of\ntension of all kinds pose a serious threat to peace and\ninternational security, jeopardize the implementation\nof all projects for sustainable development and pose\na dangerous threat to the promotion and protection\nof human rights. In that context, it is appropriate that\nthe sixty-seventh session of the General Assembly has\nopened under the banner of the theme, \u201cBringing about\nadjustment or settlement of international disputes or\nsituations by peaceful means\u201d. My delegation welcomes\nthat choice, which is also in line with the theme of the\nprevious session on mediation and reflects in a timely\nmanner the concerns of the day and aspirations of our\nStates.\nA year ago, speaking from this rostrum, I asserted\nthe importance and necessity of mediation as an\nessential tool for the prevention and settlement of\nconflicts, a tool that has proved itself, not only in Africa\nbut around the world. Having endured the horrors of\narmed conflict for years in the 1990s, the Congo chose\nthe path of mediation and dialogue. Thanks to that\ncommitment, my country has been able to overcome\nthe sociopolitical upheavals of its recent history, and\ntoday, the peace that reigns throughout the country has\ncleared the way for the impetus needed to strengthen\nour democratic process and economic development.\nTwo rounds of legislative elections were conducted\nin an atmosphere of calm on 15 July and 5 August,\nfollowed by the peaceful celebration on 15 August of\nthe fifty-second anniversary of our independence in\nKinkala, city seat of the Department of Pool, which had\nendured violence for a long time; those events serve as\nadditional examples of positive developments.\nStrengthened by that experience, the Congo would\nlike to voice its deep concern about the continuing\ncrises threatening peace and security, regionally and\ninternationally. For many years Africa has been the\ntheatre of choice for conflict. Today a number of African\ncountries \u2014 indeed, in some cases an entire region,\nlike the Sahel \u2014 are still at the mercy of instability\nand increasingly complex crises. Several meetings\ndedicated to conflicts in Africa are listed on the agendas\nof high-level meetings during the General Assembly\u2019s\ncurrent session, which is unquestionably an indicator\nof instability in the world. However, we can agree that the conflicts and crises that have marked the African\ncontinent for the whole of its post-independence history\nhave also enriched it with the experience of mediation\ninitiatives and have mobilized efforts aimed at settling\nthe conflicts by peaceful means.\nThe Democratic Republic of the Congo is dealing\nwith a serious crisis in the eastern part of the country,\ncharacterized by repeated violence that has resulted\nin an intolerable humanitarian tragedy produced by\nsmall armed groups of the Mouvement du 23 mars\nand other opposition forces. That situation is a serious\nthreat to peace and security and to the integrity and\ndevelopment of our brother country. Furthermore, the\npolitical, security, socioeconomic and humanitarian\nconsequences can be felt throughout the Great Lakes\nregion. The heads of State and Government of the\nregion, meeting at the International Conference on the\nGreat Lakes region, are fully committed to seeking\npeaceful solutions.\nI would like to take this opportunity, as I did this\nmorning, to commend again the initiative of Secretary-\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon to organize a high-level meeting\non 27 September on the situation in the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo, which will certainly provide a\nstimulus to the International Conference on the Great\nLakes Region, supported by the African Union. The\nCongo, which is committed to that effort as a neighbour,\na State member of the Conference and a member of\nthe Peace and Security Council of the African Union,\nconcurs with the conclusions of that important meeting,\nhoping to see them realized as soon as possible, so as\nto enable the Democratic Republic of the Congo to\nregain its stability and play the role expected of that\ngreat country. Our region will continue with its efforts\nto achieve the objectives we have sought and will use\nevery mechanism we have to attain them.\nIn December the Congo will host the thirty-fifth\nministerial meeting of the United Nations Standing\nAdvisory Committee on Security Questions in\nCentral Africa, which will allow us to celebrate the\ntwentieth anniversary of that General Assembly body\nand continue our cooperation on settling crises in the\nsubregion.\nThe collapse of democracy in Mali, which was once\na fine example of democracy in Africa, represents a\nrelapse that my country has condemned, while calling\nfor a return to constitutional order. The deteriorating\nhumanitarian situation, combined with the risk of spreading terrorism, calls for urgent implementation\nof the decisions of the Economic Community of West\nAfrican States, together with the support of the African\nUnion, the United Nations and the international\ncommunity, so as to ensure that that dangerous\nprecedent is not repeated anywhere else and that any\nimpulses towards destabilizing and partitioning States\nby terrorist groups are quashed.\nMy delegation can only welcome the positive\ndevelopments in the political process established by\nthe African Union in Somalia, which culminated in\nthe election on 10 September of the new President\nof the Republic, Mr. Hassan Sheikh Mohamud.\nMany challenges remain, of course, particularly\nthose of security, unification and reconciliation and\nestablishing the rule of law, to name only a few. In\nthat regard, we must support Somalia by helping that\ncountry to strengthen the gains of recent months,\nfocusing everything we do on working within a global\nstrategy for the reconstruction and development of the\nentire Somali territory and maintaining a coordinated,\norganized and coherent approach on the part of the\ninternational community, in support of the efforts of\nthe African Union Mission in Somalia.\nRegarding the dispute between the young Republic\nof South Sudan and the Republic of the Sudan, my\ndelegation urges both countries to demonstrate the\nnecessary political will and to spare no effort to\nsuccessfully and implement sign the Comprehensive\nPeace Agreement, as called for by the African Union\nin envisioning the existence of two viable States\nand a lasting peace. We support the African Union\u2019s\nnegotiations in Ethiopia on that issue.\nOutside the African continent, particularly with\nrespect to the Middle East, the ongoing violence in\ncertain countries continues to erode the prospects for\npeace in the region, not to mention the blocked peace\nprocess between Israel and Palestine, now deadlocked\nfor several decades and, even worse, 10 years after the\nadoption of the Arab Peace Initiative. The Arab spring\nhas apparently not bloomed there, to the detriment of\nthe interests of a people who have the same right as any\nother to live in peace with its neighbours in a viable\nState. The Palestinian State has a rightful place in this\nbody.\nThe situation in Syria is particularly troubling, as\nspeakers before me have emphasized. Faced with the\nrisks of the general destabilization that that situation presents for the subregion and the world, we call for a\ncoordinated and negotiated settlement that takes into\nconsideration the interests of the various parties, so\nas to put an end to the escalating violence and serious\nviolations of human rights.\nRegarding the nuclear issue, which represents a\nserious threat to humankind in general, it is essential\nthat the nuclear-weapon States take responsibility, as\nthey should, to implement specific measures that will\nenable progress towards genuine nuclear disarmament,\nwhile monitoring the ban on nuclear proliferation\nwith regard to military purposes. We reaffirm the\nimportance of respecting the three pillars of the Treaty\non the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, that is,\nnuclear disarmament, non-proliferation and the right\nof every State to develop nuclear energy for peaceful\npurposes under the supervision of the International\nAtomic Energy Agency.\nThe development agenda of the United Nations is\nstruggling to give sustainable support to our countries\nin their unceasing efforts to improve their economic\ndevelopment and their peoples\u2019 well-being. The\ncommitments made by industrialized countries at the\nmajor international conferences under the auspices of\nthe United Nations have still not been met. The global\neconomic and financial crisis continues to weaken the\neconomies of developed as well as developing countries\naround the world. We are also concerned about the\nongoing crisis in the euro zone and its effects, which\nare having a considerable impact on the achievement\nof social development objectives at the international\nlevel, including the Millennium Development Goals.\nAreas such as the fight against poverty, employment,\neducation and health are affected by the crisis. In\nthat light, my delegation reaffirms the responsibility\nand central role of the United Nations in forging the\nspirit of solidarity and cooperation that can enable the\ncommitments made in the areas of aid and financing of\ndevelopment to be respected.\nClimate change remains a serious threat to the\nequilibrium of mankind. Sadly, we have to admit that\nwe have not done enough to reverse its negative effects\non the environment. It is therefore important to waste\nno more time and work to find solutions that will ensure\na better future for coming generations.\nAlong those lines, my delegation took an active part\nin June at the United Nations Conference on Sustainable\nDevelopment (Rio+20), a high-level exchange on the\nchallenge of sustainable development. The President of the Congo, Denis Sassou Nguesso, brought Africa\u2019s\nvoice to the Conference, in his role as spokesperson for\nthe continent. While we welcome the analysis and the\nreaffirmation of shared positions that the Conference\nyielded, my delegation remains concerned about the\nlack of real progress on the important issues of an\ninstitutional framework for sustainable development\nand for global environmental governance, as well as\nplans for their implementation.\nAlthough not all of Africa\u2019s concerns were\naddressed, Africa\u2019s common positions are nevertheless\nwell represented in the Rio+20 final document (resolution\n66/288, annex), thanks to the dogged perseverance and\nresolve of the African Group, which maintained unity\nand strove throughout the negotiation process to keep\nthe African point of view in the fore. I want to take\nthis opportunity here in New York to convey President\nSassou Nguesso\u2019s words of appreciation to the African\nGroup and to extend his special thanks to the group of\nexperts led by Kenya and its Permanent Representative.\nThe sixty-seventh session of the Assembly is an\nimportant forum for a follow-up to Rio+20. I once\nagain urge African delegates to speak with one voice\nin defending African interests in the vital matter of\nsustainable development. Especially important is the\nintergovernmental process for developing proposals for\neffective sustainable development financing strategies\nto mobilize resources and put them to effective use.\nI could well have raised many other issues, such\nas Security Council reform and the need for genuine\nglobal governance that takes into account people\u2019s\ndesire for multilateralism. But I will limit myself to a\nfew words about certain concerns that should be taken\ninto account. First is the need for global governance\nof political and security issues through the necessary\nreform of the Security Council. We also need to address\nglobal economic management by granting greater\nauthority to the Economic and Social Council. Finally,\nthere is the need for global environmental management\nthrough an international institution with real power\nto protect the environment and promote sustainable\ndevelopment.\nOur times demand the pursuit of those legitimate\ngoals, shared by the majority of Member States of our\nworld Organization. Its credibility and credit in the\nworld will increase if we meet the challenge of global\ngovernance with a unified drive to create a more peaceful, prosperous and just world for the benefit of\nall."

        "file_text": "\ufeffI would\nlike to take this opportunity to warmly congratulate\nPresident Vuk Jeremi\u0107 on his election to the presidency\nof the Assembly at its sixty-seventh session. I also\npay tribute to his predecessor, Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz\nAl-Nasser, for his efforts during his tenure. I would\nalso like to commend the continuing commitment and\nefforts of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.\nToday our world faces a complex turning point in\nits history, replete with challenges and opportunities.\nThe deep geopolitical upheavals in our region and the\nserious problems resulting from the economic and\nfinancial crisis attest to that.\nWe believe that our collective faith in multilateralism\nwill help us to unite our efforts to find solutions and\novercome the persistent uncertainty that has resulted\nfrom those changes. The unprecedented extent of our\nproblems may risk worsening the existing imbalances\nin relations among nations. All of us, without exception,\nbear a responsibility for the future of our planet, which\nwe would like to be more just and more united.\nNo country has been spared the consequences\nof the global crisis, and their management cannot be\nconsidered by only a small number of States acting to the exclusion of the rest. Quite the contrary, we all\nhave the right to participate in finding solutions. The\nslowdown in the world\u2019s economy negatively affects\nmany countries, including those of the developed\nworld, which are facing a sovereign debt crisis and\nincreasing unemployment. Therefore, further efforts\nare called for to prevent such situations from spilling\nover to other regions of the world, in particular to\nAfrica. The response to the challenges of the crisis rests\nwith our capacity to find alternatives to the theories\nand practices of the past, because the new realities of\nour times require urgent implementation of appropriate\nand more effective approaches and mechanisms for\naddressing the crisis.\nAs in previous years, we continue to suffer from\nthe effects of the multidimensional crisis, whether in\neconomic governance or in political coordination. In\nfact, the return of trust and growth should lead us to\nstep up our efforts to coordinate between the United\nNations and multilateral institutions in the economic\nand financial fields. The United Nations and the Bretton\nWoods institutions should complement each other and\nact in complete political and economic coordination\nand harmony.\nAs far as we are concerned, Algeria has shouldered\nits share of responsibility. It has made enormous\nsacrifices and continues to rigorously control and\nmanage its expenditures. The fiscal surplus that we\nhave achieved has allowed us to adopt a revived social\npolicy under our five-year plan 2010-2014 that involves\nredistributing wealth while maintaining investments\nfor economic growth.\nAlgeria has always called for combating the\ncauses and not just the consequences of instability. We\nhave insisted on the important fact that development\nand peace and security are interrelated, and that the\nstrategies of the United Nations and, in particular, the\nSecurity Council, for lasting peace must be thought of\nin harmony with socioeconomic development policies.\nIn that regard, at the regional level, Algeria is\ncontributing to the process of democratization and\nthe promotion of the rule of law and socioeconomic\ndevelopment. The fight against hunger and poverty,\nthe protection of food security, agriculture, growth,\ninfrastructure, energy and renewable energy are areas\nin which we cooperate with countries of the Maghreb\nand the Sahel. Along the same lines, Algeria is sharing\nwith African and Arab countries and with its other\npartners its experience in the area of fighting terrorism and the interrelated scourges of organized crime and\nillicit trafficking in drugs and weapons, which are\nwidespread our region.\nAlgeria welcomes the recent changes in some\ncountries of North Africa and the Middle East that\nreflected the will of their peoples, who are searching\nfor a democratic ideal, justice and dignity. Those are, in\nfact, the founding principles of the Algerian revolution.\nCommitted to the principle of self-determination of\npeoples and mutual respect among nations, Algeria\ncondemns all forms of violence and repression,\nwherever they arise. We will continue to believe that\ndialogue and negotiation are the best means for settling\ndisputes.\nAlgeria hopes that the people of Western Sahara\nwill exercise their right to self-determination. We\nurge Morocco and the Frente Polisario to act in good\nfaith and initiate formal talks, under the auspices of\nthe United Nations, with a view to reaching a just and\nlasting solution, pursuant to the norms and provisions\nof international law.\nThe search for peace, security and development is\na priority for us all. That commitment was formally\nreaffirmed by the countries of the Non-Aligned\nMovement, including Algeria, at the Movement\u2019s\nsixteenth summit, held in Tehran last August.\nWe support the commitment of the United Nations\nto conflict prevention through its unf lagging diplomatic\nefforts, and we appreciate our Organization\u2019s role in\npromoting appropriate solutions to major crises within\nthe context of its tireless and comprehensive efforts to\nbring about development.\nAlgeria is a member of the special joint committee\nof the United Nations and the League of Arab States\nto monitor the Syrian crisis. We supported Mr. Kofi\nAnnan and we will do the same with his successor,\nMr. Lakhdar Brahimi, with a view to reaching a\npolitical solution to the acute crisis that is unfolding\nwithin that fraternal country.\nIn our region today, we are facing new risks and\nthreats that point to a return of terrorism in its more\nviolent manifestations, along with its interrelated\nscourges of organized crime and trafficking in drugs\nand weapons. It is in that context that we have to\nconsider the complex situation in brotherly Mali. That\ncrisis seriously threatens the security of the countries of\nthe Sahel. In fact the deep, root causes of the situation\ncan be attributed to the ills of severe underdevelopment and abject poverty. Algeria acts in concert with the\nAfrican Union, the Economic Community of West\nAfrican States and other regional actors concerned with\na view to reaching a peaceful and lasting settlement of\nthe crisis in Mali.\nThe roles played by the General Assembly and\nthe Security Council are essential for the preservation\nand building of peace throughout the world and for\nthe realization of the principles and purposes of the\nUnited Nations Charter in the areas of international\ncooperation and development. Moreover, the missions\nof those two principal and complementary organs are\nbased on legitimacy, contrary to the deadlock in the\nreform process that began years ago. We must therefore\ndo everything possible to ensure that the General\nAssembly, the most representative organ of the United\nNations, reclaims all its competence in that context.\nThe working methods and membership of the Security\nCouncil must be revised to ensure its democratization in\nterms of new permanent and non-permanent members\nfrom the developing world, in particular from Africa,\nthe cradle of civilization.\nAlgeria is proud to celebrate this year the fiftieth\nanniversary of its independence and of its membership\nof the United Nations. Faithful to its principles,\nAlgeria has made a wise contribution to the complete\ndecolonization of Africa. Today it enjoys peace with\nits neighbours with a view to completing the process\nof regional integration. Algeria would like to become\na member of the Human Rights Council, for which\nit is a candidate for the period 2014-2016, in order to\ncontinue defending the values on which its history and\nits determination to overcome adversity is based.\nEveryone knows that the road of human rights\nis littered with many pitfalls and obstacles, such as\nauthoritarianism, xenophobia, poverty, discrimination\nand unilateral economic sanctions. In that regard, the\nembargo on Cuba, which has lasted for more than half a\ncentury and has created deprivation, is both unfair and\nanachronistic.\nFurthermore, attacks on Islam and Muslims are\na violation of human rights and a threat to peaceful\ncoexistence among peoples. We should all fight against\nthe phenomenon of Islamophobia, which is based on a\nxenophobic ideology that erroneously likens Islam to\nterrorism. That phenomenon must be fought. In that\ncontext, the tragic events engendered by the infamous\nvideo concerning Islam and its Prophet are reprehensible\nin many respects. Similary, Algeria condemns acts of violence perpetrated against diplomatic officers and\nmissions, which are vehicles for friendly relations\nand cooperation among peoples. Algeria proposes an\ninitiative under the auspices of the United Nations to\nidentify the ways and means to organize a response\nthat puts an end to such hateful events, which threaten\ninternational peace and security. In that regard, we\ncannot forget that the appropriate and responsible use\nof freedom of expression should also endow our world\nwith a more human and brotherly face through the\npromotion of dialogue among religions and cultures.\nAt the sixty-seventh session of the General\nAssembly, Algeria would like to welcome the State\nof Palestine as a new Member of the United Nations\nfamily, recognized within its 1967 borders, with\nAl-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital. We believe that the\ntime has come for Palestine to be fully represented at\nthe centre of this irreplaceable international forum, the\nUnited Nations. Recognition of the legitimate rights\nof the Palestinian people to sovereignty and self-\ndetermination is an inalienable right and a necessary\nprecondition for a just and lasting peace in the Middle\nEast, which is currently being prevented by the Israeli\npolicy of occupation.\nIn addition, the creation of a zone free of weapons\nof mass destruction in the Middle East is an important\nconfidence-building measure. In that regard, we support\nthe efforts of the Under-Secretary of State for Foreign\nAffairs of Finland, Jaakko Laajava, as facilitator for\nthe conference on the establishment of a Middle East\nzone free of nuclear weapons and all other weapons of\nmass destruction, to be held before the end of this year\nin Helsinki.\nAlgeria is committed to a global and ambitious\nagreement to protect the environment and promote\nsustainable development. In that regard, we are grateful\nto the Group of 77 and China, which we have the honour\nto preside over this year, for its constant support and\ncooperation, which has made it possible to achieve the\nresults of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable\nDevelopment, the strengthening of the Nairobi\nWork Programme and the preparations for the next\nconferences on climate change and biodiversity. Algeria\nurges Member States to shoulder their responsibilities\nin implementing the commitments entered into under\nthe concept of common but differentiated responsibility,\nthat is, namely, the financing of the transfer of know-\nhow, technology and capacity-building in the area of\nsustainable development. The President of the Republic, Mr. Abdelaziz\nBoutef lika, has given new impetus to the programme of\nreforms aimed at strengthening the democratic process,\nthe rule of law and the advancement of women. The\nlegislative elections of 10 May 2012 yielded a significant\nincrease in women\u2019s representation, with 146 women\nMembers of Parliament, representing one third of the\nLower Chamber.\nOur country has made tangible progress in the\npolitical, economic and social areas, and we continue\nour efforts to establish and consolidate our democratic\nfreedoms based on the principle of equal opportunity\nembodied in our Constitution. Those steps have enabled\nour country to achieve in general the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals prior to 2015. That led to Algeria\nbeing chosen as one of the 50 countries selected by the\nUnited Nations for consultations on the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals and the post-2015 development\nagenda.\nIn conclusion, I thank members for their attention\nand wish them every success in the work of our session."

Our people are following dear\nrespected Marshal Kim Jong Un with absolute trust in\nhim and are vigorously advancing to the final victory\nwith full conviction in and optimism about the future,\nsingle-heartedly united behind him.\nThe founding of the United Nations in the last\ncentury gave hope to mankind following a tragic\nworld war \u2014 hope of achieving common prosperity\nby ensuring peace and security and developing\ncooperation among States based on the principle of\nsovereign equality. Yet today, after the first decade\nof the new century, that desire of the mankind has yet\nto be achieved. At present in international relations,\nhigh-handedness and arbitrariness are becoming ever\nmore undisguised, and the use of force and acts of\nState terrorism aimed at infringing on sovereignty,\ninterference in internal affairs and effecting regime\nchange are being perpetrated under such pretexts as\nnon-proliferation and humanitarian intervention.\nWe are now witnessing the resurrection of the\noutdated international relations of the first half of the\ntwentieth century, when a handful of great Powers\ndominated the world by resorting to the use of force.\nThis resurrection tarnishes the credibility of the United\nNations, whose mandate is to ensure global peace and\nsecurity.\nThe fact that the theme \u201cBringing about adjustment\nor settlement of international disputes or situations by\npeaceful means\u201d was chosen for the current session\nshows the seriousness of the current international\nsituation. The most serious issue in the international\narena at present is a f lagrant violation of the principles\nof respect for sovereignty and equality. Unless the\nhigh-handedness and arbitrariness of certain countries\nare thoroughly eliminated, it will be hard to say that\nthe United Nations is fulfilling its role and function as\na centre for coordinating cooperative relations between\nStates based on the principle of sovereign equality as\nenshrined in the Charter of the United Nations.\nThe unjustifiable interference, pressure and use\nof force that violate the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Syria and the right to self-determination\nand existence of Palestine should be rejected.\nDemocratizing the United Nations and, in\nparticular, strengthening the authority of the General\nAssembly are urgent issues for enhancing the central\nrole of the United Nations in international relations.\nThe Assembly resolution adopted long ago on\ndismantling the so-called United Nations Command\nstationed in South Korea and the resolution adopted\nannually on ending the United States blockade against\nCuba remain unimplemented. These are typical\nexamples that show the need to strengthen the authority\nof the General Assembly.\nIt is quite natural for the General Assembly, which\nrepresents the general will of all Member States, to\nsupervise the overall activities of the Organization. In\nparticular, it should be given the authority to undertake\nfinal review of Security Council resolutions related to\npeace and security, such as sanctions and use of force.\nThe abuse of the Security Council as a tool for pursuing\nstrategic interests by a handful of countries should\nnever be overlooked. Last April, the United States took\nissue with our legitimate and peaceful space launch,\nwhich followed universal international law, and forced\nthe Council to adopt an unjust statement. That alone\nshows how the Council has been abused.\nSecurity Council reform, which is at the core of\noverall United Nations reform, is a matter that should\nno longer be delayed. It should be carried out in a\nmanner that guarantees responsibility, transparency,\nimpartiality and objectivity in its activities and ensures\nfull representation of developing countries in its\ncomposition.\nOther United Nations bodies in which double\nstandards and the theory of force are extremely evident\nare the Third Committee of the General Assembly and\nthe Human Rights Council. Politicization, selectivity\nand double standards in deliberations on human rights\nshould be put to an end. We should never allow the\ncontinuation of the practice whereby human rights\nsituations of selected countries are either called into\nquestion or simply ignored in accordance with the\npolitical purposes and interests of the West and the\nWestern standard values.\nIn the field of sustainable development, which\nis now one of the three targets set by the United\nNations, the agreement reached in the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development, held last June\nin Rio de Janeiro, should be implemented. Practical\nmeasures should be taken to solve such issues as\nestablishing fair international economic and trade\nrelations, fulfilling official development assistance\ncommitments, transferring environmentally clean\ntechnologies to developing countries and strengthening\nfinancial support.\nToday, due to the ongoing hostile policy of\nthe United States towards the Democratic People\u2019s\nRepublic of Korea, a vicious cycle of confrontation\nand aggravation of tension continues to afflict the\nKorean peninsula, which has become the world\u2019s most\ndangerous hotspot, a place where a spark could set off\na thermonuclear war. At the root of that hostile policy,\nwhich has lasted for more than half a century, towards\nthe Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea lies the\nintention of the United States to destroy the ideas and\nsystem our people have chosen and to occupy the entire\nKorean peninsula, in order to use it as a stepping stone\nin realizing its strategy of dominating all of Asia.\nSince the day the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of\nKorea was founded, the United States has designated it\nan enemy and refused to recognize its sovereignty. Since\nthen, it has pursued every kind of sanction, pressure and\nmilitary provocation against the Democratic People\u2019s\nRepublic of Korea for more than half a century. Its\nhostile policy is most deeply rooted in the military field.\nNo precedent can be found in modern history for the\nsituation whereby the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of\nKorea and the United States have continued as warring\nparties after hostilities ended and for more than 60\nyears altogether.\nWith a view to eliminating the Democratic People\u2019s\nRepublic of Korea by force, the United States has\nalready finalized various war scenarios, and is waiting\nfor a chance to implement them, as it has outlined in a\ncontingency plan to impose military rule after a military\ninvasion. In accordance with those plans for military\noperations, the United States has staged various joint\nmilitary exercises under different names in and around\nthe Korean peninsula for several decades. A typical\nexample was a combined military exercise named Ulji\nFreedom Guardian, staged at the end of last August and\ninvolving huge numbers of armed forces, which pushed\nthe situation on the Korean peninsula to the brink of\nwar.\nIt is only the patience and military deterrent self-\ndefence capacity of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea that have prevented the continued military\nprovocations of the United States from turning into all-\nout war on the Korean peninsula. However, this does\nnot mean that the patience of the Democratic People\u2019s\nRepublic of Korea is inexhaustible. Our people value\npeace and stability in pursuing their overall goal of\nbuilding a prosperous and powerful State. But the\ndignity of our nation and the sovereignty of our country\nare even more valuable.\nOur principled stand is based on reacting to an\naggressor\u2019s reckless provocations with an immediate,\ncorresponding strike in defence of our nation\u2019s dignity\nand sovereignty, and to respond to a war of aggression\nwith a just war of reunification of the country. The\nrealities of the situation on the Korean peninsula\nprove that we have been absolutely right to have built\na military deterrent capacity for our self-defence, by\ntightening our belts in order to pursue the path of\nSongun and independence. Our military deterrent is a\nmighty weapon that defends the country\u2019s sovereignty\nand a powerful means of preventing war on the Korean\npeninsula, as well as a strong guarantee that enables\nus to focus our efforts on economic construction and\nimproving people\u2019s livelihoods.\nThe only way to prevent war and ensure lasting\npeace on the Korean peninsula is to put an end to\nthe hostile policy of the United States towards the\nDemocratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea. That policy\nis the root cause that has made the Korean peninsula\nthe world\u2019s most dangerous hotspot, and it is the chief\nobstacle to lasting peace and security. The nuclear\nissue on the Korean peninsula is also a product of that\npolicy. None of these problems, including the Korean\npeninsula nuclear issue, can be resolved without first\nending the hostile policy of the United States, which\nviews the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea as an\nenemy target and tries to stif le it at any cost. That is the\nessence of the process of our dialogue with the United\nStates and a lesson we have drawn from practical\nexperience.\nSince the turn of the new century, North-South\nsummit meetings have been held twice, amid the joyful\nenthusiasm of all our fellow countrymen. They resulted\nin the adoption of the 15 June North-South Joint\nDeclaration and the 4 October Declaration, and created\nan atmosphere in which the desire for reconciliation,\ncooperation and reunification between North and South\nreached a peak. Soon after taking office, however, the\nnew South Korean authorities annulled all inter-Korean agreements, including the 15 June North-South Joint\nDeclaration and the 4 October Declaration, which had\nbeen warmly welcomed and were fully supported by the\nentire Korean nation and the international community,\nincluding the United Nations. Furthermore, the\nconfrontation between fellow countrymen and systems\nhave caused an extreme deterioration in inter-Korean\nrelations. The South Korean authorities rubbed salt in\nthe wounds of our people, who had suffered such a huge\nnational loss, even insulting our supreme dignity with\nacts of political terrorism, and leaving inter-Korean\nrelations totally bankrupt. History will bring them to\njustice.\nThe Government of the Democratic People\u2019s\nRepublic of Korea will join hands with anyone who\ntruly desires the country\u2019s reunification and national\nreconciliation and prosperity. With responsibility and\npatience, and relying on the nation\u2019s concerted efforts,\nit is making every effort to realize the historic cause\nof national reunification by preventing interference by\noutside forces and any attempt by anti-reunification\nforces to achieve permanent national division.\nThe Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea will\ncontinue to further strengthen and develop the relations\nof friendship and cooperation with all countries that\nrespect its sovereignty, pursuant to the principles\nof independence, peace and friendship on which its\nforeign policy is based, and will actively cooperate with\nthe efforts of United Nations Member States to secure\nworld peace and stability and to achieve sustainable\ndevelopment."

        "file_text": "\ufeffOn behalf of the Government\nof the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka, I\ncongratulate Vuk Jeremi\u0107 on his election as President\nof the General Assembly at its sixty-seventh session. His proven skills and charming personality leave no\nroom for doubt that under his able leadership we will\nachieve our goals for this session. Sri Lanka is also\npleased to endorse the theme proposed by him for this\nyear\u2019s high-level debate.\nFor 67 years, the United Nations has provided the\npremier forum for the resolution of international disputes\nand the negotiation of landmark global goals. In the\nconduct of international relations, Sri Lanka, a founding\nmember of the Non-Aligned Movement, firmly upholds\nthe tenets of peaceful coexistence, mutual respect\nfor each other\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity,\nnon-interference in the internal affairs of other States,\nequality and mutual benefit. Sri Lanka believes that,\nin the settlement of international disputes, action must\nbe based on the fundamental principle of the sovereign\nequality of States, a principle firmly enshrined in the\nCharter of the United Nations. The noticeable recent\ntendency to selectively and arbitrarily intervene in the\ninternal affairs of States f lies in the face of this principle\nand dilutes the confidence so carefully nurtured in the\nUnited Nations system.\nThe global financial crisis has posed a major\nchallenge to the entire international community. In\nthis context, it is of the greatest importance to ensure\nthat any strategies employed to achieve recovery do not\nimpose unjustifiable burdens on developing countries,\nas they strive to achieve better living conditions for\ntheir people. A recovery that does not simultaneously\nuplift developing countries will be, by its very nature,\nunsustainable. It is paradoxical that the very countries\nin which the financial crisis originated now seek to\nprovide policy prescriptions for others.\nIt has been noted that many countries of the South\nhave weathered the financial storm successfully. Sri\nLanka\u2019s economy, which has been carefully managed\nduring this period, is one of the Asian economies\nthat has recorded impressive gains by any standard.\nA growth rate of 8.2 per cent was achieved in 2011.\nFollowing the end of the conflict in 2009, the areas\nformerly controlled by terrorists, namely the northern\nprovince, recorded a 27 per cent growth in gross\ndomestic product in 2011. The exponential boom in\nagriculture and fisheries in particular has contributed\nsubstantially to this result.\nWe are now at a significant juncture in human\nhistory, as climate change looms as the greatest\nchallenge to the very existence of humanity. Many\ndeveloping countries, including my own, are still struggling to regain lost opportunities and improve the\nlivelihood of their people while staring global warming\nin the face. Our carbon footprint remains negligible.\nIt is imperative that the developed world deliver on its\nsolemn undertakings to assist developing countries, as\nwe seek the common goal of arresting climate change,\nwhich is caused by human activities.\nThe United Nations Conference on Sustainable\nDevelopment (Rio+20), held in June 2012, demonstrated\nconvincingly the efficacy of United Nations processes.\nThe potential of the green economy, however, will be\nless attractive if we do not clearly understand its long-\nterm consequences at the national level for sustainable\neconomic strategies. The transition to a green economy\nmust not generate negative externalities that retard\neconomic growth and perpetuate societal inequity\nand poverty. Assistance to developing countries under\nNorth-South development cooperation mechanisms\nmust take into account global initiatives to mitigate\nthe adverse consequences of too rigid an application of\ngreen economic principles. The efforts of developing\ncountries themselves in this regard must be recognized\nand further facilitated.\nAs Member States, we must respect the principles\npatiently negotiated by the international community.\nThese are, in particular, the equality of rights,\nthe equal sovereignty of all States and the right to\ndevelopment, as underlined in the Rio+20 outcome\ndocument (resolution 66/288, annex). The interests of\nthe developing world must be entrenched and protected.\nHence, no constraining conditions should be applied to\ndevelopment models or approaches adopted by Member\nStates that could prevent the achievement of sustainable\ndevelopment together with the eradication of poverty.\nThe middle-income countries are the main driving\nforce for strengthening our global economy. Sri Lanka\u2019s\nbalanced socioeconomic policy strategies propelled\nus to middle-income status a few years ago. As we\nhave repeatedly emphasized, countries\u2019 attainment\nof middle-income status does not by itself provide a\nsolution to the issue of poverty and other development\nchallenges.\nI wish to mention in particular that Sri Lanka\nemploys a unique development strategy that empowers\ncitizens, with special attention to social development\nneeds. It has continued to achieve transformational\nchange in the lives of its people by effectively\nmobilizing available resources and delivering\nsustainable and citizen-centred programmes. Sri Lanka has emphasized synergistic interactions between health\ncare and education, public infrastructure development,\nincluding improved water and sanitation, transport\nand communications, especially under an integrated\nregional development approach, which we consider to\nbe important. We also enjoy a 98 per cent literacy rate,\nwith the score for girls being even higher. The success\nof this strategy is reflected in Sri Lanka\u2019s high ranking\non the human development index, of which we are\nlegitimately proud.\nSri Lanka has achieved many of the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) and is well on track to\nrealize all of them by 2015, including the eradication\nof poverty. Eradicating poverty and improving the\nquality of life of our people has been the cornerstone\nof social development policies in Sri Lanka over\nmany decades. Sri Lanka\u2019s key policy document,\n\u201cMahinda Chintana \u2014Vision for the Future\u201d, has set\nspecific targets to combat poverty within the MDG\nframework. A range of projects has been designed\nfor the eradication of poverty by 2016. Through the\nGama Naguma and Divi Naguma programmes, which\ndeal with village awakening and the enhancement of\nlivelihoods and incomes, we have been addressing\nrural poverty eradication and ensuring food security.\nThese programmes continue to promote the concept\nof self-employment, directing financial and technical\nassistance to youth and women in rural areas, including\nthose who suffered from the terrorist conflict.\nThe contribution of women in Sri Lanka\u2019s\nsuccessful realization of most of the MDGs is of great\nsignificance. Women who are literate also encourage\ntheir children to focus on education and aspire to higher\ngoals. It is through the participation of women that Sri\nLanka has been recognized for its achievements in the\nWorld Health Organization breastfeeding promotion\nand immunization programmes. I note with great pride\nthat Sri Lanka produced the first elected woman Prime\nMinister in the world in 1960.\nWe have made genuine efforts to ensure that the\nfruits of economic development are equally distributed\nand are accessible, especially to the most vulnerable\nsegments of society. We have ensured that social\nmobility is not confined to the privileged in the towns\nand cities of the island, but penetrates deep into the\nrural hinterland.\nThree years ago, our Government ended the\nterrorist challenge largely through its own efforts. Sri Lanka is firmly committed to redressing the grievances\nof all parties affected by the internal conflict. After\nthe release of the report of the Lessons Learnt and\nReconciliation Commission, a local mechanism set in\nplace by the President of Sri Lanka, an action plan to\ngive expeditious effect to its recommendations was\nadopted. A comprehensive national action plan for\nhuman rights with specific timelines has been approved\nby the Cabinet of Ministers. The Government has also\nproposed a transparent and democratic process under a\nparliamentary select committee to address post-conflict\nreconciliation issues. That initiative has, regrettably,\nbeen delayed by the failure of some opposition parties\nto nominate their representatives.\nSri Lanka exemplifies the challenges faced by\na society emerging from the shadow of a sustained\nconflict that spanned three decades; the country is now\nentering an era of peace and tranquillity. The gradual\ndiminution of the challenges and the brevity of the\nperiod that has elapsed since the end of the conflict\nleave no room for doubt as to the degree of success\nachieved by the Government of Sri Lanka with respect\nto a wide range of issues relating to development and\nreconciliation. It has only been about three years since\nthe conflict ended.\nPrioritization was a central feature of the\nGovernment\u2019s plan of action. The progress on the\nground during the last three years with regard to\nthe resettlement of internally displaced persons; the\nreintegration into society of thousands of ex-combatants\nafter exposure to programmes of livelihood skills\ntraining, which equipped them to earn their living with\ndignity and independence; the rapid completion of the\nmine-clearance process; and the unprecedented focus\non infrastructure development leading to very visible\ninvigoration of the economy of the island as a whole,\nand the Northern province in particular, are quite\napparent.\nThe experience of Sri Lanka demonstrates that,\nwith the dynamic leadership of high quality and the\nunwavering commitment that President Mahinda\nRajapaksa has provided, along with an effective\npolitical and military strategy and strong rapport with\nall sections of the public, it is possible to prevail against\nthe most ruthless forces of terror. No one has a greater\ncommitment to reconciliation in an all-inclusive spirit\nthan our Government. Unhelpful external pressures\nthat support narrow partisan interests could easily\nderail initiatives that have produced very substantial results and peace on the ground, as we begin a new and\nexciting chapter in our country\u2019s history.\nIn the international community\u2019s quest to bring\nsome semblance of equity to economic development\nacross the continents, we must maintain increased focus\non the continent of Africa, especially through South-\nSouth cooperation. Sri Lanka is vigorously expanding\nits engagement with the region, especially in matters\nrelating to trade, investment, tourism and technical\nassistance.\nAll of our current endeavours should have a stronger\nfocus on children and youth, who are the custodians of\nour future.\nWe have continuously supported resolution 66/6 and\nthe need to end the unjust economic, commercial and\nfinancial embargo against Cuba. Unilateral sanctions\nof that nature, which harm ordinary people, have no\nplace in modern international intercourse.\nTerrorism remains a scourge in the contemporary\nworld, threatens our societies and impedes the\nsocioeconomic progress of our people. As a country\nthat has emerged from ruthless and brutal terrorism, Sri\nLanka continues resolutely to support all multilateral\nefforts to enhance peace and security and eliminate\nall forms of terrorism, without discrimination. In our\ncollective quest to eradicate terrorism, the selective\napplication of principles and double standards must be\nscrupulously avoided. Terrorism from whatever source\nmust be unequivocally condemned and countered.\nIt has been established that terrorism has developed\nclose links with transnational organized crime in the\nform of cybercrime and identity theft, environment-\nrelated crime, maritime piracy, the smuggling of\nmigrants and trafficking in persons and drugs.\nMaritime piracy has emerged as a major threat to\ninternational sea lanes and has added an additional\neconomic burden to global trade. Sri Lanka, which has\nbeen a trading nation for centuries, eagerly supports\nmultinational efforts to counter that threat. But it must\nbe remembered that piracy originates on land and that\nany solution to piracy must also address its causes and\ndevelopments on land.\nThe illicit transportation of migrants to greener\npastures overseas by criminal networks requires\nour collective attention. Sri Lanka also continues to\ncooperate closely in that regard with our bilateral\nand multilateral partners. As a member of the Bali Process, we are committed to cooperation in capacity-\nbuilding, the exchange of best practices and law\nenforcement cooperation. At the same time, we believe\nin the necessity to share information in good faith,\nacknowledging that action on the part of a variety of\nMember States, with their various national interests, is\nessential to counter the sophisticated human smuggling\nrings.\nOne long-standing issue that weighs on the\nconscience of the international community and which\nneeds our sustained collective attention is the restoration\nof the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people. Sri\nLanka fully supports the implementation of all relevant\nUnited Nations resolutions on Palestine, which will\npave the way for the achievement of Statehood for\nthe Palestinian people and bring lasting peace to the\nregion. Sri Lanka fully supports Palestine in its efforts\nto achieve full membership in the United Nations.\nSri Lanka unreservedly condemns the defamation\nof all religions and religious leaders. While the right\nto free speech is fundamental to our value system, that\nright should not be abused in order to hurt the feelings\nof the faithful, whether they be Buddhists, Muslims,\nChristians, Hindus, Jews or followers of other faiths.\nAll available mechanisms must be employed to prevent\nthe defamation of all religions and the exploitation of\nreligious symbols for commercial purposes.\nIn conclusion, Sri Lanka is currently in the\nprocess of making arrangements to host the World\nYouth Conference in 2014. The primary objective\nwill be the strengthening of youth inclusion in\nnational decision-making processes in relation to the\ndevelopment and implementation of the post-2015\ndevelopment agenda. I cordially extend an open\ninvitation to all fellow Member States to join hands\nwith us to make that global event a success."

        "file_text": "\ufeffMay I offer\nmy warm congratulations to Mr. Vuk Jeremi\u0107 on his\nelection to the position of President of the General\nAssembly at its sixty-seventh session.\nFollowing the experiences of recent years, the world\nis poised at a difficult moment in its development. The\nweakness of international institutions in the face of\neconomic, security, humanitarian and environmental\nproblems is indisputable, and yet those institutions\nwere designed to resolve such problems. That also\napplies to the Security Council, especially in the\ncontext of the conflict in Syria. It is also clear that\ninternational financial institutions are not capable of\nhandling the destructive volatility of financial markets,\nwhich results from the opaqueness and arbitrariness of\npowerful private interests operating in this area.\nThe signals coming from Asia point to an\nundiminished number of tensions and disputes. We\nhave been following with concern the tension resulting\nfrom the Iranian nuclear programme. We are worried\nby the increasingly tangible threat of the proliferation\nof weapons of mass destruction and of an intensified\narms race among the Gulf States.\nThe results of the Mission in Afghanistan are not\nentirely satisfactory. We must learn a lesson from the\nshortcomings of the strategy devised for that country thus far. The approach that suggests the military option\nfirst is not a suitable method for resolving complex\ninternal conflicts.\nThe hopes raised by the Arab Spring have been\njustified, but only to a certain extent. The civil war\nin Syria and the resulting toll in lives, as well as the\nUnited Nations and Arab League\u2019s inability to contain\nit, cast a shadow across the entire region. The tragic\ndeath of American diplomats and the circumstances\nof their death should also prompt ref lection among all\nthose persuaded of the automatic nature of democratic\ntransformations.\nWhen we signed the United Nations Charter, which\nis the constitution of the contemporary international\norder and testifies to our faith in a better world, we\npledged our readiness to make concerted efforts and\ncooperate in pursuit of the ideals invoked in it. One\nof the main paths to a more secure and fair world is\nthe peaceful resolution of disputes and conflicts. That\nconcept is the main theme of this year\u2019s session of the\nAssembly, and the choice of that subject is timely. In\nrecent years, we have seen numerous occasions in which\na commitment pursuant to Article 2 of the Charter was\nignored, with very dramatic consequences. The best\nexample is the crisis in Syria, but such situations also\noccur in other parts of the world.\nThroughout the twentieth century, the international\ncommunity developed various means and ways to\nachieve a peaceful settlement to disputes at both the\nglobal and regional level. Volumes have been written on\nthe subject. There are many international institutions\ninvolved in this field, as well as many renowned and\nprominent experts, diplomats and politicians. Some of\nthem, including Jimmy Carter and Martti Ahtisaari,\nhave been rightly acknowledged by being awarded a\nNobel Peace Prize. They were able to effectively use\nexisting procedures to quell conflicts and peacefully\nresolve difficult disputes of an international or\ninternal nature that otherwise could have escalated\ninto international conflicts. However, success was not\npossible everywhere. If success was not achieved, it\nwas because of the absence of one crucially important\nfactor without which it is impossible to settle a dispute\nin a peaceful, lasting and just manner, namely, realizing\nthe obvious truth that without compromise one cannot\narrive at a lasting solution to any conflict. That is\nembedded in the very nature of conflict.\n\nIn that connection, I would like to refer to the Polish\nexperience with the Solidarity movement and the round\ntable talks of the spring of 1989. Both sides of the deep\nsocial conflict of those days \u2014 the communist regime,\non the one hand, and the champions of democratic\ntransformation who ultimately strove to overthrow\ncommunism, on the other \u2014 demonstrated wisdom and\nwere thereby able to reach a compromise, even if it was\nnot fully satisfactory to either party. It was nevertheless\na compromise that opened perspectives for further\nchange, which extended beyond Poland to the entire\nregion of Central and Eastern Europe. What made that\ncompromise possible was the capacity for self-control\nby those actors who ultimately strove to achieve a\nrevolutionary change. Let us recall that all previous\nattempts undertaken by the democratic opposition\noutside the system ended in military interventions,\nbloodshed, tens of thousands of refugees and further\nrepression. That could have also been the case on a\nmassive scale in the spring of 1989.\nIn the long run, the capacity for self-control and\nthe strength of a wise compromise make a much better\nsolution than pushing one\u2019s own demands and trying to\nadvance one\u2019s own arguments by force. We know all too\nwell what happens in the latter case; it usually ends in\npeople taking up arms in order to prove their rightness\nby military means. In line with the rules of geopolitics,\nboth parties to a conflict seek allies abroad. Finally,\nthe logic of holding each other in check and an \u201call or\nnothing\u201d mentality start to prevail. Costs are no longer\ncounted. As the conflict continues, the scale of the crisis\ngrows. The situation develops into a truly international\none. In order to fend off any further escalation of\nantagonisms, major humanitarian and stabilization\noperations supported by the army and police force are\ninevitable. The process of reconciliation, normalization\nand reconstruction is greatly delayed.\nWe have seen that process in various situations in\ndifferent countries. It can be avoided provided that,\nfrom the very outset of a dispute, both sides anticipate\ndialogue, acknowledge the limits of what is feasible,\nshow sensitivity to the potential costs of conflict and\nseek compromise. The art of self-control and of wise\ncompromise, embodied by Nobel Prize winners Lech\nWalesa and Nelson Mandela, are worth promoting.\nHowever, this approach is not promoted often\nenough in the context of efforts for peaceful conflict\nresolution and situations that may lead to conflict.\nSyria is a dramatic example of how a wasted chance for compromise can unfold. We expect that an end\nwill be soon put to the bloodshed in Syria and that the\nconflict will be settled on the basis of United Nations\nprinciples, using the instruments available to the\nOrganization. May the new United Nations envoy for\nthat conflict never lack determination in the fulfilment\nof his mission.\nAfter many centuries of antagonism, disputes and\nconflicts in Europe, yet another preventive method\nwas invented in order to do away with wars and stop\ndifferences and competing claims from turning into\nbloody crises. That method is the process of regional\nintegration, which was ushered in after the Second\nWorld War by the creation of the European Coal and\nSteel Community. The project\u2019s hidden intention was\nto firmly establish the \u201cno war\u201d principle. It was not\nenough to ban war, as had been done through the\nKellogg-Briand Pact of 1928. What was needed was for\nwar to be made impossible by the process of integration.\nThrough the establishment of the Community and its\nexpansion to new areas of integration, including most of\nthe countries on the continent, the disputes threatening\nEurope\u2019s security and peace were consigned to the past.\nEven if that experience cannot be used in a completely\ncopy-and-paste manner, it can still serve as an example\nto other regions of the world.\nThe plight of civilian populations, in particular\nchildren, is the most dramatic consequence of the lack\nto self-control and the absence of a culture of, and\nwillingness to, compromise in contemporary disputes\nand internal and international conflicts. The methods\nand means of combat spare soldiers, sometimes at the\nexpense of innocent civilians, especially children,\nwho often become a target of military operations.\nThis phenomenon is related to efforts to move the\naggression to the other side. The responsibility for\ncivilian casualties, even if unintended, can also fall on\ninternational and peacekeeping forces.\nBased on experience gathered by the international\ncommunity, the contentious idea of humanitarian\nintervention has been replaced with the concept of the\n\u201cresponsibility to protect\u201d. I believe that this was a very\nwise path to take to end the stalemate that emerged in\nthis area more than 10 years ago. The concept of the\nresponsibility to protect has been approved by the\nentire international community and has been a United\nNations norm since 2005.\n\nAs we know, a norm and its practice may sometimes\nbe worlds apart. Given the developments that have\nunfolded over the past decade, including several events\nin North Africa, and in the light of the humanitarian\ntragedies, in particular the suffering and death of\nthousands of innocent children, that should stir people\u2019s\nhearts and consciences, we cannot afford for the\nresponsibility to protect to remain a dead letter. What\nwe put forward for the Assembly\u2019s consideration is that\nthe United Nations should initiate work on defining\na catalogue of instruments to be applied in situations\nthat entail the responsibility to protect. This is about\nthe international community being effective without\nexceeding a mission\u2019s mandate and inciting disputes on\nthat count.\nThis is a particularly important consideration for\nus in Poland. Our nation has more than once fallen\nvictim to crimes perpetrated on a mass scale. Prompted\nby that awareness, Tadeusz Mazowiecki, special\nrapporteur on crimes in the Balkans for the Human\nRights Commission, embarked on his mission 20 years\nago. The effectiveness of the international community\nwhen faced with f lagrant violations of human rights on\na mass scale and crimes and suffering that call for rapid\nreaction, as in Syria these days, depends largely upon\nthe credibility of our action in previous such situations.\nWe must always act in good faith and in line with the\nmandate given to us.\nI am speaking on behalf of a country that, over the\npast 20 years, has managed to travel the difficult road\nfrom a totalitarian regime, the collapse of its economy\nand mass social unrest curbed by force to democratic\nstability, economic growth and the ability to support\npeaceful transformations beyond its borders. Thirty\nyears ago, when martial law was imposed in order to\ncrush the Solidarity revolution, it was suggested that\nPoland\u2019s attempt to enter the world of democracy would\nentail potential imbalances between the East and West,\nand even a war between the Warsaw Pact nations and\nNATO \u2014 in effect, a world war.\nFortunately, those days are gone. Hardly anyone\nwould think in such terms now. Today, Poland is a free\ncountry that develops its relations without limitations,\nshares its experience, spreads the word about the\nbenefits derived from our transition to democracy and\nextends development and humanitarian aid. We are a\ncountry that has had a positive economic growth rate\nfor the past 20 years.\n\nPoland\u2019s commitment to the stability of the\nEuropean integration process mirrors our understanding\nof the process as one that serves the security of all of\nEurope and its neighbourhood. That is why we actively\nendeavour to bring together the two parts of Europe once\ndivided by the Cold War. The European Union Eastern\nPartnership programme was designed to that end, with\nPoland and Sweden as its initiators and promoters.\nPoland readily offers support to and shares\nexperiences with countries and societies embarking\non the road to democracy in North Africa, Asia and\nEurope. To the extent we are able, Poland is involved\nin developing contact with countries from different\nregions and civilizations. Our policy in that regard\narises from the conviction that an effective United\nNations is as urgently needed today as it was in the\ndays of the Cold War. The world cannot be driven by\na bipolar or multipolar concert of Powers. Of course,\nalthough the Powers will not cease to exist, stability\nand regulation of the international legal order will\nrequire the more extensive engagement of multilateral\ninstitutions, as well as norms and mechanisms securing\nfull observance. Only the United Nations system can\nensure all of those.\nIn order to improve its effectiveness, we need\nto reform the Organization along the way, respect\nagreed norms and honour our commitments in good\nfaith. We recall that a return to a Hobbesian world is\nalways possible and that some people continue actively\nto bring it about. That is why Poland felt sorely tried\nunder the effects of the twentieth-century dramas.\nHowever, Poland is committed to promoting respect for\nthe principles, integrity and full implementation of the\noutput of our Organization. Such action will ensure that\nthe tasks we propose will be carried out effectively and\nthe United Nations will meet the expectations we set\nout at its very beginning and continue to promote today."

        "file_text": "\ufeffAllow me to\ncongratulate the President on his election and to offer\nthe steadfast support of my country for his term.\nEach year we renew our commitment to our United\nNations and to the Charter that enshrines, in the plainest\nof language, our hopes and aspirations for a progressive,\npeaceful and secure world. Our Organization and our\nCharter have survived and thrived through dark times\nand great adversity. The letter and spirit of the Charter\nremain alive and vibrant in a constantly changing world.\nOur work continues to be important, even in the face of\ndoubts about the relevance of multilateral institutions.\nAll that was possible because at the heart of our\ndetermination to build peace has been our commitment\nto the rule of law. Keeping faith in the law allows us\nto treat each other fairly and in the spirit of sovereign\nequality. It provides the rules that enable nations to\nrelate to one another and work together. It reduces\narbitrariness and unilateralism. Fidelity to the rule of law allows us not only the means to resolve differences\nbut also the substance on which to build better\nunderstanding.\nOur advocacy for the rule of law not only is born\nof our experience and insights as a founding Member\nof the United Nations and an active participant in\ninternational affairs, but also is deeply rooted in our\nexperience as a nation. Our freedom was hard-won.\nOur democracy was achieved only after decades of\ndictatorship. Our governance was sullied by corruption\nand patronage in previous years.\nOur President, Benigno S. Aquino III, has placed\nthe rule of law at the centre of his governance. As a\nresult, the culture of impunity has been neutralized,\nour economy is on the upswing and our people\u2019s rights\nand freedoms are assured.\nAmong the gravest threats that continue to face us\ntoday is the deadly testament of man\u2019s ability to destroy\nhis fellow man. The full force of the rule of law must be\nbrought to bear to prevent the proliferation of nuclear\nweapons, to promote nuclear disarmament and to end\nthe f low of illicit weapons. The Philippines is proud\nto have presided over the 2010 Review Conference\nof the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation\nof Nuclear Weapons. The historic adoption of the 64\naction points strengthened the legal regime of the\nTreaty.\nWe also support nuclear-weapon-free zones,\nincluding the Southeast Asian Nuclear-Weapon-Free\nZone created by the Association of Southeast Asian\nNations. It is essential that such a zone be created for the volatile Middle East, as envisaged by the 2010\nReview Conference. The Philippines commends the\nStates of the region, the depository States of the 1995\nresolution 50/78, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and\nthe Government of Finland for setting the stage for\nthe 2012 Conference that will pursue that most urgent\nobjective.\nThe Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty\nis another critical pillar of global disarmament and\nnon-proliferation. The Philippines commends Indonesia\nfor being the latest annex 2 State to ratify the Treaty,\nand it reiterates its call to the remaining eight annex\n2 States to accede at the soonest possible time. Other\nStates not included in annex 2, but not parties to the\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, must do the\nsame to ensure the universality of the Treaty.\nWe must also actively pursue respect for the law of\npeace and humanitarian law in the numerous regional\nconflicts that affect the lives, safety and well-being of\nmillions of people around the world. Towards that end,\npeacekeeping is the crucial tool by which the Charter\u2019s\nmandate is carried out. Despite its limited resources,\nthe Philippines is doing its part in that important task.\nWe are currently a major contributor to United Nations\npeacekeeping missions. We call on others to also do\nall that they can. And we support innovative efforts to\nhelp embattled communities, including proposals on\npossible unarmed peacekeeping that would expand the\ncivilian component of our endeavours.\nThe Philippines also recognizes the important role\nof women in the promotion of peace and continues to\ndeploy more female peacekeepers to peacekeeping\nmissions. We aim to attain and surpass the 10 per\ncent deployment target of women in country troop\ncontingents and 20 per cent for police deployments.\nWith a tenth of the population of our country in\nforeign lands, there is a very real and human dimension\nto our quest to strengthen the rule of law. To further\ngalvanize international dialogue and cooperation, the\nPhilippines has been among the principal advocates for\ndeveloping norms of international law that will protect\nnot only our overseas Filipinos but all migrants. Human\ntrafficking is a crime of such magnitude that it cannot\nbe dealt with by a single nation or even by a group of\nnations. The international community as a whole must\nstand together against that scourge. For that reason, the\nPhilippines became a founding member of the Group\nof Friends United against Human Trafficking, and we\nare the main sponsor of the biennial General Assembly\nresolution on trafficking in women and girls.\nIn pursuit of that objective, we call on all Member\nStates to implement the Global Plan of Action against\nTrafficking in Persons and to ratify and enforce human\nrights instruments such as the Palermo Protocol and\nthe International Convention on the Protection of the\nRights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their\nFamilies.\nMany of my country\u2019s overseas Filipinos are found\non merchant ships. Filipinos form the bulk of seafarers.\nMany have fallen victim to pirates. Maritime piracy\ncontinues to be a menace to the entire world. A full 80 per\ncent of world trade travels by sea \u2014 almost six billion\ntons of cargo, moved by some 93,000 merchant vessels,\nmanned by 1.25 million seafarers. The business and\nhuman costs of piracy cannot be overstated. We support\nbilateral, multilateral, regional and interregional efforts\nto address the impact of piracy, including measures to\nimprove the welfare of affected seafarers.\nThe Philippine Constitution values the dignity of\nevery human person and guarantees full respect for all\nhuman rights. Our National Human Rights Action Plan\n2009-2014 aims to mainstream human rights standards\ninto all parts of the national Government and national\nlife. The Plan fully respects our obligations under the\neight major international human rights treaties.\nAs a founding and current member of the Human\nRights Council, the Philippines works with the other\nmembers of the Council to safeguard the human\nrights of vulnerable groups, such as migrants, women,\nchildren, young people, the elderly, indigenous peoples\nand persons with disabilities. The Philippines has\nactively contributed to initiatives on human rights,\nextreme poverty, human rights education, combating\ntrafficking in persons, especially women and children,\nand climate change.\nThe Philippines was one of the first nations to\nsubmit to the universal periodic review process of\nthe Human Rights Council. Last month, the Council\nadopted by consensus our second report under that\nreview mechanism.\nThe noble vision of the Universal Declaration of\nHuman Rights and of many other profound declarations\nis far from being realized for the poor, the deprived,\nthe oppressed and the marginalized. The recent global\nfinancial and economic crises have left such vulnerable sectors of our societies in even greater danger. The\nPhilippine Government therefore strongly supports\nmeasures for the empowerment of those disadvantaged\nand endangered groups and strongly advocates policies\nthat aim to raise their participation and integration in\nsociety.\nFor that reason, it is important to achieve the\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) and to plan\nfor the post-MDG period, after 2015. Accordingly,\nthe Philippines, together with Tanzania, initiated\nresolution 66/124, entitled \u201cHigh-level Meeting of the\nGeneral Assembly on the realization of the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals and other internationally agreed\ndevelopment goals for persons with disabilities\u201d. The\n2013 High-level Meeting seeks the inclusiveness of the\ndisabled, a cause to which all should rally.\nWe are instituting measures to enhance the role\nand the status of women and are strengthening their\nprotection through the Philippine Commission on\nWomen, whose foundation predates the Convention on\nthe Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against\nWomen, through the key legislation of the Magna Carta\nof Women and through the Philippine Plan for Gender-\nResponsive Development 1995-2015.\nMigration remains an unheralded and\nunderappreciated dimension of globalization today. Yet\nthe reality is that hundreds of millions live and work\noutside their native lands, providing benefits to both\ntheir host nations and their countries of origin. The\nGlobal Forum on Migration and Development, which\nthe Philippines chaired in 2008, allows us to share our\npractical experiences in migration management and in\nprotecting the rights and welfare of all migrants. We\nlook forward to a successful outcome of the Forum\nsummit in Port Louis, Mauritius, in November.\nEarlier this year, the Philippines was pleased to\nratify two key international instruments that affect\nmigrants everywhere, namely, the Maritime Labour\nConvention and the Convention concerning Decent\nWork for Domestic Workers. Our ratification brings\nthose two agreements into force next year.\nAs a further indication of our commitment to\nprotecting the rights of migrants, the Philippines\nwill co-host a regional meeting of the Global Forum\non Migration and Development, under the title\n\u201cInternational Migrant Domestic Care Workers at the\nInterface of Migration and Development\u201d, in Manila\nlater this month, with the support of UN-Women, the International Labour Organization and the International\nOrganization for Migration.\nThe rule of law is an instrument of justice and\ndevelopment. Yet the continuing global economic\nchallenges and financial instability make it even more\nimportant that we focus on ensuring that the rule of\nlaw gives everyone their due. Poverty, hunger, poor\nhealth and education and a deteriorating environment\nare threats to all and require nothing less than our\nconcerted and collective response.\nIn all development efforts, we must respect the\nprinciples and norms of sustainability that are crucial\nto the continued health of the Earth and of our peoples.\nConsequently, the Philippines will further integrate\nkey ideas from the United Nations Conference on\nSustainable Development into the review of its medium-\nterm development plan, even as we continue to pursue\nthe attainment of the Millennium Development Goals\nby 2015.\nFor many developing countries such as the\nPhilippines, food security remains a crucial issue.\nRecent events have shown that the capacity to\nsource affordable food can affect millions of people,\nsometimes even to the extent of their sheer survival. We\nexpress our appreciation to the General Assembly for\nthe adoption of resolution 66/222, declaring 2014 the\nInternational Year of Family Farming.\nAs a country particularly prone to natural disasters,\nincluding those wrought by climate change, we value\nthe work being done in advancing the management of\nnatural disaster risk reduction. Global and regional\ncooperation through partnerships is the best way\nto strengthen the international humanitarian and\nemergency response system.\nNatural disasters plague mankind. The forces of\nnature are difficult to contain. That should not be the\ncase in humankind\u2019s quest for peace. While natural\ndisasters are impossible to prevent, the same is not true\nof war and conflict.\nThe United Nations was created to protect the\nweak from the strong, to provide for the equality of\nall sovereign States and to enshrine the rule of law\nas the governing principle in regulating international\ndisputes.The Philippines is therefore steadfast in\npromoting the peaceful settlement of disputes through\na rules-based approach. We stand firmly behind the\nefforts of the United Nations to promote the rule of law\nand mediation. In 1982, we adopted the Manila Declaration on\nthe Peaceful Settlement of Disputes. This year marks\nits thirtieth anniversary. The principles and processes\nset out in the Manila Declaration remain applicable to\nthis day and are a stark reminder that we have yet to\novercome the barriers that divide countries and peoples\nthroughout the planet. For that reason, we share the\nPresident\u2019s view that \u201cBringing about the adjustment\nor settlement of international disputes or situations\nby peaceful means\u201d is essential to the future peace,\nprogress and prosperity of all nations.\nFurthermore, from the perspective of the rule of law,\nand given the maritime disputes that have intensified\nin the Asian region, the United Nations Convention on\nthe Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) has never been more\nrelevant than it is today. All States must respect their\nobligations to settle their maritime disputes by peaceful\nmeans under UNCLOS, without the threat or use of\nforce. A rules-based approach under UNCLOS can\npeacefully resolve the Asian maritime disputes.\nToday, my country faces its most serious\nchallenge \u2014 a challenge to the security of its maritime\ndomain and the integrity of its national territory, as well\nas its effective protection of its marine environment.\nTo address this challenge and to arrive at a durable\nresolution, we must rely on the rule of law and not the\nforce of arms. We must rely on the body of rules that\nstate that disputes must be resolved peacefully. We must\nrely on the norms and rules enshrined in UNCLOS. We\ntherefore rely on our friends and allies and all those\nwho believe in the peaceful and fair management of the\nseas and oceans to uphold the rule of law and UNCLOS.\nWe will endeavour to elicit a more proactive approach\nfrom the General Assembly.\nWe often hear the quote that \u201cwe are a country of\nlaws and not of men\u201d. I shall modify it to say that \u201cwe\nare a community of nations and not of hegemons\u201d. Let us\nmake this a reality. Let us all, without exception, respect\nthe international legal framework to utilize institutions\nand adhere to commitments in treaties and conventions.\nFor in so doing, we create global norms that will serve\nour nations in good stead today and in the future, and\nwe will preserve the one great institution that we have\ncharged with promoting peace and prosperity in our\nworld, our United Nations. If we achieve this, rather\nthan being forced to accept that might is right, we will\ninstead demonstrate that right is might."

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt is a great honour for me\nto speak from this rostrum for the first time since I\ntook office in January. I would like to congratulate\nPresident Jeremi\u0107 on assuming the chair of this highly\nrepresentative body and wish him success in his\nchallenging task. I also wish to commend the work\nof his predecessor, Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser,\nPresident of the Assembly at its sixty-sixth session.\nLet me express our gratitude and appreciation to\nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his inspiring\nvision, reform efforts and result-oriented action. I also\nwish to welcome the appointment of Mr. Jan Eliasson of\nSweden as Deputy Secretary-General.\nOur time is marked by historic shifts and\nby achievements in science, technology and\ncommunications that shape the global economy and politics but that, we should also bear in mind, have an\nimpact on every human being. More and more nations\naround the world have now opted for open, free and\ndemocratic societies based on the rule of law and\ngood governance. But such historic transformations\ndo not always bring more peace and stability. On\nmany occasions we still face extreme violence and\nbloodshed, causing senseless loss of innocent lives,\nhuman suffering and destruction.\nThe main theme of the Assembly\u2019s general debate\ntoday could not be more relevant for us as political\nleaders. Dealing with violent conflicts and promoting\npeace, security, development and human rights have\nalways been at the core of the United Nations. At\nyesterday\u2019s High-level Meeting, we affirmed our\ncredo that the rule of law forms the basis of a peaceful\nand predictable system of international relations.\nNowadays, as conflicts have become more complex, we\nshare the view that mediation and good offices should\nbe the tools of preference for dealing with escalating\ntension.\nDelivering justice is vital to addressing terrorism,\none of the ugliest and most despicable crimes against\nhumanity. No cause whatsoever can justify the\nindiscriminate killing of innocent civilians. Sadly\nenough, no country or human being today can feel safe\nor insured against this evil. Just a few weeks ago, at the\nSofia synagogue, we paid tribute to the memory of five\nIsraeli citizens and one Bulgarian who lost their lives in\nthe shocking terrorist attack last July at the airport of\nSarafovo, a lively tourist destination on our Black Sea\ncoast. From this high stage today in New York, a few\nmiles from the September 11 memorial, I now reaffirm\nour strongest condemnation of that awful crime. My\ncountry will spare no effort to bring the perpetrators\nand masterminds to justice. That attack on our own\nsoil has made us stronger and more determined to align\nwith others in implementing the United Nations Global\nCounter-Terrorism Strategy.\nWe condemn the violent acts committed recently\nin the name of defending religious beliefs. This is\nunacceptable. We urge all involved to show tolerance\nand avoid provocative actions that can be destructive to\npeace and stability.\nFor more than a year now the continuing brutal\nviolence in Syria has provoked our extreme concern.\nEach day brings testimony of unacceptable levels\nof bloodshed and human suffering. The regime in Damascus has lost all legitimacy by waging a reckless\nwar on its own people and refusing to heed the calls for\na negotiated way out of the crisis. Due to the growing\nnumber of refugees, the humanitarian situation is\ndeteriorating day by day and the stability of neighbouring\ncountries is also at risk. Bulgaria condemns these\ngross violations of basic United Nations principles\nand of international humanitarian law. We call for full\naccountability on the part of the perpetrators, including\nby bringing them before the International Criminal\nCourt. My country subscribes to the acts of solidarity\nundertaken by the European Union and its members\nin providing relief to the suffering civilian population\nthrough emergency humanitarian assistance.\nIt is regrettable that the active involvement of\nthe United Nations and the international community\nhas so far failed to ensure the Syrian authorities\u2019\ncompliance with the peace proposals elaborated\nthrough international mediation. Bulgaria gave its full\nsupport to the diplomatic efforts of Mr. Kofi Annan and\nwelcomed the appointment of Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi as\nJoint Special Representative of the United Nations and\nthe League of Arab States for Syria. While the violence\nand bloodshed should be stopped immediately, we\nalso call for the start of a transition towards inclusive\nand representative democratic rule in Syria, one\nthat guarantees the rights of all citizens regardless\nof ethnicity or religion. Bulgaria has supported the\nSyrian opposition groups in their efforts to unite on an\nalternative to the current regime, on the basis of the\nvision of a new democratic State that can be a home that\nwelcomes all Syrians.\nThe promotion of just, inclusive and transparent\nsocieties supports the process of democratic transition,\nknown as the Arab Spring, that has swept across the\nMiddle East and North Africa. Bulgaria welcomes\nthe steps taken by several countries on the path to\nconstitutional and political reform, and we trust that\nthose are now irreversible.\nAt the same time, the need to reactivate the Middle\nEast peace process seems now more pressing than\never. Bulgaria looks forward to the resumption in good\nfaith of direct negotiations and expects both parties to\ndemonstrate their continued commitment to a peaceful\nsolution that respects the legitimate interests and\nsensitivities of the Israeli and Palestinian people. All\nefforts should made to create an environment conducive\nto a comprehensive peace settlement between the two\nStates, a two-State solution. In that respect, we urge both the Palestinians and the Israelis to refrain from\nany unilateral actions that could be destructive to the\npeace process.\nDisarmament and non-proliferation of weapons\nof mass destruction are areas that continue to demand\nstrong political will and action by the international\ncommunity. It is essential that we continue to\nstrengthen the comprehensive regime of the Treaty on\nthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and of other\nmajor international instruments, such as the Chemical\nWeapons Convention. With regard to conventional\narms, Bulgaria consistently supports the negotiation\nprocess leading to the adoption of a legally binding\narms trade treaty that is robust in substance.\nAlong with others, we believe that Iran\u2019s full\ncooperation with the International Atomic Energy\nAgency is of paramount importance. The Government\nin Tehran must show greater transparency of its nuclear\nactivities and fully comply with all relevant Security\nCouncil resolutions. We look to a resumption of the\nhigh-level negotiations on the future of Iran\u2019s nuclear\nprogramme and a clear demonstration of political\nwill by the Iranian authorities to undertake concrete\nconfidence-building steps and address the concerns of\nthe international community.\nBulgaria highly values the role of the Human\nRights Council as the primary United Nations body\nfor the protection and promotion of human rights. I am\ndelighted to announce that my country will be seeking,\nfor the first time, election to the Council for the period\n2019 to 2021.\nOver the past two decades, Bulgaria has gone\nthrough a successful transition from totalitarian rule to\na functioning democracy with an open market economy\nand a vibrant civil society. It has been a difficult,\ndramatic and sometimes turbulent journey. I think\nour greatest achievement in this process was to have\npreserved the long-standing tradition of tolerance and\ndialogue between ethnic and religious communities\nwithin Bulgarian society. That tradition can be clearly\nillustrated by a glimpse of the centre of our capital, where\nfour temples of different religions \u2014 Islam, Judaism\nand Catholic and Orthodox Christianity \u2014 coexist\npeacefully, surrounded by archaeological monuments\nof several ancient civilizations.\nIt is in this spirit that we stand ready to share the\nexperience from our road to democracy with other\ncountries undergoing similar challenges. More than a year ago, Bulgaria initiated an international forum\ncalled the Sofia Platform , providing a useful venue for\ndialogue and an exchange of views and best practices\namong countries in the region. We got experts,\nofficials and representatives from Governments,\nnon-governmental organizations and civil societies all\nover the world focusing on the transition processes in\nCentral and Eastern Europe, the Balkans and the Middle\nEast. The forum showed that although the historical,\ncultural and political realities vary in different countries\nand regions, conclusions and lessons learned can be\nrelevant in the field of national reconciliation, rule of\nlaw, institution-building and security sector reform.\nBulgaria maintains its unwavering commitment\nto the process of European Union (EU) enlargement,\ninvolving all our neighbouring countries of South-\nEastern Europe and the Balkans. We confirm our\nconviction that all States of the region should one day\nbecome part of the European Union, on the basis of\ntheir own merits and criteria fulfilled in the negotiation\nprocess. At the same time, pursuing the national reform\nagendas, solving outstanding issues and building\nregional cooperation and good neighbourly relations, in\naccordance with the European standards, is of direct\nbenefit to all countries of the region and their European\nperspective. All of us in South-Eastern Europe are\ninterested in promoting business and human contacts\nwith our neighbours, developing cross-border projects\nand facilitating travel, building railways and highways,\nand developing communications and regional energy\nand transport infrastructure facilities \u2014 all as part of\nthe pan-European networks. That is why we need to\nmake the best use of existing regional bodies, such as the\nOrganization of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation\nand the South-Eastern European Cooperation Process\nwith its Regional Cooperation Council.\nA few months ago, at the Rio+20 Conference on\nSustainable Development, we made a good start on\nthe path to a greener and safer world. The outcome\ndocuments indicate that sustainable development is\nthe only possible way forward. The triple-win policies\nenvisaged in the outcome document, \u201cThe future we\nwant\u201d (resolution 66/288, annex) seek to advance social\ndevelopment, economic growth and environmental\nsustainability, all at the same time. Our task now is\nto focus on the Conference follow-up and to deliver.\nThe General Assembly should discuss the formulation\nof sustainable development goals to be integrated\ninto the United Nations development agenda beyond\n2015. We see an important role for the Economic and Social Council in the process, and we stand ready to\ncontribute, taking the opportunity of our membership\nin the Council.\nIn the context of the United Nations development\nagenda, let me stress that Bulgaria, as an EU member,\nis deeply committed to the implementation of the\nMillennium Development Goals and is working to\ngradually increase its share as a donor of development\nand humanitarian aid, in compliance with the\ncommitments it has undertaken. During this Assembly\nsession, Bulgaria will sign the Food Assistance\nConvention.\nBeing myself a strong supporter of greater focus\non education as a key area for sustainable development,\nallow me to express my high appreciation for the\ninitiative of the Secretary-General \u201cEducation First\u201d.\nI am convinced that in a knowledge-based network of\neconomies, education is the best investment in order\nto prepare young generations for global citizenship.\nWe welcome the designation of UNESCO\u2019s Director-\nGeneral, Mrs. Irina Bokova, as the Executive\nSecretary for this initiative. In view of her outstanding\nperformance so far, Bulgaria advocates Mrs. Bokova\u2019s\nre-election for a second term at the helm of UNESCO\nfor the period 2013 to 2017.\nWe highly value UNICEF\u2019s noble mission to\npromote children\u2019s rights, safety and well-being. Over\nthe past few years, the role of UNICEF in Bulgaria\nevolved from the usual technical assistance to a\nstrategic partnership with the Government in order to\npromote fundamental reforms. In November this year,\nmy country will host a UNICEF-sponsored high-level\nregional conference on child care system reform.\nFinally, let me assure the Assembly that Bulgaria\nwill continue to give its full support to the noble cause\nof building a stronger, rule-based multilateral system\nwith an enhanced role for the United Nations at its\ncentre. Success on that path will be achieved only by\nworking together."

        "file_text": "\ufeffI am proud that\nthis year Britain welcomed the world to the Olympic\nand Paralympic games and put on a great display,\nshowing that while we may have only the twenty-\nsecond-largest population in the world, we can roll out\none of its warmest welcomes.\nI am honoured, too, that in the coming year I have\nbeen asked to co-chair the high-level panel designed to\nhelp us build on one of the greatest achievements of the United Nations, the Millennium Development Goals.\nBritain takes that work very seriously. I am convinced\nthat we need to focus more than ever on the building\nblocks that take countries and people from poverty to\nprosperity. By those building blocks I mean the absence\nof conflict and corruption and the presence of property\nrights and the rule of law. We should never forget that\nfor many in the world the closest relative of poverty is\ninjustice. Development has never been just about aid\nor money, but I am proud that Britain is a country that\nkeeps its promises to the poorest in our world.\nA year ago I stood here and argued that the Arab\nSpring represented an unprecedented opportunity for\nadvancing peace, prosperity and security. One year\non, some believe that the Arab Spring is in danger of\nbecoming an Arab winter. They point to the riots on\nthe streets, to Syria\u2019s descent into a bloody civil war, to\nfrustration at the lack of economic progress and to the\nemergence of newly elected Islamist-led Governments\nacross the region.\nBut I believe those people are in danger of drawing\nthe wrong conclusion. Today is not the time to turn back,\nbut to keep the faith and to redouble our support for open\nsocieties and for people\u2019s demands for a job and a voice.\nYes, the path is challenging. But democracy is not, and\nnever has been, simply about holding an election. It is\nnot one person, one vote, once. Democracy is about\nestablishing the building blocks of true democracy:\nthe independence of the judiciary and the rule of law,\nwith the majority prepared to defend the rights of the\nminority; the freedom of the media; a proper place for\nthe army in society; and the development of effective\nState institutions, political parties and a wider civil\nsociety.\nI am not so naive as to believe that democracy\nalone has some magical healing power. I am a liberal\nConservative, not a neo-conservative. I respect each\ncountry\u2019s different histories and traditions. I welcome\nthe steps taken in countries where reform is happening\nwith the consent of the people. I know that every\ncountry takes its own path, and that progress will\nsometimes be slow. Some countries have achieved\nstability and success based on tradition and consent.\nOthers have endured decades in which the institutions\nof civil society were deliberately destroyed, political\nparties banned, free media abolished and the rule of\nlaw twisted for the benefit of the few. We cannot expect\nthe damage of decades to be put right in a matter of\nmonths. But the drive for opportunity, justice and the rule of law and the hunger for a job and a voice are not\nresponsible for the problems in the region. In fact, quite\nthe opposite: the building blocks of democracy, fair\neconomies and open societies are part of the solution,\nnot part of the problem. We in the United Nations\nmust step up our efforts to support the people of those\ncountries as they build their own democratic future.\nLet me take the key arguments in turn. First, there\nare those who say there has been too little progress,\nthat the Arab Spring has produced few tangible\nimprovements in people\u2019s lives. That is not right. Look\nat Libya since the fall of Al-Qadhafi. We have seen\nelections to create a new Congress, and now plans to\nintegrate armed groups into the national police and\narmy. None of that is to ignore the huge and sobering\nchallenges that remain.\nThe murder of Ambassador Chris Stevens was a\ndespicable act of terrorism. But the right response is\nto finish the work that Chris Stevens gave his life to.\nThat is what the vast majority of Libyans want, too, as\nwe saw so inspiringly in Benghazi last weekend, when\nthey took to the streets in the thousands, refusing to\nallow extremists to hijack their chance for democracy.\nThe Arab Spring has also brought progress in\nEgypt, where the democratically elected President\nhas asserted civilian control over the military; in\nYemen and Tunisia, where elections have brought new\nGovernments to power; and in Morocco, where there\nis a new Constitution and a Prime Minister appointed\non the basis of a popular vote for the first time. Even\nfurther afield, Somalia has also taken the first vital step\nforward by electing a new President. So there has been\nprogress. None of it would have come about without\npeople standing up last year and demanding change,\nor without the United Nations having the courage to\nrespond to those crises.\nSecondly, there is the argument that the removal of\ndictators has somehow started to unleash a new wave of\nviolence, extremism and instability. Some argue that in\na volatile region, only an authoritarian strong man can\nmaintain stability and security. Or even, some argue,\nthat recent events prove that democracy in the Middle\nEast brings terrorism, not security, and sectarian\nconflict, not peace. Again, I believe we should reject\nthat argument.\nI have no illusions about the danger that political\ntransition can be exploited by violent extremists. I\nunderstand the importance of protecting people and defending national security. Britain is determined\nto work with our allies to do that. But democracy\nand open societies are not the problem. The fact is\nthat, for decades, too many were prepared to tolerate\ndictators like Al-Qadhafi and Al-Assad on the basis\nthat they would keep their people safe at home and\npromote stability in the region and the wider world. In\nfact, neither was true. Not only were theose dictators\nrepressing their people, ruling by control not by consent,\nplundering the national wealth, and denying people\ntheir basic rights and freedoms, they were funding\nterrorism overseas as well. Brutal dictatorships made\nthe region more dangerous not less; more dangerous\nbecause those regimes dealt with frustration at home\nby whipping up anger against their neighbours, against\nthe West, against Israel; and more dangerous, too,\nbecause people denied a job and a voice were given no\nalternative but a dead-end choice between dictatorship\nand extremism.\nWhat was heartening about the events of Tahrir\nSquare was that the Egyptian people found their voice\nand rejected that false choice. They withheld their\nconsent from a Government that had lost all legitimacy,\nand they chose instead the road to a more open and fair\nsociety. The road is not easy, but it is the right one. I\nbelieve it will make countries safer in the end.\nNext, there are those who say that, whatever may\nhave been achieved elsewhere, in Syria the Arab Spring\nhas unleashed a vortex of sectarian violence and hatred\nwith the potential to destroy the whole region. Syria\ndoes present some profound challenges. But those who\nlook at Syria today and blame the Arab Spring have got\nit the wrong way round. We cannot blame the people\nfor the behaviour of a brutal dictator. The responsibility\nlies with the brutal dictator himself.\nAl-Assad is today inf laming Syria\u2019s sectarian\ntensions, just as his father did as far back as the slaughter\nin Hama 30 years ago. And not only in Syria; Al-Assad\nhas colluded with those in Iran who are set on dragging\nthe region into wider conflict. The only way out of\nSyria\u2019s nightmare is to move forward towards political\ntransition and not to give up the cause of freedom. The\nfuture for Syria is a future without Al-Assad. It has to\nbe based on mutual consent, as was clearly agreed in\nthe International Conference on Syria held in Geneva\nin June. If anyone was in any doubt about the horrors\nthat Al-Assad has inf licted on his people, just look at\nthe evidence published this week by Save the Children:\nschools used as torture centres, children used for target practice. A 16-year-old Syrian called Wael who was\ndetained in a police station in Daraa said: \u201cI have seen\nchildren slaughtered. No, I do not think I will ever be\nOK again...lf there was even 1 per cent of humanity in\nthe world, this would not happen\u201d.\nThe blood of those young children is a terrible stain\non the reputation of the United Nations. In particular,\nit is a stain on those who have failed to stand up to\nthese atrocities and those who in some cases aided\nand abetted Al-Assad\u2019s regime of terror. lf the United\nNations Charter is to have any value in the twenty-\nfirst century, we must now join together to support\na rapid political transition. At the same time, no one\nof conscience can turn a deaf ear to the voices of\nsuffering. Security Council members have a particular\nresponsibility to support the United Nations appeal for\nSyria. Britain, already the third biggest donor, is today\nannouncing a further $12 million in humanitarian\nsupport, including new support for UNICEF\u2019s work\nto help Syrian children. We look to our international\npartners to do more as well.\nOf course, the Arab Spring has not removed\novernight the profound economic challenges that\nthese countries face. Too many countries face falling\ninvestment, rising food prices and bigger trade deficits.\nBut it is completely wrong to suggest that the Arab\nSpring has somehow created those economic problems.\nIt is a challenging time for the world economy as\na whole. There was never going to be an economic\ntransformation overnight, not least because far from\nbeing successful open-market-based economies, many\nof these countries were beset by vested interests and\ncorruption, with unaccountable institutions. That has,\none might say, created a double problem. Not just\nfragile economies, but worse, people were told they had\nexperienced free enterprise and open markets when\nthey had experienced nothing of the sort.\nSo we must help these countries unwind the legacy\nof endemic corruption, military expenditure they\ncannot afford, natural resources unfairly exploited; in\nshort, the mass kleptocracy that they suffered under for\ntoo long.\nWhile I am on the subject of stolen assets, we also\nhave a responsibility to help these countries get back\nthe stolen assets that are rightfully theirs, just as we\nhave returned billions of dollars of assets to Libya. It\nis simply not good enough that the Egyptian people\ncontinue to be denied those assets long after Mubarak\nhas gone.\n\nToday, I am announcing a new British task force to\nwork with the Egyptian Government to gather evidence,\ntrace assets, work to change European Union law and\npursue the legal cases that will return the stolen money\nto its rightful owners, the Egyptian people.\nFinally, perhaps most challenging of all for Western\ncountries like mine, is the argument that elections\nhave simply opened the door to Islamist parties whose\nvalues are incompatible with truly open societies. My\nresponse to this is clear. We should respect the outcome\nof elections. But we should not compromise on our\ndefinition of what makes an open society. We should\njudge Islamists by what they do.\nThe test is this. Will they entrust the rights of\ncitizenship to fellow countrymen and countrywomen\nwho do not share their specific political or religious\nviews? Do they accept that, unlike the dictators they\nreplaced, they should never pervert the democratic\nprocess to hold onto power if they lose the consent\nof the people they serve? Will they live up to their\ncommitments to protect the rule of law for all citizens,\nto defend the rights of Christians and minorities and\nto allow women a full role in society, in the economy\nand in politics? The truth is this: we cannot build\nstrong economies, we cannot build open societies and\nwe cannot have inclusive political systems if we lock\nout women. The eyes of the world today may be on the\nbrothers, but the future is as much in the hands of their\nmothers, their sisters and their daughters.\nHolding Islamists to account must also mean that\nif they attempt to undermine the stability of other\ncountries, encourage terrorism instead of peace or\npromote conflict instead of partnership, we will oppose\nthem. That is why Iran will continue to face the full\nforce of sanctions and scrutiny from the United Nations\nuntil it gives up its ambitions to spread a nuclear shadow\nover the world. It is also why we should not waver from\nour insistence that Hamas give up violence. Hamas must\nnot be allowed to dictate the way forward. Palestinians\nshould have the chance to fulfil the same aspirations for\na job and a voice as others in the region, and we support\ntheir right to have a State and a home. And Israelis\nshould be able to fulfil their own aspirations to live in\npeace and security with their neighbours.\nOf course there are challenges in working with\nGovernments that have different views and cultural\ntraditions. But there is a fundamental difference\nbetween Islam and extremism. Islam is a great religion\nobserved peacefully and devoutly by more than 1 billion people. Islamist extremism is a warped political\nideology supported by a minority that seeks to hijack\nthat great religion, to gain respectability for its violent\nobjectives. It is vital that we make that distinction.\nIn Turkey, we see a Government with roots in\nIslamic values but with democratic politics, an open\neconomy and a responsible attitude to supporting\nchange in Libya, Syria and elsewhere in the region.\nI profoundly believe the same path is open to Egypt,\nTunisia and their neighbours. We must help them take\nit. Democracy and Islam can flourish alongside one\nanother. Let us judge Governments not by their religion,\nbut by how they act and what they do. Let us engage with\nthe new democratic Governments in Egypt, Tunisia and\nLibya so their success can strengthen democracy, not\nundermine it.\nThere is no doubt that we are in the midst of\nprofound change and that many uncertainties lie\nahead. But the building blocks of democracy, fair\neconomies and open societies are part of the solution,\nnot the problem. Indeed, nothing in the last year has\nchanged my fundamental conviction. The Arab Spring\nrepresents a precious opportunity for people to realize\ntheir aspirations for a job, a voice and a stake in their\nfuture. We in the United Nations must do everything\nwe can to support them."

        "file_text": "\ufeffMr. President, I would like to extend to you the\ncongratulations of the Government of Ecuador on your\nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly at\nits sixty-seventh session, for which we will provide\nwhatever support you need to help achieve the\ninternational agenda\u2019s commitments, especially those\nthat have to do with revitalization of the Assembly.\nWe are participating in this important forum with\nthe clear purpose of sharing our ideas and proposals for\nthe international system that governs us. We are well\naware that the United Nations system was conceived\nin the middle of the last century and that its structure\nis based on, among other things, the principles of humanism, multilateralism and the equality of States\nbefore the law. Since then, the great majority of\ncountries have fought to see those principles complied\nwith, but there have also been countries whose power\nhas wrongfully enabled them to fail to live up to the\nprinciples and to their obligations within the system.\nThe world has changed substantially since the\nroad map for the United Nations was designed, and its\nfunctions must adapt to the new demands of international\nrelations, characterized by exchanges of information\nand communications and by interdependent economies.\nWe believe the time has come to end the illegitimate\npolitical exploitation of United Nations bodies by\ncertain Powers, which continue to exert political and\neconomic pressure and even to intervene militarily\nin sovereign States whose Governments criticize the\ninternational status quo or focus on different ideologies\nfrom those promoted by some Powers, or whose public\npolicies are opposed to the economic interests of large\ntransnational companies. Such pressure delegitimizes\nthe system and distorts multilateralism itself.\nIn the five years of President Rafael Correa\u2019s\nGovernment, Ecuador has regained sovereignty in\ndecision-making on its internal and international\npolicies, pursuing decisions that promote a horizontal\nrelationship between countries with the same rights and\nobligations. In those five years Ecuador has supported\npeace. That is why we have expressed our concern\nabout the terrible consequences for human beings that\nresult from military interventions conducted by the\nPowers, and why we are calling loudly for dialogue\nand for respect for human rights and the people\u2019s self-\ndetermination in all countries in conflict. We have\nhad enough of geopolitical visions that are imposed by\nforce, destroying human rights. In that regard, Ecuador\nwelcomes with great hope and enthusiasm the dialogue\nprocess in the sister Republic of Colombia, which is\nthe bravest step that the Government of that fraternal\ncountry could have taken.\nToday the world is experiencing constant changes\nin the distribution of power. New regional Powers have\nemerged in the past 20 years and have begun to play\na decisive role in international politics and security.\nRussia, China, India, Brazil, Mexico, South Africa,\nArgentina, Indonesia, Venezuela and the developing\nworld, in general, are now the drivers of the global\neconomy. It is therefore a political imperative that\nmultilateralism be strengthened and promoted with\nregard to respect and equality among States. It is important to point out that Latin American\ncountries committed to multilateralism, in response\nto unilateral actions that undermine international\nstability, have established regional institutions, such\nas the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our\nAmerica \u2014 Peoples\u2019 Trade Agreement (ALBA), the\nUnion of South American Nations (UNASUR) and the\nCommunity of Latin American and Caribbean States.\nSuch bodies are restoring the principle of universal\nrepresentation in global governance and endowing it with\nnew characteristics so as to adjust it to today\u2019s political\nand social reality. However, while such countries and\norganizations seek to keep the institution of inter-State\nwork alive, the continuing unilateral actions of certain\nPowers without consultation jeopardize the ability of\nmultilateral bodies to provide legitimate and valid\nresponses to international needs and problems.\nIn that context, Ecuador believes that the\nweakening of the decision-making system in the United\nNations undermines international law. Open dialogue\nis therefore needed in order to effectively reform our\nOrganization. We believe that it is time to begin a\nstructural reform of the United Nations that makes it\nmore democratic and up to date and that prevents the\npolitical and illegal use of its bodies. The system will\nbe truly democratic, as it claims to be, when everyone\naccepts that each country has a vote and that the\nmajority decides in a democratic, free and sovereign\nway, without a small group of States that represents\n2.5 per cent of the Organization\u2019s membership being\nable to veto the remaining 97.5 per cent.\nWe must of course restore the fundamental principles\nof the United Nations, namely, the legal equality of\nStates, international social justice, unconditional\nrespect for international law, the protection and defence\nof all human rights, cooperation and the promotion\nof the mutual interests of nations, respect for the\nsovereignty of States, the free self-determination of\npeoples, non-intervention in the internal affairs of\nother States, the elimination of wars of aggression and\nthe peaceful settlement of disputes through dialogue,\nwithout recourse to the threat or, worse still, the use of\nforce. But, above all, we must restore the principle of\ncollective action. As a result, we must give it values,\nsuch as democracy, universality and supranationality.\nIn order to be effective and efficient in its work\nto maintain international peace and stability, the new\nmultilateralism should not uphold the veto power or\nthe existence of an exclusive club, whose members are a small group of countries that decide the system\u2019s\nfuture and other measures that affect the remaining\ncountries. The new system would require all countries,\nas equals, to be equally represented in decision-making\nthat affected the international system. It should not\nallow non-compliance with international standards by\nsome States, but must rather demand strict adherence\nto international law and full respect for international\njudicial authority as the only way of promoting peaceful\ncoexistence among nations.\nEcuador supports the comprehensive reform of the\nUnited Nations system and the democratization of the\ninternational decision-making bodies. We advocate\na comprehensive reform of the Security Council that\nincludes decisions on membership categories, the veto\nissue, regional representation, the size of an expanded\nSecurity Council and its working methods, and its\nrelationship with the General Assembly \u2014 in other\nwords, a comprehensive change in its composition\nand operation. The idea is to make the Council\nrepresentative, democratic and effective to enable\nthe international community to have an appropriate\ncollective security system. We believe that we must\nwork on that proposal, study it, discuss it and decide\non it together.\nOur country also calls for a comprehensive\nrevitalization of the General Assembly. We propose\nthat its role as the main depositary of global sovereignty\nbe fully recognized within the United Nations system\nsince it is only there that all members are represented.\nThe General Assembly should therefore have the\nability to discuss and take binding decisions on all\nsignificant issues on the international agenda, including\ninternational peace and security.\nAn example of the imbalance and lack of democracy\nof the current United Nations system that clearly reflects\nthe urgent need for its reform is the situation in which\nthe abhorrent blockade on the sisterly Republic of Cuba\ncontinues because an economic and military Power is\nable to impose its will and political view despite the\ncontrary decision of 186 countries. Then again, the\nUnited States cannot continue to include Cuba on its\nspurious list of countries that sponsor terrorism simply\nbecause of an ideological unwillingness to accept that\nthe island has survived its forced isolation. Arbitrariness\nhas played a great part in that issue.\nCuba has declared that its territory has never been\nused nor ever will be used to organize, finance or\ncarry out terrorist acts against any country, including the United States. Similarly, the prominent former\nUnited States President, Jimmy Carter, has stated that\nthe role of Havana as a guarantor in the peace talks\nbetween the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de\nColombia and the Colombian Government refutes any\nargument about the need for Cuba to remain on that\nlist. The former President, whom we consider a friend\nof the Latin American cause, said that a more sincere\ndialogue could take place between the two countries if\nthe United States were to remove Cuba from its list of\nState sponsors of terrorism. We share and support that\nview.\nConsistent with Ecuador\u2019s recognition of the\nPalestinian State within the 1967 borders and with\nEast Jerusalem as its capital, my country supports\nthe inclusion of Palestine as a full Member of the\nOrganization. Likewise, Ecuador reiterates its support\nfor the historic rights of the Argentine Republic over\nthe Malvinas Islands. The specific and anachronistic\nsituation of those Islands should pave the way for\nrenewed direct negotiations with the United Kingdom,\nas called for by Argentina. That appeal has been\nreiterated in several resolutions of the relevant United\nNations bodies.\nFor Ecuador, it is essential that disputes, including\nthose related to borders, be resolved peacefully.\nEcuador has successfully achieved that.\nEcuador has also worked to strengthen the\nfundamental institutions of international law, such as\nthe inviolability of diplomatic missions, as provided\nfor in the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic\nRelations. I wish to recall that, a few weeks ago, the\nGovernment of Ecuador had an unexpected diplomatic\ndispute with the Government of the United Kingdom\non exactly that issue. In response, Ecuador advocated\nthat various multilateral forums adopt resolutions\naffirming that principle of international law. We must\nsay with deep gratitude that Ecuador received the\nresolute support of the Governments of States members\nof UNASUR, ALBA and the Organization of American\nStates and of other Governments, such as that of\nRussia, condemning any attempt at forced entry into or\nviolation of diplomatic premises.\nThe Government of Ecuador accordingly\ncondemned the terrible events of 11 September, when\nthe United States diplomatic mission and consulate in\nCairo and Benghazi were attacked by armed groups\nwith a tragic loss of life, including that of the United States Ambassador to Libya, Christopher Stevens.\nEcuador stands in solidarity with the people of the\nUnited States and reaffirms its condemnation of those\nviolent acts against United States personnel in Libya\nand Egypt. Once again, we declare our respect for the\ninviolability of the premises of diplomatic missions.\nMy country believes that it is essential for\ninternational organizations to support and promote the\nobservance and development of all human rights. That\nshould be their ultimate objective, not just a politically\ncorrect way to make a discussion attractive or to justify\nimplementing a geopolitical outlook on different\ncultural realities. Human rights are a principle that is\nlived every day and that is constantly developed and\nupheld. It is a principle including all of humankind\nwith no exception, no discrimination, no categories and\nno prioritization. The principle admits no reservations\nor double standards. It is either completely defended\nand we submit to it, or it is rejected. But conditioned,\npartial compliance is not admissible. We are, of course,\nspeaking of the progressive development of international\nand national instruments governing human rights and\nthe legal international bodies that ensure compliance\nwith those instruments.\nTo write on paper that all men and women around\nthe world are equal without applying it in practice is\nnothing but hypocrisy. Human rights, as a whole, can\nbe summarized in the right to life. The question is:\nhow many thousands of human beings must continue\nto be sacrificed in the name of the abstract principle\nwithout understanding, without really feeling what the\nconcept is. When will humanity ask, for example, if\nthe defence of democracy in its Western version or the\naccumulation of transnational capital and the expansion\nof organized crime constitute sufficient justification\nfor the sacrifice of tens of thousands of human lives or\nfor the destruction of the planet.\nIn order to guarantee the rights of human beings,\ndeepen their social and economic development, and\nachieve the harmony of nature while being fully\nresponsible towards all generations, Ecuador has\nchanged some traditional policies since the adoption\nof the new Ecuadorian Constitution in 2008. We\nunderstand that we must overcome the archaic concept\nthat the rule of law consists of laws carved in stone\nthat were approved at some time in history but are\nobsolete and out of date today. The law cannot be\nabstract, because in essence it is a living thing needed\nto give security to human beings, and it cannot be divorced from reality. That is why we also advocate\nthat the standards that are part of international legal\ncoexistence should be discussed and updated, because\ntheir forced application leads to chaos and weakens the\nrule of international law.\nFrom that point of view, our Constitution calls\non us to live in a constitutional State of rights and\nguarantees. The fundamental objective is what is called\nin the Quechua language sumak kawsay, or \u201cthe right\nto a good life\u201d of people and nature, knowing how to\nlive fully, without any discrimination. It is based on\ndignity, solidarity, equality and the complementarity\nof people, cultures, nationalities, people\u2019s social groups\nand countries in general.\nIt is the commitment to being human that calls on\nus to encourage tolerance, respect and full support for\neverybody, especially those afflicted with disabilities.\nEcuador has been nationally recognized on that front,\nbecause, in the last five years, it has maintained\nthe highest ratings for effectiveness in programme\nsupport and reintegration into daily life of our brothers\nand sisters with disabilities. The strength of our\nVice-President Len\u00edn Moreno Garc\u00e9s in his battle\nagainst discrimination against people with disabilities\nhas made it possible for him to be globally recognized.\nAdmiration of his programmes has led to his being\nnominated for the Nobel Peace Prize.\nSince human beings are at the centre of the\ncovenant of the popular revolution, we have given full\nsupport to those who suffer persecution because of\ntheir political ideas and sexual preferences. My country\nhas the largest number of refugees in Latin America\nand one of the largest numbers in the entire Western\nhemisphere. Almost 60,000 people living in Ecuador\nare refugees. We also have around 500,000 economic\nmigrants. That has led to recognition and expressions\nof gratitude by United Nations bodies. Because people\nin the situation of being refugees and asylum-seekers\nhave been incorporated into Ecuadorian society, they\nreceive political and social protection as well as an\neconomic subsidy from the Ecuadorian State.\nSocial groups that traditionally were discriminated\nagainst in Ecuador for ethnic or cultural reasons have\nalso seen a substantial improvement in their situation.\nThat is shown by the indicators for education, health\nand housing. But above all, President Rafael Correa has\nstressed that action to benefit the poorest is the main\nobjective of State policy. The incorporation of social\ngroups into the active life of the country has taken place, with full respect for their ancestral culture and\ntheir traditions, customs, beliefs and political views.\nWe are also one of the countries that has\nstrengthened gender equality, the development of the\nrights of women, and the application of affirmative\naction measures that cut across public policies in all\nthe functions of our Government. However, those\nsuccessful changes have led to a reaction from sectors\nof traditional power, both inside and outside Ecuador.\nJust yesterday, we noted the second anniversary of an\nattempted coup d\u2019\u00e9tat and assassination. But things\nhave changed. The empowerment of citizens fully\nidentified with the Government has made it possible to\novercome this year\u2019s crisis as well as an international\nmedia campaign of criticism and misinformation on the\nactivities and achievements of our country.\nI would like to highlight from this rostrum that\nEcuador is the first country in the world to have\nrecognized the rights of nature in its Constitution.\nNature stops being a passive object and becomes an\nactive subject. In that connection, the Constitution\nof Ecuador states that Mother Earth, or Pachamama,\nwhere life reproduces and flourishes, has a right to\nfull respect for its existence and the maintenance and\nregeneration of its vital cycles, structure, functions and\ndevelopmental processes. By recognizing those rights,\nwe close the circle of the complementary relationship\nwith the rights of human beings. The Constitution\nof Ecuador has led to major progress in legal and\nenvironmental areas. It overcomes the human-centred\nvision of law prevailing in the world. We aspire to\nopen a discussion in this forum aimed at preparing a\nuniversal declaration on the rights of nature.\nIn the environment, Ecuador is one of the leading\npromoters at the international level of environmental\nsustainability policies. We have developed new\ninitiatives in the fight against climate change, such\nas the \u201cnet avoided emissions\u201d mechanism. That has\nmade the Yasun\u00ed-ITT initiative an innovative sovereign\ndecision. We have also planned to protect natural\nresources and the cultures of several ethnic groups in\nthe Amazon region and have accepted the responsibility\nto reduce greenhouse-gas emissions.\nIn that context, Ecuador has been a leader in the\nregional debate on a model for domestic sustainable\ndevelopment. At the same time, together with the\nregional Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas bloc, we\nhave played a critical role within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, and we\nhave noted the scant political will, especially in the\ncountries in the North, to let themselves be subject to\nlegally binding commitments to reduce greenhouse-gas\nemissions. Ecuador has proposed, on the international\nlevel, an alternative sustainable participatory\ndevelopment model.\nWhen it comes to promoting human rights and the\nfreedom of expression, the Government of Ecuador\nhas been faithful to its tradition, which is to protect\nthose who seek refuge in its territory or its diplomatic\nmissions because they are victims of political\npersecution, and has granted diplomatic asylum to the\nAustralian citizen Julian Assange in response to his\nrequest to the President of the Republic of Ecuador and\nafter an exhaustive judicial assessment. That has been a\nunique opportunity for the world community to debate\nthe process of asylum in that context and to observe\nthe political, legal and human repercussions of its\napplication within the framework of the strict respect\nfor international law. Ecuador is proud of having taken\na sovereign decision in a legal procedure that protects\nhuman beings anywhere in the world.\nOur country promotes the reform of the multilateral\nUnited Nations system through example and not just\nin words. We have also undertaken an unprecedented\ninstitutional reform of our own. The results have been\nhighly satisfactory, with outstanding levels of growth\nand poverty reduction. I want to mention just a few\nfigures, so that members can have a clear idea of our\nachievements. Under the Government of the Citizens\u2019\nRevolution, the poverty rate has been reduced from\n36.7 per cent to 25.3 per cent, a reduction of more than\n11 per cent. Extreme poverty, that is, abject poverty,\nhas come down from 16.5 per cent to 9.4 per cent. We\nhave reduced the Gini coefficient from 0.55 per cent\nto 0.47 per cent. For the first time in our two centuries\nas a republic, the extreme poverty rate for Ecuador\u2019s\npopulation is below 10 per cent. An annual education\nbudget of $858 million has now grown by a factor of\n5.1, to $4.366 billion. Payment of external debt is not\nmore than 4.2 per cent of gross domestic product, while\nour spending on public social services stands at 11 per\ncent of gross domestic product.\nEvery international agency that has reviewed\nour macroeconomic numbers and social spending\nagree that the changes in our country are drastically\nimproving the lives of our citizens. We have not settled\nfor mere words, but, rather, our country\u2019s success story is written in concrete, practical actions as part of a\nnational development plan, overseen and managed by\nthe President of the Republic himself, that is bringing\nrapid change to our country \u2014 and without the usual\nsocial ills that result from the prescriptions of the\ninternational financial institutions. On the contrary,\nours is a participatory model founded in solidarity.\nWe have not neglected foreign direct investment,\nwhich we believe essential to our development strategy,\nso long as it complements our national initiatives,\nincluding our national development plan. I state with\npride that the Constitution of the Republic of Ecuador\nis the first in the world to define legal security as a\nhuman right in itself, respect for which and the direct\napplication of which are guaranteed by judicial,\nadministrative and constitutional authorities.\nNevertheless, we believe that progress for Ecuador\nor for any other country is at risk if the international\nsystem, either because of general indifference or\nbecause of interests that run contrary to global well-\nbeing, feeds a new era of anarchy in which unilateral\nactions or geopolitical conflicts predominate. For that\nreason, we would like to take this opportunity to reiterate\nthe need to rehabilitate and revitalize multilateralism,\nto upgrade international mechanisms and strengthen\ninternational law, so as to safeguard international peace\nand security and a healthy environment, which are the\nnecessary ingredients for worldwide development and\nprosperity. We want to use this platform to urge the\ninternational community and the representatives of all\nthe countries of the world to join in demonstrating the\nresolve, bravery and political will to drive the creation\nof a new international order \u2014 new in being more just,\nmore open, more participatory and more democratic."

For us, it is a special moment\nfor ref lection on how the world is progressing and for\nsketching ways to build a world of peace, security and\nsolidarity. The sixty-seventh session of the General\nAssembly is taking place in an atmosphere of uncertainty\nrelated to the very difficult international economic\nsituation and the growing threats to international peace\nand security. The challenges that the situation poses to\nworld require of us greater courage, effort, creativity\nand solidarity, if all of us wish one day to achieve the\nobjectives of peace and development so dear to the\ninternational community.\nThis year, Burkina Faso has been tested by a food\ncrisis resulting from poor rainfall. The grain and cereal\nshortage was exacerbated by a massive inf low of tens\nof thousands of refugees from neighbouring Mali,\nsometimes with all of their cattle, as a result of the crisis\nthat has raged in that brother country since 17 January.\nThe situation has led the Government of Burkina Faso\nto undertake vigorous and urgent measures that have enabled us to contain its negative impact on the most\nvulnerable strata of society and welcome our brothers\nand sisters from Mali in acceptable human conditions. I\nshould like to reiterate the gratitude of the Government\nand the people of Burkina Faso to the relevant specialized\nagencies of the United Nations systems, the Economic\nCommunity of West African States (ECOWAS), the\nWest African Economic and Monetary Union, the\nKingdom of Morocco, the Republic of China (Taiwan),\nthe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Algeria, Japan, Tunisia,\nEgypt and Azerbaijan, who have lent us their assistance\nto ensure that refugees and worst-off populations of\nBurkina Faso are able to live dignified lives.\nAt the political level, Burkina Faso, within the\nframework of the implementation of the conclusions\nof the Consultative Council on Political Reforms, is\ncontinuing the strengthening and consolidation of its\ndemocratic process. Following the successful holding\nof a biometric registration effort covering the entire\nnational territory, December of this year will witness the\norganization of joint legislative and municipal elections\non the basis of greater transparency and fairness.\nTurning to the economy, Burkina Faso is continuing\nits policy of building a strong and prosperous economy\nto serve the basic needs of its population. To do that,\nwe have adopted a strategy of accelerated growth and\nsustainable development to fulfil our drive for progress\ntowards becoming an emerging country and enabling\nit to achieve the Millennium Development Goals. We\nwelcome the backing of Burkina Faso\u2019s partners for that\nstrategy, whose ultimate goal is to achieve strong and\nsustained economic growth that serves to multiplies\nrevenue and improves the population\u2019s quality of life,\nwhile taking into account the guiding principles of\nsustainable management of natural resources.\nThe annual foreign financing needs of the strategy\nremain significant, despite the efforts undertaken by\nthe Government of Burkina Faso on the basis of our\nown resources. We are hopeful that our bilateral and\nmultilateral partners, as they have done in the past, will\nbe at our side to ensure a successful implementation of\nthe strategy. We wish to convey our gratitude to those\nthat have already demonstrated their solidarity with us.\nBurkina Faso is aware that there can be no sustainable\ndevelopment without peace and stability. That is why\nPresident Blaise Compaor\u00e9 has turned dialogue and\nmediation into new levers for the maintenance of\nharmony and understanding among peoples. We are very grateful to President Vuk Jeremi\u0107 for having\nplaced this session of the General Assembly under the\nbanner, \u201cBringing about adjustment or settlement of\ninternational disputes or situations by peaceful means\u201d.\nThat theme underscores the importance of resorting to\npeaceful means as an appropriate mechanism for the\nsettlement of disputes. Burkina Faso fully associates\nitself with the choice of that topic which, following on\nthe sixty-sixth session, will enable the international\ncommunity to deepen its thinking and commit itself\nresolutely to the peaceful settlement of conflicts\nthrough dialogue to avoid stalemate and the escalation\nof violence, which reduces to nought our efforts\naimed at promoting sustainable economic and social\ndevelopment.\nIt is along those lines that the President of Burkina\nFaso has accepted the mediation mission that its peers\nfrom the Economic Community of West African States\nhave entrusted him within the framework of the crisis\nin Mali. The ECOWAS mediation, whose goal is to\nresolve, through dialogue, the dual institutional and\nsecurity crisis that is raging in Mali, has focused its\nefforts on restoring the normal constitutional order and\nto setting up stable transition bodies that are accepted by\nMalians and recognized by the international community\nin order to implement the road map contained in the\nframework agreement of 6 April, which deals with\nthe management of the crisis and the organization of\nelections. Burkina Faso will continue to work under\nthe ECOWAS framework, with the support of the\ninternational community, towards Mali\u2019s reunification\nand reconciliation so as to create conditions conducive\nto the holding of free and democratic elections\nthroughout all of Mali.\nThe establishment of stable and lasting peace\nin Mali will require a comprehensive approach\ncombining political dialogue and the use of force\nmainly aimed at neutralizing extremist terrorist groups\nof a transnational nature, whose presence in the north\nof Mali is likely to irretrievably compromise efforts\naimed at better governance and social and economic\ndevelopment. The President of Burkina Faso, with the\nassistance of President Goodluck Ebele Jonathan, will\ncontinue in a clear-headed way to seek solutions to\nthe deep-rooted causes of the crisis undermining our\nsubregion, a crisis which the armed rebellion has but\nexacerbated. I therefore call upon the Malian armed\nmovements to renounce the systematic use of arms as a\nmeans to achieve their demands. I urge them to respect the fundamental freedoms of their fellow citizens and\nto clearly distance themselves from extremist and\nterrorist movements in order to promote the values of\ndialogue and democracy to which Mali is so wedded.\nThe crisis situation in the north of Mali is a tangible\nmanifestation of the type of threat facing all of the\ncountries of the Sahel region. I therefore welcome the\ntimely initiative of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon that\nbrought us together on 26 September on the margins\nof the General Assembly around the issue of peace,\nsecurity and development in the States of the Sahel\nregion. I renew my gratitude and reiterate to him the\nregard and appreciation of the Government of Burkina\nFaso for his availability and commitment to peace and\ndevelopment in Africa and throughout the world.\nAlways working for international peace and\nsecurity, Burkina Faso contributes to peacekeeping\noperations in Darfur and Guinea-Bissau. On\nGuinea-Bissau, Burkina Faso encourages the efforts\nundertaken by the transitional bodies to quickly restore\nconstitutional order and urges all of the country\u2019s\nstakeholders to ensure a consensual and inclusive\ntransition and to create the best possible conditions in\nwhich to implement priority reforms, organize free and\ntransparent presidential elections and entrench the rule\nof law. On Darfur, we encourage the parties to better\nimplement the Doha Document for Peace in Darfur, and\nwe continue to contribute through the implementation\nand follow-up mechanism provided for by the Doha\nDocument.\nOn the issue of the Western Sahara, Burkina Faso\nwelcomes the determination of the parties to explore\nappropriate ways and means to achieve a fair and\nagreed political settlement of the issue. The current\nstatus quo is neither viable nor of benefit to any of\nthe parties, given its impact on the subregion\u2019s peace\nand security. That is why my country has continuously\npromoted dialogue and compromise aimed at achieving\nan acceptable political solution between the parties. In\nthat regard, we believe that the Moroccan initiative for\nthe negotiation of an autonomous status for the Saharan\nregion could be an appropriate way to settle differences.\nThe world is experiencing great uncertainty and\nanxiety as a result of the international economic and\nfinancial instability, the increase in poverty, ongoing\nenvironmental degradation and the increase in natural\ndisasters. In particular, the recent international financial\ncrises, which seriously compromised the balance of our economies, are sorely testing the cohesion of our\nsocieties. They have an impact on all of us and require\nof us constant vigilance and sustained solidarity.\nThe United Nations Conference on Sustainable\nDevelopment (Rio+20), held from 18 to 22 June in Brazil,\nrightly reminded us of our shared but differentiated\nresponsibilities to protect our planet and to ensure\nsustainable development for future generations. It\nis essential that efforts continue on the basis of the\nconsensus reached at the Conference in order to find\nacceptable compromises that take into account the\ninterests of the various regions of the world.\nBurkina Faso attaches special importance to all\nissues related to the empowerment of women. To that\nend, we have spared no effort to improve women\u2019s\nlegal and social status in our country. The First Lady\nof Burkina Faso, Mrs. Chantal Compaor\u00e9, Goodwill\nAmbassador and Coordinator of the International\nCampaign to Ban Female Genital Mutilation Worldwide,\nco-chaired during this session the high-level side event\non banning female genital mutilation. That is yet\nanother demonstration of her well-known commitment\nto the defence of women\u2019s rights and the improvement\nof the status of women. In that connection, we reiterate\nour full support for the African initiative to introduce\nat this session a draft resolution aimed at a global ban\non female genital mutilation. We hope that it will enjoy\nthe support of the entire international community.\nFurthermore, we welcome efforts undertaken since\nthe launch of UN-Women and we hope that this new\nbody will strengthen United Nations activities aimed\nat the empowerment of women, the defence of their\nrights and the promotion of gender equality, especially\nin developing countries.\nBurkina Faso believes in multilateralism, solidarity\nbetween peoples and the virtue of dialogue among\nnations. In that regard, my delegation notes with great\nsatisfaction the calm atmosphere that currently prevails\nin the relations between the Republic of China (Taiwan)\nand the People\u2019s Republic of China. That would\nargue in favour of granting the Republic of China its\nrightful place among the family of nations, including\nthrough its meaningful participation in the activities\nof international organizations such as the International\nCivil Aviation Organization and the United Nations\nFramework Convention on Climate Change.\nThe nature of the threats and challenges facing the\nworld demands of us a better sharing of responsibilities through a reform of the United Nations. Such reform\nremains a topic of great concern at the very heart of\nglobal governance. We hope that the negotiations\nlaunched within the framework of this reform will\nresult in acceptable compromises that can strengthen\nthe effectiveness and standing of the United Nations as\nit faces the new challenges of our changing world. Only\nin that way will we genuinely move towards building a\nmore fair and united world.\nMy delegation listened with great interest to the\ninaugural address by the President of the General\nAssembly at its sixty-seventh session, in which he\ncovered all the major issues of concern to today\u2019s\ndemocratic societies. I would therefore like to\ncongratulate him on his election and welcome the\nvision with which he would like to endow our common\nOrganization. He can rest assured of our delegation\u2019s\nreadiness for full cooperation.\nFinally, I would like to take this opportunity to\nexpress our gratitude to his predecessor, His Excellency\nMr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser of Qatar, for his efforts\nduring the sixty-sixth session of the Assembly. That\nsession\u2019s very welcome results bear witness to the skill\nand effectiveness with which he led our work."

        "file_text": "\ufeffI congratulate\nMr. Vuk Jeremi\u0107 on his election as President of the\nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-seventh session. His\nelection represents one more important step in an\nalready illustrious career, as well as a historic moment\nfor Serbia, one that recognizes its courageous efforts\nto overcome a difficult recent past and to proceed with\ndetermination towards European integration.\nAllow me also to express a word of recognition\nto Ambassador Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser for his\nsuccessful leadership of the Assembly in a particularly\ndemanding year. We also offer praise and support to\nour Secretary-General for his commendable work, in\nparticular for his efforts made to promote peace in a\ntime of great challenges.\nAs Portugal is three months away from the\nconclusion of our mandate in the Security Council,\nto which we were elected by a significant majority of\nthe Member States present in this Hall, we consider\nit appropriate to present an assessment to the General\nAssembly. We fulfilled our mandate with both rigour\nand transparency, always seeking to strengthen the\ncredibility and efficiency of the principal organ\nentrusted with the protection of international peace\nand security. We were guided by the same principles\nthat have always oriented our foreign policy and which\nhave merited the trust of the Assembly, namely, the\ndefence of the primacy of international law, the search\nfor effective multilateralism and the central role of the\nUnited Nations in the international architecture.\nWith equal coherence and firm resolve we have\ndefended the promotion of human rights, the role of\nwomen, the protection of civilians, the strengthening\nof action defending children against violence and the\nprotection of children in the context of armed conflict.\nSustainable development, the fight against poverty,\nfood security and the particularly devastating effects\nof climate change on small island developing States,\nwhich threaten their very existence, remain, for\nPortugal, fundamental pillars for our action within the\nUnited Nations.\nWith equal perseverance, we have sought to\nstrengthen the role of the Security Council in the fight\nagainst new challenges to international peace and\nsecurity, such as organized crime; the proliferation of\nillicit trafficking, terrorism and pandemics; the Council\u2019s\ncapacity to prevent conflicts and to bring mediation\ninto play; and its efforts to improve coordination with\nregional and subregional organizations. We have played\nan active role, and continue to do so, in the collective\nefforts to overcome crises, such as those that emerged\nin C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Libya and Yemen, or the current\nchallenges in Syria, Guinea-Bissau and Mali.\nOur actions have always been driven by openness\nto dialogue and a constructive and balanced attitude,\nembodying our vocation to build bridges and generate\nconsensus without abdicating our values and principles.\nWe hope to have lived up to the high expectations and\ntrust placed in us.\nAs Chair of the Informal Working Group on\nDocumentation and Other Procedural Questions, we\nsought to improve the internal working methods of\nthe Council and its communication with the General\nAssembly, with a view to making it more effective and\nopen and more in harmony with our times. We will\npresent a report to the Assembly on the work undertaken\non that issue.\nIt is important, however, to recognize that the\ncredibility of the Security Council is also underpinned\nby a need for its composition to reflect the current\ngeopolitical reality, one that is quite different from the\ndynamic that was in place in 1945. It is increasingly\ndifficult for us, as it is for many others, to see that the\nincreasing role of Brazil and India in the international\nscene has not yet been acknowledged with permanent\nseats on the Security Council, or that Africa is the only\ncontinent without a permanent seat on the Council.\nThe Security Council continues to confront\nserious obstacles. The number of victims in Syria\nis exponentially increasing day by day. We remain\nimpotent witnesses before a true humanitarian\ncatastrophe and a generalized systematic violation of\nthe most basic rights of the Syrian people. In addition,\nthe catastrophe could have been avoided had the Syrian\nGovernment not chosen military force and brutal\nrepression in response to the legitimate protests by its\npeople, which systematically excluded any possibility\nof a politically negotiated outcome to the crisis. However, there is no alternative to a political\nsolution, one that supports the legitimate aspirations of\nthe Syrian people and allows for a democratic transition\ndriven by the Syrians themselves, one in which they see\ntheir wishes reflected. Increased militarization of the\nconflict will undoubtedly lead to even more suffering for\nthe civilian population, threaten the territorial integrity\nof Syria and increase the risks of destabilization for its\nneighbours and indeed for the region as a whole.\nThe appointment of Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi, a\ndiplomat whom we greatly respect, as the Joint Special\nRepresentative of the United Nations and the League of\nArab States for Syria should be seen as a new opportunity\nfor the parties to revisit their options, cease the violence\nand seriously engage in a process of political transition.\nFor the Joint Special Representative\u2019s mission to be a\nsuccess, the Security Council will finally have to exert\njoint, continued and effective pressure on all parties\nand most certainly on the Syrian authorities, who bear\nprimary responsibility for the current situation.\nThe impasse in finding a lasting solution to the\nIsraeli-Arab conflict is also of great concern and an\nincreasingly urgent issue in the light of the recent\ndevelopments in the Middle East and North Africa\nand the fight of the people of those regions for liberty,\ndemocracy and dignity. There will be no lasting peace,\nno stability and no security in the Middle East without\na solution to the question of Palestine.\nWe understand and share Israel\u2019s legitimate\nsecurity aspirations. Yet we also understand and share\nthe frustration of the Palestinian people, for whom\nan independent Palestinian State is not simply an\ninalienable right, but also a straightforward question of\njustice. Only a comprehensive deal that is negotiated\ndirectly by the parties on the basis of United Nations\nresolutions and internationally recognized parameters\nand which solves the pending questions and is dedicated\nto the two-State solution of Israel and Palestine living\nside by side in peace will meet both the security\nconcerns laid down by Israel and the aspirations of\nthe Palestinian people for independence, liberty and\ndignity. We appeal to the Israelis and Palestinians to\nquickly restart direct negotiations.\nAnother regional issue still at an impasse and of\nserious concern in the Middle East is the question of\na nuclear Iran. We regret the absence of any positive\ndevelopments on the issue despite the significant\ndiplomatic efforts under way and the application of mechanisms of international pressure. The onus of the\nsituation is on Tehran.\nIn Africa, we are faced with a grave situation in\nthe Sahel, particularly in Mali, which threatens the\nwhole region and could spread throughout Western\nAfrica, putting both stability and development at risk\nin a number of countries. As a result of a tapestry of\nhistorical, economic and social influences, we are\nwitnessing an exponential growth in terrorism, with\nincreasing links to organized transnational crime,\ndrugs and other sorts of illicit trafficking. In that regard,\nthe international community should be more active.\nAccordingly, we support the outcome of the recent\nHigh-level Meeting on the Sahel, which contributed to\nthe creation of an integrated international strategy for\nthe region.\nIt is against that grave regional background that\nthe crisis in Guinea-Bissau is unfolding. The military\ncoup of 12 April interrupted a democratic electoral\nprocess, violating the principles defended by the\nUnited Nations, as was clearly recognized in Security\nCouncil resolution 2048 (2012). It is imperative that the\nconstitutional order in Guinea-Bissau be restored. That\nrequires the appointment of an inclusive Government\nthat includes the African Party for the Independence\nof Guinea and Cape Verde, which is the party holding\nthe majority in the National Assembly; permission for\nthe legitimate leaders to return without restrictions on\ntheir civil and political rights; and the organization of\nfree and credible elections. Any and all solutions to the\npresent crisis will have to respect international legality\nand the constitutional order of Guinea-Bissau, and must\nbe translated into an internal, inclusive, and credible\npolitical process capable of creating national stability.\nTo that end, coordinated action by the international\ncommunity \u2014 the United Nations, the African Union,\nthe Economic Community of West African States, the\nCommunity of Portuguese-speaking Countries (CPLP)\nand the European Union \u2014 is essential. Portugal is\nfully engaged and available to work with all interested\nparties in the process.\nIt is inconceivable that, in the twenty-first century,\ndemocratically elected African leaders are pushed aside\nby force and are made to live outside their countries. It is\nup to all of us to defend the principles of the Charter and\nto apply, without any ambiguities, the principle of zero\ntolerance in such situations. In that context, I note the\nincreasingly relevant role of the African Union, which has been working in close coordination with the United\nNations for the promotion and protection of peace and\nsecurity on the African continent. I also take advantage\nof this opportunity to congratulate Mrs. Dlamini-Zuma\non her election as President of the Commission of the\nAfrican Union. That also represents a milestone in the\nstrengthening of the role of women in Africa, which we\nalso welcome with great satisfaction.\nAllow me also to refer to a successful case and a\ngood example, Timor-Leste. It is a successful example\nthanks, first of all, to the Timorese themselves, but also\nowing to the efficient support of the United Nations.\nThe United Nations Integrated Mission in Timor-\nLeste will conclude its mandate at the end of the year.\nIt will do so with the sense of having accomplished\nits purpose, thanks to the maturity shown by the\nTimorese people over recent years, as exemplified in\nthe successful presidential and legislative elections\nheld just a few months ago. A new cycle of cooperation\nbetween the international community and Timor-Leste\nis now opening in line with the priorities defined by\nthat country\u2019s Government.\nIn that context, Portugal will continue to support\nTimor-Leste on its path to economic and social\ndevelopment, including the strengthening of its\ninstitutions and democratic values, as well as the rule\nof law and the promotion of the human rights of the\nTimorese people. Timor-Leste, like Guinea-Bissau, is a\nmember State of the CPLP, along with Angola, Brazil,\nCape Verde, Mozambique, and Sao Tome and Principe.\nWithin the CPLP we share a common language and\nhistory, but we have also developed shared efforts\ntowards the defence of universal values, through active\nmultilateralism within the framework of the United\nNations and the regional organizations to which we\nbelong.\nThe significance of the Portuguese language as\na language of global communication, business and\nculture, with about 250 million speakers, should be\ntaken advantage of by the international community. For\nthat reason, we will continue to work together to have\nPortuguese recognized as an official language of the\nUnited Nations.\nI referred at the beginning of my statement to\nPortugal\u2019s commitment to multilateralism as the most\neffective means for finding common solutions to the\nglobal challenges that we face. I specifically noted\nour efforts in the defence of human rights and in the promotion of sustainable development. In that context,\nwe support the outcomes achieved at the United\nNations Conference on Sustainable Development, in\npart thanks to the notable efforts of Secretary-General\nBan Ki-moon and the Brazilian Government.\nWe continue to defend the universal, indivisible\nand interdependent rights of all human beings, be\nthey political, economic, social or cultural. We have\na solid commitment to humanitarian law and to the\nexcellent work of the Office of the United Nations High\nCommissioner for Refugees. In that context, with the\ncommitment to defend and promote human rights and\nwith the same sense of responsibility with which we\nundertook our current mandate in the Security Council,\nPortugal has announced its candidacy for the Human\nRights Council for the years 2015 to 2017. We hope to\nbe able to merit, once again, the trust of the Assembly\nand to serve, for the first time, in that body.\nThe changes in today\u2019s world call for the promotion\nof a culture of dialogue on a global scale based on\ntolerance and the respect for human dignity. The\nUnited Nations should remain in the vanguard of those\nefforts, namely through initiatives such as the Alliance\nof Civilizations. I would like to congratulate the High\nRepresentative of the Alliance of Civilizations for\nhis leadership and work in the defence of peace and\nof a better understanding among peoples. Indeed, the\ndialogue among different cultures, civilizations and\nreligions is at the very heart of the work of the United\nNations.\nIn conclusion, today, as in the past, the United\nNations has to reflect on what it is and what we\ncollectively want it to be. It should translate the\nindispensable convergence of the common will of\nStates into actions that contribute to a better world.\nIts central objective should be the maintenance of\ninternational peace and security and greater prosperity\nfor all. Portugal stands steadfast in its commitment to\nthose efforts."

        "file_text": "\ufeffI will\nbegin my remarks by congratulating Mr. Vuk Jeremi\u0107,\nPresident of the General Assembly, on his election.\nMy country offers its support to him as he fulfils his\nimportant role. Success in his work will also represent\nsuccess for the United Nations and therefore for all the\npeoples of the world. We endorse his commitment to\nthe \u201cadjustment or settlement of international disputes\nor situations by peaceful means\u201d, and we support\nthe road map that he has outlined for the exercise of\nhis duties. We welcome the outstanding work of his\npredecessor, Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser, and\nemphasize in particular his commitment to mediation.\nWe reiterate our support for the five imperatives of the\nagenda presented in January by Secretary-General Ban\nKi-moon for his second term.\nBarely a year ago, we gathered in this Hall,\nencouraged by an echo of hope. It came from North\nAfrica and the Middle East and was broadcast by\na wide cross-section of voices gathered around one\nuniversal value \u2014 freedom. That hopeful clamour can\nstill be heard in the complex transitions to democracy,\npropelled by the will of the people. Tunisia, Egypt and\nLibya are the best examples. We convey our admiration\nand respect to those countries and their people.\nToday, however, the sounds most strongly\nresonating in this Hall are the desperate cries of\nwomen and children in Syria. To them, we convey our\nsolidarity. At the same time, we are distressed at the fury\nunleashed by those who would manipulate intolerance\nand extremism. We are worried by the resurgence of\nterritorial conflicts, the warmongering rhetoric of some\nStates and the indifference of autocratic regimes. We\nface the ongoing challenges of relentless terrorism, drug\ntrafficking and organized crime. Meanwhile, alarming\nsigns of environmental destruction are cropping up\nwith increasing urgency. These challenges have made\nus aware of the many threats we face, and they reiterate\nthe seminal importance of this Organization and of the\nmultilateral system as a whole.\nThe peaceful settlement of disputes is imperative\nfor peaceful coexistence among individuals, peoples\nand countries. For Costa Rica, it is also a part of daily\nlife and a central goal of our foreign policy. It is a value\nthat is deeply rooted in our respect for diversity and our\ncommitment to tolerance and the rule of law. To prevent conflicts or to strip them of their violent consequences,\nwe must promote preventive diplomacy and mediation.\nWe enjoy the best results when these processes generate\nlegally binding agreements and decisions within the\nframework of the rule of law. A clear link therefore\nexists between the theme proposed by President\nJeremi\u0107 for this session and the commitment by the\nUnited Nations and its Member States to the rule of law.\nCosta Rica believes in the power of mediation, and is\nthus part of a group of countries dedicated to promoting\nit within the United Nations. In July 2011, thanks to\nan initiative by the group that was enthusiastically\nsupported by many other States, the Assembly adopted\nby consensus its first resolution aimed at strengthening\nthe role of mediation (resolution 66/291). A few days\nago, the Assembly gave its support to a follow-up text.\nMoreover, Costa Rica is proud to have headed up\none of the most successful mediation processes in the\nhistory of our hemisphere. In the mid-1980s, various\narmed conflicts bloodied our brotherly countries in\nCentral America. There seemed to be no way out of the\nconflict. However, thanks to the tenacious leadership\nof former Costa Rican President \u00d3scar Arias S\u00e1nchez,\non 7 August 1987, the region\u2019s Heads of State signed\nthe Central American peace plan in Guatemala. That\nleadership earned our compatriot and President the\nNobel Peace Prize.\nThe success of the peace plan stemmed from\nthe double commitment of the signatories: to cease\nhostilities, and to address their root causes. Thanks\nto this comprehensive approach, the vision of the five\nPresidents of the Central American isthmus and effective\ninternational support, Central America silenced its\nguns and achieved peace. It was a peace founded on\ndemocracy and the commitment to development and\njustice.\nUnfortunately, the region today faces another\nchallenge of similar proportions. I refer to the onslaught\nof drug trafficking and international organized crime.\nWe are a transit route between the production centres of\nthe south and the large consumption centre of the north.\nThis situation has made us the victims of a problem\nover which we exercise minimal control. Our resources\nto deal with the problem are even more meagre.\nCentral Americans countries have agreed on regional\nstrategies to work jointly on prevention, interdiction\nand suppression, but our capacity for action is limited\nand has prevented any rapid implementation. Despite all this, Costa Rica has rejected the\ndangerous notion of a \u201cwar\u201d to confront these scourges.\nRather, we are working to expand opportunities for\nyoung people, promote preventative measures, improve\npolice capacity, strengthen the effectiveness of the\njudiciary and assist addicts. Fortunately, we are seeing\nresults in terms of civil security. For example, our\nmurder rate, which is the lowest in Central America,\nhas fallen from 11.7 per 100,000 people in May 2011,\nto 9 per 100,000 in May of this year. Reports of crime\nin general decreased by 12 per cent from 2010 to 2011.\nHowever, the cartels\u2019 onslaught is so intense, the\nlogic of the drug market so disastrous, and the global\nstrategies to control it so disorganized and insufficient\nthat the outlook is grim.\nCosta Rica therefore believes a more active link\nmust be developed between the United Nations and\nthe design and implementation of balanced regional\nstrategies to deal with the drug trade. Moreover, drug\ntraffickers must be viewed as a real threat to peace and\ninternational security.\nCosta Rica is a small, democratic, unarmed\nand civilian country. The multilateral system and\ninternational law are our only means of defence. For this\nreason, we have recognized the compulsory jurisdiction\nof the International Court of Justice since 1973.\nAt the end of 2010, we appealed to the Court after the\nGovernment of Nicaragua illegally deployed military\nforces and civilian personnel in part of our national\nterritory. In March of the following year, the Court\npronounced a series of provisional measures. Among\nthem, the Court ordered Nicaragua to remove its forces\nfrom the disputed area and granted environmental\ncustody to Costa Rica. However, the Government\nof Nicaragua has consistently f louted the order and\ncontinued to send personnel to that area. It has done so\nin open defiance of the Court, to the detriment of our\nbilateral relations, and in violation of paragraph 31 of\nthe Declaration on the Rule of Law at the National and\nInternational Levels that was adopted a week ago by the\nAssembly (resolution 67/1). We do not want this case to\nmar relations or, even worse, the profound human ties\nbetween our countries. But Nicaragua has still failed to\nfulfil the provisional measures of the Court. We regret\nthis, we condemn this and we denounce this once again\nin this Hall.\nDespite its clear adherence to the rule of law and\ncommitment to mediation, the international community\nhas been unable to adopt a key instrument for avoiding conflicts or, at least, limiting their destructive effects.\nAt the end of July 2012, we failed to reach a consensus\non a universal, robust and binding arms trade treaty.\nIt was a sombre moment for peace and human dignity.\nCosta Rica, one of the co-authors of that initiative, will\nnot cease in its efforts to promote the kind of instrument\nthat the millions of victims of conventional weapons\nare demanding from the silence of their tombs.\nThe rule of law should also be the foundation of\nglobal governance. If this governance is to be robust in\nany area, it should be in the area of the environment.\nThe United Nations Conference on Sustainable\nDevelopment brought about important progress in this\nrespect. However, the biggest tasks and commitments\nremain pending. While the global temperature\ncontinues to rise, droughts and f loods continue to\nexact a toll in lives, destroy infrastructure and displace\npopulations. The environmental threat is about to\nassume exponential dimensions. We cannot wait any\nlonger to act.\nCosta Rica adopted sustainability as a development\nmodel several years ago and has embraced its national\nresponsibilities on the matter. We have increased\nour forest coverage. We generate 90 per cent of our\nenergy from renewable sources. Over 25 per cent of\nour territory is made up of national parks, and we have\nadopted the goal of becoming a carbon-neutral country\nby 2021. But these and many other initiatives by small\ncountries will be useless without the commitment of\nthe biggest carbon emitters and without international\ncooperation for mitigation and adaption in the most\nvulnerable countries.\nThe formulation of the post-2015 sustainable\ndevelopment goals gives us an excellent opportunity\nto move forward. We expect their formulation to be a\nmultisectoral and participatory process that includes\nrule of law and good governance components.\nMiddle-income countries still need the support\nof the international community to consolidate our\nimprovements in economic and human development.\nLet us not forget that our achievements are due, in\npart, to the proper use of cooperation mechanisms.\nTo eliminate these because they have been well used\nwould be a disastrous mistake. That is why Costa\nRica, together with other middle-income countries,\nwill continue to participate actively in improving the\nmethodology guiding the graduation processes in the\ncontext of the United Nations Development Programme.\nAs we mentioned, we must consider, in the models for these processes, not only income, but also other criteria\nthat better reflect the extent of our challenges and\nthat foster cooperation strategies that provide greater\nsupport to our development efforts.\nThe main leadership role in global governance\nshould be played by the United Nations, on the basis\nof international law. Only legitimate multilateral\naction can promote and protect the most important\nglobal public goods. We cannot discount the external\nchallenges to the leadership of this Organization. But it\nis more important that we recognize the internal need to\ncommit ourselves to making it more vigorous, effective,\nefficient, inclusive and representative. Member States\nshould understand that the best way to promote our\nnational interests through the United Nations is to\nreform it in order to improve its performance.\nCosta Rica aligns itself with the concept of a global\nSecretariat that was formulated by the Secretary-\nGeneral, and is ready to give its constructive support to\ntranslating this idea into reality. We are also committed\nto the comprehensive reform of the Security Council\nand believe that improving its working methods should\nbe an ongoing process.\nWe emphasize the value of the responsibility\nto protect as a critical operative principle of the\ninternational community.\nThe fight against impunity is part of the fight for\nhuman dignity. This is why we ardently support the\nInternational Criminal Court, one of the most relevant\nachievements of the multilateral system since the\ncreation of the United Nations.\nThe upheavals in the world today demand our\nattention and fill us with dismay, but hope also\nflourishes alongside them. What better example is\nthere, in this regard, than the spirit recently embodied\nby the Olympic and Paralympic athletes in London, who\ncompeted with clear rules, fair play, mutual respect and\na feeling of achievement? If the conflicts of our world\nmimicked that experience, the course of humanity\nwould be different. Maybe such a fundamental change\nis not possible, but we should at least continue to work\nfor a world that is more just, peaceful, free, sustainable,\nand respectful of human dignity and the rule of law.\nCosta Rica reiterates its profound commitment to this\ntask."

        "file_text": "\ufeffI wish\nto congratulate Mr. Jeremi\u0107 on his election as President\nof the General Assembly at its sixty-seventh session.\nI am confident that with his ability and experience he\nwill successfully fulfil that lofty mission. I also wish to thank Mr. Al-Nasser for his positive contribution as\nPresident at the last session.\nThe world is undergoing major and profound\nchanges. The trends towards multipolarity, economic\nglobalization and the application of information\ntechnology are gaining momentum. Countries have\nnever been as interconnected and interdependent as they\nare today. Emerging markets and developing countries\nhave never had such strong influence, and cross-\ncivilizational dialogue and exchanges are flourishing\nas never before. To promote peace, development\nand cooperation has become the shared aspiration of\npeople across the world and the common pursuit of the\ninternational community.\nOn the other hand, the world is still far from being\npeaceful. The underlying impact of the international\nfinancial crisis and the European debt crisis remains\nstrong. Destabilizing factors and uncertainties affecting\nglobal growth have increased. Regional turbulence\npersists, hotspot issues keep emerging and traditional\nand non-traditional security issues have become\nintertwined. The international security environment is\nhighly complex.\nFacing both unprecedented opportunities and\nchallenges, we must not allow the outdated Cold War\nmentality and zero-sum game theory to stand in our\nway. We should act like passengers who stick together\nin a boat when crossing a torrential river and seek\nwin-win progress through cooperation. That is the only\noption for countries around the world. To ensure one\u2019s\nown security, a country should respect and accommodate\nthe security of other nations. To achieve one\u2019s own\ndevelopment, a country should actively promote\ncommon development. In pursuing one\u2019s own interests,\na country should take into account the interests of\nother nations. Only by promoting common security and\ndevelopment for all its members can the international\ncommunity effectively address complex and multiple\nsecurity threats and global challenges, resolve\nincreasingly serious difficulties facing development and\nensure durable peace and sustainable development in\nthe world. With that in mind, China believes that it is\nimportant to do the following.\nWe should promote equality and democracy in\ninternational relations. Mutual respect and equality\nare basic norms governing international relations. All\ncountries, large or small, strong or weak, rich or poor,\nare equal members of the international community. Respect for each other\u2019s sovereignty, core interests\nand choice of social system and development path is a\nfundamental principle guiding State-to-State relations.\nWe should resolutely promote greater democracy in\ninternational relations. A country should deal with its\ninternal affairs itself. Issues involving the interests of\nvarious countries should be handled by those countries\nthrough consultation. We should remain true to\nmultilateralism and uphold the purposes and principles\nof the Charter of the United Nations and the central role\nof the United Nations in international affairs.\nChina strives to strengthen political mutual trust\nand to address problems and differences with other\ncountries through dialogue and exchanges. China does\nnot interfere in the internal affairs of other countries or\nimpose its will on others. China does not allow outside\nforces to interfere in its internal affairs.\nWe should seek win-win progress through\ncooperation on development. As economic globalization\ndeepens, all countries have a high stake in each other\u2019s\nsuccess. We should therefore enhance cooperation\nand develop common interests to achieve win-win\nprogress with benefits for all. We should tap the\npotential for cooperation in all countries, increase and\ndevelop cooperation, improve cooperation mechanisms\nand work together to make economic globalization\nbalanced, inclusive and beneficial to all.\nWe should accelerate the development of\ndeveloping countries and narrow the North-South gap.\nWe should enhance global development cooperation to\nensure that the benefits of development reach everyone.\nSince the start of the international financial crisis,\nwhile maintaining its own robust growth, China has\nsignificantly increased contributions to international\nfinancial institutions, extended a helping hand to other\ndeveloping countries and bought more bonds from\ncertain developed countries. That has helped to stabilize\nthe international economic and financial situation and\nto maintain the economic and social development of the\nrelevant countries.\nWe should ensure fairness and effectiveness in\nconducting global governance. Facing increasing\nglobal challenges, the international community should\nstrengthen coordination and cooperation, establish a\nfair, equitable, flexible and effective system of global\ngovernance, properly address the various global issues\nand promote the common well-being of humanity.\nChina supports the United Nations in enhancing its authority, efficiency and ability to address new threats\nand challenges through the required proper reform.\nIt is important to advance the building of a global\nsystem of economic governance with a focus on\nreforming the international financial system, rapidly\nimplement the quota and governance reform plans of\nthe International Monetary Fund and other financial\ninstitutions, and increase the representation and voice of\nemerging markets and developing countries. We should\nfully implement the outcome and consensus of the\nUnited Nations Conference on Sustainable Development\n(resolution 66/288, annex), further develop international\ncooperation on sustainable development and discuss the\nestablishment of a post-2015 international development\nagenda based on actively implementing the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals.\nWe should launch a process of open, transparent\nand democratic intergovernmental consultation,\nwith development and poverty reduction as the core\nobjectives. We should also fully leverage the role of\ncivil society and the private sector in that task. Together\nwith all other parties, China is ready to actively\nparticipate in reforming the international system and in\nglobal governance and to jointly face the various global\nchallenges.\nWe should pursue common progress by embracing\nthe diversity of civilizations. According to ancient\nChinese philosophy, the world will be a great place\nwhen all things thrive without harming each another\nand when various efforts are pursued in parallel\nwithout their clashing. We should encourage exchanges\nand mutual learning among different civilizations and\nsocial systems, draw on each other\u2019s strength through\ncompetition and comparison and make progress by\nseeking common ground, while maintaining our\ndifferences. We should respect the diversity of the world\nand the right of all countries to independently choose\ntheir development path. China encourages dialogue\nand exchanges among civilizations. We should replace\nconfrontation with dialogue and bridge differences\nwith inclusiveness in order to make the world more\nharmonious and to ensure common progress for\nhumanity.\nWe should seek common security amid growing\ninterdependence. No country is immune to the complex\nand multiple security threats and challenges in the\nworld. We should foster a new thinking on security that\nis characterized by mutual trust and benefit, equality and coordination. We should adopt a holistic approach\nto address both the symptoms and the root causes of\nthe various security challenges and should build a\npeaceful and stable international and regional security\nenvironment.\nThe United Nations should fully play its role in\nmaintaining international peace and security and\nin establishing a fair and effective mechanism for\ncommon security. We must resolve disputes through\ndialogue and negotiation and oppose the wilful use or\nthreat of force. We must oppose all forms of terrorism,\nseparatism and extremism.\nWest Asia and North Africa are undergoing\nprofound changes. China respects and supports efforts\nby countries in those regions to independently deal\nwith their internal affairs. We respect the aspirations\nand calls of people in those areas for change and\ndevelopment. The unique features of those regions in\nterms of religion, civilization, history and ethnicity\nmust be respected. We hope that the relevant parties will\nsettle differences through inclusive and constructive\npolitical dialogue and that they will resolve problems\npeacefully.\nSafeguarding peace and stability in those areas,\nupholding the fundamental and long-term interests of\nArab countries and ensuring the growth of friendly\nChina-Arab relations will remain a central goal of\nChina\u2019s policy towards such regions. We will continue\nto tirelessly strive, together with countries in those\nareas, to promote peace and development in line with\nthe purposes and principles of the Charter of the United\nNations.\nChina is deeply concerned about the stalled\nPalestinian-Israeli peace talks and the economic\nand humanitarian difficulties facing the Palestinian\npeople. The turbulence in the region should not divert\ninternational attention from the Palestinian issue. China\nsupports the Palestinian people in establishing, on the\nbasis of the 1967 border, an independent Palestinian State\nthat enjoys full sovereignty, with East Jerusalem as its\ncapital. China supports Palestine\u2019s membership of the\nUnited Nations and other international organizations.\nChina urges both Palestine and Israel to take concrete\nmeasures to remove obstacles and to work for the early\nresumption and substantive progress of the peace talks.\nChina is deeply concerned about the ongoing\ntension and worsening humanitarian situation in\nSyria. We call on all relevant parties in Syria to put an immediate end to the fighting and violence, to\nimplement the relevant Security Council resolutions,\nMr. Kofi Annan\u2019s six-point plan and the communiqu\u00e9\nof the foreign ministers\u2019 meeting of the Action Group\nfor Syria (A/66/865, annex), and to launch an inclusive\npolitical dialogue and a Syrian-led political transition as\nsoon as possible. China is open to any political plan that\nis acceptable to all parties in Syria. The relevant parties\nof the international community should play a positive\nand constructive role in that regard, credibly support\nMr. Lakhdar Brahimi, Joint Special Representative\nof the United Nations and the League of Arab States,\nin conducting impartial mediation, and strive to set\nin motion and move forward the process of political\ntransition in Syria.\nThe Iranian nuclear issue has reached a new, critical\nstage. The relevant parties should remain committed to\na diplomatic solution and begin a new round of dialogue\nas soon as possible. In the spirit of respecting each\nother\u2019s concerns, we should act with flexibility and\npragmatism to expand common ground and overcome\ndifferences, seek early progress in dialogue and\nnegotiation and, over time, achieve a comprehensive,\nlong-term and appropriate solution to the issue. China\nhas always supported efforts to uphold the international\nnuclear non-proliferation regime and will continue to\nwork with the parties concerned and play a constructive\nrole in seeking a peaceful solution to the Iranian nuclear\nissue through dialogue and negotiation.\nThe Asia-Pacific region has maintained general\nstability and rapid growth for many years, thereby\nmaking important contributions to global stability\nand prosperity. Given the growing threat of shrinkage\nin the global economy and increasing volatility in the\ninternational situation, maintaining peace, stability\nand sound growth in the Asia-Pacific region is crucial\nto ensuring the well-being of its people and meets the\nbroader interests of the international community.\nWe should fully respect the reality of a\ndiverse and interdependent Asia-Pacific region,\nand continue to follow the approach of regional\ncooperation \u2014 building consensus, making\nincremental progress and accommodating each other\u2019s\ncomfort levels \u2014 that has proved effective over the\nyears. We should promote regional development with\ngreater determination, advance regional cooperation\nwith increased resources, and handle differences with\nlonger-term interests in mind so as to uphold the peace,\nstability and prosperity of the Asia-Pacific region. As an important participant in building the\ninternational system, China is committed to sharing\ndevelopment opportunities with other countries and\nto working with them to overcome various challenges\nand realize security and development for all. China\nwill stay the course of peaceful development. We seek\na peaceful international environment in which China\ncan promote its own development. By so doing, China\nwill contribute to global peace and development. China\nis firm in upholding its core interests. At the same\ntime, it respects the legitimate right of other countries\nto protect their interests. We seek to expand common\ninterests with other parties for the sake of the common\ngood.\nChina has contributed a total of some 21,000\npersonnel to United Nations peacekeeping missions\nand taken an active part in international cooperation\non counter-terrorism, anti-piracy and non-proliferation\nefforts. In our efforts to resolve major international\nand regional hotspot issues, we have urged the parties\nconcerned to seek peaceful solutions through negotiation\nand thereby played an important and constructive role\nin easing tensions and achieving the political resolution\nof those issues. China has made remarkable progress\nin pursuing peaceful development and will continue to\nfollow that path in the years to come.\nChina will enhance friendly relations and\ncooperation with all other countries on the basis of\nthe five principles of peaceful coexistence and strive\nto promote a new type of relationship among major\ncountries based on mutual respect and win-win\ncooperation. Following a policy of building good\nrelationships and partnerships with neighbouring\ncountries, China has actively expanded exchanges with\nits neighbours.\nChina has contributed to over 50 per cent of\nAsia\u2019s growth for many consecutive years. We have\nendeavoured to build mechanisms of mutual trust and\npolitical cooperation with other Asian countries and\nappropriately to address differences and frictions among\nrelevant countries. On the basis of firmly upholding\nChina\u2019s sovereignty, security and territorial integrity,\nwe have worked with our neighbours to maintain sound\nrelations and overall stability in the region. China treats\nother developing countries as good friends and good\npartners; we therefore support each other and seek\ncommon development on the basis of equality.\nBy the end of 2011, the Chinese Government had\nbuilt over 2,200 projects that are important to the local economies and people\u2019s lives in the countries\nconcerned. We have cancelled the debts owed to China\nby 50 heavily indebted poor and least-developed\ncountries. We have trained over 60,000 personnel in\nvarious sectors for 173 developing countries and 13\nregional and international organizations. All of that has\ncontributed to the economic and social development of\nother developing countries.\nChina has taken an active part in reforming the\ninternational system and global governance, and\nassumed its due share of international responsibilities\nand obligations as its capabilities permit. We are\nworking to build a fair, equitable and non-discriminatory\nglobal trading system and a more equal and balanced\nnew global partnership for development. We support\na greater role for the Group of Twenty as the premier\nforum for international economic cooperation, as well\nas the efforts of emerging markets represented by the\nBRICS group \u2014 Brazil, Russia, India, China and South\nAfrica \u2014 aimed at exploring a new model of global\ncooperation.\nThe global economy is at a critical stage, and\nachieving full recovery and sustained growth will be a\nlong and difficult task. Last year, despite a challenging\neconomic environment both at home and abroad, China\nregistered a gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate\nof 9.3 per cent, and made good progress in adjusting its\neconomic structure and improving people\u2019s lives. Since\nthe beginning of the year, in order to address some\nnew problems in economic performance, the Chinese\nGovernment has stepped up anticipatory fine-tuning of\nthe economy and introduced a series of targeted policy\nmeasures. That has boosted market confidence and\nensured steady growth.\nChina\u2019s GDP grew by 7.8 per cent in the first half of\nthe year, and the country has enjoyed sound economic\nand social development. China is still in an important\nperiod of strategic opportunities for development.\nIndustrialization, urbanization, the application of\ninformation technology and agricultural modernization\nwill continue to unlock our great potential for\ndevelopment. We have the confidence, means and\nability to maintain steady and robust growth and\nachieve long-term, sound and sustainable development.\nDuring its twelfth five-year plan for the period\n2011-2015, China\u2019s domestic market will become one of\nthe largest in the world. Its total imports are expected\nto exceed $10 trillion, and direct outbound investment is expected to exceed $500 billion. That will create\nenormous business and job opportunities for the world\nand provide good opportunities for other countries\u2019\ndevelopment.\nThe Diaoyu Islands have been an integral part\nof China\u2019s territory since ancient times. China has\nindisputable historical and legal evidence in that\nregard. Japan seized the islands in 1895 at the end of the\nSino-Japanese War and forced the Chinese Government\nof the time to sign an unequal treaty to cede the islands\nand other Chinese territories to Japan. After the Second\nWorld War, the Diaoyu Islands and other Chinese\nterritories occupied by Japan were returned to China\nin accordance with the Cairo Declaration, the Potsdam\nAgreement and other international documents.\nBy taking such unilateral actions as the so-called\nisland purchase, the Japanese Government has grossly\nviolated China\u2019s sovereignty. This is an outright denial\nof the outcomes of the victorious anti-fascist World\nWar and poses a grave challenge to the post-war\ninternational order and the purposes and principles of\nthe Charter of the United Nations. The moves made by\nJapan are totally illegal and invalid. They can in no way\nchange the historical fact that Japan stole the Diaoyu\nIslands from China and that China has territorial\nsovereignty over them. The Chinese Government is\nfirm in upholding China\u2019s territorial sovereignty. China\nstrongly urges Japan to immediately stop all activities\nviolating China\u2019s territorial sovereignty, take concrete\naction to correct its mistakes and return to the path of\nresolving the dispute through negotiation.\nThe Communist Party of China will soon hold\nits eighteenth National Congress. We are confident\nthat the important meeting will lead China\u2019s reform,\nopening-up and modernization drive to a new stage.\nThe facts have shown and will continue to prove that\nChina\u2019s development is peaceful, open, cooperative and\nwin-win in nature. We will work with the international\ncommunity to follow the trend of history and the call\nof the times and build a harmonious world of enduring\npeace and shared prosperity."

        "file_text": "\ufeffAllow me to congratulate\nthe President on his election to the presidency of the\nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-seventh session. I would\nlike to assure him of my delegation\u2019s full support and\ncooperation during his tenure of office. His impeccable\ncredentials and experience will ensure a successful\nsession. I also wish to commend his predecessor for his\nsterling leadership during the previous session.\nThe establishment of the United Nations by 51\ncountries following the Second World War ushered in\nhope for collective security, shared prosperity and justice\nin international relations. Six decades have passed and\nthe membership of the Organization has swelled more\nthan threefold. But obstacles still remain in the path\ntowards creating a world that was envisioned by our\nforebears. We know the solutions that can effectively\naddress the multifaceted challenges that confront our\nworld. But it is increasingly difficult to arrive at those\nsolutions within the multilateral system. On the international stage, unilateral actions that\ndefy civility and international law are growing more\nfrequent, and increasingly go unpunished. Despite the\nlessons of history, there are countries that still believe\nthey can solve the political problems of our time through\nwar and coercion. It does not matter to them that history\nhas shown that the goal of domination through the use\nof force is not only elusive and dangerous but also\nunsustainable.\nHumankind derives no comfort from the potential\nconflict between the Islamic Republic of Iran and the\nWestern Powers over Iran\u2019s nuclear programme. That\nlooming crisis can be avoided not through the threats\nbeing made against Iran, but through negotiations based\non respect for sovereign equality and the recognition of\nthe rights and legitimate fears of all parties involved.\nOur generation is already facing too many problems.\nSurely we cannot afford another avoidable war.\nWe are saddened by the increasing tension in the East\nChina Sea between two of the most respectable members\nof the international community, the People\u2019s Republic\nof China and Japan. No one should take advantage of\nthe situation to fan the flames of discord between those\ntwo great nations and ancient civilizations. Instead, we\nmust encourage them to resolve their differences with\nmaturity and through peaceful dialogue.\nIn the Middle East, it is about time that individual\ninterests gave way to compassion and reason, so that\nthe people of Palestine can enjoy their inalienable\nright to self-determination in our lifetimes. Two States\nexisting side by side in peace and security have long\nbeen recognized by the international community as the\nonly plausible route to enduring peace and stability in\nthe region. The State of Israel must be prevailed upon\nto support that solution. It must stop building illegal\nsettlements on Palestinian lands, which have the\npotential to render the prospects of a two-State solution\nirrelevant.\nOur call for lifting the economic embargo against\nthe Republic of Cuba has gone unheeded for the past\n20 years. Our thoughts are with the ordinary people of\nCuba who for decades have been denied the fruits of\nglobalization and prosperity through no fault of their\nown. This unfortunate situation has continued for too\nlong and must be resolved. We call on all stakeholders\ninvolved to search for a just and peaceful solution, just\nas we continue to call on the Kingdom of Morocco\nto cooperate with the international community and facilitate the independence and self-determination of\nthe people of the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic.\nPeace within and among nations is a fundamental\ncondition for development. The dream of a prosperous\nworld will continue to be an illusion if tensions persist\nand our world is perpetually at war with itself. That\nis why we welcome as timely and relevant the choice\nof theme for this session, \u201cBringing about adjustment\nor settlement of international disputes or situations by\npeaceful means\u201d.\nToday, many nations are rising up against\ndictatorial regimes in defence of their basic human\nrights and freedoms. The popular democratic uprising\nin the Arab world has underscored the frustration of the\npeople with longstanding political repression and lack\nof accountability. In some Arab countries this quest for\nfreedom, human rights and democracy has been met\nwith atrocious force and brutality. The Government\nof Syria must accept the popular legitimacy and\nsupremacy of the people\u2019s aspirations before it is too\nlate. Further militarization of the situation in Syria will\nmake the conflict too costly in terms of human life. At\nthe same time, we call on all countries to refrain from\ninterfering in the internal affairs of Syria in a manner\nthat undermines the prospects of peace in that country.\nTrue revolutions need no external sponsors. The efforts\nof the international community must focus on helping\nthe Syrian people find a negotiated, peaceful and lasting\nsettlement of the ongoing conflict in their country.\nAfrica, too, is trying hard to rid itself of wars and\nconflicts. While we thought we had dealt with the scourge\nof the coups d\u2019\u00e9tat, it has recently reared its ugly head\nin a few African countries. We call on the international\ncommunity to join hands with the African Union and\nstand firm in refusing to recognize any Government\nthat comes to power through unconstitutional means.\nIt is indeed a mockery of the United Nations, as an\nOrganization that cherishes democratic values and\nprinciples, to accord legitimacy to unconstitutional\nregimes by allowing them to participate in its activities\non an equal footing with bona fide Members. In\nAfrica, we have adopted a policy of zero tolerance to\nunconstitutional changes of Government, and have\nremained steadfast in our resolve to refuse to recognize\nGovernments that have no democratic legitimacy. We\nurge the international community to support that policy\nand to make it universal. Africa has not been without successes in pursuing\nthe settlement of disputes by peaceful means. The United\nNations, the African Union and other stakeholders have\nworked together with the Somali authorities to pave\nthe way for peace in Somalia. The positive results of\nthat joint effort are beginning to be visible. Remarkable\nstrides towards democracy and State-building have\nbeen registered. The election of the President less than\ntwo weeks ago is a cause for celebration. Today, the\npeople of Somalia have reason to hope that they can\nput the unfortunate era of instability behind them. It is\nimportant to recognize, however, that the road ahead\nfor the Government and the people of Somalia is still\nlong and steep. The continued and unfaltering support\nof the international community is indespensable to\nensuring that Somalia does not relapse into conflict and\nbecome a failed State.\nThe development and possession of nuclear and\nother weapons of mass destruction remains a serious\nconcern for the peace and security of humankind.\nSome States possess those weapons in large quantities\nand have not remained faithful to their commitments\nunder the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\nWeapons. Those States often threaten to humiliate\nnon-nuclear-weapon States. That is why other countries\naspire to acquire nuclear weapons. We must renew\nour collective commitment to a nuclear-weapon-free\nworld \u2014 a world that is safe for future generations,\nsustained by the shared values of universal peace and\nprosperity.\nIn the same way, for as long as international trade\nin small arms, light weapons and other conventional\nweapons remains unregulated, peace will continue to\nelude us. The failure of the international community,\nless than three months ago, to conclude a robust, legally\nbinding arms trade treaty has left an indelible mark on\nour generation. We need to step up efforts during this\nsixty-seventh session and live up to our responsibilities.\nConventional weapons, including small arms and light\nweapons, are the real weapons of mass destruction in\nAfrica; they fuel conflict and account for the death of\nscores of our people every day.\nAcross the globe, military and political repression\nhave combined with religious intolerance to sustain the\nspectre of terrorism that continues to besiege our world.\nWhile the international community must address those\nroot causes, there can be no acceptable justification for\nterrorism, because it is both brutal and indiscriminate,\nand it is innocent people, including women and children, who bear the brunt of it. Lesotho condemns\nterrorism in all its forms and manifestations. It does\nnot matter if it is sponsored by States or individuals,\nor whether its evil schemes are carried out by crude\nmeans or the most sophisticated weaponry. The recent\nmurder of American diplomats in Libya demonstrates\nthe brutality and senselessness of terrorism. It deserves\nour strongest condemnation. We extend our sincere\ncondolences to the people and Government of the\nUnited States of America.\nA few days ago, we had an opportunity to reaffirm\nour resolve to uphold the rule of law both at the national\nand international levels. Respect for the rule of law is\na precondition for guaranteeing fundamental freedoms\nand respect for human rights. Similarly, strengthening\nthe rule of law at the international level is critical for\neffectively addressing our current global challenges.\nInternational law is the very foundation of peaceful\ncoexistence between nations.\nThe role played by the International Court of\nJustice as an instrument for the peaceful resolution\nof conflicts and the bedrock of the international legal\norder is sacrosanct. Lesotho reaffirms its support for\nthe principal judicial organ of the United Nations and\nfor other established international courts and tribunals.\nBut those bodies must not be politicized, so that they\ncan retain their integrity and fairness.\nIt is almost four years since the multiple global\ncrises befell us, yet the prospects for economic recovery\nremain gloomy. Evidence of climate change is all around\nus. Extreme weather conditions, f loods, drought, soil\ndegradation and the rise of sea levels threaten the very\nexistence of humankind. In my country, drought and\nf loods have heightened food insecurity, and famine is\nlooming. In August, my Government had to declare\nLesotho in a situation of food crisis and called on its\ndevelopment partners to assist. That followed a severe\ndrought that afflicted Lesotho in the last planting\nseason. I am humbled to repeat that call for help\nbefore this body. Our response to the crisis will focus\non the priorities of subsidizing agricultural input and\npromoting drought-resistant crops, as well as scaling up\nconservation farming and providing nutrition services\nto mothers of infants and young children.\nWe went to Rio de Janeiro in June with a\ndetermination to adopt ambitious and measurable steps\nto address sustainable development. Regrettably, the\nRio+20 United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development did not meet everyone\u2019s expectations. A\nlack of a concrete commitment by developed countries\nto provide developing countries with financing and\ntechnology is a source of concern. Nevertheless, there\nis still hope that a sustainable future is within reach.\nWe must continue to work for the future we want and\ndeserve.\nAs we march forward, we must ensure that the\nformulation of the sustainable development goals and\ntheir interphase with the post-2015 development agenda\nis done carefully and in an inclusive manner. We must\navoid parallel tracks for the Millennium Development\nGoals (MDGs) and the sustainable development goals,\nwhich should be viewed as being complementary to,\nand not a substitute for, the MDGs.\nThe United Nations, which has remained the same\nfor the past 67 years, cannot be effective in efficiently\naddressing the challenges of our time. The need for\nthe early reform of the United Nations, in particular\nthe Security Council, was universally agreed by the\ninternational community at the World Summit in 2005.\nYet, seven years later, negotiations on the reform of the\nCouncil are still without progress. As the status quo is maintained, the Council remains largely inept in the\ndischarge of its mandate. Let us resolve to make the\nAssembly\u2019s sixty-seventh session one of action and less\nrhetoric.\nAllow me to conclude by pointing out that a\nresponsive, effective and efficient multilateral system\nis the only answer to the problems of the twenty-first\ncentury. It must be a United Nations that draws on the\nfull diversity of its membership. With the necessary\ncommitment and political will, that goal can indeed be\nattained."

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt is my distinct honour\nto address the Assembly on behalf of the Government\nand people of Belize. I wish to congratulate Mr. Vuk\nJeremi\u0107 on his election as President of the General\nAssembly at its sixty-seventh session. I am confident\nthat he will guide the deliberations of the Assembly in\na forthright and skilful manner.\nI take this opportunity to reaffirm Belize\u2019s\nunequivocal commitment to the principles, goals\nand ideals of the United Nations, and to pledge our\nunconditional support for the success of its endeavours.\nBased on its performance over the past 67 years, we\nfeel confident to opine that, whereas the United Nations\nis unquestionably imperfect, just as our democracy is\nimperfect, our United Nations is also, however \u2014 like\ndemocracy \u2014 the best institution devised by mankind\ndedicated exclusively to achieving a safer, more just\nand prosperous world.\nAs the twenty-first century inexorably evolves,\nlaying bare the fragility and vulnerability of our planet\nto dangerous global forces, both natural and man-made,\nwhich threaten the existence of all living things on\nour planet, the genius and prescience of the founding\nfathers in creating the United Nations is illuminated\nbeyond doubt. It is probably debatable whether in\n1945 the imperative for mankind to work together\nin harmony to ensure the survival of our very planet\nwas appreciated by all nations. It may be questionable\nwhether it was universally appreciated in 1945 that it\nwas absolutely necessary to have a global institution\ndedicated to the protection of mankind against man\u2019s\npenchant for causing destruction as well as against\nNature\u2019s destructive elements and forces. Today,\nhowever, the need for the United Nations is not only\nmanifest to everyone, but there are clarion calls for it\nto do more and to be more inclusive, representative and\ndemocratic, calls to which Belize adds its voice.\nMy country gained its independence largely in\nconsequence of a resolution of the United Nations\ncalling upon the United Kingdom to grant us our\nindependence by the end of 1981, thereby bringing to\nan end more than 100 years of colonial administration.\nBut whereas we attained our political independence in\nSeptember 1981, our sovereignty over our homeland is\nstill being threatened by a territorial claim dating back\nto the post-1940s by our neighbour Guatemala. We therefore find the theme for this session\u2019s\ndebate a timely and fitting one, namely, bringing about\nadjustment or settlement of international disputes or\nsituations by peaceful means. Happily, I can today\ninform the Assembly that the Governments of Guatemala\nand Belize both have agreed to a recommendation of\nthe Secretary-General of the Organization of American\nStates to allow the Guatemalan claim to be adjudicated\nupon by the International Court of Justice if that is\nthe will of the citizens of our respective countries, as\nexpressed in simultaneous referendums to be held on\n6 October 2013.\nThe resolution of the territorial differendum\nbetween Belize and Guatemala will not only consolidate\nBelize\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity, but also\nenhance the peace and security of our subregion and be\nconducive to the strengthening and deepening of our\nregional integration process.\nBelizeans are a peace-loving people. We abhor\nconflict. We believe in the rule of law. And we have\nfaith in the United Nations.\nWith almost half of our population under the age\nof 25 and approximately 37 per cent under the age of\n18, our nation\u2019s future and destiny are inextricably tied\nto the welfare of our children. And in order for them\nto attain their full potential, they must be properly\nnurtured and fed with balanced, nutritious meals. They\nmust be safely and comfortably housed and they must\nbe properly educated and trained, beginning from the\ntime they are in the cradle. Our children must be trained\nand educated especially in science and technology.\nThey must be trained to think creatively, to be fiercely\ncompetitive, to be industrious and to be prudent in\nthe management of our resources. Our Government is\nconvinced that it is only with this type of training and\ndevelopment that our citizens will be able to compete\nsuccessfully in the world market and generate the\nwealth that is required to transform our society into a\ntruly developed nation. If we fail our children today, we\nare setting ourselves up to fail in our common future.\nWith a view to attaining development objectives,\nour Government has initiated some ambitious,\ncomprehensive pro-poor policies. For example, our\nGovernment is committed to a programme to ensure that\nlow-income Belizean families do not have to face the\ndifficult choice between sending their children to school\nor buying food. Qualifying families in underserved\nrural or urban areas can already rely on our conditional\ncash-transfer programme and on our food pantry\nprogramme. We provide education subsidies to families\nof children attending secondary school. We continue\nto emphasize and expand early childhood education\nand to improve access to alternative education. We are\ninvesting in improving the quality of the health care to\nwhich our citizens have access.\nAs a small State that took its place among the\nnations of the world only 31 years ago, Belize is\nexperiencing all the growing pains that naturally afflict\nthe young. Furthermore, our situation is aggravated by\nthe fact our population is less than 350,000 persons,\nwho trace their origins to all over the globe and are\nconsequently multi-ethnic, multi-faith, multilingual\nand multicultural. With such a diverse population, the\nurgency of social cohesion cannot be overstated. When\nwe add to this mix the challenges which today confront\nus all, occasioned by natural disasters such as climate\nchange and by man-made ones such as the global\nfinancial collapse and transnational criminal activity,\nit becomes readily apparent that it is wholly beyond\nthe capacity of any one Government to discharge its\nobligation towards its citizens solely through national\ninitiatives and devices and solely with domestic\nresources.\nFor this reason, the Belize Government has\nembraced the multilateral system and our cooperation\npartners around the world. We are partnering with\nthem in many fields, including economic, social,\nenvironmental and humanitarian, in our perennial\nquest to better secure all our citizens and develop them\nto their fullest potential. In this regard, United Nations\nfunds, programmes and agencies such as the United\nNations Development Programme, the United Nations\nPopulation Fund, UNICEF, UNESCO, the Food and\nAgriculture Organization of the United Nations, the\nUnited Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, and the\nWorld Health Organization are working tirelessly with\ncountries like Belize to carry out the decisions of the\ninternational community and support efforts to meet\nthe aspirations of our people. Belize avails itself of this\nopportunity to thank all our development partners for\nthe tremendous contributions they make daily to the\nsecurity and development of our country and people.\nWe know that more can and, indeed, must be done\nto raise our ambitions in delivering for the poor, for the\nneedy and for the vulnerable. It is therefore urgent that\nwe move to shape a post-2015 development agenda that\nreflects our equal stake in a common future, addresses the concerns of the wealthy and strong, and meets the\nneeds of the poor and the vulnerable.\nBelize remains fully supportive of all regional\ninitiatives. We have sought and obtained membership\nin the Organization of American States, the Caribbean\nCommunity (CARICOM), the Central American\nIntegration System and the Community of Latin\nAmerican and Caribbean States. We work closely in all\nthese subregional groupings on the issues of concern\nto us such as climate change, security and economic\ndevelopment. And here we feel constrained to point\nout that the impact of climate change on our region has\nbeen direct, dire and devastating, compelling us to join\nforces with our CARICOM partners and with the wider\nAlliance of Small Island States to advance our interests\nin the climate change negotiation process. In that\nconnection, Belize is proud of its contribution as host\nnation of the CARICOM Climate Change Centre, which\nis tasked to provide technical and scientific advice\nto inform subregional policy positions in executing\nadaptation and mitigation projects in our subregion and\nto raise awareness of the deleterious impact of climate\nchange in our respective countries. We thank the staff\nof that institution for the sterling work they are doing.\nWith respect to the nefarious enterprises of\ntransnational trafficking in humans, drugs and arms,\nBelize subscribes to the view that a regional response\nis imperative to combat these pernicious scourges.\nOur countries are not the markets for these illicit\ncommodities. Our countries do not benefit from\nthe immense profits generated by these criminal\nenterprises, yet we bear the burden of having to divert\nscarce resources, badly needed for development, to\ncombat the activities of these merchants of death and\ndestruction. Indeed, our countries are overwhelmed by\nthe grim tasks which now befall us of having to mend\nthe shattered lives of our children and of mourning\ntheir untimely deaths. That is why Belize is committed\nto the implementation of the Central America Regional\nSecurity Strategy and to working with our partners\nto ensure that the Strategy has the level of support\nnecessary to guarantee that it is effective.\nOur region, Central America and the Caribbean,\nhas been labelled as among the most violent regions\nof the world, with homicide rates that have reached\ncrisis levels, occasioned largely by the use of small\narms and light weapons. But almost all small arms and\nlight weapons found in our region start out as legally\nmanufactured and legally traded arms. Every Member\nof the United Nations is involved in some measure in this\ntrade, which we believe is of dubious value to mankind.\nIt is therefore deeply regrettable that, despite what\nappeared to be an emerging consensus and despite the\nunderlying global urgency of a multilateral response,\nthe conclusion of an arms trade treaty has so far been\nbeyond the reach of the international community. It\nis urgent, in our view, that we redouble our efforts to\nbreak the gridlock and reach the compromise necessary\nto arrive at a consensus on an arms trade treaty as soon\nas possible.\nThe States of Latin America and the Caribbean are\nalmost all classified \u2014 wrongly and unjustly, in our\nview \u2014 as middle-income countries. That is a generic\nclassification that masks the varied challenges our\ncountries continue to face arising from poverty, high\nlevels of income inequality, economic vulnerabilities\nand debt. As a consequence, all our countries have\nbeen calling for a change in paradigm so that the\nclassification of countries as middle-income countries\nno longer guides development cooperation. We urge all\nour development partners to heed this call and address\nthis situation.\nFinally, we would like to echo the call of other\nMembers of this institution who have advocated the\nlifting of the economic embargo against Cuba, which\ncontinues to fetter the development of that sister\nCaribbean nation and its people.\nBelize also notes and joins those positive voices\nthat support Taiwan. We therefore urge Taiwan\u2019s full\nparticipation in the United Nations.\nWe ask also that urgent attention be given to the\nconcerns of the people of Israel and Palestine, whose\nlegitimate expectation to live peaceful, fruitful lives\ncontinues to be frustrated. And we stand in solidarity\nwith the citizens of the Middle East, particularly those\nin Syria, in their quest for those democratic freedoms\nto which we all aspire.\nAs we move ahead to take on the new challenges\nthat will emerge during the sixty-seventh session, as\nwe redouble our efforts to address the long-standing\nproblems our world faces, and as we renew our faith\nin the multilateral system, the role of the Assembly\nand of our United Nations Organization will become\nincreasingly critical and relevant. This is the only body\nthat is truly universal in character and which commands\nlegitimacy and authority. The entire world looks to the\nUnited Nations to solve the multitudinous problems which beset mankind. In the circumstances, the United\nNations is simply just too big to fail in the discharge of\nits singular obligation: to safeguard the well-being and\nsafety of humankind and planet Earth."

        "file_text": "\ufeffAt the outset, I would\nlike to congratulate Mr. Vuk Jeremi\u0107 on his election\nas President of the General Assembly at its sixty-\nseventh session. I am confident that his experience in\ninternational affairs will enable him to guide the work\nof this session wisely and ably, and I wish him every\nsuccess in his task.\nI would also like to commend his predecessor,\nAmbassador Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser, for his\nsuccessful and prudent leadership of the sixty-sixth\nsession of the General Assembly, and to commend the\ngreat efforts made by Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon\nand pay tribute to his tireless efforts and the role of this\ninternational Organization in promoting international\npeace, security and development.\nSecurity and stability in the Arab Gulf region are a\nhigh priority for all of us. Our balanced policies are based\non the principles of the Charter of the United Nations\nand the provisions of international law, especially those\ncalling for peaceful coexistence, confidence-building,\ngood neighbourliness, mutual respect, non-interference\nin the internal affairs of other States, and pursuing\npeaceful means in resolving conflicts and disputes.\nOn the basis of those principles, my Government\nexpresses, once again, its regret regarding the\ncontinued Iranian occupation of our three islands:\nAbu Musa, Greater Tunb and Lesser Tunb. We demand\nthe restoration of the United Arab Emirates\u2019 full\nsovereignty over those islands. We emphasize that all\nactions and measures taken by Iran are null and void,\nand are in contravention of international law and all\nnorms and universal human values.\nThe events unfolding in Syria are for us a cause\nfor great sadness. They have gone beyond all limits\nand norms. The United Arab Emirates is closely, and\nwith great concern, following the policies of violence,\nkilling, displacement and expulsion being pursued by\nthe Syrian regime against its people, which regime\nhas lost all its legitimacy. We therefore call upon the\ninternational community to consider with seriousness\nand firmness what is happening to our Syrian brothers\nand to shoulder its humanitarian responsibilities.\nWe see it as our duty to stop those atrocities against\nthe peaceful Syrian people. We are convinced that a solution to the crisis can be achieved only through an\norderly transition of power.\nThat severe humanitarian crisis requires us\nto support the people of Syria, in particular the\nrefugees. The United Arab Emirates has shouldered\nits responsibilities and obligations towards the Syrian\nrefugees in Turkey and Jordan and will continue to do\nso by providing relief. We urge all States to contribute\nto such humanitarian efforts.\nThe Middle East holds great importance for us,\nand we believe that peace and stability will never be\nachieved in that region until the Arab-Israeli conflict\nis resolved. That is the central and vital issue to the\npeople of the entire region, and reaching a just solution\nis the key for bringing peace and stability to the whole\narea. It cannot be realized without putting an end to\nthe Israeli occupation of the Palestinian and Arab\nterritories through Israel\u2019s withdrawal to the lines\nof 4 June 1967, including from East Jerusalem, the\noccupied Syrian Golan Heights and the remaining\noccupied Lebanese territories. The achievement of a\njust and comprehensive peace must be carried out in\naccordance with resolutions of international legitimacy,\nthe principle of land for peace, the Arab Peace Initiative\nand the establishment of an independent Palestinian\nState, with East Jerusalem as its capital.\nThe United Arab Emirates welcomes the\nconsiderable progress achieved in the political process\nin Somalia through the completion of the transitional\nphase, the convening of the Constituent Assembly,\nthe adoption of the Constitution of Somalia and the\nelection of Mr. Hassan Sheikh Mohamud as the new\nPresident of Somalia. We also reaffirm our support\nfor the sovereignty, territorial integrity and political\nindependence of Somalia, and look forward to working\nwith its Government towards achieving security and\nstability and countering piracy in a region of such\nvital importance, not only with respect to oil and gas\ntransport but also to the world economy in general.\nIn the United Arab Emirates, we remain committed\nto supporting the security and stability of Afghanistan\nand confirm the continuation of our humanitarian and\ndevelopmental support to that distressed country. In\nthat context, we welcome the outcome of the donors\nconference that was held in Tokyo, with the hope that\nthe pledges announced at the conference will contribute\nto the process of the reconstruction of Afghanistan. As\nwe approach the year 2014 and the commitment for\nmilitary withdrawal from Afghanistan and for turning\nthe country over to its people and Government, we\naspire to see an Afghanistan that is free from terrorism,\nextremism and violence.\nAt the same time, the United Arab Emirates\nexpresses its deep concern over the violence against\nthe Rohingya Muslim community in Myanmar and\ncalls upon the international community to urge the\nGovernment of Myanmar to cease all acts incompatible\nwith the principles of fundamental human rights.\nWe reaffirm our commitment to all requirements of\nnuclear non-proliferation and renew our support for the\nefforts aimed at designating the region of the Middle\nEast, including the Arab Gulf region, a zone free of\nweapons of mass destruction \u2014 especially the Arab\nGulf region. In that context, we must also call upon\nIsrael to join the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\nNuclear Weapons and subject all of its nuclear facilities\nto the comprehensive safeguards regime.\nIn that regard, we urge the Islamic Republic of Iran\nto fully cooperate with the International Atomic Energy\nAgency in implementing its international commitments\nin order to dispel all fears and suspicions surrounding\nits nuclear programme. We look forward to a peaceful\nsolution to that crisis, ensuring that our region remains\nfree of tension and conflict, while guaranteeing the\ntransparency and peaceful nature of Iran\u2019s nuclear\nprogramme.\nThe United Arab Emirates began in 2009 to develop\na nuclear energy programme for peaceful uses in order\nto meet the country\u2019s growing demand for energy and to\nsupport economic development projects. It ensured that\nthe programme\u2019s rules and regulations were based on\nthe highest standards of sustained safety and security\nmeasures and principles of nuclear non-proliferation.\nI take the opportunity to call upon the States of the\nregion to draw on the experience of the United Arab\nEmirates in that field and to study the standards of\ntransparency, technology, safety and security upon\nwhich the programme is based.\nWe would like to emphasize the importance of\naddressing the implications of climate change, which\ninvolves developing renewable energy technologies to\nachieve sustainable development and providing clean\nenergy for developing countries, which are among\nthe goals advocated by the United Arab Emirates in\noffering various types of humanitarian and development\nassistance.\n\nThe United Arab Emirates reiterates its firm\ncondemnation of all acts of terrorism, illicit trafficking\nin drugs and arms and human trafficking, as well as\norganized crime, which are interlinked phenomena that\nfeed into each other. It reaffirms its resolve to continue\ncooperating with international and multilateral efforts\naiming at the total elimination of those negative\nphenomena, which pose a direct threat to international\npeace and security.\nThe United Arab Emirates has announced the\nestablishment of the International Centre of Excellence\nfor Countering Violent Extremism, in collaboration with\nseveral inf luential friends and actors, which will begin\nits work in Abu Dhabi at the end of the year. Moderation\nand tolerance are the basic principles guiding our\npolitical orientation and represent lofty values to the\ncitizens of the United Arab Emirates and to society as\na whole. In that sense, the United Arab Emirates has\nbeen and will remain committed to moderation in its\napproach, and accepts other communities as part of a\ndiverse world built on mutual respect. Those are the\nhuman values that have formed our convictions with\nregard to many issues, such as counterterrorism, human\nrights, the empowerment of women and coexistence\namong peoples and religious sects.\nThe United Arab Emirates emphasizes the\nimportance of consolidating the values of tolerance,\nmoderation and respect for religions, as well as the\nimportance of protecting religions against defamation\nand contempt and stresses the need to develop the\nnecessary legislation in that regard. I must condemn,\nin the strongest possible terms, abuses against Islam,\nas freedom of expression should not be allowed to\nundermine any religion or belief, whatsoever. We also\ncondemn all violent reactions to any such abuse.\nTerrorism poses a challenge to international peace\nand security and leads to violating the human rights\nof ordinary people by depriving them of the right\nto live in peace and prosperity. In that context and\nbased on our commitment to the principles of human\nrights, the United Arab Emirates renews its support of\ninternational efforts aimed at ensuring peace, security\nand prosperity for all the peoples of the world, and\nlooks forward to expanding its engagement in that area.\nThe United Arab Emirates has also been focusing\nits efforts on reducing gender discrimination.\nTherefore, we look forward to playing an active role\nin the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and\nthe Empowerment of Women, based on our successful  national experience in empowering the women of\nthe United Arab Emirates, who actively participate\nin managing the affairs of the State as well as the\ncommunity.\nIn conclusion, I would like to appeal to all\nMember States to support the quest of the United Arab\nEmirates to host World Expo 2020 in Dubai under the\nslogan \u201cConnecting Minds, Creating the Future\u201d. We\nlook forward to receiving the support necessary to\nstrengthen my country\u2019s candidacy, particularly since it\nis the first time that the event will be held in the Middle\nEast, North Africa and South Asia region."

        "file_text": "\ufeffI commend the Secretary-\nGeneral for his immense efforts in leading the United Nations and its Secretariat to fulfil its mission and\nimplement the tasks with which the Organization is\ncharged. The theme of this session is very timely. The\nUnited Nations plays a leading role in the settlement of\ndisputes by peaceful means. It possesses the legal and\ninstitutional framework to do so.\nStates Members of the United Nations have\ncommitted themselves to the principles contained in the\nCharter. The peaceful settlement of disputes therefore\nprimarily depends on the determination of the national\nand international leaders. Only if they are determined\ncan the United Nations and other international\norganizations and institutions arrive at decisions and\ntake action.\nLet me speak about some concrete challenges\nthat require strong will and decisive action by the\ninternational community. The conflict in Syria threatens\nsecurity and stability in the whole region and beyond.\nLatvia urges all members of the Security Council to\nfind the political will to unite and resolve that crisis.\nThe lives of innocent people must be protected.\nThe risk of the proliferation of weapons of mass\ndestruction is one of the most serious global threats.\nThe international community should be united in its\ncommitment to prevent it. Latvia is seriously concerned\nabout the potential use of Syria\u2019s stockpiles of chemical\nweapons.\nWe deplore the lack of progress in dialogue with\nIran on the nature of its nuclear programme. We believe\nthat its full cooperation to clarify all outstanding\nquestions is needed.\nWe call for strengthening the efforts to reach the\ngoals of the the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\nNuclear Weapons and its action plan. In that regard,\nwe applaud the steps taken by the United States and\nRussia towards global disarmament and transparency.\nWe hope that they will trigger further efforts to reduce\nthe reliance on nuclear weapons.\nLatvia also welcomes the consensus outcome of\nthe second Review Conference on Small Arms and\nLight Weapons. We should redouble our efforts to find\nsolutions on the Arms Trade Treaty as soon as possible.\nLatvia welcomes the increasingly active role\nplayed by regional organizations such as the African\nUnion and the League of Arab States in the peaceful\nsettlement of conflicts. \n\nEuropean regional organizations have also been\nactively working towards the resolution of protracted\nconflicts in the wider Europe. We see a positive\ntrend towards a political settlement in Transnistria,\nRepublic of Moldova. However, only with progress on\nthe withdrawal of foreign troops will any settlement\nbe sustainable. A multinational peacekeeping mission\nwith an international mandate could be a rational way\nforward.\nThe consequences of the conflict in Georgia in\n2008 will have a long-lasting effect on the security\nsituation in the region. The European Union Monitoring\nMission in Georgia is presently the only international\nplayer that monitors the implementation of the sixpoint\nagreement. Gaining actual access to the occupied\nterritories would contribute to lasting progress. In\naddition, the restoration of a meaningful presence of\nthe United Nations in Georgia is needed.\nWe remain concerned about the increasing number\nof incidents at the contact line in Nagorno-Karabakh.\nThe conflicting sides should abstain from hostile public\nrhetoric and should concentrate on confidence-building\nmeasures. The conduct of major military exercises in\nthat volatile region should be avoided.\nAfghanistan has been at the centre of the world\u2019s\nattention for much more than a decade. We believe\nthat the international community is fully committed to\nassisting the Afghan Government in strengthening its\npublic administration and the National Security Forces.\nLatvia will continue its involvement in the European\nUnion (EU) and NATO missions in Afghanistan. We\nalso intend to participate in the missions after 2014. In\naddition, Latvia will provide a financial contribution to\nthe international fund in support of the Afghan National\nSecurity Forces.\nThe future of Afghanistan is closely linked to\neconomic development and regional cooperation.\nWe encourage the full engagement of the Central\nAsian countries in discussions on the region\u2019s future.\nAfghanistan has the potential to become a regional hub\nfor transportation and transit. Using our experience as\nan entry point to the Northern Distribution Network,\nLatvia is already engaged in training Afghan experts\nin the areas of transportation and anti-drug trafficking.\nThe global economic and financial crisis has\nfocused leaders\u2019 attention on immediate measures to\novercome it, often diverting their attention from long-term global challenges. The world economy remains\nfragile, even if some positive trends can be observed.\nLatvia welcomes all efforts to stabilize the situation in\nthe eurozone and supports recent steps in that regard.\nWe are working hard to be part of the solution and to\nbecome a net contributor to global economic stability.\nLatvia\u2019s own gross national product grew more\nthan 5.5 per cent in 2011. That positive trend is set to\ncontinue in 2012. Over the past decade, we have achieved\nsignificant progress with respect to both income and\nstructural convergence. The quality of governance and\neconomic structures in Latvia is comparable to that\nof the member countries of the Office of Economic\nCooperation and Development (OECD). Looking to\nthe OECD\u2019s expected enlargement, Latvia is ready to\noffer its experience with transition and with the kind of\ndecisive reforms that are leading us to recovery from\nthe recent crisis.\nOverall, Latvia has emerged from the downturn\nstronger and more competitive, with a balanced\neconomy and a positive business environment that\npositions us well for the next growth cycle. Above all,\nthe sustainability of economic health must go hand\nin hand with the process of incorporation into the\neurozone. Latvia believes that the challenges can be\novercome and aims to introduce the euro in 2014.\nInternational peace and security are closely linked\nwith two other pillars of the United Nations, namely,\ndevelopment and human rights. Latvia welcomes the\nestablishment of the high-level panel on the post-2015\ndevelopment agenda. We are pleased that the EU\u2019s\nCommissioner for Development, Mr. Andris Piebalgs\nof Latvia, will contribute to the panel\u2019s work.\nThe current framework of the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals has revitalized global action on\ndevelopment and improved its effectiveness. Latvia\u2019s EU\npresidency in 2015 will evaluate the progress achieved\nand contribute actively to the agreement on post-2015\nframework, which should remain people-centred,\nfocused, time-bound and simple.\nIn recent years we have witnessed a growing number\nof people in many countries demanding freedom and\njustice. The international community must support\ntheir aspirations. We must help build stable democratic\ninstitutions and establish the rule of law. We believe\nthat respect for human rights, good governance and\ninclusive economic development will help to prevent\nfuture conflicts.\n\nLatvia participates in capacity-building in several\nconflict and post-conflict countries. We actively support\nnations in transition in their efforts to strengthen the\nrule of law. We welcome the fact that those issues are\nnow part of the Secretary-General\u2019s five-year Action\nAgenda and we are committed to their implementation.\nLatvia believes that economic and social\ndevelopment will benefit from the introduction of the\nprinciples of open Government. Civil society in Latvia\nactively participates in the decision-making process at\nall stages and levels.\nLatvia fully supports the work of a strong and\neffective Human Rights Council. We have put forward\nour candidacy for the elections to the Council in 2014.\nIn order to keep pace with the modern world, the\nUnited Nations needs to change. The time has come\nto start real negotiations on reforming the Security\nCouncil. We support the enlargement of the Council in\nboth the permanent and the non-permanent membership\ncategories. Any enlargement of the Council should\ninclude at least one new non-permanent seat for the\nEastern European Group.\nThe world is going through a period of turbulence,\nas shown by recent violent events in the Middle East.\nWe strongly condemn the attacks on diplomatic\nmissions in several countries as unacceptable. Latvia\nfully supports the freedom of association and the right\nto demonstrate peacefully. We deplore any attempts to\nuse religion to fuel extremism and violence. Tolerance\nand respect for our differences are the key to preventing\nconflicts and violence, both in our communities and\ninternationally.\nFinally, Latvia looks forward to a fruitful sixtyseventh\nsession of the General Assembly. Let us address\nthe challenges with true political will."

        "file_text": "\ufeffAt the\noutset, allow me on behalf of the Chadian delevation\nto wholeheartedly thank the President for selecting\nthe theme for the sixty-seventh session of the General\nAssembly, \u201cBringing about adjustment or settlement of\ninternational disputes or situations by peaceful means\u201d.\nThat subject is at the very heart of the principles that\nunderlie the existence of our Organization, and reflects\nthe global concerns of our day.\nIndeed, the world is in an period of unprecedented\ntension, perhaps even more serious than that following\nthe Cold War. From Afghanistan to Mali; from Pakistan\nto Somalia; from Libya to Syria; and from the Israeli-\nPalestinian conflict to that of the Sudan and South\nSudan, most of the crises that have recently shaken and\ncontinue to shake our planet, while undoubtedly rooted\nin political and social claims, also have considerable\nreligious and cultural undertones that are often difficult\nto address.\nAfrica is the crucible of all the scourges affecting\nthe world. The war and attacks in Somalia, the situation\nin Mali, the crises in the Democratic Republic of the\nCongo and between the two Sudans, violence in\nLibya and outbreaks in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire and the Central\nAfrican Republic are situations which many attempts to\nresolve have proved ineffective. Based on the principle\nthat without peace and security development is not\npossible, the international community, embodied in the\nUnited Nations, has the firm obligation to contribute to establishing peace by making use of all the legal\nmechanisms at its disposal for settling conflict.\nThe Organization has been particularly active\nin recent years in different theatres of conflict, such\nas Afghanistan, Darfur, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Libya and the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo. Since its inception,\nthe United Nations has never been so involved in different\nhotbeds of tension around the world. We commend that\npresence because of its calming and legitimizing effect\non populations and even on protagonists. However,\nwe also need to ponder the form and effectiveness of\nthat presence. The stalemate in the Israeli-Palestinian\nconflict and the crisis in the Democratic Republic of\nthe Congo, despite the massive and costly deployments\nof the forces mandated by the United Nations, clearly\nreflect the inability of the international community to\nimpose peace where it is necessary.\nThe crisis in Mali comes as a test and a challenge\nfor the international community. Along with that crisis,\nobscurantist and violent religious fundamentalism,\ndrug and human trafficking and irredentist claims\nhave taken root in the very heart of Africa today. Can\nthe world continue to stand by for much longer given\nthat that gangrene, of which Mali is only the epicentre,\nthreatens to spread throughout the entire Sahel?\nOur delegation commends the determination\nof the international community seen at the high-\nlevel meeting on the Sahel that was organized on the\ninitiative of the Secretary-General. We commend the\ncommitments of France, the Economic Community of\nWest African States and above all those of the primary\nparty concerned, namely, Mali, to act to eradicate that\ngangrene. The United Nations, too, needs to expedite\nprocedures and act quickly by adopting a resolution that\nwould authorize the intervention of an international\nmilitary force.\nI would like to take advantage of my presence at\nthis rostrum to warmly commend Mr. Omer Hassan\nA. Al-Bashir of the Sudan and Mr. Salva Kiir of South\nSudan, who overcame their differences and reached\na peace and security agreement, albeit partial. We\nsincerely hope that the agreement will quickly lead\nto a final understanding, which is so necessary to the\nprogress of the countries and to the stability of the\nsubregion.\nIt is my pleasure to inform the Assembly that within\nthe framework of subregional initiatives with respect to\npeace and security in the Sahel, the member countries of the Community of Sahelo-Saharan States (CEN-SAD)\nhave undertaken a reform of our organization, which\nwill incorporate peace and security dimensions into its\nupdated texts. The President of the Republic of Chad,\nMr. Idriss Deby Itno, has invited his colleagues from\nmember countries to a summit meeting in N\u2019Djamena\non 29 November to adopt new texts aimed at refocusing\nCEN-SAD\u2019s objectives on the specific concerns of the\nregion.\nThe ability of extremist groups to cause harm\nacross borders calls for a collective and appropriate\nresponse. Our community, CEN-SAD, which includes\nalmost all of the countries of the Sahel and the Saraha,\nseems to be the appropriate structure in which to bring\ntogether all our response strategies.\nDrawing on lessons from the difficulties experienced\nby the United Nations on the ground, Chad requested\nthe departure in 2010 of the United Nations Mission in\nthe Central African Republic and Chad (MINURCAT).\nThe Mission had been mandated to stabilize the region\nand protect Sudanese refugee camps in Darfur and\nthose of internally displaced persons in eastern Chad.\nDespite a huge budget and considerable resources, that\nforce did not prove to be an effective deterrent. It left the\nbulk of the work to the D\u00e9tachement int\u00e9gr\u00e9 de s\u00e9curit\u00e9\n(DIS), a special national Chadian force made up 600\nmen and women. After MINURCAT\u2019s departure,\nChad decided to entrust DIS with the protection of\nrefugees and displaced persons and any humanitarian\norganizations that provided assistance. A joint support\nprogramme for DIS was signed in February 2011 in\norder to mobilize the necessary logistical financial\nsupport to enable it to operate. The overall budget was\nestimated to be $20 million, about 2 per cent of the\nbudget allocated to MINURCAT, which, I would remind\nthe Assembly, amounted to some $800 million per year.\nThat support has not yet been forthcoming, and Chad\nhas been bearing the cost of the unit alone, estimated\nat about $4 million per year. I would also remind the\nAssembly that the responsibility of providing security\nto refugees, displaced persons and humanitarian\norganizations living in that region cannot and should\nnot be left to Chad alone. The international community\nhas the obligation to consider that issue and address\nit. That is why Chad is reiterating the special appeal\nit launched from this rostrum last year, requesting our\nOrganization to take heed.\nAfrica sorely needs international solidarity, not\nonly to settle the conflicts and crises sweeping through it, but also for its development. In both cases, the results\nhave been disappointing. The Millennium Development\nGoals, official development assistance and debt relief,\nin sum all of the commitments made in that regard,\nhave either not been met or have been met only\nhalfway. We would remind the Assembly that poverty,\nunemployment and, at times, despair are the scourges\nthat push young Africans to extremism and to seek\nbetter prospects elsewhere. Africa needs assistance on\na large scale, not in small doses, in order to help those\nyoung people and give them new confidence in their\ncontinent. This would not absolve the African States\nfrom shouldering their primary responsibility to create\nthe right conditions for progress and prosperity.\nFor its part, my country, Chad, under the\nleadership of President Idriss Deby Itno, is continuing\nthe necessary political and economic reforms for its\ndevelopment and stability. We have just held the first\nmunicipal elections in our political history, and there\nwere presidential and legislative elections in 2011. In\naddition, we are reviewing ways of establishing new\narrangements for political dialogue with the democratic\nopposition, similar to those which enabled us to hold\nthe latest elections in a calm and tranquil environment.\nFor that reason, we are patiently working to\nconsolidate the rule of law and strengthen the values of\ntolerance and democracy within Chadian society. That\nis a long and arduous process in a country that has just\nbeen through three decades of violence and political\ninstability. With stability restored and socioeconomic\nprogress achieved, Chad would like to make its modest\ncontribution to building a world of justice and peace.\nFor that reason, my country is for the first time a\ncandidate for a non-permanent seat in the Security\nCouncil during the elections of October 2013.\nThe efforts undertaken by my country have,\nhowever, been hampered by unexpected events: first,\nthe crisis in Libya, which required us to strengthen\nsecurity along the borders with that country, in addition\nto our efforts to secure our borders with the Sudan, the\nCentral African Republic and the Lake Chad region that\nborders Nigeria and the Niger; secondly, the arrival of\nnearly 100,000 Chadians who had f led the war in Libya,\nthe majority of whom were young people needing help\nwith reintegration; and, thirdly, the current f loods,\ncaused by exceptionally heavy rains. The Government\u2019s\nappeal for help for the victims of the disaster has not yet\nreceived the expected response. Despite all those constraints and the sacrifices\nundertaken by Chad, we have not been able to benefit\nfrom the debt relief that comes with reaching the\ncompletion point. We therefore call on our bilateral and\nmultilateral partners to take into account our unique\nsituation and support us as we move forward.\nThe theme of our session this year reminds us that\nall of the formulas that have been used to address the\nIsraeli-Palestinian conflict have failed. As the crisis\ngoes on and on, it is becoming accepted; yet, it is at the\nvery root of the worst violence the world has seen in\nrecent years. The community of nations cannot behave\nlike an ostrich indefinitely, allowing a crisis as old as the\nUnited Nations itself to drag on interminably \u2014 a crisis\nwhich is a constant threat to peace and the regional and\nglobal balance. Here, too, old postures need to change\nand robust initiatives need to be taken to put an end to\nthe conflict, which has gone on far too long.\nThe international realities of our time should also\nstrengthen our determination to bring about the reform\nof the Security Council. The primary innovation should\nbe to expand its membership, with the admission of\nAfrica as a permanent member with the right of veto.\nThe world has greatly changed. We therefore need to\nadapt our global governance to these developments.\nIn conclusion, the delegation of Chad, through\nme, would like to express how much we admire the\nnewly elected President\u2019s steering of the work of the\nGeneral Assembly. We also would like to pay tribute to\nthe Secretary-General for his personal commitment in\nthe quest for peace worldwide. We firmly hope that his\nefforts will be successful and bring about more justice\nand serenity for humankind."

        "file_text": "\ufeffI bring warm greetings from the\npeople of Kiribati, on whose behalf I am privileged to\naddress this body once again. I join with those who\nhave gone before me in congratulating Mr. Vuk Jeremi\u0107\non assuming the presidency of the Assembly at its\nsixty-seventh session. We find ourselves in challenging\ntimes. The work ahead of us during this session reflects\nthose challenges. I am confident, however, that, under\nhis able leadership, this Organization will continue its work to improve the quality of life for all members\nof our global community, in particular those who are\nmost vulnerable.\nLet me also take this opportunity to acknowledge\nwith appreciation the commendable leadership of his\npredecessor, Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser, during\nthe most recent session of the General Assembly.\nI also recognize the unwavering dedication of our\nSecretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon. With his hand\non the tiller, he continues to steer our Organization\nthrough the complex realities and challenges facing\nour world today towards our objectives. In particular, I\nwould like to acknowledge with deep appreciation his\npersonal commitment to the issue of climate change\nand the plight of the most vulnerable. We in Kiribati\nwelcomed the Secretary-General to our country\nlast year, during the first visit ever by anyone in his\nposition to our part of the world. We were grateful for\nthe opportunity to show him firsthand the challenges\nof living on the front lines of climate change.\nIn the President\u2019s opening statement yesterday\n(see A/67/PV.6), he reminded us that the core function\nof the Organization is the maintenance of peace and\nsecurity. It is important that we all reflect on what we\nhave done as individuals to achieve a more peaceful,\nsecure and better world. We must ask ourselves if\nwhat we are doing is in the collective interest of all the\npeoples of this world or of just a select few. We must\nlook at our efforts as leaders of this global family and\nask ourselves if we are doing the right thing for our\nchildren and their children. I firmly believe that, with all the information\navailable to us today, we should know exactly what\nneeds to be done. We know what we have to do but,\nfor whatever reason, we lack the courage, the fortitude\nand the vision to do it. We lack a sense of responsibility\nfor each other. We are not willing to step out of our\ncomfort zone and make the necessary sacrifices for the\nsecurity and future of all members of our international\ncommunity.\nIt is never too late to do the right thing. History\nshows many examples where global action has resulted\nin global good. We have managed to secure a relatively\nmore peaceful world. We have been able to address\nsome of the major injustices of the past. We have come\ntogether to face down those who seek to achieve their\nobjectives through terrorist means. However, we must\nremain vigilant, as new and emerging forms of security\nthreats and injustices are cropping up to threaten our\nglobal family.\nThis will be the seventh time I have had the honour\nto address the Assembly in my nine years as President\nof my country. Each time I have sought to convey the\nsame message. Each time I have spoken of the real\nand existential threat to my nation. Each time I have\nreminded the Assembly of the need for urgent action\nto address climate change and sea level rise so as to\nensure the long-term survival of nations like Kiribati.\nI frequently find myself watching my grandchildren\nand wondering what sort of a future we shall be leaving\nthem. For their sake, climate change is an issue that I\nwill continue to talk about for as long as I have breath in\nmy body. This is a critical issue for the survival of our\npeople and for all of humanity. It remains the greatest\nmoral challenge of our time.\nWhether or not we are willing to acknowledge it,\nclimate change and sea-level rise are the result of the\nunsustainable use of our planet\u2019s resources. Economic\ngrowth at all costs must not be our mantra, particularly\nwhen it is those who will benefit the least from this\ngrowth who will pay the ultimate price. The Earth is\nnot ours to do with as we please. We are merely trustees\nfor future generations, and we ignore this reality at\ntheir peril.\nThe Organization was founded on the fundamental\nprinciple of sovereign equality. Security issues\naffecting each of us must be given due recognition.\nWe are grateful that the General Assembly agrees that\nclimate change is a matter warranting the attention of the Security Council. I applaud the commitment of our\nSecretary-General to this particular security threat, but\nhe needs the support of all nations to take the necessary\naction to address it.\nWe must step up our collective efforts to mitigate\nglobal greenhouse-gas emissions. We continue to urge\nmajor greenhouse-gas emitters to do their part. We also\nurge development partners to provide the appropriate\nlevel of resources and technology to enable us to deal\nwith the current and future impacts of climate change\nand sea-level rise.\nWhile we are taking adaptative measures to ensure\nthat Kiribati remains habitable for as long as possible,\nwe are also preparing for a future when our islands\nmay no longer be able to sustain our population. We\nare looking to improve the skills of our people to a\nlevel where they will be able to compete for jobs in\nthe international labour market. We want our people to\nhave the option to migrate with dignity, should that be\na necessary choice in the future, and all the science is\ntelling us that that is a real possibility.\nWe note some positive progress made at the recent\nclimate change talks in Bangkok, building on the\ndecisions made in Durban last year. However, action\nhas been too slow in coming. We inch along, when\nit is great strides that are needed. On those issues\nwhere we have consensus, we believe the international\ncommunity must move to implement agreed action\nwithout delay, while we continue our discussions on\nthose matters that remain contentious. If we wait for\nagreement on everything, then it is going to be a very\nlong wait and a long process.\nIt should not come as a surprise that we are off-\ntrack on many of the Millennium Development\nGoals (MDGs). While other countries are focusing\ntheir resources on their efforts to meet the MDGs, we,\nthe most vulnerable countries, continue to spend a\ndisproportionate level of our limited resources fighting\nthe onslaught of the rising seas and storm surges on our\nhomes, livelihoods and public infrastructure. That is a\ncostly exercise that we cannot afford. We continue to\nrely on the goodwill of our partners and members of our\nglobal community in that regard.\nWe are a nation of water. We are a very-large-ocean\nState. We believe that, given the right support, we\ncan achieve sustainable development through the\nutilization of the available resources of our vast\nexclusive economic zone. We believe that, in so doing, we can reduce our reliance on development assistance.\nI also believe that we may even be able to do away with\ndevelopment assistance altogether, if we are provided\nwith the support we need now to develop our capacity\nto harvest and process our own resources.\nFisheries remain a major economic resource for my\ncountry, providing between 40 and 50 per cent of our\nrevenue. Our aspiration is to maximize returns from\nthat resource, given the current rate of return of between\n5 and 8 per cent after landed value alone. We have\nstarted establishing our fish-processing plant through\na public/private partnership. Seabed mining is another\npotential source of revenue. However, we are mindful\nof the need to take a precautionary approach towards\nthat particular industry, given the potential damage it\ncould cause to our pristine marine environment.\nWe acknowledge the fundamental role of our\nenvironment as a pillar of sustainable development.\nMaintaining the health and biodiversity of our oceans\nand ecosystems will be critical. Our contribution to\nthose efforts is the Phoenix Islands Protected Area,\nwhich was once the world\u2019s largest marine protected\narea. We have set aside that area as a haven for\nmarine biodiversity, and that is our gift to humanity\nin recognition of the value of protecting our common\nheritage.\nOcean conservation is beyond the resources of\nany single country. Collaboration on cross-border\ninitiatives is therefore essential to advancing our\nefforts in that regard. At the recent Pacific Islands\nForum meeting in the Cook Islands, the United States\nand Kiribati announced plans to collaborate in building\nlinks between our adjoining marine parks in the\nPhoenix Islands, under the umbrella of the Phoenix\nOcean Arc. That effort is our joint contribution to the\nPacific Oceanscape Framework. We want to take this\nopportunity to invite the international community to\npartner with us in that endeavour.\nOur message to the international community is that\nconservation of biodiversity and marine ecosystems\nin the Pacific is not only important to the sustainable\ndevelopment of Pacific island people. It is also of vital\nimportance to the rest of the global community. The\ninternational community needs to support those efforts,\nnot as a hand-out but as an investment for this planet\u2019s\nfuture generations.\nIn June, we met in Rio de Janeiro to review our\nprogress 20 years on from the 1992 Earth Summit. Twenty years ago, we agreed that the protection of our\nglobal environment was critical for our future survival\nand that the pursuit of development must be based on\nthe long-term sustainability of our natural resources.\nUnfortunately, our track record in delivering on our\nundertakings has not been good. In fact, in many\nrespects, our environment is worse off today than it was\n20 years ago. The fine balance keeping our planetary\necosystem together has been adversely affected by\nour pursuit of individual benefits at the expense of the\ncollective good. While some members of our global\nfamily continue to benefit from the unsustainable\nexploitation of resources, others are having to pay the\nultimate price. We do not believe that there is justice\nin that.\nWe renewed our commitment in June to achieving\nthe future we want. That future will require our\nOrganization to evolve to reflect the realities of our\ntime, a time in which new and emerging security\nthreats and injustices, such as climate change, are\nchallenging the credibility of our international system\nof governance; a time in which the future survival\nof some nations is seriously in question; and a time\nwhen all those countries with the ability to do so must\ncontribute to the prevention of such a calamity or be\nforever judged by history. If we are to provide a secure,\npeaceful and prosperous future for our children, then\nwe must go beyond business as usual and deliver now.\nIn fact, we should have delivered yesterday.\nWe accept the reality that, during these uncertain\ntimes, there is a need for the United Nations to remain\nas relevant and responsive as possible to the ever-\nchanging needs and challenges of this world. In our\ndiscussions earlier this morning, I was most encouraged\nto be assured by the Secretary-General\u2019s commitment\nto ensuring that our Organization will undergo reforms\nin order to become more efficient, more transparent\nand more accountable. We also welcome the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s proposal to strengthen partnerships with civil\nsociety and the private sector.\nIn fact, I believe that such a partnership must begin\nat the community and national levels before extending\nto the regional and international levels.\nThe fundamental fabric that binds us together as\na family and as humanity is unravelling at the seams.\nMaintaining security and ensuring the survival of\npeople in conflict areas, particularly in the Middle\nEast and North Africa, remain a major challenge to our\nOrganization. Let us pray for the sake of those on the front line of the major global challenges that a greater\nunderstanding and stability will prevail.\nIt is gratifying to note the continued easing of\ntension and the improvement of relations across the\nTaiwan Straits. We also welcome the inclusion of\ncountries such as Taiwan in the international activities\nof the World Health Assembly. We hope that a\nsimilar understanding will prevail in respect of other\ninternational institutions and processes so that Taiwan\ncan participate and contribute meaningfully for the\ngood of humanity.\nAs we chart the path towards the future that we\nwant, we must address the fundamental threats to the\nvery existence of the members of this family of nations.\nAs a family, we must guarantee the survival of the\nmembers of our community. Climate change must be\nresolved before it is too late for those countries on the\nfront line and, indeed, the whole of humanity.\nWe need compassionate, visionary and responsible\nleadership at this time in order to direct our path\ntowards a more secure and just future. We owe it to\nour children and their children\u2019s children to act and act\nsoon. So let us pray that God will give us the common\nsense to do the right thing for the future of humanity."

        "file_text": "\ufeffI wish to warmly congratulate\nyou, Mr. President, on your election to the presidency\nof the General Assembly at this session. Rest assured\nthat you have Italy\u2019s full support as you assume your\ncrucial responsibilities in the service of international\npeace and cooperation.\nEvery day and everywhere, people strive to\novercome fear, achieve justice and persevere through\nhardship and uncertainty to protect their families\nand livelihoods and to ensure a better future for their\nchildren. Governments strive to achieve and preserve\npeace, justice and prosperity in a world gripped by\npolitical tensions, civil wars and a severe economic and\nfinancial crisis. In 2011, financial markets showed serious new\nsigns of tension, due primarily to the deterioration of\npublic finances. What we have been experiencing is\nnot a recurrent cyclical imbalance. In the case of the\nEuropean Union (EU), it is the deepest and worst crisis\nin its history.\nOther crises threatened the European project in the\npast, but each time Europeans found a way to continue\ndown the path on which they embarked upon more\nthan 50 years ago. In his memoirs, Jean Monnet noted\nthat Europe would be built through crises. Indeed, it\nis by solving those crises that Europeans have realized\nhow closely integrated their interests are and how\ninterdependent their economies. Today, the world has\nlearned how essential a viable Europe is to tackling\nglobal economic and security challenges, and how\nimportant the euro area is to the recovery of the global\neconomy. Today it is clear that \u201cmore Europe\u201d is in the\ngeneral interest, and not just that of Europeans.\nWe cannot overlook the importance of the measures\nbeing taken at the EU level to strengthen governance and\nfiscal integration, as was underlined by President Van\nRompuy. It is also essential that European Governments\ndeliver at the national level. Italy will continue to do\nits part to further strengthen fiscal sustainability and\nenhance potential growth.\nHistoric changes are taking place in the\nMediterranean region. Italy has stood by the Arab\npeoples in their quest for justice and democracy. In the\npast months, we have engaged with the new leaders\nof those nations. I found in them a deep commitment\nthat inspires hope. Both bilaterally and through the\nEuropean Union, we are lending concrete support to\ntheir new Governments to assist their recovery, set\nmutually beneficial trade policies and foster inclusive\neconomic development, thereby promoting stability\nthroughout the region.\nThere is also an element of self-interest in that\npursuit. Instability around the Mediterranean impacts\nour own security. Conflicts and social unrest on the\nsouthern shore spill over to our own shores. Terrorism\nfinds new avenues to reach Europe. Trafficking in\nhuman beings has destabilizing effects on the countries\nof destination and often results tragedies at sea, which\nwe can no longer accept. The situation in the Sahel is of\ngrave concern and a top priority for Italy. It is a volatile\nmix of fragile institutions and rampant organized\ncrime and terrorist groups. We cannot let the situation\ndeteriorate any further. Italy, for one, will make its contribution jointly with our partners and the States of\nthe region.\nThe ultimate goals of peace and cooperation will\nbe achieved only if all the countries concerned work\ntogether on the basis of mutual respect and a shared\nsense of purpose. A culture of dialogue must prevail\nover confrontation. Extremism and intolerance must be\nisolated and rejected. Rights, dignity and opportunities\nmust be offered to every component and member of our\nsocieties, especially minorities and women.\nItaly is fully committed to implementing such a\nvision. For us, protecting and promoting human rights\nis a long-standing domestic commitment as well as a\nfundamental pillar of our foreign policy. In that vein,\nwe shall continue to pursue the universal abolition\nof the death penalty, the protection of minorities, the\nadvancement of the status of women and the free and safe\nexpression of religion or belief. We need to cooperate\nwisely in firmly rejecting the misrepresentation of\nreligions or beliefs as an instrument of disruption and\ndestabilization.\nTo achieve that goal, good laws are always\nnecessary, but they are not always enough. Tolerance\nmust be promoted through educational programmes\nand consistent grass-roots work, engaging the efforts\nof both Governments and civil society. I strongly\nencourage the membership of the Assembly and all\nrelevant international organizations to resolutely\npursue such an approach.\nThe Arab Spring has experienced difficulties, yet it\nhas also scored a number of remarkable achievements.\nNothing is easy, yet nothing is impossible. But nothing\ncan be achieved without goodwill and good faith, which\nwe will need if we want to put an end to the ongoing\nmassacres and the massive human rights violations in\nSyria. The regime in Damascus refuses to comply with\nthe resolutions of the Security Council, and it continues\nto commit indiscriminate violence against civilians.\nItaly fully supports the mission of the new Joint Special\nRepresentative for Syria and strongly urges the Security\nCouncil to overcome the stalemate that is preventing\neffective international action. History will not be\nlenient in judging those who bear responsibilities.\nNor can we underestimate the increasing danger of\nnuclear proliferation. Italy supports the commitment of\nthe International Atomic Energy Agency to obtaining\nclarification of the true nature of the Iranian nuclear\nprogramme. We urge Iran to fully comply with all the relevant Security Council resolutions. Italy advocates\nmore effective arms control regimes, and looks forward\nto concrete nuclear disarmament measures as proposed\nin President Obama\u2019s Prague appeal.\nRespect for the rule of law is the basic condition for\npromoting human rights and maintaining international\npeace and security. In that context, Mr. President, I\nwelcome your proposal of \u201cBringing about adjustment\nor settlement of international disputes or situations\nby peaceful means\u201d as the overarching theme for this\nsession of the General Assembly.\nI am also pleased to announce that Italy is now\nready to accept the compulsory jurisdiction of the\nInternational Court of Justice in accordance with\nArticle 36, paragraph 2, of the Court\u2019s Statute. This\nis a defining moment for the International Court of\nJustice and for international jurisdictions in general,\nsince they are the key institutions for interpreting\ninternational law and guaranteeing global compliance\nwith its provisions. More and more, effective actions to\nassure international order and security demand respect\nfor international law.\nThe same holds true for actions to counter new\nthreats, such as piracy, which is particularly troubling\ngiven its impact on the world economy and on the lives\nof seafarers. International efforts to protect sea lanes\nand fight piracy can be effective only if all nations\ncooperate in good faith, according to the established\nrules of international customary law and United Nations\nconventions, including those protecting the jurisdiction\nof the f lag State in international waters.\nThe Organization can expect no less from each\nMember State, and especially from those Members that\naim to have a decisive influence on the rules of global\ngovernance. Any erosion of the sending State\u2019s exclusive\njurisdiction over servicemen on official duty would\njeopardize the status of our agents on international\nmissions. Consequently, it would also undermine the\nsustainability of United Nations peacekeeping missions.\nBy the same token, we must not tolerate any breach\nof diplomatic missions, whose inviolability must be\nrespected. We firmly condemn any proposition that\nviolence is an acceptable response to speech.\nTransnational organized crime also requires a\ncollective response grounded in the rule of law and\nthe principle of shared responsibility. With the United\nNations Office on Drugs and Crime, Italy has actively\ncontributed to, and co-financed with Colombia, a digest to promote the implementation of the Palermo\nConvention by illustrating best practices. The digest\nis a practical tool for law enforcement officials and\nprosecutors. It will be officially presented next month\nin Vienna, on the occasion of the sixth Conference of\nthe Parties to the United Nations Convention against\nTransnational Organized Crime.\nThe United Nations is called upon to play a key\nrole in conflict prevention, the settlement of disputes\nand providing assistance for crisis management\nand nation-building, in cooperation with regional\norganizations. Despite the current financial juncture,\nItaly continues to do its part in crisis management,\npeacekeeping and stabilization missions. Our\nexpertise and resources \u2014 both military and\ncivilian \u2014 will remain engaged in a number of critical\ntheatres, especially Afghanistan and Lebanon. That\ncommitment constitutes a heavy burden, but one we\ndeem a worthy investment for the sake of the common\ninterest.\nIn that light, helping Somalia to recover its integrity\nand dignity will remain high on my Government\u2019s\nagenda.\nThe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)\nhave played a crucial role in changing development\ncooperation policies and practices. But since they\nwere first agreed upon, the development landscape has\nchanged deeply. New challenges have emerged and\nother issues and processes have come to the fore. The\npost-2015 development agenda will therefore have to\ntake those trends into account. It will have to include\nsuch important dimensions of development as reducing\ninequality, fostering credible democracy, promoting\nhuman rights, good governance, equitable growth,\nmigration, employment, decent jobs and tackling\nclimate change.\nWe are very pleased with your decision,\nMr. President, to constitute a high-level panel to\ndiscuss this fundamental issue, and to appoint three\nimportant leaders to conduct the international debate.\nWe are confident that the process of defining the pillars\nof the future development agenda will be as inclusive as\npossible, while avoiding the top-down assumptions that\nemerged in 1995.\nIn our view, the post-2015 MDGs will have to be\nharmonized with the inputs that emerged from the\nUnited Nations Conference on Sustainable Development\nin Rio de Janeiro (Rio+20). The three dimensions of sustainable development \u2014 the social, economic and\nenvironmental \u2014 will be part of the scenarios we face\nin the future. We will also have to work within the\nframework of the new Busan Global Partnership for\nEffective Development Cooperation.\nIn the area of climate change, sound and balanced\nmanagement of land and marine resources, involving\nstrengthened trans-boundary cooperation, deserves\ncloser political attention and common application. Some\nchallenges are particularly pressing. Tackling climate\nchange through coordinated emissions-reduction\npolicies is a prerequisite to substantially reducing, and\npossibly stopping, the serious degradation of planet\nEarth\u2019s fragile ecosystems, on which our lives depend.\nIn line with our joint strategic objectives to overcome\nthe financial crisis, we attach great importance to\ninnovative sources of financing for development. Italy\nhas helped promote a number of significant initiatives,\nin particular in the health field.\nMigrant remittances play a key role in the\ndevelopment of many countries. That process will be\nfacilitated by achieving the commitments of the Group\nof Eight (G-8) and the Group of 20 to reduce the average\nglobal cost of transferring remittances.\nFood security is a priority for the Italian\nGovernment\u2019s development assistance policy. In 2009,\nunder Italy\u2019s presidency, the G-8 adopted the L\u2019Aquila\nFood Security Initiative, a new and inclusive mechanism\nthat has been joined by more than 40 countries and has\nfunded several food security projects amounting to an\nestimated $22 billion.\nWe are still paying careful attention to policies\naimed at mitigating the effect of agricultural price\nvolatility. The availability of high-quality, healthy and\nsustainable food for all humankind is the historical\nand concrete challenge being taken up by Expo 2015 in\nMilan. The theme \u201cFeeding the planet\u201d is crucial to the\nglobal agenda \u2014 from the Millennium Development\nGoals to Rio+20 and its Zero Hunger initiative, as well\nas the G-8 and G-20 processes \u2014 and is particularly\nrelevant to the work of the United Nations system. All\nStates Members of the United Nations have been invited,\nand so far almost 100 countries and international\norganizations have confirmed their participation.\nIn conclusion, I wish to respond to the appeal\nyou launched in your opening address. Yes, Italy\nwill make an active contribution to the efforts aimed\nat revitalizing the General Assembly by enhancing its role and efficiency. Today more than ever, the\nworld needs the authority of the United Nations. The\nreform of the Security Council is a key element of\nthis agenda. We are very much counting on members\u2019\nassistance in making it happen. An effective Security\nCouncil is crucial not only to meeting the challenges\nto peace, but also to creating a better international\norder. An equitable reform of the Council is a matter\nof continuing legitimacy, rather than of increasing the\nnational power of select Member States. The principles\nof accountability, consensus and regional empowerment\nmust continue to inspire our commitment."

        "file_text": "\ufeffOn behalf\nof the Government of the Republic of Angola, I avail\nmyself of this opportunity to congratulate Mr. Vuk\nJeremi\u0107 on his election to preside over the General\nAssembly at its sixty-seventh session and to assure him\nof the support of my country in the fulfilment of his\nmission. It is our belief that under his leadership this\nsession will confirm the importance and role of the General Assembly in finding solutions to the burning\nissues affecting humankind, thereby helping to make\nthe world safer and fairer. I would also like to express\nour gratitude to Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser for\nthe exemplary and wise manner in which he conducted\nthe work of the Assembly at its previous session. I\nfurther salute Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for\nthe dynamism he has invested in the work of our\nOrganization. In this connection, I would like to thank\nhim for his visit to my country in February of this\nyear, during the celebration of the tenth anniversary\nof the advent of peace in Angola. During that visit,\nhe had the opportunity to familiarize himself with the\nprogress made in the reconstruction of the country and\nconsolidation of democratic institutions.\nThis session of the General Assembly is taking place\nat a time of profound international political, economic\nand social transformations, which reaffirm the relevance\nof the central theme of our discussion: maintaining\ninternational peace and security, eradicating poverty,\npromoting development, protecting the environment\nand ensuring a better future for generations to come,\nguaranteeing the rule of law in international relations,\nand promoting and ensuring the protection of human\nrights. These are indeed the main challenges facing us\ntoday.\nIn addition to these, there are further challenges\nrequiring priority attention from our Organization,\nincluding disarmament, the fight against organized\ncrime, the implementation of the Global Counter-\nTerrorism Strategy, and the persistence of armed\nconflicts and their impact on people\u2019s lives. Having\nhad the painful experience of war, which still has\nmajor consequences for the lives of our people, Angola\nreiterates that dialogue and negotiation are the way to\na peaceful resolution of conflict. Angola will continue\nto meet its obligations and fulfil its responsibilities\nat the international level, in particular with regard\nto Africa as a whole, as well as in the context of the\nregional economic and political groups to which it\nbelongs, including the Southern African Development\nCommunity, the Community of Portuguese-speaking\nCountries, the Economic Community of Central\nAfrican States and the International Conference of the\nGreat Lakes Region.\nThe international economic and financial crisis\nthat is affecting all countries in the world continues\nto demand solutions, including the reform of the\neconomic, financial and international trade system in order to serve the interests of all countries in a global\nperspective. In this regard, my Government reiterates\nits support for initiatives aimed at liberalizing\ninternational trade in line with the Doha Round. The\nreform of the international economic and financial\nsystem\u2019s regulatory institutions is of crucial importance\nto ensure greater flexibility and transparency in\nallocating capital to the least developed countries \u2014 a\ncategory that includes the majority of African nations.\nIt is also essential to take appropriate measures\ntowards strengthened support for international action\non sustainable development and increased financial\ncontributions to the United Nations to enable our\nOrganization to fulfil its mandate efficiently. It must\ndo so by renewing its commitments to the sustainable\ndevelopment issues contained in Agenda 21, adopted\nat the United Nations Conference on Environment and\nDevelopment in Rio de Janeiro in 1992. The United\nNations Conference on Sustainable Development\nprovided a solid framework for creating national and\ninternational policies to ensure the social, economic\nand environmental welfare of our peoples.\nWe note that despite the progress made, there is\na continued need for the international community to\ntranslate commitments into action in order to achieve\nsustainable development. Africa in general, and my\ncountry in particular, believe that intensive efforts on\nthe part of the international community are needed to\ntackle the phenomena that threaten to reverse progress\nmade with respect to development. Drought and\ndesertification, climate change, natural disasters, loss\nof biodiversity and rapid urbanization are just some of\nthe factors that adversely affect development efforts\nworldwide.\nThe Security Council plays a key role in preventing\nand resolving conflicts, and in peacekeeping efforts, in\naccordance with the powers conferred upon it by the\nCharter of the United Nations. The central theme at\nthe heart of our debate calls for reform of the Security\nCouncil, as well as ensuring the fair representation\nof all regions and the broadening of its permanent\nmembership in order to adapt it to contemporary reality.\nAllow me to refer to a set of conflicts that are of\ncritical concern to my country. In the Great Lakes\nregion, the conflict in the Democratic Republic of the\nCongo continues to worry the international community.\nMy country reaffirms its support for the decisions of\nthe third extraordinary summit of the International\nConference on the Great Lakes Region, held in Kampala, as well as the efforts of the African Union\nand the Southern African Development Community.\nAngola welcomes the normalization of the legal\nand constitutional order in Somalia as a result of the\ncompletion of the transition process, including the\ninauguration of President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud.\nGiven that the situation remains unstable, Angola urges\nthe international community to continue to support the\nstabilization process in that country.\nThe situation in the Sudan has seen positive\ndevelopments. Angola welcomes the recent agreements\nbetween the sisterly Republics of South Sudan and the\nSudan, with a view to the settling of their disputes.\nAngola urges stakeholders to engage with one another\nand to show the political will necessary to implement\nthe commitments undertaken.\nWith respect to Mali, Angola deplores the\nworsening humanitarian situation resulting from\nthe crisis prevailing in that country. Angola calls\nupon the international community to demonstrate its\ndetermination to preserve the unity, sovereignty and\nterritorial integrity of Mali.\nIn the sisterly nation of Guinea-Bissau, we\nadvocate a comprehensive solution and the permanent\nnormalization of the constitutional order, in accordance\nwith the relevant resolutions of the Security Council, the\nAfrican Union, the Community of Portuguese-speaking\nCountries and the Economic Community of West\nAfrican States, as well as the wishes of all the internal\nactors, in order to stabilize the country and establish\npeace.\nWe remain concerned about the lack of progress\nin resolving the issue of Western Sahara. We call on\nthe parties involved to continue negotiations under\nthe auspices of the United Nations so that the people\nof Western Sahara can exercise their right of self-\ndetermination.\nThe prevailing situation in the Middle East in\ngeneral, and the Palestinian territories in particular,\nis one of the most serious problems facing the\ninternational community. Angola supports the creation\nof an independent Palestinian State living side by side\nwith the State of Israel in peace and security and within\nsecure internationally recognized borders, in line with\nthe position of the international community.\nThe conflict in Syria poses a grave threat to\ninternational peace and security and will seriously exacerbate the humanitarian situation in the region.\nAngola urges the international community to support\nthe efforts of Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi, Joint Special\nRepresentative of the United Nations and the League\nof Arab States for Syria, to seek a negotiated solution\nto the conflict.\nThe embargo imposed on Cuba violates international\nlaw and for decades has been a major impediment to that\ncountry\u2019s development and improvements in the lives\nof its citizens. Angola reiterates its principled position\naffirming the need to end the embargo in accordance\nwith the relevant United Nations resolutions.\nAngola\u2019s foreign policy will continue to be based on\nmutual respect, mutual benefit, good-neighbourliness\nand the strengthening of regional economic integration.\nAngola will continue to comply with all the international\ncommitments and international instruments to which it\nis a party.\nTen years after achieving peace, Angola has\nrecorded significant progress in consolidating its\ndemocratic process. General elections were held on\n31 August in a civil and peaceful atmosphere, thus\ndemonstrating the maturity of its people. The results\nexpressed the sovereign will of the Angolan people,\nas verified by international observers who closely\nfollowed the election.\nCurrently, Angola is joyfully celebrating the\ninvestiture of its organs of State sovereignty, including\nthe President of the Republic and the National Assembly,\nas well as the assumption of office by members of the\nGovernment. It is experiencing a dynamic reconstruction\nand development process marked by the consolidation\nof macroeconomic stability that has had positive\neffects on the stabilization of the national currency.\nIn addition, the rehabilitation and modernization of\nmajor productive and social infrastructure, namely\nthe reconstruction of roads, railways, electricity\nsupply and distribution systems, water supply systems\nand sanitation and telecommunication networks, are\ncontributing to the progressive improvement of the\nliving conditions of Angolans.\nPolitical stability and the strengthening of\ninstitutional capacity have enabled the Angolan\neconomy to grow at an average rate of 9.2 per cent over\nthe past five years, while the non-oil sector has grown\nat an average rate of 12 per cent. Those growth rates\nwere due to effective measures by the Government\naimed at stabilizing the fiscal, monetary and currency macroeconomic indicators and thereby facilitating the\nrevival of the economy.\nThe fi ght against hunger and the struggle to reduce\nand eradicate poverty are two of the biggest challenges\nbeing addressed by the Angolan State owing to their\nimpact on people\u2019s lives. Indeed, their resolution is\ncrucial if we are to build a more prosperous society and\nachieve social justice.\nDespite Angola\u2019s successes in the last decade,\nit was not possible to achieve the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals as we had wished. However, the\ncountry\u2019s macroeconomic development indicators have\npermitted the Committee for Development Policy of\nthe Economic and Social Council to consider Angola\neligible to graduate from its least developed country\nstatus starting in 2015.\nOn behalf of the Angolan Government, we would\nlike to express our gratitude for the trust that investors have shown in us and for the assistance provided by\ninternational partners which, added to investment from\nnational sources, has allowed us to achieve the level of\neconomic growth the country has been experiencing.\nWe are aware that there is still much to do to ensure\nthat the high growth rates the country has seen in the\nrecent past are reflected in an effective, systematic and\ngradual increase in the standard of living of the Angolan\npeople, through a better distribution of national income\nand higher employment levels, especially among youth,\nand increased and better investment in the area of social\nwelfare.\nIn conclusion, I must reiterate Angola\u2019s commitment\nto the purposes and principles embodied in the Charter\nof the United Nations and state that we will continue\nto engage in the search for solutions to the challenges\nfacing the international community."

        "file_text": "As I address the General Assembly at its sixty-seventh\nsession, I would like first of all to convey the warm\ngreetings and solidarity of the people of Nicaragua and\nits Government of national reconciliation and unity,\nled by Comrade President Comandante Daniel Ortega\nSaavedra, who wishes us success in our work.\nThe changes now taking place in science, economy,\ngeopolitics, technology, ecology and culture are truly\nrevolutions in the life of all human societies around\nthe world, but they raise doubts about the effectiveness\nof international organizations in conducting global\naffairs. The situation in the world today proves that\nwhen governance is conceived and conducted from the\nperspective of global capitalism \u2014 savage, as it was\ncalled by His Holiness Pope John Paul II \u2014 instead of\nbecoming a factor for positive transformation, as we\nwere led to believe it would, it can lead us to the edge\nof civilization.\nThe vertiginous development of speculative venture\ncapital in developed countries has reduced the role of\nthe State in public affairs. The market imposes itself\nin all areas \u2014 the economy, politics, culture, society,\nindividuals and the mass media \u2014 thus strengthening the\ninfluence of the interests of giant corporations involved\nin food production, communications, medicine and the\nmilitary-industrial complex. They are the real power\nin decisions having a global impact; their decisions\ndetermine the course of many important events related\nto the economy and to peace. That is totally contrary to\nthe idea that gave rise to our Organization. That situation\nis aggravated by the growing sense that, increasingly,\nwell-being and world power are completely in the\nhands of market and finance elites, that the people\u2019s\nstandards of living are dramatically crumbling and\nthat confidence in the capacity of all Governments to\nsolve the most pressing problems is decreasing at an\naccelerating pace.\n\nThe impact of the economic and financial crisis on\nthe centres of power of global capitalism is provoking political and social changes with great international\nrepercussions. The United States and European\ncountries, paradigms of that egotistical model, are at a\nloss to find solutions to their structural problems. They\ndrag their citizens and the world into unemployment,\nsocial insecurity and greater poverty. Thus the\nexclusive nature of the privatization of the State and its\nsubjection to market forces, speculation and financial\nfraud becomes clear, demonstrating the urgent need for\nequitable distribution of wealth worldwide.\nMany outstanding thinkers describe the scenario as\na struggle between the market and the State. However,\nthe paradox is that the very State that wanted to find the\nparadigm for development in the greater comfort of its\ncitizens is one that today, without political scruples or\nethics, develops a new neoliberal programme, disguised\nas necessary adjustments to save the economy and\ndefend the citizens. That reveals that in developed\ncountries, the economy, the market and political power\nare the same thing. In them, the State has evolved only to\nmerge into one programme the interests of speculative\nfinancial capital, of large global corporations and\nindustries and of the military-industrial complex.\nWe are certain that the nature of these adjustments is\npermanent, and that it is a new economic agenda that\nwill direct the greatest concentration of power to the\nhighest global level in the quest to dictate the path of\na new capitalist model that in all spheres of life is ever\nmore concentrated.\nThe world of 1945, after the Second World War,\ngave rise to all the institutions that constitute global\ngovernance, beginning with our Organization. That\nworld no longer exists. Thus today as never before it\nis imperative that we re-establish a philosophy of firm\nand lasting world peace and of economic development\nfor the benefit of all the peoples of the world \u2014 that is,\nthe philosophy that inspired the founders of the United\nNations system, the philosophy of global governability\nand management.\nIn that connection, we reiterate the urgency of\nmaking progress in the reform of the United Nations\nsystem, or rather in its reinvention. Nicaraguans have\nthe honour of having taken the initiative in this matter.\nOur brother, the former Foreign Minister of Nicaragua\nand President of the the General Assembly at its sixty-\nthird session, Father Miguel d\u2019Escoto Brockmann,\ntogether with President Daniel Ortega Saavedra and\nother great present-day thinkers, have taken on the task\nof developing a plan for the reinvention of the United Nations system. We say \u201creinvent\u201d because the present\nOrganization no longer permits reforms; those that\nhave been proposed so far have not made progress, due\nthe policy of some permanent members of the Security\nCouncil. In the name of the people of Nicaragua, I\ninvite all to strongly push for that proposal, in order to\nmake a reality of a new Charter of the United Nations\nthat guarantees democratization of the Organization.\nPeace is a supreme value and a condition in\nwhich human activity can develop in a stable manner\nbeneficial for all. However, some developments\nestablish a dangerous path.\nWe consider the economic, commercial and\nfinancial blockade of Cuba a f lagrant violation of\ninternational law and the most basic norms of peaceful\ncoexistence. Furthermore, today it is claimed that\nthat blockade is based on the arbitrary, groundless\nand unilateral inclusion of that fraternal country in a\nlist of States sponsoring international terrorism. We\ndemand the immediate and unconditional end of that\ncrime against humanity, which constitutes an affront\nto the conscience of our peoples. We also demand the\nimmediate and unconditional release of the five Cuban\npatriots who are unjustly kept in prison in the United\nStates of America.\nWe demand respect for the sovereignty and\nindependence of the fraternal Bolivarian Republic of\nVenezuela, which faces a wave of conspiratorial actions\nseeking to destabilize and destroy the democratic plan\nof the Bolivarian Revolution and the popular interests,\nthus undermining the enormous social and economic\ngains obtained by the Venezuelan people through great\neffort and courage, with the distinguished leadership of\nPresident Hugo Ch\u00e1vez Frias.\nThe peace process in Colombia should be fully\nsupported in order for the people to start on a path of\ntrue social progress.\nInternational law should be given unrestricted\nsupport as regards the inviolability of Ecuador\u2019s\ndiplomatic Mission in the United Kingdom. We also\nreaffirm our support of Argentina\u2019s sovereign rights\nover the Malvinas Islands and the right of Puerto Rico\nto obtain its full independence.\nBearing in mind the information disseminated\ndaily by the world\u2019s main communication media, it\nhas escaped no one\u2019s attention that there is a risk of\nwidespread war in the Middle East. The situation in Syria is unacceptable. We strongly condemn the acts of\nterrorism that have cost the lives of high-level officials\nof President Bashar Al-Assad\u2019s Government and of\nthe population of Syria. Nicaragua recalls that it is a\nform of aggression that was already condemned by the\nInternational Court of Justice in 1986 in the case of The\nRepublic of Nicaragua v. The United States of America.\nIt is evident that the mediation promoted by the United\nNations is going nowhere, simply because it is being\nblocked by the members of NATO and their allies with\ninterests in the region.\nA peaceful solution with regard to the Islamic\nRepublic of Iran should be promoted. We need to\nresolve without delay the aspirations of the Palestinian\npeople by supporting the peace negotiations and their\nlegitimate right to their own State and to be part of\nthe United Nations. We strongly condemn the terrorist\nacts in Benghazi, Libya, on 11 September, in which\nUnited States Ambassador Christopher Stevens and\nthree other United States citizens lost their lives, just\nas we condemn any act of terrorism that is an assault\non civilization, culture, religion and justice anywhere\nin the world.\nWe welcome the recent positive developments with\nregard to the relationship between China/Taiwan and\nthe People\u2019s Republic of China. We have to address the\nlegitimate aspirations of Taiwan to participate more\nbroadly in all United Nations specialized agencies and\norgans.\nWe reaffirm our commitment to total and complete\ndisarmament and international security. A world free\nof nuclear arms and weapons of mass destruction is\nindispensable.\nOn a different matter, Central America is a transit\nzone for the drugs produced in the South and that find in\nthe North, in the United States, their largest consumer\nmarket and the largest money-laundering operation for\nthe traffic in drugs. Central America has expressed\nthe need for destination countries to eradicate drug\ntrafficking and consumption within their borders,\nusing all the technology and resources at their disposal.\nLikewise, we have agreed to demand economic support\nfor all of Central America in its constant struggle\nagainst organized crime and drug trafficking. However,\nthe slow pace or lack of commitment to that issue\ndoes irreparable damage, especially to the peoples\nof Mesoamerica, who have to allocate enormous resources for the prohibition and interception of drugs,\nconsequently delaying our social investments.\nIn that scenario, which is not very encouraging\nand in which we are far from being triumphant, Latin\nAmerica and the Caribbean are making great strides\nin strengthening their economic, political, social and\ncultural integration and unity through the Central\nAmerican Integration System, the Bolivarian Alliance\nfor the Peoples of Our America and the Community of\nLatin American and Caribbean States. Our regional\nprocess of integration and unity through the Central\nAmerican Integration System advances consistently and\non solid ground, based on the common objectives that\nfurther the peace and economic and social development\nof Central Americans. Our model for integration and\nunity is also evident in the Bolivarian Alliance for the\nPeoples of Our America, which has a component of\nfair trade, complementarity, cooperation and solidarity\namong its members. Another expression of this process\nis the Community of Latin American and Caribbean\nStates, which was established in 2011 and is convincing\nproof of our integrationist calling.\nThe principles and purposes of the Movement of\nNon-Aligned Countries constitute a broad common\nplatform, which has world reach and is contributing\nto the development of a multipolar world and to the\nstrengthening of peace and international security. In\nthat context, our Government of national reconciliation\nand unity, presided over by Comandante Daniel Ortega\nSaavedra, and our people are achieving important\nresults in the struggle against poverty. That strengthens\nthe process of restoring rights, which translates into\nmore health, better education, more productive and\nservice-oriented infrastructure, and a higher living\nstandard for all our citizens.\nVery soon we will have transformed our energy\nmatrix, using sources of renewable energy, so that by\n2017, 94 per cent of energy consumed will be renewable\nenergy. We have decided to take the necessary steps for\nthe construction of the great inter-ocean canal through\nNicaragua for ships weighing more than 250,000 tons.\nClimate change and all its related effects constitute\none of the most formidable challenges of our time. The\ndeveloped countries should comply with their legally\nbinding environmental commitments. The valuable\nnatural resources of our planet must not be privatized\nin favour of a few. Furthermore, in times of crisis, we can see that\nwe run the risk of not reaching all of the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals that we proposed to reach by 2015.\nWe cannot allow that to happen. The commitments\nof the developed countries to allocate 0.7 per cent of\ntheir gross national product to official development\nassistance must be honoured.\nAnother grave problem is that of food insecurity.\nThe food crisis is a serious obstacle in the struggle\nagainst poverty and hunger. We must work together\nto universally restore that right to the peoples. Our\nsocieties are struggling with the urgency of satisfying\ntheir most basic needs, with equitable profits from the\nbenefits of development and with the importance of\ndeveloping democracies based on representation and\ndirect participation of the citizens. That is a road whose\nspecificities must be respected without interference of\nany kind.\nDangers lurk and have resulted in events that do not\ncontribute to our political stability. Coups d\u2019\u00e9tat, such\nas those attempted in Venezuela, Bolivia and Ecuador\nor those carried out in Honduras and Paraguay, must\nbe condemned and rejected, regardless of how they are\nexecuted or attempted. We cannot allow coups to once\nagain become entrenched as methods for a political\nsolution to conflicts, whether within any country or\nbetween States.\nWe cannot ignore that the process of concentration\nof global power has repercussions in the political\nand social systems governing our societies. The\nfinal blow is intended to destroy or break up popular\nsocial movements in order to eliminate States and\nGovernments that do not align themselves with the\nneoliberal model. Therefore, in the progressive or\nrevolutionary national projects manifested through\nthe nation States of our Latin and Caribbean America,\nour citizens, our peoples, are called to resist and to\nraise banners of peace, dignity, identity and national\nsovereignty.\nWe are constructing a new world governance with\nour work to transform international institutions. We are\nstrengthening a new world governance by incorporating\nmore and more citizens in the work of building this new\nworld to which we aspire. The present global order and\nits institutions are at an impasse. The only headway\nbeing made is through the new effort I am describing\nto deeply transform the economy, politics, society and\nculture. That effort alone will endure as the fruit of the best of our human nature and our history. The other\nworld, the world that refuses change, the world of war\nand human misery, the world of the apocalypse being\nannounced on television as a novelty, will fail. The\nhope and the future for which we struggle will grow\nand shine on its remains.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAt the outset, I wish\nto convey thanks and appreciation to the Secretary-\nGeneral for his true commitment to the fulfilment of\nthe purposes and principles of the United Nations. The United Nations and its General Assembly are a\nunique tool, the one and only global forum that provides\nroom for dialogue to discuss strategic visions and to\nseek policy-level solutions to the problems that we are\njointly confronted with at the international, regional\nand national levels. It is our obligation and moral duty\nto search together for ways of bringing peace and\nprosperity to all humankind. Conflicts do not stop at\nborders. The world we live in is so interconnected that\nevery problem is a problem for all of us and every threat\nis a threat faced by all. At the same time, every success\nis of benefit to all of us.\nBesides numerous indisputable benefits, the\nprocess of globalization introduces new challenges. I\nwill mention just three challenges encountered in the\nearly twenty-first century: the global economic crisis,\nenvironmental change and man-made threats, including\nterrorism and weapons of mass destruction. We need\nglobal partnership and cooperation. We need strong\nmultilateralism. We need a proactive United Nations that\ncan lead effectively on all fronts: political, economic,\nmilitary, social and civil. We need a trustworthy United\nNations that people can rely upon to save them from the\nscourge of war. We need to work together towards our\ncommon goal: peace, security and dignity for all.\nThe Organization\u2019s primary objective is to preserve\npeace and security in the world. We have been through\nan extremely challenging year full of unexpected twists\nand turns, including some severe new conflicts, grave\nviolations of human rights, disease, famine, terrorism\nand extremism, as well as other threats to peace and\nsecurity, which, unfortunately, we cannot always\nsuccessfully prevent. Attacks have even occurred\nagainst diplomats and diplomatic missions, which we\nresolutely condemn as totally unacceptable.\nIt is the way we go about resolving constantly\noccurring conflicts and the effectiveness of our\nresponses to new threats that tells us how successful\nwe are in meeting the objectives of the United Nations.\nViolence can never be the right way to settle a dispute.\nOpen dialogue, respect for mutual differences and a\njoint search for solutions by peaceful means is the only\nway to proceed; there is no alternative. Therefore, we\nappreciate the appeal to concentrate specifically on\nthat crucial aspect of international relations. We are\nall obliged under the Charter of the United Nations to\nresolve disputes by peaceful means so that peace and\nsecurity are not at risk.\n\nThe Charter provides us with a range of options,\nincluding negotiation, enquiry, mediation, conciliation,\narbitration and other peaceful means, which must\nbe used effectively. Mediation under the auspices\nof the United Nations is key to resolving conflicts\nby peaceful means. Reinforcing United Nations\nmediation capacities, confidence-building, improved\nimplementation of the Charter and enhanced respect for\nits provisions are central.\nWhile the nature of conflicts evolves and changes,\ntheir essence remains the same \u2014 achieving goals by\nviolence. I refer not just to military battles. Famine\nand thirst have even more devastating consequences\nthan weapons. Unfair distribution of wealth, social\nimbalances, poverty and the feeling of injustice remain\nbreeding grounds for conflicts and disputes. Persons\nwhose basic needs are met do not seek conflict; rather,\nthey seek ways of making the best of their lives. In that\ncontext, I think that prevention is the most effective\ntool for ensuring peace, sustainable growth and a life\nof dignity.\nIt is crucial to eliminate the primary causes\nof conflicts, including through poverty reduction,\nsustainable development, respect for human rights, the\nrule of law and respect for its instruments, building of\ndemocratic institutions, and arms control. Those are\nthe basic building blocks of peace and prosperity. The\nUnited Nations, with its multipurpose focus, possesses\nthe potential to effectively assist its Members in all\nthose areas. But it must be adequately empowered to\ndo so.\nHowever, we still differ considerably on what the\nUnited Nations should do, and how. Terrorism poses an\nimminent threat to every one of us, yet we are unable\nto find common grounds to describe its characteristics.\nClimate change has brought about crucial changes with\nconcrete impacts on agricultural production, yet the\nproduction of greenhouse gases and emissions does\nnot decline. The gap between the wealthy and the poor\nhas been growing. An increasingly important role is\nbeing played by non-State actors \u2014 multinational\ncorporations and speculative investors.\nThe crisis has shown that even the strongest\neconomies are vulnerable. They are vulnerable when\nthey live on credit, when the moral hazard goes beyond\nwhat is sustainable. The crisis has shown that peace\nhas its limits in every society, whether that society is\nmore or less advanced. It is important for the global\neconomy that the strongest economies are stable and, in particular, that they are aware of their responsibility\nfor global development and the sustainability of\nsocial stability in the world. This is not only about the\napplication of the principle of social solidarity; it is\nabout the self-preservation of humankind.\nWe therefore have to pursue a common target:\nto transform the United Nations into an effective\nOrganization with a leading role in a new international\nenvironment. We need a political willingness on the\npart of all Members and a clear vision to adapt the\nUnited Nations to the global demands of the twenty-\nfirst century.\nOne of the instruments for preventing conflicts is\nthe elimination of poverty and ensuring sustainable\ndevelopment for all, and in all aspects. The United\nNations has the necessary tools in its hands. At a time\nof fiscal constraints, we have to use the existing tools\nmore effectively. We do not need to create new parallel\nor duplicate structures.\nAt the United Nations Conference on Sustainable\nDevelopment (Rio+20), we agreed that we needed an\ninclusive, strong multilateral system that will be able\nto effectively address threats in the area of sustainable\ndevelopment. Such a system is crucial for enduring\npeace and, of course, for security.\nWe support Sustainable Energy for All, an\ninitiative launched by the Secretary-General. In the\nspirit of the initiative, we emphasize, among other\nthings, the positive aspects of the use of nuclear energy\nin the energy and health care sectors. I am convinced\nthat priority investments in research to increase the\noperational safety and security of nuclear power plants\nwould be more useful than massive investment in the\nclosure of functioning power plants.\nSlovakia is prepared to intensively and constructively\ncooperate with partners in order to maximize the\neffective functioning of the United Nations system in\nthe economic, social, environmental and other areas.\nWe support strengthening the Economic and Social\nCouncil and more effective cooperation of the Council\nwith the General Assembly and other entities across the\nUnited Nations system.\nSlovakia takes seriously its moral duty to help\ndeveloping countries and countries in distress. We have\nless than three years to go to accomplish the United\nNations Millennium Development Goals. We need\nto step up our efforts. As a donor country, Slovakia\ncontributes its share to addressing the pressing problems of global development. Despite its tight budget, Slovakia\nincreases its total contribution to official development\nassistance every year.\nA secure and stable environment conducive to\ndevelopment cannot be achieved without effective arms\ncontrol and universal disarmament as the fundamental\ninstruments of conflict prevention. Slovakia is an\nadvocate of a comprehensive, universal and binding\narms trade treaty. Our objective is to curb irresponsible\ndealing in arms and to prevent their transfer to the hands\nof terrorists, criminals and other illicit groups. I regret\nthat the years-long efforts of States, in cooperation with\ncivil society, were not crowned with success at the July\n2012 Conference on the Arms Trade Treaty. I believe\nthat further negotiations will lead to a consensus on an\neffective agreement.\nA world free of nuclear weapons is one of the\npriorities long pursued by the international community.\nAlthough we have made some progress in this respect\nin recent years, there are still countries that are not\nparties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\nWeapons.\nWe appreciate that a conference on a Middle East\nzone free of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass\ndestruction has been scheduled for December 2012 in\nHelsinki. We believe that despite the regrettable turmoil\nin the region and the unwillingness of some countries to\ncooperate, we will overcome the differences and jointly\nbring the conference to a successful conclusion, for the\nsake of our common goal, namely, peace and security\nin the Middle East without the fear of nuclear weapons.\nSuccess of the conference would also support long-\nlasting efforts to drive away concerns over the Iranian\nnuclear programme. Rocket tests performed by Iran\ndo not contribute to belief that its nuclear programme\nserves a peaceful purpose.\nWith regard to further improvements in the\nwork of peacebuilding missions and increasing their\neffectiveness, I would like to mention three aspects\nthat I consider crucial: first, cooperation among United\nNations missions; secondly, the protection of civilians\nand the contributions to monitoring human rights; and,\nthirdly, the need to prepare a strategy for the transition\nfrom peacekeeping to peacebuilding, that is, increased\neffectiveness in the implementation of security\nsector reform. More intensive cooperation among\npeacekeeping missions will allow for effective sharing of\nfunds, equipment and personnel between neighbouring\nmissions, as well as contribute to improving the\ncapabilities of United Nations peacekeeping forces\nto adequately respond to unforeseen situations. The\nprotection of civilians is one of the main objectives\nunder the mandates of peacekeeping operations. It will\nenable the restoration of political processes in a country,\nincluding the implementation of measures aimed at\nthe disarmament, demobilization and reintegration of\ncombatants, as well as of ordinary people affected by the\nconflict, including children. As the road from conflict\nto enduring peace is complicated, it is important that\nwe prepare strategies for the peacekeeping forces to\nanticipate and transfer responsibility for peacekeeping\nin a host country with the aim of eliminating duplicate\ninstruments and procedures.\nLast year, the international community devoted\nconsiderable attention and funds to support Afghanistan\non its road towards responsibility for its own security\nand for meeting its obligations. Afghanistan remains\nthe top-priority foreign military operation for Slovakia.\nOur troops will stay in Afghanistan as long as necessary.\nSecurity and stability also depend on a stable\neconomy. Therefore we also wish to intensify our\ninvolvement in the area of development assistance.\nAfghanistan remains one of the three primary recipients\nof Slovakia\u2019s official development assistance. At the\nsame time, we support the central role of the United\nNations and the United Nations Assistance Mission in\nAfghanistan in capacity-building and stabilization in\nAfghanistan. Wherever in the world human lives are at\nrisk, the international community should be prepared\nto take resolute action.\nAllow me to express my deepest regret over the\nthousands of victims of the conflict in Syria. The Slovak\nRepublic has joined the initiative requesting that the\nmost serious crimes under international law committed\nin Syria be investigated by the International Criminal\nCourt. The primary responsibility for the protection\nof its citizens is always borne by the Government and\ndemocratic institutions of a country. The aim is to\nbuild a country governed by the rule of law, respecting\ninternational principles and at the same time reflecting\ntraditional common law.\nSlovakia is committed to the United Nations\nprinciples set out in the Charter. We believe that the key\nto resolving global problems in today\u2019s interconnected\nworld is an inclusive and effective multilateralism.\nGlobal threats to security, the economy, the environment or society know no borders and are so extensive that no\ncountry and no regional organization can alone respond\nto or defend against them effectively.\nWe believe that, together, we will make progress\non our agenda during the current session of the General\nAssembly. That is what our citizens expect from us."

        "file_text": "\ufeffPapua New Guinea\ncongratulates Mr. Jeremi\u0107 on his recent election as\nPresident of the General Assembly at its sixty-seventh\nsession. Our country pledges its support to him in that\nrole. I also commend his predecessor, His Excellency\nMr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser, for the valuable work\nthat he has done in the past year.\nPapua New Guinea recently celebrated its 37\nyears of independence, on 16 September. Prior to that,\ndespite various challenges, our country successfully\ncompleted its general elections in a fair and peaceful\nmanner. Those elections culminated in the convening\nof our ninth National Parliament and the formation\nof a new Government. We thank our close friends\nand development partners that have assisted us in the\nelection process, including Australia, New Zealand,\nJapan, South Korea, China, the United States, Great\nBritain, the European Union, the United Nations and\nthe Commonwealth.\nAs a young developing nation, we are proud of our\nConstitution-based and evolving democracy. While our\npeople have subsisted on the island nation of Papua New\nGuinea for many centuries, our short modern history\ncontinues to be a testament to the will of our people to\nmaintain and consolidate our burgeoning democracy in\nline with the rule of law. In today\u2019s world, that is the\nbasis on which a just and fair society is built and on\nwhich societies have been built.\nPapua New Guinea\u2019s key development priorities in\nthe next five years are contained in our Medium-Term\nDevelopment Plan 2011-2015. That seeks to achieve a long-term national road map under our Vision 2050.\nWe need to strengthen our economy for it to be more\nresilient to global market shocks by diversifying\ntrade and investment and by reviewing development\ncooperation, ensuring that our people\u2019s basic needs are\nmet.\nPapua New Guinea is also increasing investment\nin our children\u2019s future, security and success by the\nprovision of free and quality education from the\nelementary to the secondary level and by further\nsubsidizing education from Grade 12 to the tertiary\nlevel. We believe that that will help us to achieve\nMillennium Development Goal 2 on universal primary\neducation, which will enhance our nation-building\nprocess.\nWe are also rehabilitating and developing our major\ninfrastructure, such as roads, airports, ports, schools\nand hospitals, as key drivers of sustainable development\nin our country. We are increasing support for funding\nto ensure the delivery of basic health-care and social\nservices countrywide. That includes the revitalization\nof our institutional and human resources capacity to\ntake the country to a higher development level, which\nis our national development priority.\nOur Government has prioritized combating\ncorruption at all levels of society. In doing so, we have\nadopted the principle of zero tolerance. In that respect,\nour country is setting up the Independent Commission\nagainst Corruption to enhance implementation of the\nUnited Nations Convention against Corruption. We\nbelieve that such legislation and policy efforts will\nimprove good governance, resulting in the effective\ndelivery of basic services and the provision of access to\nopportunities for participation in national development\nby all relevant stakeholders.\nThe economy of Papua New Guinea is growing at\nan annual rate of 8 per cent. Our improved economic\nperformance is underscored by political stability, sound\nmacroeconomic management and the development of\nthe first large liquefied natural gas project. The revenue\nfrom that project is likely to increase the growth of our\neconomy, doubling the revenue base by 2014. We intend\nto share that wealth with our Pacific neighbours in the\nappropriate manner. In that context, a sovereign wealth\nfund has been set up to professionally manage the\nrevenue from the liquefied natural gas project and other\nextractive industries. We plan to reinvest that revenue\nfor the future of our country.\n\nWe believe that a strengthened economy will\nimprove our social indicators, particularly by\naddressing our literacy levels, high maternal and infant\nmortality rates, law and order enforcement, the ageing\npublic sector workforce and the declining state of our\ncountry\u2019s infrastructure.\nPapua New Guinea supports the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s five-year action agenda on sustainable\ndevelopment, enhanced human security, enhancing the\ncore values of the international community, supporting\nnations in transition, and working with and for women\nand young people, which was launched on 25 January.\nPapua New Guinea continues to benefit from a strong\nUnited Nations presence, through which various\ndevelopment programmes have been implemented. We\nhighly value the contribution of the United Nations in\nthat regard.\nWe have also been implementing the One United\nNations initiative since 2006 as a self-starter country.\nSo far, that is working exceptionally well for our\ncountry. We are also grateful that the United Nations\nhas heeded our call and has synergized its development\nassistance framework 2012-2015 with our Medium-\nTerm Development Plan. However, we can do more. We\nurge donor partners to abide by the principles of the\nParis Declaration on Aid Effectiveness and the Accra\nAgenda for Action. Through the Pacific Islands Forum,\nwe have adapted the Cairns Compact in order to better\ncoordinate development assistance and to ensure the\neffective delivery of aid.\nWe welcome the proactive engagement of the United\nNations with the Pacific region and thank the Secretary-\nGeneral for his visit and ongoing commitment. We\nare encouraged by that and by the fact that contacts\nwith the United Nations system and personnel will be\nstrengthened in the Pacific Islands region.\nThe challenge for Papua New Guinea is to ensure that\nthe development of our natural resources is sustainable\nand that the benefits are effectively translated into the\nimproved livelihoods of our people. That, in turn, will\nassist us in meeting our Millennium Development Goals\n(MDGs), especially the 22 indicators and 90 national\ntargets that we have set ourselves. We acknowledge\nthat it will be a challenge to attain all the MDGs by\n2015, but note there has been measured progress in\nthe eradication of extreme poverty and hunger, which\nis MDG 1, and the reduction of child mortality, which is MDG 4. So for our part, our country is taking full\nownership of the MDGs.\nWith the support of our development partners such\nas the European Union and the United Nations, Papua\nNew Guinea is conducting a trial of the Millennium\nVillage concept this month. We recommit ourselves\nto working with our international partners, including\nthe United Nations, and we reiterate that the MDGs\nneed to be the priority while we discuss sustainable\ndevelopment goals for the long term.\nPapua New Guinea continues to scale up its\nefforts to further strengthen human rights protection\nand advancement in the country. We are working\nclosely with United Nations agencies and our other\ndevelopment partners in the furtherance of these\nobjectives. To date, we have reported to the Human\nRights Council on work done relating to the Convention\non the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination\nagainst Women in July 2010. We have also reported to\nthe Human Rights Council under the universal periodic\nreview process. Additionally, the 2012 report of the\nSpecial Rapporteur on violence against women, its\ncauses and consequences (A/HRC/20/16) and the 2010\nreport of the Special Rapporteur on torture and other\ncruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment\nare being considered by our Government this year.\nPapua New Guinea is committed to gender\nempowerment and equality. We recognize women and\ngirls as not only key national development partners\nbut also persons whose inherent human dignity must\nbe respected and safeguarded. This is a central pillar\nof our Constitution and a core value of our national\ndevelopment road map. A testament to the success of\nthis measure is that more girls are enrolling in primary\nand upper levels of education with an increasingly high\nretention rate. Women are also increasingly employed,\nrecognized and given greater responsibilities in\nour public and private sectors. In fact, we achieved\na historical milestone this year, and one which is\nunprecedented in our political history, in that, for the\nfirst time, three women were elected to the national\nparliament. This positive trend is increasing in our\ncountry at all levels.\nWe also recognize the critical importance of\nprotecting our women and girls from violence and\ndiscrimination. Papua New Guinea is taking a\nproactive approach through education, advocacy\nand legislation to prevent gender-based violence. We have made violence against women and girls a crime\npunishable by law. Partnership with all stakeholders,\nincluding our development partners and civil society,\nforms an important part of the gender empowerment\nand equality issues in our country. In this context, we\ncommend the funding, substantially from the Australian\nGovernment, that was announced at the margins of the\nPacific Islands Forum in Rarotonga in August 2012, as\nwell as that from other development partners, including\nNew Zealand, the United Nations and the United States\nof America.\nHaving acceded to the Convention on the Rights of\nPersons with Disabilities, Papua New Guinea is now in\nthe process of ratifying the Convention. Our country is\nworking with our Pacific Islands Forum member States\nto host the Pacific Islands Forum Disability Ministers\nMeeting on 3 and 4 October 2012 in Port Moresby.\nWe are also working towards setting up an\nindependent national human rights commission and, at\nthe same time, we are in the process of withdrawing\nthe seven reservations on the 1951 Convention relating\nto the Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol. In this\ncontext, we are partnering with Australia to address\nhuman trafficking and human smuggling issues in our\nregion.\nThe theme that was chosen for the High-level\nMeeting during this session, the rule of law at the\nnational and international levels, is timely and\ncommendable. Papua New Guinea fully subscribes, as I\nhave said, to the principles of the rule of law.\nPapua New Guinea also fully subscribes to\ndisarmament and non-proliferation to secure a peaceful\nworld. We urge nuclear nations to denuclearize and\nthose thinking of going nuclear to refrain from doing\nso. The Pacific region remains a nuclear-free zone, and\nwe urge other Member States that have yet to sign and ratify the Rarotonga Treaty, which prohibits nuclear\nweapons in the region, to do so.\nWe remain concerned about the continued\nproliferation of small arms and light weapons. In\nthis context, we call for the recent impasse on the\nnegotiations on a global arms trade treaty to be ended\nas soon as possible.\nPapua New Guinea supports the Group of Seven\nPlus forum for its efforts to strengthen peacebuilding\nand State-building in fragile and post-conflict countries\nand commend Timor-Leste for their leadership. As part\nof our national commitment to fostering global peace\nand security, Papua New Guinea has commenced its\ncontribution to the United Nations peacekeeping force\nand is looking to expand that contribution.\nWe remain committed to the United Nations\nsustainable development agenda, especially on climate\nchange, with respect to mitigation and adaptation.\nWe are committed to working closely with the global\ncommunity under the United Nations Framework\nConvention on Climate Change and subscribe to the\nRio+20 outcome declaration, \u201cThe future we want\u201d\n(resolution 66/288, annex).\nPapua New Guinea recognizes the pivotal role\nof the Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI) for\nsustainable development. As a founding member of\nGGGI, Papua New Guinea pledges to work together\nwith other stakeholders to ensure the desired outcomes\nthrough the Institute. In this context, we pay tribute to\nthe work that has been done by the Republic of Korea.\nIn conclusion, we support the call made by the\nSecretary-General for the reform of the United Nations\nsystem. We also again call for the reform of the Security\nCouncil in both the permanent and the non-permanent\ncategories of members, in order for it to reflect the\ngeopolitical realities of today."

        "file_text": "\ufeffOn behalf of the Prime\nMinister and the people of Fiji, I congratulate the\nPresident on his election and have full confidence in\nhis guidance of the sixty-seventh session of the General\nAssembly. I wish also to pay tribute to the tireless efforts of his predecessor, Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser,\nthrough what has been an eventful and turbulent year\nfor the global community of nations.\nThe world is facing many challenges that demand\nour attention and collective action. As we all gathered\nlast June in Rio de Janeiro for the United Nations\nConference on Sustainable Development, millions\nof people were recovering from, or living through,\nnatural disasters. In Fiji, we experienced our worst\nf looding on record during the months of January and\nApril. Beyond the human cost, the economic damage\nto infrastructure, schools, businesses, agriculture and\ntourism \u2014 a sector that generates 33 per cent of Fiji\u2019s\ngross domestic product \u2014 was immense, and we still\nhave not fully recovered. Our f loods were by no means\nthe world\u2019s worst climatic disaster of the year; other\npeoples suffered much worse. But as a people who live\non a group of small islands in the South Pacific, we feel\nparticularly vulnerable.\nThe ongoing failure of the international community\nto seriously address climate change means that we will\nall see more frequent and more intense weather events.\nThose will erode our development gains and leave our\npeople feeling poorer and less secure, so it is clear that\nit is indispensable to incorporate disaster risk reduction\ninto global and national development strategies.\nThe post-2015 development agenda is now under\ndiscussion, and frameworks and modalities are being\ndeveloped. However, our job with the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) is not complete. As a\nglobal community of nations that has committed to\nthose goals, we must give meaningful support to all\nthose States lagging in their progress. We must also\nensure that a post-2015 development agenda does not\nsimply delay the target date for the MDG indicators\nand goals. The development community can do much\nmore, including meeting our agreed objectives for\ndevelopment funding.\nFiji has embarked on a comprehensive reform\nprogramme not only to promote development, but also\nto improve the lives of our people. We have embraced\nthe Millennium Development Goals as they were\nintended \u2014 to provide specific objective standards for\nimproving the lives of our people. We are the second\ncountry in the world to introduce the pneumococcal\nand rotavirus immunizations as standard, with a view\nto minimizing child mortality. That represents progress\ntowards meeting MDGs 4 and 5.\n\nBut the reward is not in meeting the goals; the\nreward is in children who are healthier, families that are\nless burdened, and generations given a better chance to\nbecome productive adults. We must never forget that\nbehind each of those Millennium Development Goals\nare human beings \u2014 the citizens of our nations \u2014 who\nlook to us to provide opportunities for a fuller life. We\nstill have work to do particularly in meeting MDGs 1,\n3 and 6, and we are working on those as best we can.\nThe particular case of small island developing States\nin meeting those goals and their specific challenges\nwill be addressed by the third Global Conference on the\nSustainable Development of Small Island Developing\nStates, to be held in the Pacific region in 2014. The\nsuccess of the Conference will be measured in actions,\nnot simply in more words. Substantive preparations\nfor the Conference must therefore be oriented towards\ntaking action and achieving specific goals.\nIn addition to support for regional development,\nFiji is also taking the lead in the region on broadband\nconnectivity. It is clear to us that broadband is\nan essential technology for improving education,\nmedicine, agriculture and environmental services.\nBroadband technology is especially important to us\nbecause it will help unite a dispersed people and help\ndraw us closer to our island neighbours in the Pacific.\nIf we take care to make it accessible, affordable and\nunderstandable, we will bring an entire universe of\nwisdom and understanding to the smallest schools and\nremotest villages. Information need no longer be the\nproperty mostly of people who live in the cities or who\nare attached to large institutions.\nLike all islands nations, Fiji relies on the ocean and\nits resources as our economic lifeblood and source of\nsustainable development. While fish and other living\nmarine resources have been vital to Fiji\u2019s economy\nand livelihood, we believe that our efforts to explore\ndeep-sea mineral resources have greater potential,\nprovided that a precautionary approach with regard to\nenvironmental sustainability is ensured.\nThe theme selected by the President for this\nyear\u2019s general debate, \u201cBringing about adjustment or\nsettlement of international disputes or situations by\npeaceful means\u201d, is most relevant in these times of\nturbulence across the world. The United Nations must\ncontinue to be at the vanguard of international peace\nand security. It must be able to respond to new types\nof crises, always with an aim to stabilize the places it enters and leave behind not just a state of peace and\nstability, but also an environment that fosters freedom\nand opportunity for the people.\nIn that context, Fiji continues to play a role in\npeacekeeping missions around the world that is far\nbeyond what is expected of a country of our size\nand level of development. We contribute troops and\npolice personnel to operations in Iraq, Liberia, South\nSudan, Darfur and Timor-Leste. Fiji has responded to\nexigent requests by the Department of Peacekeeping\nOperations, above and beyond agreed contributions,\nto ensure that peacekeeping operations in Iraq can\ncontinue unhindered, despite the additional burden it\nhas placed on our troops operating far from home and\nfor longer than envisaged. We believe that all nations\nmust find ways to make the world safer, more humane\nand more livable, and as a people we are proud that we\ncan make that contribution to global peace and security\nand to the lives of citizens far away from us. That is\nnot just Government policy; it is a calling that is deeply\nembraced by the Fijian people.\nRecognizing the role that peacekeeping missions\nwith expanded mandates play in helping to build the\nfoundations of a sustainable future, Fiji has in the past\nyear also started to contribute in a small yet meaningful\nway to the corrections and justice sector of peacekeeping\nmissions. Mentoring and strengthening corrections and\njustice institutions is part of the process of allowing\npost-conflict societies to take control of their own\ndestinies, and Fiji is pleased to be able to be a part of\nthose unfolding stories around the world.\nFiji has been honoured to be a part of that process\nin our own region through our contributions in Timor-\nLeste via the United Nations Integrated Mission in\nTimor-Leste (UNMIT). Following the successful\nelections in Timor-Leste early this year, UNMIT will be\nin a position to wind down its operations later this year,\nallowing the Timorese people to take full ownership\nand control of their own destinies. Timor-Leste is now\nan observer to the regional organization of which Fiji is\nthe current Chair, the Melanesian Spearhead Group, and\nwe trust that through that organization and the United\nNations we will have many years of collaboration ahead.\nIn the spirit of supporting self-determination,\nFiji continues to work through the Decolonization\nCommittee of the United Nations to ensure that New\nCaledonia\u2019s right to self-determination, as expressed in\nthe Noumea Accord, is implemented faithfully by all parties. Fiji works through the Melanesian Spearhead\nGroup in monitoring the progress of implementation\nof the Noumea Accord. Additionally, at the Engaging\nwith the Pacific Meetings held in Fiji in 2011 and 2012,\nPacific island leaders committed to supporting the\ninalienable right of the people of Ma\u2019ohi Nui/French\nPolynesia to self-determination. We look forward to\nworking through the United Nations processes and with\nall relevant partners in order to have the question of\nMa\u2019ohi Nui\u2019s self-determination placed on the United\nNations agenda again.\nFiji is itself working through a period of reform and\ntransition. We are building a sustainable democracy\nfounded on the principle of \u201cone person, one vote, one\nvalue\u201d. Elections will be held under a new constitution\nand electoral system no later than September 2014.\nThose elections will see the citizens of Fiji go to the\npolls without regard to their race for the first time in\nour nation\u2019s history. Fiji\u2019s new constitution will be\nbased on some unassailable democratic principles: a\nsecular State that recognizes our multi-faith society;\na common national identity in which all citizens, not\njust indigenous people, will call themselves Fijians for\nthe first time; a war against corruption, which inhibits\nthe country\u2019s development; an independent judiciary\nto uphold the rights of every Fijian; social justice and\nthe elimination of all forms of discrimination, so that\nevery Fijian is treated equally; good and transparent\ngovernance; and lowering the voting age to 18 to give\nour young people a voice.\nWe set up an independent Constitutional\nCommission in March to draft a new constitution\nguided by those principles. It will be a constitution\nof and for the people. Ordinary Fijians are seizing\nthe opportunity to put forward their views at public\nhearings throughout the country and to voice the issues\nthat are most important to them. The Commission\u2019s\nrecommendations will be reviewed by a Constituent\nAssembly in early 2013. This body, made up of a broad\ncross-section of Fijian society, will formulate the final\ndocument through public discussion and debate. That\nwill set the scene for elections in 2014, for which\npreparations have already begun. Through a process of\nelectronic registration carried out in July and August\nof this year, almost half a million Fijians have so far\nregistered to vote.\nThroughout this process, we have stayed true to\nthe principle that we in Fiji must determine our own\ndestiny, one that is inclusive and fair to all citizens. We are taking the time necessary to get it right. We\nhave endured criticism and a degree of isolation at the\nhands of some of our traditional friends among the\nworld\u2019s democracies. By now, those countries have\nbegun to recognize that we are serious about building a\nsustainable democracy that is racially blind, that offers\nequal opportunity, and that protects all citizens from\nthe tyranny of the majority. We need the support of the\nworld\u2019s democracies, and we invite them to work with us\nin our quest to establish the kind of democratic system\nthat they enjoy. After 40 years of strife and instability,\nthe work of true and sustainable democracy is just\nbeginning, and we ask the international community to\nsupport us.\nWe have examined and redefined our world view\nto help forge productive, friendly relationships with\nall nations of goodwill. In 2011, Fiji opened three\nnew embassies in Brazil, Indonesia and South Africa.\nWe have expanded our diplomatic presence this year\nby opening embassies in the Republic of Korea and\nthe United Arab Emirates. We want to learn more, to\nexchange more, to develop more, to trade more, and\ncertainly to contribute more through active and robust\nengagement with other nations.\nIn the United Nations, Fiji pledges to work in the\nmost constructive manner possible, and to respect the\nideals of the United Nations Charter. That includes the\nInternational Labour Organization (ILO), with which\nwe are engaged at the present moment. The Fijian\nGovernment\u2019s commitment to a future of equality and\nopportunity for all Fijians includes ensuring that the\nrights of working people are protected and extended.\nThe Constitutional Commission has received\nsubmissions from all sectors of Fijian society, including\ntrade unions and public employees. We expect the new\nconstitution to help us continue to build an environment\nthat promotes safe working conditions, protects\nworkers from arbitrary actions, and allows workers to\nform unions. We seek to ensure that unions can take\ncollective action, as directed by their member workers,\nand are subject only to restrictions that are generally\naccepted as protecting the public good. We also seek to\nprotect the rights of those workers who choose not to\naffiliate with unions.\nThe Fijian Government is committed to protecting\nworkers who are fortunate enough to have jobs and\nto ensuring that all workers receive fair wages.\nWe are equally committed to creating employment opportunities for the young and less aff luent. As part\nof Fiji\u2019s progress in reform towards democracy, we\nare reviewing our current labour laws to ensure their\ncompliance with the 34 ILO conventions that Fiji has\nratified. The tripartite Employment Relations Advisory\nBoard is a key participant in this process. This year\nalone, Fiji has ratified or adopted eight ILO instruments,\nas recommended by the tripartite Board, including the\n2006 Maritime Labour Convention.\nBy empowering Fijians, the Government is\nseeking to ensure that all citizens, regardless of ethnic\nbackground, are on a level playing field and in possession\nof the tools needed to compete with their peers in the\nglobal community, improve their livelihoods and fulfil\ntheir dreams. By modernizing Fiji, the Government is\nseeking to make the country and its institutions and\nlegal system strong, independent and world-class.\nFiji may be a relatively small country, but it has\nbig aspirations. They include being a good global\ncitizen, a leader by example among island nations,\nand an actively engaged member of the international\ncommunity. In the spirit of constructive contribution\nto the global community and the United Nations, I\nam pleased to say that at today\u2019s ministerial meeting\nof the Group of 77 and China, Fiji was endorsed as\nthe Chair of the Group for the year 2013. Fiji takes\non this responsibility with a deep sense of humility, a\nwillingness to work collaboratively with all States, and\na commitment to addressing the inequalities that exist\nbetween developing and developed countries.\nAs we look forward to a productive sixty-seventh\nsession of the General Assembly, we reiterate our full\nsupport for and cooperation with the President and all\nMembers, with a view to advancing the objectives of\nthis body and the aspirations of the global community."

It\nis indeed a pleasure for me to participate in the general\ndebate under his presidency. Similarly, I congratulate his\npredecessor and commend him on the manner in which\nhe steered the work of the sixty-sixth session. It would\nbe remiss of me not to acknowledge and commend the\nSecretary-General and the entire Secretariat on their\nservice to the Organization.\nEchoing the President\u2019s words during the opening\nof the session, we meet here amid upheavals of\nunprecedented scope, characterized by multiple intra-\nand inter-State conflicts in the world and a time of\nemerging and worsening conflicts, most of which\nare taking place in Africa and the Middle East (see\nA/67/PV.1). Those conflicts have caused the deaths\nand suffering of millions of people, including children,\nwomen and the elderly. Undoubtedly, a new world order\nof lasting peace, security and freedom, as envisaged in\nthe United Nations Charter, can be achieved through\ndialogue and reconciliation.\nWe applaud the fact that the theme of this general\ndebate is \u201cAdjustment or settlement of international\ndisputes or situations by peaceful means\u201d. Similarly,\nwe welcome the many initiatives undertaken at the\nnational, regional and international levels in promoting\nthat matter.\nDuring the 50 years of the independence of the\nUnited Republic of Tanzania, we have witnessed and\nrespected the effectiveness of preventive diplomacy. We\nhave participated in various mediation processes in the\nregion and on the continent, such as in Burundi, C\u00f4te\nd\u2019Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya\nand Madagascar. The involvement of former Presidents\nof Tanzania the late Mwalimu Julius Kambarage\nNyerere and Benjamin William Mkapa, as well as\nHis Excellency Jakaya Mrisho Kikwete, President of\nthe United Republic of Tanzania, in those processes\nis a clear testimony of our continued commitment to\npreventive diplomacy.\nWe are all too aware of the dire consequences\nof conflict, particularly when all the mechanisms\nprovided for under the Charter of the United Nations\nto resolve conflicts fail to find a permanent solution\nand to ensure lasting peace. The situation in Syria is\na case in point. It is important that we find ways to strengthen early-warning mechanisms and to prevent\nconflicts before they occur. In no case should we\npursue actions that would encourage parties in conflict\nto resort to armed solutions instead of dialogue. While\nfacilitating dialogue, it is also important that we uphold\nthe principles of impartiality, objectivity and respect for\ninternational law. The unity of the entire membership is\ncrucial in ending impunity and human rights violations,\nwherever they occur.\nThe pacific settlement of disputes as provided under\nChapter VI of the Charter of the United Nations has\nnever been so pertinent. In the interest of maintaining\npeace and security, we should learn to keep our\ndifferences aside and not allow them to create divisions\namong us. I believe the presidency of Mr. Vuk Jeremi\u0107\nwill guide us in that direction.\nTanzania is the current Chair of the Southern Africa\nDevelopment Community (SADC) Organ on Politics,\nDefence and Security. We have taken up the mantle of\nleadership of the Organ at a time when some countries of\nthe region face security challenges. Under the umbrella\nof SADC and the International Conference on the Great\nLakes Region of Africa, we have resolved to find a\ndurable solution to the crisis in the eastern part of the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, where rebel groups\nsuch as the Mouvement du 23 mars are destabilizing and\nthreatening the peace and security of the entire region.\nMembers of the International Conference on the Great\nLakes Region have agreed to establish an international\nneutral force comprising 4,000 troops to address the\nproblem. Tanzania has committed to contribute troops\nto the neutral force. Through the African Union (AU),\nwe are taking the necessary steps to ensure that the\ndeployment of this international neutral force is done\nunder the mandate of the United Nations.\nLikewise, Tanzania will work assiduously with\nother SADC member States to support the return\nto constitutional normalcy in Madagascar and the\nfinalization of the drafting a new constitution in\nZimbabwe, which will open the way to democratic\nelections by June 2013. We proceed in that endeavour\nwith the firm belief that a solution in both countries\nwill finally be achieved through the effective and\nconstructive engagement of all parties concerned.\nTwelve years ago, in the month of September,\nwe met in this very Hall to adopt the United Nations\nMillennium Declaration (resolution 55/2), which gave\nbirth to the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).Three years from now, we will reach the deadline we\nagreed. We have undoubtedly made some progress on\nmany fronts, but most developing States are unlikely to\nachieve all the goals by the deadline of 2015.\nMy country has also made progress in the\nachievement of the MDGs. It attained Goal 2, on\nuniversal primary education, back in 2009. It has also\nregistered considerable gains on Goal 3, on promoting\ngender equality and the empowerment of women, as\nwell as on Goal 6, on combating HIV/AIDS, malaria\nand other diseases. We have also achieved moderate\nresults on MDGs 4 and 5, dealing with infant and\nmaternal mortality, respectively. However, much more\nremains to be done to emancipate our people from the\ntraps of poverty.\nOur goals to improve the livelihood of our people\nmust go beyond 2015. It is therefore necessary that we\nconsider the post-MDG agenda as one that complements,\ninstead of diverting our focus from the current MDGs.\nMy delegation proposes a second generation of MDGs,\nwhereby all our efforts are directed to ensure that\nMDGs are achieved post-2015 in those countries that\nwill not have achieved them by 2015.\nAt the sixty-sixth session of the General Assembly,\nPresident Kikwete expressed serious concern regarding\nglobal food insecurity (see A/66/PV.15). Since then,\nthe situation has worsened and the vulnerability of\nmany developing countries has increased. We must\nwork collectively to address food insecurity. We\nmust increase food production and productivity on\na sustainable basis, strengthen agricultural systems,\nand establish early-warning mechanisms, as we also\nmust develop effective responses to calamities such\nas those in the Horn of Africa and the Sahel region.\nWhile ensuring food security, we need also to address\nthe issue of nutrition. It is in that regard that Tanzania is\na proud member of the Scaling Up Nutrition movement.\nAt the national level, the Government is undertaking\nvarious initiatives to ensure food security through\npublic-private partnerships. My Government has had\nthe pleasure of hosting the Africa Green Revolution\nForum, in Arusha, which concluded today, with the\nparticipation of African leaders, ministers, private\nagribusiness firms, financial institutions, farmers,\nnon-governmental organizations and agricultural\nexperts. The Forum was organized by the Alliance for\na Green Revolution in Africa.\n\nUnited Nations reforms are long overdue. The\nUnited Nations is composed of its States Members,\nwithout which there is no United Nations. If we Member\nStates cannot agree on reforms then the United Nations\nwill never be reformed. It is a fact that we have had long\ndiscussions without reaching concrete agreements. The\ntime has come to walk the talk.\nIt is important to remind ourselves that Africa is\nthe largest regional group in the United Nations and\nthe only continent that is not represented among the\npermanent seats on the Security Council. That situation\nequally overlooks the fact that most discussions in the\nSecurity Council concern Africa. We, African leaders\nand the African Union, have voiced our sentiments\nand agreed to have two permanent seats with the veto\npower. We will continue working together based on the\nagreed Ezulwini Consensus and the Sirte Declaration,\nto which we all subscribed. I therefore appeal to Africa\nto maintain that momentum and solidarity.\nMy country will continue to support reform\nof the United Nations, including the Delivering as\nOne initiative, which has been implemented with\nconsiderable success in Tanzania since 2007. The\nGovernment will continue to support that process,\nincluding its continuation in programme countries.\nThe endorsement of that initiative by some members\nof the Assembly is a clear testimony to the value of\nthe approach. We believe that the 2012 quadrennial\ncomprehensive policy review will take into account\nthose positive achievements.\nThe United Nations is anchored in the principles\nof human rights, the rule of law, good governance and\ndemocracy. We the Member States must implement\nwhat we deliberate and agree upon, otherwise the\ncredibility of the United Nations will be at stake. The\nSecurity Council and the General Assembly have\nadopted many resolutions on Palestinian independence.\nTanzania applauds the admission of the Palestinian\nState to UNESCO. As we do so, Tanzania would like\nonce again to appeal to the major Powers and donors in\nUNESCO to review their decision to punish UNESCO\nby withdrawing their contributions. That decision\nimpacts more on developing countries, in particular\nAfrican countries, which draw on up to 65 per cent of\nUNESCO funds in education, science and culture.\nWith regard to Western Sahara, Tanzania calls\nupon the Secretary-General to continue his mediation\nefforts in bringing together the Government of Morocco and the leadership of Western Sahara to resolve the\nlongstanding crisis. In that regard, my delegation\nencourages Morocco to rejoin the AU so that together\nwe can find a durable solution on the independence of\nWestern Sahara.\nTanzania remains troubled by applications of\nunilateral sanctions and embargos imposed against\nCuba and its people. As President Kikwete said at\nthe previous session of the General Assembly (see\nA/66/PV.15), Tanzania is in full solidarity with the\npeople of Cuba in demanding the end to all unilateral\nsanctions and embargos against them.\nWe Member States have the duty and responsibility\nto make the world a better place. We should maintain the\nsanctity of humankind before our ambitions and desires.\nIn order to achieve that, we should recommit ourselves\nto and uphold the objectives and principles contained\nin the Declaration on Principles of International Law\nconcerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation among\nStates in accordance with the Charter of the United\nNations (resolution 2625 (XXV))."

        "file_text": "\ufeffUganda joins other\ndelegations in congratulating Mr. Jeremi\u0107 on his\nelection as President of this body. My delegation has full\nconfidence in his ability to steer our deliberations, and\nhe can count on our support. I also wish to commend\nMr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser for his effective\nleadership during the last session.\nThe international community has made significant\nprogress in reducing conflicts around the world over\nthe two decades since the end of the Cold War and\nthe eventual freedom of South Africa from apartheid.\nHowever, we still face challenges arising from conflicts\nthat take a heavy toll on nations and people around the\nworld. The theme for this session\u2019s debate is therefore\ntimely and pertinent. We are again seeing an increase\nin conflicts brought about by unconstitutional changes\nof Governments, disputed elections, social tensions,\nextremist ideologies and territorial or border disputes,\namong other causes. We must redouble our efforts to\nresolve conflicts and disputes through peaceful means\nand in conformity with justice and international law, as\nenshrined in the Charter of the United Nations.\nFrom Uganda\u2019s experience over the years, conflicts\nare best handled, first and foremost, by the political\nactors and citizens of the countries in question,\nfollowing democratic principles and guided by the\nprinciple of equality of all persons before the law. In\ncases where national actors for some reason cannot\nresolve the problem, then subregional organizations\nshould step in. In the case of Africa those include the East\nAfrican Community, the Intergovernmental Authority\non Development, the International Conference on the\nGreat Lakes Region (ICGLR), the Southern African\nDevelopment Community, the Economic Community\nof West African States and others. The United Nations\nand the international community would then provide\nthe necessary support to subregional and regional\ninitiatives.\nOur recent achievements in the peace processes in\nBurundi, the Sudan, South Sudan and Somalia, among\nothers, attest to the progress we can achieve by working\ntogether. The advantages of such an approach include\nthe use of local actors who have more discerning\nknowledge of the problems and those in close proximity\nand with a greater stake in getting the problems\nresolved. In addition, there is the international support and legitimacy that the United Nations provides. The\ncurrent ICGLR initiative on the situation in the east\nof the Democratic Republic of the Congo is based on\nsuch experience. We call upon the Security Council\nand the international community to give the necessary\nsupport to the decisions of the ICGLR summit held in\nKampala on 8 September. That regional initiative is\naimed at addressing the root causes of the conflict in\neastern Congo, deploying a neutral international force\nand responding to the humanitarian crisis.\nOur preference for home-grown solutions is\npremised on the realization that external influences\nor interventions do not necessarily offer sustainable\nsolutions for the resolution of conflicts. On the contrary,\nexternal interventions often contribute to a cycle of\ndestabilizing tendencies \u2014 which is why we are still\ngrappling with situations like the one in eastern Congo.\nThe African Union (AU) has shown strong political\nwill to resolve conflicts on the continent peacefully and\nto contribute to the maintenance of international peace\nand security. We call upon our partners to support the\ndispute resolution mechanisms, as well as the peace and\nsecurity efforts of the AU and subregional organizations.\nUganda\u2019s participation in and contribution to conflict\nresolution in our subregion, on the African continent\nand on the international scene are guided by that\napproach, which has proved to be largely successful in\nresolving conflicts and wars.\nRegional initiatives need to be complemented by\ninternational support, including assisting countries\nemerging from conflict to build the requisite capacities\nfor the consolidation of peace. It is also important that\nsuch support include provision of immediate post-\nconflict humanitarian assistance and material input\nfor reconstruction and development. We welcome the\ncontinuing deepening of cooperation between the United\nNations and regional and subregional organizations\nin the resolution of conflicts and the maintenance of\npeace and security. This positive trend should continue,\nand every effort should be made to avoid repeating the\nmistakes of the past.\nUganda strongly believes that conflicts that might\narise between and within countries should be resolved\nthrough dialogue among all the parties concerned. In\nthe recent past we have witnessed regrettable instances\nin which peace initiatives have been frustrated through\nthe intransigence of the parties, with support from some\nmembers of the international community. That can only be a recipe for long-term turmoil and instability in the\naffected countries and neighbouring regions.\nIn our view, in situations of armed conflict the\nfirst priority should be securing a verifiable ceasefire,\nfollowed by a political process involving an all-inclusive\ndialogue without preconditions. It is up to the parties,\nwith the assistance of a mediator or facilitator, to reach\na settlement that addresses their interests.\nThere is no doubt that resolving conflicts requires\nidentifying and addressing their underlying causes,\nwhich include social, political and economic factors\nthat are often deeply entrenched and interwoven. In\nseeking to resolve any conflict, national, regional and\ninternational actors need to adopt approaches that take\ninto account the following complexities.\nFirst, it is important to address the substantive issues\nthat give rise to conflicts in the first place, such as lack\nof access to or inequitable distribution of resources,\nsocial or political exclusion and other grievances.\nThe linkage between development and security in\npeacebuilding is now widely recognized, and once\nconflicts are resolved, the affected communities need\npeace dividends in terms of delivery of basic services\nsuch as health and education as well as opportunities\nfor employment.\nSecondly, efforts should be made to defuse the fear,\nhatred and other negative emotions that make conflicts\nintractable and often violent. We must collectively\nspeak out against intolerance and extremism in order\nto advance mutual respect and understanding of the\nvalues and beliefs of others. Uganda condemns all acts\nof terrorism and violence. We strongly condemn the\nrecent spate of violence and attacks, including targeting\ndiplomatic missions of the United States and other\nMember States.\nThirdly, political leaders and all actors need\nto forge national reconciliation, including through\ntransitional justice mechanisms, as well as establishing\ntruth and reconciliation mechanisms, which play a key\nrole in promoting durable peace. We would also like\nto reiterate the need to increase the role of women and\nyouth in the peaceful settlement of disputes, given the\nsignificant contribution they can make.\nOn the Israeli-Palestinian question, Uganda\ncontinues to call upon both parties to negotiate and\nreach a peaceful settlement based on a two-State\nsolution, with a Palestinian State living side by side\nwith Israel in peace, security and mutual recognition.\n\nFinally, we affirm our commitment to the peaceful\nsettlement of conflicts and to fostering international\ncooperation based on the principles of sovereign\nequality, justice and adherence to international law."

        "file_text": "\ufeffI convey my greetings\nto the President of the General Assembly, Mr. Vuk\nJeremi\u0107, whom I congratulate on his election. I wish him\nsuccess during his tenure as President of the General\nAssembly at its sixty-seventh session. I would also like\nto convey my greetings to the former President of the\nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-sixth session, Mr. Nassir\nAbdulaziz Al-Nasser of the State of Qatar, for the\nexcellent work he accomplished during his tenure.\nAlso allow me to express my appreciation to\nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his competent\nmanagement of the Organization. We reaffirm our\ntrust in his leadership during a particularly difficult\ntime in our history \u2014 during one of the worst financial\ncrises that the world has ever known that has had\nrepercussions in the economic, social, political, food,\nenergy and environmental sectors, to say nothing of the\nterrible threats to peace and security emanating from\nevery corner of the world.\nAs a small island State, with a shortage of\nresources and with only 37 years of independence,\nCape Verde is proud to be a democratic country that\nis based on the rule of law, built with the suffering\nand the determination of Cape Verdeans inside and\noutside our country. Notwithstanding the fact that my country faces enormous difficulties in ensuring its\nown existence and that to overcome them will require\ninternational solidarity, I believe that Cape Verde can,\nalthough modestly, contribute towards finding solutions\nto important problems that threaten the troubled world\nof our time.\nApart from the political stability that has\ncharacterized us as well as the build-up and consolidation\nof a democratic system, the Cape Verdean nation that\npreceded the creation of the State can be considered\nan example of peaceful coexistence among peoples\nwho originated from different countries, with different\ncreeds integrated into what had already been a mixed\nsculture. Our nation stands open to the world and to the\nexchange of values.\nCape Verde has opted for a policy for peace, dialogue\nand understanding in the resolution of conflicts. The\nexpression of those values is part of the Cape Verdean\npeople\u2019s way of living and being. Ours is a culture of\ntolerance that has shaped, in the almost four decades\nof its history, the values and principles of the country\u2019s\npolicies. Besides our modest political contribution to the\nresolution of conflicts in Southern Africa, for example,\nthe end of apartheid in South Africa, the independence\nof Namibia and peace in Angola, I would assert that our\nbiggest contribution has been our way of life as a people\nand as a culture. Through our way of life, we have been\nable to show that tolerance and the sharing of values\ncan be part of daily living, even in adverse conditions.\nOur way of life has allowed successive Cape Verdean\nGovernments and heads of State to manage the foreign\npolicy of our country in a consistent manner, giving\npriority to peace, justice and the peaceful coexistence\nof people in the formulation of policy. Accordingly, our\nforeign policy is the expression or translation of our\nculture and our ideology. That is also what guides me\nas I strive to broaden Cape Verde\u2019s contribution to our\ncontinent and, hopefully, to the world.\nOn 25 September, we celebrated the twenty-fifth\nanniversary of the adoption of the Constitution of the\nRepublic of Cape Verde, which is proof of the stability\nwe enjoy in our country. It has allowed numerous\npresidential, legislative and municipal elections to take\nplace, and changes in power have occurred with the\nhighest degree of normality. By happy coincidence, that\ncritical date for Cape Verde \u2014 25 September \u2014 coincides\nwith the launch of the sixty-seventh session of the\nGeneral Assembly, that exponent of democracy\non a global level which is undergoing a process of revitalization. As such, I am very grateful to be able to\nshare our milestone with General Assembly.\nThe Magna Law stipulates that our domestic legal\norder incorporates the precedents and standards of\ninternational common law and the law of treaties as\nlawfully approved and ratified. It is thus clear that\nwe attach great importance to institutions like the\nUnited Nations and the principles that guide them.\nNevertheless, we are aware that if those principles,\nwhich we have embedded in our Constitution, including\nthose referring to human rights, do not trickle down\ninto our day-to-day culture, the Constitution will not\nbe fulfilled in its entirety. We therefore urge all Cape\nVerdeans, be they in the country or outside, to further\ninternalize the values of our Constitution, which we\nconsider a critical step in ensuring its vitality and full\nrealization.\nDespite the serious issues arising in the world\nand the vulnerabilities of the Cape Verdean economy\nand its direct impact on the living conditions of the\nmajority of its people, I must say without false modesty\nthat I am proud of the trajectory that my country has\nfollowed since its independence. At independence, our\nannual gross domestic product (GDP) was $190 per\ncapita, whereas today it has grown to $3,295 per capita\nper annum. Several social indices have mirrored that\ngrowth, making it possible for us to achieve some of\nthe Millennium Development Goals. In fact, the human\ndevelopment, economic and financial results registered\nin the biennium 2011-2012 received positive reviews\nfrom the major international financial institutions.\nOurs is a service economy \u2014 with services\naccounting for 80 per cent of GDP in 2010 \u2014 with a very\nsmall market and an agricultural sector that is struggling\nwith desertification and drought. We therefore cannot\nignore our great vulnerabilities or rest on our laurels\nfor having graduated to a medium-income developed\ncountry. On the contrary, we cannot lose sight of the\nfact that our economy is still very dependent, that it\ncannot employ a significant portion of its potential\nworkforce, with all the social consequences that stem\nfrom that. We are therefore obliged to continue to rely\non international solidarity.\nWe of course will continue to use our meagre\nresources in an efficient and rational manner and\ndevelop even more effective efforts to combat poverty,\nsocial exclusion and unemployment, which in 2010\nreached an overall rate of 21 per cent, and 50 per cent among youth. Constraints with respect to energy, water\nand sanitation continue to garner our full attention so\nthat, as we build key infrastructure, we can create the\nconditions needed to achieve sustainable growth in our\neconomy.\nWe also must take into account the fact that the\nimpact on small island developing States of climate\nchange and natural disasters is a sword of Damocles\nthreatening our future. It is imperative that all countries,\nacting consistently and with solidarity, implement\nenvironmental defence programmes, develop the green\neconomy and help build true global resilience.\nOne of the most remarkable characteristics of\ntoday\u2019s world is the increasing interdependence of\nall sectors. We may speak frequently of the economy,\nbut that is because it conditions all the rest \u2014 the\nenvironmental, health, security, political and cultural\nsectors, indeed, nearly all areas of human activity. It\nis therefore fundamental for us to constantly monitor\nall relevant aspects of those complex relationships so\nthat we can understand the leading trends that have\nan impact on our process of development, but also so\nthat we can contribute even modestly to solving the\nproblems of people and countries across the globe.\nAlthough social and political stability are essential\naspects of our society, we cannot ignore the fact that\non our continent, Africa, that has not been a basic\ncharacteristic for internal and, to some extent, external\nreasons.\nI express my deep concern about the economic and\nfinancial global crisis that continues to severely punish\nthe Governments and defenceless populations of the\nAfrican continent. Those people are already suffering\nfrom hunger, the scourge of AIDS, the consequences\nof other endemic diseases, the f light of hundreds of\nthousands of displaced people and the overwhelming\nenvironmental degradation to which the continent\nis victim. Despite the fact that the continent least\ncontributed to that imbalance, it is Africa that most\nsuffers from its consequences.\nSuch crises also affect security not only because\nof regional conflicts but also owing to the universal\ndimension that terrorism has assumed. In that regard, it\nhas affected a good part of our continent with its links\nto trafficking in drugs and persons, maritime piracy,\nreligious intolerance and the problems that arise from\nthe political, social or military instability prevailing\nin many of our countries. That is fertile territory for terrorism and its growth. The recent cases of Mali,\nGuinea-Bissau and others, such as the Sudan, Somalia,\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo and some\ncountries of the Maghreb, well illustrate the situation.\nThe international community has every interest in\nresolutely focusing on the fight to eradicate such ills.\nDespite those constraints, it should be acknowledged\nthat the new wave of African leaders has been doing a\ngreat deal for the continent\u2019s progress. The international\ncommunity must therefore help such countries to find\nappropriate solutions to the situations that they face,\nwithout interfering or acting in the interests of others\nrather than of our people.\nIn any case, an organization such as the United\nNations, which is a depository of values that respect\nlegality and international law, should never, through\nits silence, promote, further or support solutions that\nmerely legitimize unconstitutional actions. It is clear\nthat much remains to be done.\nIn our view, as I have said before, in Africa\nthere has been no lack of mechanisms, declarations,\nrecommendations, programmes and projects with\nassessments and perspectives that disregard the\npolitical, institutional, social and cultural elements and\nsometimes resemble a vicious cycle. There is no real\ndevelopment because there is no peace. Democracy is\nnot deeply rooted because it conflicts with cultural and\nmoral traditions. There is no peace on account of the\nintolerance and social exclusion that prevent its citizens\nfrom building a free, fair, democratic and pluralistic\nsociety. That, at times, exacerbates armed conflicts and\nother social ills.\nAfrica needs a new train of thought that does not\nreject the universal values of democracy but, on the\ncontrary, uses them to enrich its own development\nprocess with a dialectic between modernity and\ntradition, freedom and the tendency for its own\nconditioning, the demands of its economic development\nand the fight against exclusion and social inequality,\nand reality and preconceptions.\nAfrica needs to regain its self-confidence. Africa\nstill needs to see stronger links between the United\nNations and the African Union for a true development\npartnership.\nIt is time to take decisions on issues such as\nglobal trade and climate change on the basis of global\nnegotiations that are grounded in fair, equal and ethical rules and that are in step with the countries of the\nSouth, in general, and of my continent, in particular.\nThat would give legitimacy to other forums, that is, in\nthe context of the World Trade Organization, the Food\nand Agriculture Organization of the United Nations\nand United Nations Framework Convention on Climate\nChange.\nIn short, we call for decisions on specific measures\nthat will result in effective decision-taking within this\nOrganization on development areas, such as cancelling\nthe foreign debt of developing countries, in particular\nsmall island developing States. We are certain that that\nwould be a stimulus for all such countries to achieve the\nMillennium Development Goals in 2015.\nIn 2009, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon affirmed\nat Princeton University that the United Nations needed\n\u201ca new vision, a new paradigm, a new multilateralism\u201d.\nThat would help to ensure global economic and financial\nstability, combat poverty, re-establish peace, respond to\nthe effects of climate change, improve global health,\nfight against terrorism and ensure disarmament and\nnon-proliferation.\nAt the closing ceremony of the United Nations\nConference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20)\nin June, it was stated that Rio+20 had shown that\nmultilateralism was an irreplaceable instrument for the\nglobal expression of democracy. We reaffirm that that\nis the legitimate path for finding solutions to problems\nthat affect all humankind. I support and welcome such\nstatements.\nIn conclusion, the world has developed immensely\nsince the end of the Cold War. The current multilateral\nsystem must align itself with the new challenges. For\nthe United Nations to continue to be an efficient and\nvital instrument for the international community in this\nnew era of multilateral relations, it will have to open\nup, innovate, listen to other voices and accept the new\npolitical, economic and social realities that have been\ncreated and imposed by the globalization process.\n\nThe reform of the Security Council \u2014 an organ that\nis responding less and less every day to the challenges\nof the contemporary world \u2014 is a goal that has long\nbeen pursued, without success. Cape Verde supports\nthe position of the African Union, which recommends\nthat the Council be reformed so as to correct the\nunjust situation with respect to the African continent.\n\nAt present Africa does not have the right to even one\npermanent seat on the Council, even though it meets all\nthe requirements.\nI conclude, Mr. President, with the conviction that\nAfrica can also provide a valuable contribution to the\ndevelopment of a better world, one without war, where\npeace is not just a theoretical concept; a world with\nmore freedom, justice and security \u2014 in other words,\na world with more fraternity and prosperity, in which\nthe well-being of its citizens is effectively provided for."

        "file_text": "\ufeffI bring greetings\nfrom the South Pacific. For the past year, New Zealand\nhas had the privilege of chairing the Pacific Islands\nForum, a regional body that represents some of the\nsmallest and most vulnerable States on this planet. For\nus that has been an important responsibility.\nBecause we are a small country with modest\nresources, we choose to focus much of our attention\non our own region. Over 60 per cent of our official\ndevelopment assistance is spent in our own\nneighbourhood. Serving as Chair of the Pacific Islands\nForum has caused us to reflect on the role of regional\norganizations, and also on the extent to which we all\ndepend on the United Nations for solutions to challenges\nthat are truly global in character. I say with some\nconfidence that we have been making good progress\nin dealing with those challenges that are capable of\nregional solutions.\nBut I must also say that we need and expect more\nfrom this institution. The Pacific Islands Forum has\n16 members, of which 16 are small island States. I was\npleased this week to attend the first meeting between\nthe Secretary-General and Pacific Islands Forum\nleaders, which I hope will mark a new era of enhanced\nhigh-level engagement between this Organization and\nour region and a greater understanding of our needs.\nThe Pacific has had its share of stability and\nsecurity challenges in recent times. As a region, we\nhave done reasonably well in dealing with them. Most recently it has been in Solomon Islands that a regional\ninitiative has been required. The Regional Assistance\nMission to the Solomon Islands has involved a truly\nregional approach, with the participation of police\nand other personnel from every member of the Pacific\nIslands Forum. I am pleased to report that the security\nelement of that initiative has been significantly scaled\ndown and will soon be fully withdrawn. But there is\nalso more that this Organization, particularly the\nSecurity Council, can do to acknowledge and support\nregional leadership on peace and security matters in the\nPacific and elsewhere.\nConcerns about democracy, the rule of law and\nhuman rights are not mere abstract considerations within\nthe Pacific. Those principles have been challenged in a\nnumber of States, most notably, in recent years, in Fiji.\nIn that respect, I am pleased to report that progress is\nbeing made towards the holding of elections in 2014,\nand that support has been forthcoming to ensure that\nsuch elections are free and fair.\nStability and security issues are not the only\npriorities for our regional body. In our year as Forum\nChair, New Zealand chose to focus on a number of\ndevelopment priorities, two of which I wish to mention\nin my remarks today.\nFor many of the poorer States within our region,\ntheir fisheries resource is the major economic asset they\nhold. Yet due to illegal fishing practices, unreported\ncatch and inadequate management practices, those\ncountries have received far too small a return on that\nresource. Because of the highly migratory character\nof the tuna resource, this is truly a matter requiring\nregional management. Solid progress is being made\nin such areas as improved surveillance, the training\nof monitors and improved management practices, both\nto protect the last really healthy fishery on the planet\nand to ensure that its owners receive a fair share of the\nresource they own.\nOne of the highest priorities within our region\nis the need for practical initiatives in the area of\nrenewable energy. Ours is a region heavily dependent\nupon fossil fuels for the generation of electricity. The\ncost of expensive imported diesel in most small Pacific\neconomies is absolutely crippling. The climate change\nimpact is obvious.\nAfter a decade of climate change conferences and\nhundreds of millions of dollars in so-called climate\nchange initiatives, one might be forgiven for imagining that the Pacific, overendowed as it is with good sunlight,\nwould by now be positively festooned with solar power\nplants. Sadly, I must report that that is not in fact the\ncase. Indeed, one of the most striking features of our\nregion has been the complete lack of progress in putting\nlofty climate change rhetoric into any form of renewable\nenergy practice.\nIn our year in the Chair of the regional body we\nhave set out to correct that serious shortcoming. A\nsmall but important illustration lies in our work in\nthe tiny Tokelau Islands. Until now, Tokelau has been\n100 per cent dependent on fossil fuels for the generation\nof electricity. By the end 2012, Tokelau will be over\n90 per cent resourced with renewable solar electricity.\nGood progress has also been made in Tonga, where\nI recently participated in the opening of a solar power\nplant supplying around 20 per cent of the electricity\nrequirements of the main island, Tongatapu. And we\nare working with the Cook Islands Government, too,\nto assist in meeting their bold aspiration to 50 per cent\nrenewable electricity by 2015, mostly through solar\ninitiatives.\nThese New Zealand-funded programmes are\nan important part of our overall commitment to our\nregion. Our parting legacy from our year as Chair\nof the regional body is a renewable-energy pledging\nconference to be held early next year, with the objective\nof matching donors, suppliers of concessional and\ncommercial finance, and others with the renewable\nenergy plans of our Pacific neighbours. Here I should\nacknowledge the European Union\u2019s commitment in\nco-leading this initiative, as well as the support of the\nWorld Bank, the Asian Development Bank and the\nGovernments of Australia, the United States and other\ngenerous supporters.\nWhile there is much that can be achieved by\nregional action, we must acknowledge that sometimes\nregional solutions are just not enough. That goes right\nto the very heart of the reason for the existence of this\nOrganization. My point is most vividly illustrated\ntoday in relation to Syria. It would be difficult for\nme to overstate the level of frustration of the people\nI represent with the complete inability of the Security\nCouncil to act in relation to Syria. And it would be\neven more difficult to overstate the extent to which the\nSecurity Council is at risk of losing its credibility in the\neyes of reasonable and fair-minded people through its\ninability to act. People in my country ask a very simple question:\nIf 25,000 deaths, countless thousands injured and\nmany more displaced and homeless are not enough to\nget the Security Council to act, then what does it take?\nJust what does it take? I welcome the leadership that\nthe Arab League and Arab States have shown on this\nissue, and we have seen similar leadership from them\non other difficult issues in their region. And I welcome\nthe fact that the General Assembly has been looking\nfor opportunities to be more engaged. In the absence of\nleadership from the Security Council, 1 suggest that the\nAssembly must find ways to play a more activist role.\nBut from all of this, the case for Security Council\nreform has become utterly compelling. Indeed,\nincreasingly, the future credibility of the United\nNations may depend on it. If we are to make progress\nin this area we will need to see Members move past the\nextravagant attempts to maximize individual positions\nand try to find some meaningful, practical reforms that\nactually hold the prospect of widespread support.\nI represent a small nation of practical, constructive\npeople. And it is because we seek practical,\nconstructive reform that our Government supports the\nso-called intermediate solution: the creation of a new\ncategory of seat for the group of larger countries that\nfeel underrepresented in comparison with the five\npermanent members of the Security Council (P-5), but\nseats that they would have to win in open elections\nso as to make them fully accountable to the broader\nmembership.\nI do not intend in these remarks to discuss any other\nspecific proposals we would like to see considered, with\none exception. There are now compelling reasons for us\nto ask the P-5 to voluntarily accept restrictions on the\nuse of the veto. To go further and to seek its abolition is\npointless; it simply will not happen. But to ask the P-5\nto acknowledge and respect the genuine concerns of the\nwider membership by voluntarily accepting a curb on\nthe exercise of the veto is an entirely reasonable and\nachievable objective.\nMy country was one of those that led the opposition\nto the veto when the Organization was being established;\nindeed, it was the only Charter issue that was forced to a\nvote. The permanent members argued at that stage that\nthe veto was necessary in order to protect their vital\nnational interests. Yet today we routinely see the veto\nexercised in circumstances that have little to do with\nnational interests. My request to the five permanent members is simply that they stick with what they said\nto us back in 1945. And my challenge to them today\nis to consider a process by which they collectively and\nvoluntarily agree to confine their use of the veto to\nthose issues that clearly and directly affect their vital\nnational interests; and also that they voluntarily agree\nnot to use their veto in situations that involve mass\natrocities.\nWhile on the topic of the Security Council, I\nwould like to take the opportunity to urge the Council\nand the relevant organs of the General Assembly to\nrespond positively to the requests from the Economic\nCommunity of West African States for support in\ndealing with the conflict in Mali and the Sahel. Too\noften we have seen the Council fail to respond in\na timely way to requests for help \u2014 in Rwanda, in\nGuinea, in Darfur and in Somalia. Too often it has been\na case of too little, too late. In all of these cases we have\nseen good leadership from within the African Union,\nand that leadership deserves a timely and constructive\nresponse from New York.\nMany of those here will be aware that New Zealand\nis an energetic candidate for election to the Security\nCouncil for the term from 2015-2016. I can assure the\nAssembly that it will hear more from us on these topics\nover the next two years. We are a small country with\na big voice and an approach that is fair-minded and\nconstructive.\nIn the past few days. the Assembly has heard from\nboth Prime Minister Netanyahu and President Abbas.\nWe are now on notice that the issue of Palestinian status\nin the United Nations will come before the Assembly\nduring this session. We look forward to seeing the text\nof a draft resolution and to engaging in the consultations\nthat have been signaled to us. I said earlier that New\nZealanders are practical and constructive. They are also\nfair-minded people; they expect to see their Government\nbring all of those attributes to the consideration of such\na resolution, and that we will surely do. Having said\nthat, let me also be clear that we see such a resolution\nas a very poor substitute for the direct discussions that\nshould occur between two leaders who live half an hour\ndown the road from each other.\nIn his address to the Assembly earlier in the week\n(see A/67/PV.12), Prime Minister Netanyahu set out\nclearly the grave implications for the Middle East, and\nfor the global community more generally, of a nuclear\nbreakout in the region. Like other Member States, New Zealand believes Iran must be told to step back from\na course that risks further dangerous escalation of the\nsituation. We hope the international community will\nstand firm in sending that sort of message. In return,\nhowever, I suggest that it is fair for the international\ncommunity to make a request of Prime Minister\nNetanyahu. And that is to put the settlements on hold, at\nthe very least while negotiations proceed, and to engage\nin the direct talks with his Palestinian counterpart that\nrepresent the only basis for a durable solution to this\nissue, and an essential step in removing the seeds of\nwider conflict within the region.\nI would like to remind the Assembly that these are\nvery difficult times for Governments around the world.\nBudget economies have affected foreign ministries,\nmy own included. It is only fair that we should in\nturn ask this large institution to find economies and\nimprove working methods in order to deliver better\nvalue for our taxpayers. Smaller countries, like New\nZealand, depend more than most on good multilateral\ninstitutions. We need a United Nations that is modern,\nefficient and able to meet changing needs. We all need\na Security Council that is more responsive to the needs\nof the wider membership and more effective in dealing\nwith the significant challenges that we all confront\ntoday."

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt gives me\ngreat pleasure to congratulate Mr. Vuk Jeremi\u0107 and his\nfriendly country on his assumption of the presidency of\nthe General Assembly at its current session. I wish him\nevery success in his task.\nI would like to express my sincere appreciation\nto the former President of the General Assembly,\nMr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser, and the brotherly\nState of Qatar for their outstanding stewardship of the\nprevious session. I would also like to pay tribute to the\nSecretary-General for striving tirelessly to preserve the\nrole of the Organization and enhance its effectiveness.\nI assure him of Egypt\u2019s support in all efforts extended\nfor that purpose.\nMy presence here today to address the General\nAssembly has multiple significance. I am the first\nEgyptian civilian President elected democratically\nand freely, following a great peaceful revolution\nhailed by the entire world. The revolution enjoyed\ngenuine legitimacy thanks to the efforts and will of\nall Egyptians, inside and outside of Egypt, and by the\ngrace of God. Today, every Egyptian shares a sense\nof self-confidence that allows each of them to claim a\nhigher moral and cultural ground.\nWe have taken several effective steps on the road\ntowards establishing the modern State aspired to by\nall Egyptians \u2014 one that is in tune with the present,\nbased on the rule of law, democracy and respect for\nhuman rights, a constitutional State that will not\ncompromise the values firmly embedded in the souls of\nall Egyptians, a State that seeks justice, truth, freedom,\ndignity and social justice.\n\nThe Egyptian revolution that was founded on the\nlegitimacy that I represent before the Assembly today\nwas not the product of a f leeting moment, or a brief\nuprising. Nor was it the product of the winds of change\nof a certain spring or autumn. Rather, that revolution,\nand all the ones preceding it and following it in the\nregion, were triggered by the long-term struggle of\nindigenous national movements seeking a life of\npride and dignity for all citizens. It therefore reflects\nthe wisdom of history and is a clear warning to those\nattempting to put their interests before those of their\npeoples.\nWe are therefore striving to realize a new vision\nof Egypt that will serve as a programme of action\nfor the world and that will guide our cooperation\nwith the international community in a spirit of\nequality and mutual respect through the promotion\nof non-intervention in the affairs of States and the\nimplementation of international principles, agreements\nand instruments. Today we reiterate our commitment,\nparticularly to the Charter of the United Nations, which\nEgypt took part in drafting.\nFrom that perspective, we continue efforts to\nresolve problems and address their root causes, without\nrelinquishing the principles of law or well-established\nvalues that, if compromised, could lead to grave\ninternational consequences if the rational and sincere\namong us choose not to pay heed.\nThe first issue that the global community must\nexert all efforts to resolve, on the basis of justice\nand dignity, is the Palestinian cause. Many decades\nhave passed since the Palestinian people expressed\ntheir desire to regain their full rights and build their\nindependent State, with Jerusalem as its capital. Despite\nthe continued struggle of the people via all legitimate\nmeans to attain their rights, and despite the acceptance\nby their representatives of the resolutions adopted by\nthe international community as a basis for resolving\nproblems, this issue of international legitimacy has to\ndate, unfortunately, remained without a resolution to\nachieve the hopes and aspirations of the Palestinian\npeople. And the resolutions agreed on the issue remain\nfar from implementation.\nThe fruits of dignity and freedom must not remain\nout of reach of the brotherly Palestinian people. It is\nshameful that the free world has accepted, without\nregard to the justifications provided, the continued\ndenial, by a member of the international community, of the rights of a nation that, for decades, has longed\nfor independence. It is also disgraceful that settlement\nactivities have continued in the Palestinian territories,\nalong with the delay in implementing decisions of\ninternational legitimacy.\nProceeding from the perspective of defending\ntruth, freedom and dignity, and from my duty to\nsupport our Palestinian brothers and sisters, I place\nthe international community face to face with its\nobligatory responsibilities requiring the achievement\nof a just and comprehensive peace, an end to all forms\nof occupation of Arab land and the implementation of\nrelevant international resolutions. I call for immediate\nand significant measures to put an end to occupation,\nsettlement activities and any alteration to the identity\nof occupied Jerusalem.\nI call for peace that will establish a sovereign\nPalestinian State and achieve the security and stability\nlong sought by the peoples of the region. On the same\nbasis, I assure the Assembly of Egypt\u2019s full support of\nany course of action that Palestine decides to follow in\nthe United Nations.\nI call upon all Member States, just as they have\nsupported the revolutions of the Arab peoples, to\nextend their support to the Palestinians and their\nendeavour to recover the full and legitimate rights of a\npeople struggling to regain its freedom and establish an\nindependent State of Palestine, based on the inalienable\nrights of the Palestinians.\nWe are determined to work to pursue all efforts of\nthe Palestinian people, in support of them and side by\nside until they freely regain all rights for all segments\nand communities of the population.\nFrom this rostrum and at this eminent gathering,\nI must address the issue that weighs heavily upon all\nof us, namely, the bloodshed and the human tragedy in\nSyria. The bloodshed must be halted immediately. That\nis our first concern. The blood being shed in the land of\nbeloved Syria is far too valuable to continue to lose day\nand night. The brotherly Syrian people, who are dear\nto the hearts of every Egyptian, deserve to hope for a\nfuture of freedom and dignity. That is the essence of\nthe initiative that I proposed in the Holy City of Mecca\nduring the recent month of Ramadan, and which I have\nreiterated on subsequent occasions. It aims to avoid the\nworst; to check the continued suffering of the Syrian\npeople and the devolvement of the conflict into a full\nscale civil war \u2014 God forbid \u2014 with concomitant negative effects extending beyond Syria and its\nimmediate neighbours.\nEgypt, along with the three other countries involved\nin our initiative, has held meetings that manifested\nmany areas of commonalities. We will continue to work\nto put an end to the suffering of the Syrian people and\nprovide them with an opportunity to choose freely the\nregime that best represents them.\nAfter the current regime comes to an end \u2014 the\nregime that is killing its own people day and night \u2014 the\nSyrian people will choose, by their own free will,\na regime that represents them and that places Syria\nin its proper position among democratic countries\ncontributing to the common march of the Arab people\nbased on its solid, legitimate, regional and international\nrole.\nI would like to emphasize here that the initiative is\nopen to all. It is not just the purview of its four starting\nparties, but is open to all who wish to positively\ncontribute to resolving the Syrian crisis and suffering,\nthat we are all responsible for.\nAll of us, the world over, must actively endeavour\nto put an end to the tragedy. It is the tragedy of the age,\nand our duty is to end it.\nEgypt is committed to continuing its sincere efforts\nto put an end to the catastrophe in Syria under an Arab,\nregional and international framework that preserves\nthe unity of that brotherly State. It would involve all\nfactions of the Syrian people without ethnic, religious or\ngender discrimination and would spare Syria the danger\nof foreign military intervention, which we oppose.\nEgypt is also committed to supporting the mission of\nMr. Lakhdar Brahimi, Joint Special Representative of\nthe United Nations and the League of Arab States for\nSyria, and to continuing the current efforts aimed at\nunifying the Syrian opposition and encouraging it to\npropose a comprehensive unified vision of an organized\ndemocratic transfer of power by measures that preserve\nthe rights of all constituencies in Syria, and maintain\ntheir essential positions in the new Syria \u2014 like the\nnew Egypt.\nI cannot fail to reiterate Egypt\u2019s commitment to\nworking with the other Arab countries to ensure that the\nArab nation reclaims its rightful position in the world.\nThat is an integral component of Egypt\u2019s vision of\nnational security and of the larger homeland extending\nfrom the Arab Gulf to the Atlantic Ocean \u2014 an area that thrives with opportunities for cooperation and\nconstructive engagement with the entire world.\nEgypt also believes that the extremely valuable\ncontribution of the Arab nation within the wider Islamic\nsphere is of vital necessity in promoting joint action\nwithin the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC).\nEgypt will make every effort to ensure that the next\nOIC conference, to be held early next year in Egypt,\nwill strengthen mutual understanding between Islamic\ncountries and the rest of the world and set in motion\nthe principles of the dialogue among civilizations, by\neliminating the causes of misunderstandings used by\nfanatics on both sides to prove, wrongly, that differences\namong people are great and to achieve political goals\ncompletely unrelated to the noble ideals of religions,\nhuman values or ethics.\nToday more than ever, our brothers and sisters in\nthe Sudan need the Assembly\u2019s support. The Sudan\nis seeking to achieve stability and development\nand is working to build sound and ideal relations\nwith South Sudan. I believe that the nascent State,\ntogether with the Sudan, is ready to become a centre\nof cooperation between the Arab world and African\ncountries. The Sudan has made great sacrifices in its\nquest for peace and stability. It has committed itself\nto the implementation of the Comprehensive Peace\nAgreement. It was also the first country to recognize\nthe nascent State of South Sudan. But let me be frank:\nit has not received the support it deserves. It is now high\ntime for international efforts to rally in support of the\nSudan and to work on settling differences between the\nSudan and its neighbour to the south in order to resolve\nall outstanding issues.\nAn early success of the brotherly Somali people\nduring the difficult transitional phase was to elect His\nExcellency Mr. Hassan Sheikh Mohamud as President,\nwhich is a positive step towards unity and stability after\na very difficult period. I call upon the United Nations\nto continue to support the Somali Government\u2019s efforts\nto fend off those seeking to hinder its efforts to achieve\nstability, reconstruct State institutions and realize the\naspirations of the Somali people for a better future.\nThe principles of justice and right are linked\nto achieving security and stability in the world,\nparticularly in the Middle East. Over many long years,\nsome have wrongfully sought to maintain stability\nthrough oppression and tyranny. Some of us have, alas,\napplauded their bad deeds. But now that the peoples of the region have regained their freedom, they will\nneither tolerate, nor permit, being deprived of their\nrights, by either their own leaders or outside forces.\nThe will of the people, especially in our region,\nno longer accepts the continued non-accession of\nany country to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\nNuclear Weapons (NPT) and the non-application of the\nsafeguards regime to that country\u2019s nuclear facilities,\nespecially if such action is coupled with irresponsible\npolicies or arbitrary threats. In that regard, the\ninternational community\u2019s acceptance of the principle\nof pre-emption or attempts to legitimize it represents a\nserious matter that must be firmly confronted to avoid\nany tendency to promote the law of the jungle.\nCognizant of the danger that the status quo\nrepresents to the security of our important region, with\nits natural resources and trade corridors, Egypt stresses\nthe necessity of mobilizing international efforts to\nconvene the special conference on declaring the Middle\nEast a nuclear-weapon-free zone that is also free of\nother weapons of mass destruction, before the end of\nthe current year, with the participation of all concerned\nparties, without exception.\nI should like to say very clearly that the only\nsolution is to eliminate all nuclear weapons and all other\nweapons of mass destruction. There is no alternative.\nAt the same time, we also emphasize the right of all\ncountries of the region and of the world, including\nEgypt, of course, to the peaceful use of nuclear energy\nwithin the framework of the NPT, with a commitment\nto honour their obligations in that respect and provide\nthe necessary guarantees to the countries of the region,\nso as to avoid any doubt surrounding their peaceful\nnuclear programmes.\nIn our view, the concepts of justice, truth and\ndignity form the basis of the framework for governing\ninternational relations.\nA review of international relations would\nundoubtedly reveal the extent of the injustice that\nhas been inf licted upon the African continent. I do\nnot think it necessary to enumerate all the previous\npledges that have been made in the Hall to boost\ndevelopment and economic growth in Africa through\naid and investment. The world has a responsibility to\nsupport Africa\u2019s efforts beyond mere promises and\ngood intentions; it must provide the assistance needed\nfor African countries to recover the treasures that were\nstolen from them over successive eras, the last of which being the period when some thought that supporting\nunjust regimes would help to achieve a false stability\nthat protected their interests, while those regimes\nmerely spread corruption and allowed for wealth to be\nsmuggled outside their countries.\nI am aware that the desired goals can only be\nachieved through the active participation of the peoples\nof the continent and their assumption of their own\nresponsibilities. That is something that we as Africans\nare ready and willing to undertake in our quest for a\nbetter future for our countries. Today, we as Africans\nhave to create for our continent a new set of ambitious\ngoals that would ensure that we are on the right track\ntowards sustainable development, the fulfilment of our\naspirations for a better future and the real participation\nof Africa in the international order. I assure the\nAssembly that Egypt will continue to support its\nbrothers and sisters in Africa, and that it is ready to\ncooperate with any stakeholder or party in or outside\nthe continent to raise living standards in Africa through\nthe exchange of expertise and successful practices.\nAs we contemplate the current international order,\nwe feel that there is a need to work diligently to repair\nit, based on principles that would renew its legitimacy\nand preserve its credibility. That is a legitimate demand\nof peoples and nations as they seek to participate\nin shaping a new world and a better future for their\nchildren.\nRevitalizing the role of the General Assembly\nas a democratic forum that expresses the will of the\ninternational community and reforming the structure\nof a Security Council, which still reflects a bygone\nera, must remain our highest priorities and must be\nundertaken with due seriousness.\nI would like to emphasize the need for the United\nNations to give special attention to women\u2019s issues\nand youth issues. During the Non-Aligned Movement\nsummit in Tehran, I proposed a new initiative to establish\na United Nations body dedicated solely to youth issues,\ngiving particular attention to education, training,\nemployment and improving youth participation in\npolitical life. The aim is to build the capacity of future\ngenerations to achieve their aspirations.\nEgypt would like to stress that the international\nsystem will not be fixed as long as we have double\nstandards. We expect from others, as others expect from\nus, respect for our cultural specificities and religious\npoints of reference. The world beyond our region should not seek to impose on us concepts or cultures\nthat are unacceptable to us, nor should they politicize\ncertain issues and use them as a pretext to intervene in\nour affairs.\nWhat Muslims \u2014 and migrant Muslims \u2014 are\nexperiencing in a number of regions worldwide in\nterms of discrimination, basic human rights violations\nand vicious campaigns against what they hold sacred, is\nunacceptable. The behaviour of some individuals in that\nregard is absolutely unacceptable. We reject the insults\nheaped upon the Prophet of Islam, Muhammad \u2014 peace\nbe upon him \u2014 as unacceptable. We oppose those who\nhurl such insults. We will not allow anyone to insult the\nProphet in word or in deed. It runs counter to the most\nbasic principles of the Charter of the United Nations.\nUnfortunately, such practices have acquired a name\ntoday \u2014 Islamophobia.\nWe all have to work together. We must join hands\nin confronting regressive ideas that hinder cooperation\namong us. We must move together to confront\nextremism, discrimination and incitement to hatred\nof others on the basis of religion or race. The General\nAssembly and the Security Council have the primary\nresponsibility for addressing a phenomenon that is\nstarting to have clear implications for international\npeace and security.\nThe obscenities that I have referred to, which are\npart of a recent organized campaign against Islamic\nsanctities, are unacceptable and require that we take a\nfirm stand. We have a responsibility at this international\nforum to look into how we can protect the world from\ninstability and insecurity.\nEgypt respects freedom of expression \u2014 a freedom\nof expression that is not used to incite hatred against\nanyone and that is not directed towards a specific\nreligion or culture. We support a freedom of expression\nthat addresses extremism and violence and does not\ndeepen ignorance or disregard others. As we have said\nbefore, we firmly oppose the use of violence as a means\nof expressing objection to obscenity and indecency.\nBefore I conclude, I must say that the severity\nand recurrence of financial and economic crises must\nlead us to a review of the international economic\ndecision-making processes that affect the fate of\npeoples who have not participated directly in those\nprocesses but yet are unfortunately the first to bear their\nnegative impacts on growth, trade, the environment\nand the social fabric of society, as a result of unfair trade rules and practices and conditionalities imposed\non the transfer of technology and access to necessary\nfinancing for development. We urgently need a new\npeople-centred form of global economic governance that\naims at consolidating cooperation between development\npartners on the basis of mutual benefit and interests.\nI have laid out our vision, which is shared by the\nEgyptian people. I have also attempted to brief ly outline\nEgypt\u2019s views on the main issues, which is to say the\nvision of Egyptian youth, children, women and men,\nMuslim and non-Muslim, on all important questions in\nthe Middle East, Africa and the rest of the world. From\nthat perspective, I am sure that the United Nations is\ncapable of assuming its intended role of effectively\naddressing all global and regional issues and challenges\nthrough dialogue, understanding and joint cooperation,\nin accordance with the principles of international law.\nPost-revolutionary Egypt will spare no effort to\ndeal sincerely with all Members of the Organization.\nWe will always remain in the forefront of international\nendeavours aimed at achieving freedom, justice, social\njustice and dignity for all peoples, as well as security\nand stability for all our countries.\nI look forward with great optimism, and I see\nthe peace that we call for prevailing all over the\nworld \u2014 a peace based on justice and conferring on\nall their undiminished rights, a peace that does not\ndiscriminate between people for any reason. That peace\nwill not come about until we all cooperate, until we\nrealize that we are all equal and share many aspirations\nand ambitions. That is the peace whose message I bring\nto to the Assembly \u2014 a peace of right and justice,\nstability and development, interdependence of interests\nand benefits, love and mutual respect. I do not believe\nthat achieving this will raise difficulties for any of us\nif we extend the hand of cooperation, sincere intention\nand righteous work. God is our witness. We are all\nhopeful that we will see a better future for the world."

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt is a distinct honour\nfor me to convey the sincere regrets of my President,\nMr. Ernest Bai Koroma, who, on account of unavoidable\ncircumstances, was unable to address the Assembly at\nits sixty-seventh session.\nI wish to join previous speakers in congratulating\nthe President on his election to direct the affairs of this\nsession and to assure him of my delegation\u2019s fullest\nsupport and cooperation throughout his tenure. Allow\nme to commend his predecessor, Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz\nAl-Nasser, and to thank him for the skilful manner in\nwhich he efficiently conducted the affairs of the last\nsession. My profound appreciation also goes to the\nSecretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for his tireless\nefforts in advancing the United Nations agenda to make\nthe world a peaceful and safer place for humankind.\nThe President\u2019s choice of the theme \u201cBringing about\nadjustment or settlement of international disputes or\nsituations by peaceful means\u201d is a timely wake-up call\nfor the United Nations to fully embrace the fundamental\nprinciple upon which our Organization was established.\nIndeed, only with such adjustments and the practical manifestation of our collective commitment to peaceful\ncoexistence can we, as a global family, successfully\ntackle the myriad of prevailing global challenges.\nThey include poverty, hunger, the gross and systematic\nviolation of human rights, extremist fundamentalism,\nterrorism and transnational organized crime, as well as\nthe reconstruction and strengthening of fragile States\nand economies emerging from conflict. In that context,\nwe should remind ourselves that, a little over a year ago,\nthe Assembly adopted the landmark resolution 66/291\non mediation that recognizes its growing usefulness\nas a means of preventing disputes from escalating into\nconflicts and as a cost-effective tool in the peaceful\nsettlement of disputes and the prevention of conflicts.\nAmid such security challenges and global economic\nuncertainties, the African continent continues to\nstrive hard to contain and to address the resurgence\nof conflicts in the region by peaceful means. At\nthe regional and subregional levels, the year under\nreview has been marred by sporadic terrorist strikes\nby extremists, leading to the extensive loss of life and\nmassive destruction of property, including coveted\nworld heritage sites, and the recent killing of the United\nStates Ambassador and three other Americans in\nLibya. Sierra Leone strongly condemns such brutal and\ncowardly acts and will continue to work closely with\nall partners, particularly within the framework of the\nMano River Union, the Economic Community of West\nAfrican States, the African Union (AU) and the United\nNations, in seeking a lasting solution to that scourge.\nUntil recently, the use of preventive diplomacy in\nthe maintenance of international peace and security\nwas not used to its fullest potential by the United\nNations system. Rather, it was used more as a tool in\ncrisis management. I am, however, heartened by the\npresent impetus and would like to take this opportunity\nto commend the role of the Secretary-General, his\nSpecial Representatives and the crisis-management\noperations and missions around the world, as well as\nthe increasing role of the AU, subregional organizations\nand international contact groups, in tackling crisis\nsituations that have emerged globally in recent times.\nSierra Leone will continue to wholeheartedly\nembrace mediation and other conflict-prevention\ninitiatives as a key and indispensable tool in settling\ndisputes and in preventing and resolving conflicts. The\nlessons learned from our experience have enhanced our\nconviction in the core principles of democracy, human\nrights and good governance as prerequisites for political stability, sustainable peace, security and development.\nWe therefore remain strongly committed to the rule of\nlaw, respect for and the protection of human rights, gender\nequality, the empowerment of women, equal access to\njustice, fighting corruption with zero tolerance and\npursuing the internationally agreed development goals,\nincluding the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).\nTo that end, we are committed to ensuring participatory\ngovernance, conducting free, fair, transparent and\ncredible elections, and combating transnational\norganized crime in all its forms.\nSierra Leone therefore views with disappointment\nthe fact that the United Nations Conference on the Arms\nTrade Treaty ended without a negotiated consensus\non the treaty\u2019s adoption. The Sierra Leone delegation\nbelieves that we must all earnestly endeavour to\nadopt a well-considered and balanced treaty with\nadequate provisions to effectively regulate the transfer\nof conventional weapons. If we continue to delay\nin that respect, we face the risk of their continuous\nuse in committing grave violations of national and\ninternational law, which has the potential to destabilize\npeace and security. We therefore urge Member States\nto consider our moral obligation to humankind as\nour key guiding principle and to sincerely commit to\ncontributing to the establishment of mechanisms to\nprevent the diversion of such weapons into the illicit\nmarket.\nIn three years, we will reach the target date of 2015\nfor the implementation of the Millennium Development\nGoals. For many Member States, particularly those\nof the global South, the voyage has been rough and,\nat times, turbulent. Worse still, the effects of the\nfood, fuel and financial crises that struck the global\ncommunity in 2008, as well as the impact of climate\nchange, conflicts and deadly pandemics, have further\nexacerbated the situation and compromised the\ndetermination and efforts of developing countries,\nespecially least developed countries (LDCs), to attain\nthe internationally agreed development goals, including\nthe MDGs.\nWe commend Brazil on successfully hosting\nthe United Nations Conference on Sustainable\nDevelopment (Rio+20). We also applaud our solidarity\nand flexibility during the negotiation process,\nenabling the incorporation of LDCs and conflict-\naffected countries in the Rio+20 outcome document\n(resolution 66/288, annex). We look forward to a similar\nspirit of solidarity in defining sustainable development goals that take on board the concerns of the most\nvulnerable members of the community of nations.\nDespite the onerous challenges facing the global\ncommunity, Sierra Leone has recorded significant\nprogress in strengthening its political and economic\ngovernance, including the improvement of its social\nindicators. We have made substantial progress in\nimplementing the President\u2019s Agenda for Change\n(2008-2012), which covers the priorities of our national\ndevelopment aspirations, as well as key peacebuilding\npriorities, in tandem with the United Nations Joint\nVision for Sierra Leone.\nThe ongoing foreign direct investment in various\nsectors of the economy, notably the mining sector, is\nbrightening the prospects for the economy. Hopefully,\nit will place Sierra Leone among the fastest growing\neconomies in the world in the next few years.\nThe Agenda for Change continues to provide a\nstrong partnership link between Sierra Leone and\nthe United Nations, as well as other international\ndevelopment partners. To date, its implementation has\nhad a great impact on peacebuilding and on laying\nthe foundations for sustainable development and the\nconsolidation of peace.\nSierra Leone today is considered a showpiece of\nbest practices in donor coordination and a success story\nin peacebuilding. In that regard, we reiterate our call to\nthe international community to continue to invest in our\nsuccess in the spirit of the New Deal for Engagement\nin Fragile States, which was agreed in Busan, and\nthe need for special attention to be paid to countries\nemerging from conflict. The successor development\nframework to our Agenda for Change, entitled Agenda\nfor Prosperity, is anchored on the New Deal and is well\nunder way.\nIn its short existence to date, the peacebuilding\narchitecture has proven its worth as envisaged by the\nleaders at the 2005 World Summit, whose goal was\nto help countries emerging from conflict make an\nirreversible transition from war to sustainable peace.\nAs one of the first countries on the Peacebuilding\nCommission\u2019s agenda, Sierra Leone has charted a\npath that can serve as a learning model for others. In\nthat regard, we strongly believe that strengthening\npeacebuilding will help to better safeguard countries\nfrom relapsing into conflict and sustain peace beyond\nthe life of peacekeeping missions. It will also help\nensure that the enormous investments that Member States make in peacekeeping operations will achieve\ntheir intended result.\nSierra Leone continues to uphold the principles\nof interreligious tolerance, peaceful coexistence and\nrespect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. At\nthe national level, we have enhanced political stability\nby strengthening good governance institutions, giving\nthem sufficient leverage and latitude to deliver on their\nrespective statutory mandates. That arrangement has\nearned the Human Rights Commission of Sierra Leone\nan \u201cA status\u201d accreditation from the International\nCoordinating Committee of National Human Rights\nInstitutions. In that regard, we remain focused on our\nobligations to report to international treaty bodies and\nhave therefore submitted our initial report with regard\nto the International Covenant on Civil and Political\nRights, while work is well under way on our reports\nin compliance with the Convention against Torture\nand Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or\nPunishment and the African Charter on Human and\nPeoples\u2019 Rights.\nAlong those lines, we recently established a national\ncommission for disabled persons, consistent with the\nrelevant provisions of the 2011 Disability Act, enacted\nthe 2012 Sexual Offences Act to address the specific\nissue of sexual violence against women and girls, and\npassed into law the 2012 bill on arms and ammunition\nto regulate gun ownership so as to ensure compliance\nwith the Economic Community of West African States\nConvention on Small Arms and Light Weapons. A\ngender-equality bill is also in process for enactment.\nI commend the support of the United Nations and\nthe international partners for the work of the Special\nCourt for Sierra Leone, which has made a number\nof critical contributions to the advancement of the\nrule of law at both the national and the international\nlevels. In particular, we compliment the Special Court\nfor bringing to trial perpetrators of crimes against\nhumanity and violations of international humanitarian\nlaw committed in Sierra Leone during the course of\nour 11-year conflict. Sierra Leone, the United Nations\nand the international community can be proud of the\nSpecial Court\u2019s immense achievements. With our\ncontinued support, the Special Court can complete its\nremaining work.\nPresident Ernest Bai Koroma, in his address to\nthe General Assembly at the opening of its sixty-sixth\nsession, underscored the imperative of peacefully settling disputes in Africa and the world at large\nby emphasizing that the world is so interconnected\nin trade, politics and the social spheres that a single\nnation\u2019s upheaval could affect many other countries\n(see A/66/PV.20). It is against that background that\nwe, as a country, have continued to nurture closer\nties with our sister States in the Mano River basin in\norder to deepen cooperation and collaboration and\naddress issues of common concern, ranging from\ntransnational organized crime to border disputes.\nThe recent decision by the Presidents of Sierra Leone\nand her sister Republic of Guinea to demilitarize the\nYenga border area and establish a joint committee of\nthe two countries in order to ensure a final peaceful\nresolution of the Yenga problem is consistent with our\ncommitment to the peaceful resolution of international\ndisputes. Indeed, our steadfast commitment to global\npeace and security is evident in our participation in\nUnited Nations peacekeeping missions in Lebanon,\nSomalia, the Sudan, South Sudan and Timor-Leste.\nThe 2012 presidential, parliamentary and\nlocal council elections scheduled to take place on\n17 November are barely 46 days away. With the support\nof our bilateral and multilateral partners, preparations\nare in full swing for the conduct of the third round of\nsuch elections within the decade following the end\nof our civil conflict. The Government is fully aware\nthat the conduct and outcome of the elections will be a\ncritical benchmark for assessing the level of our gains\nin the area of peace consolidation and democracy. The\nGovernment, relevant stakeholders and our development\npartners are therefore expressly determined to exert a\ncollective effort and use every available opportunity to\nensure that we put solid mechanisms in place for the\npeaceful conduct and achievement of transparent and\ncredible democratic elections. It is in that regard that,\nin May this year, all key stakeholders in the country\ncommitted themselves to a credible and violence-free\nprocess by signing the declaration on the 2012\nElections. We have thus consolidated the electoral laws\nand established electoral offences courts to ensure the\nlegitimacy and credibility of the electoral process.\nAs Coordinator of the Committee of Ten Heads of\nState of the African Union for the reform of the United\nNations Security Council, I am pleased to report to the\nGeneral Assembly that, at the last AU Summit held in\nAddis Ababa, African heads of State reaffirmed their\nstrong commitment to the Ezulwini Consensus and\nthe Sirte Declaration containing the African common\nposition on the reform of the Security Council. To\nthat end, we are committed to building alliances\nin support of the African common position with\nvarious interest groups and Member States engaged\nin the intergovernmental negotiations, with a view to\nachieving reform of the Security Council as soon as\npossible. In that pursuit, member States of the African\nUnion have been called upon to include the issue of\nSecurity Council reform among the priorities in their\nforeign policies.\nIn that respect, Africa continues to engage in the\nintergovernmental negotiations with an open-door\npolicy aimed at correcting the historical injustice\nsuffered by Africa as the only continent not represented\nin the permanent-member category of the Council and at\nthe same time underrepresented in the non-permanent\ncategory. Since the Security Council remains at the\ncentre of global governance in the maintenance of\ninternational peace and security, it is both imperative\nand compelling that the international community\nrecognize the need described in the 2005 World\nSummit Outcome to make the Council more broadly\nrepresentative, efficient and transparent in order\nto enhance its effectiveness and the legitimacy and\nimplementation of its decisions, as well as the need to\ndemocratize the Council\u2019s decision-making process and\ncorrect the lingering historical injustice inf licted upon\nthe continent. In that regard, we urge the wider United\nNations membership to work with Africa to urgently\naddress that injustice. Africa is not being unreasonable\nin its demand, and we all know that procrastination on\nthe matter has led to a travesty of justice and fair play,\nwhich undermines the dignity of our peoples.\nWe are determined at the national level to surmount\nall impediments on our way to development and to\ndelivering fully on all the projects in our \u201cAgenda for\nChange\u201d. We are confident that with sustained support\nfrom our bilateral and multilateral partners, we shall\npromote socioeconomic progress and provide a better\nstandard of living for our people in an atmosphere of\npeace and security. What we cannot afford at this time\nin our history is to fail in our duty and obligation to\nprovide peace, security and sustainable development\nfor our people.\nAt the global level, as we look at the work that\nlies before the sixty-seventh session, let us not lose\nsight of our shared obligation to ensure a peaceful\nand secure world by resolving our differences through\nconstructive dialogue and thus strengthen the existing mediation mechanisms provided in the Charter and\ninstitutionalized within the United Nations system."

        "file_text": "\ufeffAt the\noutset, allow me to congratulate Mr. Jeremi\u0107 on his\nelection as President of the General Assembly at its\nsixty-seventh session. I am confident that the Assembly\u2019s\nwork will be crowned with success, thanks to his rich\ndiplomatic experience and expertise. I assure him of\nLebanon\u2019s full support in his efforts. I would also like to\nthank His Excellency Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser,\nPresident of the Assembly at its sixty-sixth session,\nfor his tireless efforts and remarkable achievements. I\nalso extend my gratitude to the Secretary-General, His\nExcellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for his keen concern\nover critical global issues, especially those related to\nthe Middle East, in particular my country, Lebanon,\nwhich was mentioned in his annual report (A/67/1).\nLebanon, a founding State Member of the United\nNations, reiterates its commitment to the noble\nprinciples and human values that make up the founding\npillars of the Organization. Those standards enable it\nto act globally for justice, freedom, prosperity and\npeace and to shoulder its responsibility to address the\nworld\u2019s ongoing challenges. Those challenges test the\ninternational Organization\u2019s credibility, efficiency,\nstatus, and role in ensuring social freedom, political\nstability and economic independence for all peoples of\nthe world, free from hegemony, polarization, fear and\ndouble standards.\nIn the light of the major developments and changes\nthat have occurred since the Second World War, it\nhas become necessary to strengthen the role of the\nGeneral Assembly as a universal organ. That should\npreclude the Security Council privileges, which are\ncurrently restricted to a limited number of countries\nthat control crucial decisions, in particular those\nrelated to war and peace. In that regard, in order to\nensure greater justice and democracy, the structure,\nprivileges and expansion of the Security Council\nshould be reconsidered. The new global political,\neconomic and social realities should be taken into\naccount by extending the membership so as to enable\nsmaller countries to have greater representation. That\nwould fulfil the United Nations principles of equality\nand justice among peoples.\n\nOur meeting today takes place at a time of major\nglobal developments and changes, in particular for\nArab nations. Political reform had therefore become\ninevitable in order to achieve democracy and to lay the\nfoundations for freedom and respect for human rights.\nHowever, those legitimate demands can be attained\nsolely through a peaceful transition and dialogue, not\nviolence and foreign intervention, which will lead\nonly to more chaos, injustice and division, increasing\nthe number of refugees and exacerbating related\nhumanitarian consequences. Therefore, with regard\nto the Syrian crisis, Lebanon reaffirms its policy of\ndisassociation at the political and the security levels in\norder to maintain its stability and balance of powers and\nin order to avoid unnecessary repercussions and risks.\nLebanon has not refrained from providing\nhumanitarian support to the displaced Syrians in\nLebanon, in an effort to alleviate their suffering.\nHowever, Lebanon alone cannot deal with the\nincreasing number of displaced Syrians and their\nhumanitarian needs. We have provided assistance, but\nthe number of displaced persons has risen and exceeded\nour capacities. We can no longer absorb them on our\nown. More assistance by relevant international bodies\nis needed to help us in that regard.\nThe security repercussions of the Syrian crisis\nthreaten civic peace and stability at the local level\nand in the Middle East. The international community\nmust make greater efforts to reach a political solution\nbetween the parties in Syria, in order to put an end to\nthe violence that is claiming hundreds of innocent lives\nevery day.\nAs we support the freedom and legitimate rights\nof all people, we need to raise a crucial issue, namely,\nthe right of the fraternal Palestinian people to return\nto their homeland and to establish an independent\nPalestinian State, with Jerusalem as its capital. The\nrecognition of the Palestinian State and its acceptance\nas a full Member of this international Organization and\nits affiliated agencies should pave the way for a just\npolitical solution to the Palestinian question and correct\nthe ongoing historical injustice that has been inf licted\non the Palestinian people since 1948.\nLebanon is committed to maintaining stability\nand security in southern Lebanon, and we reaffirm\nour commitment to Security Council resolution 1701\n(2006). However, the continuous Israeli violations of\nLebanese sovereignty by air, land and sea \u2014 in excess\nof 9,000 violations since 2006 \u2014 are limiting the\nfreedom of action of the United Nations Interim Force\nin Lebanon (UNIFIL) and threatening the security\nof its members, once again violating international\nresolutions, specifically resolution 1701 (2006).\nWe appeal to the international community to\npressure Israel to respect international resolutions\nand international law, to immediately withdraw from\noccupied North Ghajar, the Shaba\u2019a farmlands and the\nKfar Shouba hills, and to bring to an end the continuous\nthreats to Lebanon\u2019s security. Lebanon values\nUNIFIL\u2019s role and its sacrifices, as well as its ongoing\ncooperation and coordination with the Lebanese army,\nand we express our gratitude to all participating and\nsupporting countries.\nLebanon calls for the full implementation of\nresolution 66/192, of 22 December 2011, regarding the\noil slick on its shores during the Israeli 2006 war on\nLebanon, and demands compensation, in application of\nparagraph 4 of that resolution.\nWe reiterate our commitment to defend our\nexclusive economic area and our maritime borders as\nset by international law and in accordance with the\nUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea,\nwhich affirms our right to exploit our wealth and\nnatural resources.\nLebanon, a vital crossroads of religions, beliefs,\ncultures and civilizations, is a country committed\nto divine and human values. We are fully aware that\ndiversity and difference are an integral part of life in\nour region and throughout the world. We reiterate our\ncommitment to freedom of expression, tolerance and\ndialogue. In the words of Pope John Paul II, Lebanon\nis not merely a country, it is a message. We consider\nprejudice towards all religions and prophets a clear\naggression against the dignity, values and feelings of\nall believers, for it can only instigate conflict, violence\nand reactions that we condemn and could never accept.\nNo one could accept them.\nWe therefore emphasize the importance and\nnecessity of dialogue between civilizations and\ncultures. Building trust and fostering rules of conduct\nbinding on all are essential to end once and for all the\ndesecration of religious symbols, as well as to ensure\nrespect for people\u2019s feelings and their freedom of belief.\nSuch efforts can put an end to the extreme reactions\nand condemnable practices that we have unfortunately\nwitnessed recently in certain countries. Respect for religion does not restrict freedom of expression; rather,\nit is a rational practice of such freedom.\nIn that spirit, Lebanon has launched a national\ndialogue among the different Lebanese constituencies\nbased on established national principles that were\nagreed on and developed under the Baabda Declaration\n(A/66/849, annex), which was welcomed by the Security\nCouncil. Dialogue is considered the best means for\nensuring stability in Lebanon.\nLebanon is committed to peace and strives for its\nachievement, especially in the Middle East, a region we\nwould like to be an oasis of peace, free of weapons of\nmass destruction. In that regard, we should remember\nthat Israel is the only country in the region to possess\nnuclear weapons and that it continues to refuse to\nratify the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\nWeapons, a position that constitutes an ongoing threat\nto peace and security in the region and the world at\nlarge.\nWe would like to emphasize once more the need\nfor a peaceful and diplomatic resolution of the Iranian\nnuclear issue, while stressing countries\u2019 right to use\nnuclear power for peaceful purposes and avoiding\ndouble standards and selectivity, a problem that is\nfaced by many regions in the world and by our region\nin particular. We also welcome ongoing international\nefforts to combat terrorism, the scourge of our time.\nThe peace we strive for is founded on what is\nright, not a fait accompli peace. The justice we strive\nfor, especially in our region, is far removed from the\nselectivity and double standards that are, unfortunately,\nthe case globally, especially in the Middle East. Our\nregion is still suffering from the consequences of the\nestablishment of the State of Israel, in 1948, and from\nits ongoing occupation of Arab territories in complete\ndisregard for international law and United Nations\nresolutions.\nPeace, freedom and justice are the pillars for\nattaining both security and stability. They will pave\nthe way to the eradication of oppression, extremism,\nhegemony and terrorism in our world. Stability cannot\nexist without a Palestinian spring, and a Palestinian\nspring can occur only through the full implementation\nof the Palestinians\u2019 right to self-determination on their\nland.\nThe Arab world is witnessing one of the most\ncritical periods of its modern history. We have reached a crossroads where societies must make choices that\nwill translate their ambitions into reality. We therefore\nrequest the international community to draw up a\nserious economic, cultural and development road\nmap to assist those countries in that newly reached\nbreakthrough. Our young Arab societies are in need of\nenlightenment and development that can be achieved\nonly by providing education and employment to put an\nend to ignorance and improve our living standards. That\nwill also certainly contribute to fighting extremism.\nWe therefore suggest that countries step forward\nwith their technical expertise while others offer\nfinancial assistance to draft a plan that could be\nimplemented through the framework of a new institution\nto assist young men and women working in public\nadministration to promote good governance, efficiency\nand productivity in governmental agencies. From\nthat perspective, I propose to establish an institution\nin Beirut that will soon be able to offer an integrated\nprogramme on good governance.\nAs the Middle East is witnessing the most tumultous\nperiod of its history, we call on the international\ncommunity to perceive Lebanon as the beacon of\nhope and message of freedom and pluralism that it is.\nLebanon is not merely a small nation in need of shelter\nin a stormy region, and we are not asking for protection\nto ensure our own survival. We are, rather, calling on\nthe Assembly to see us in the light of the role that we\nhave repeatedly played. Despite all the difficulties we\nare facing, our country, which is small geographically\nbut large in its global presence, has proved itself to be\nthe epitome of a democratic, tolerant and pluralistic\ncountry among its neighbours.\nIt is therefore the duty of the international\ncommunity to protect Lebanon, now and in the future,\nfrom the turbulence of the region and to help us so that\nwe may thrive, flourish and shine our rays all over\nthe Middle East. Only then will the United Nations\nprovide our unstable region with a genuine source of\ninspiration, a viable, vibrant nation, an example and\nmodel of civil and religious liberties, social diversity\nand political freedom.\nI call on all those here not to perceive Lebanon as a\nresponsibility but as an opportunity, an opportunity to\nprovide the safest and fastest path to all that the Middle\nEast can be \u2014 democratic, peaceful and prosperous.\nLet us work to protect Lebanon from harm so we can maintain peace in the Middle East and the world as a\nwhole."

        "file_text": "\ufeffFirst of all, let me congratulate His Excellency Mr. Vuk\nJeremi\u0107 on his election as President of the General\nAssembly at its sixty-seventh session, I wish him\nevery success in carrying out his important functions.\nIt is also a great pleasure to express my gratitude to\nHis Excellency Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser for\nhis successful, fruitful leadership of the work of the\nAssembly\u2019s previous session.\nIt would be difficult to say that the overall situation\nin the world has improved. We have not yet fully\nrecovered from one of the most serious global economic\ncrises in the past 65 years. Yes, the overall economic\nsituation is gradually normalizing. Proof of that is the\nimproving forecasts for world economic growth by key\ninternational organizations for this year. However, we\nshould point out that risks remain and that the recovery\nprocess is still very uncertain.\nIt is unfortunate that the world has not become\nany safer. We are seeing a rise in confrontations and\ntension in various parts of the world. Global climate\nchange, population growth against the background of\na deteriorating environment, the scarcity of natural\nresources and of access to drinking water, and many\nother problems are in the aggregate stoking tensions\nand the potential for conflict in areas of cooperation on\nthe international arena.\nTraditional ways of life are changing fast under the\nimpact of globalization processes. States are finding\nit increasingly hard to tackle modern challenges by\nthemselves because of the transborder nature of those\nchallenges. Terrorism, separatism, extremism, drugs,\ninformation wars \u2014 these are a kind of tumour for\nhumankind and cannot be eradicated at the local level\nalone.\n\nSadly, there are forces at work in the world that\nwish to drag humankind to the brink of the precipice,\nto kindle the flames of hostility wherever they go.\nOne glaring example is the video Innocence of\nMuslims, which symbolically appeared on the eve of\nthe General Assembly session. Kyrgyzstan condemns\nthe provocative nature of its content. It is unacceptable\nto insult anyone\u2019s religious sensibilities, regardless of\ntheir faith. Humanism, tolerance and mutual respect\nmake the world better and safer. Therefore, we also\nreject the use of force against diplomats \u2014 envoys of\npeace and a symbol of cooperation \u2014 of any country.\nHumankind is developing and changing fast.\nRegional, and even local, events can impact on global\nprocesses. In 2011, we observed with sympathy and\nsolidarity the events in the Middle East and North Africa.\nThe situation in Syria that we have seen this year can\nonly be a cause of serious concern for the international\ncommunity. All attempts to resolve the military conflict\nand restore stability to that county have, sadly, failed.\nWith regard to the thousands of civilian victims, the\nKyrgyz Republic strongly advocates a speedy end to the\nviolence in that country, the opening of a broad national\ndialogue between the political forces and a continuation\nof political and socioeconomic reform and participation\nof all Syrian citizens.\nThe Afghan factor continues to be a source of\nthreat to international security. There are concerns that\na full, swift drawdown of coalition forces could open\nthe way for destructive forces and the emergence of\nvarious extremist and terrorist groups in neighbouring\ncountries. Every stakeholder in the world can make\na contribution to the issue of security by reviving\nAfghanistan\u2019s economy and developing trade, economic,\ncultural and humanitarian ties with the country, as well\nas its communication infrastructure.\nSince 2001 Kyrgyzstan has played its part in that\nprocess, rendering assistance to the counter-terrorist\ncoalition in Afghanistan through the cargo Transit\nCenter at Manas International Airport. It is clear that\nthe counter-terrorist coalition, with the withdrawal\nof the military contingent from Afghanistan, must\nbring its mission to a logical conclusion to create the\nfoundation of a national administrative system for\nthat country so that all branches of power can be fully\nfunctional throughout the territory of Afghanistan.\nWe must do our utmost for the economic\nrehabilitation of Afghanistan by engaging it in the development of regional cooperation and implementing\njoint socioeconomic projects between international\norganizations and financial institutions. In that regard,\nKyrgyzstan is ready to expand trade and economic\nties to export electricity to Afghanistan as part of the\nCASA-1000 project, with the support of donor countries\nand the international financial institutions.\nThe peaceful development of Afghanistan is\nimpossible without eradicating the systemic, ubiquitous\ncultivation of opium in that country. For many years\nAfghanistan has been the biggest producer and exporter\nof drugs. The growing penetration of that deadly crop is\nharming the countries of Central Asia. Not only are they\non the northern transit route towards the countries of\nEurope and Asia, they are also progressively becoming\nconsumers.\nDrugs are the enemy of civilized humankind. Where\nthere are drugs, there are international organized crime\ngroups and transborder challenges. Easy money earned\nat the cost of people\u2019s lives has no productive basis. It\nbrings destruction and the degradation of human value.\nDrugs also spawn corruption and erode State systems\nfrom the inside. Criminal proceeds are used to bribe\nlaw enforcement bodies and the judiciary. They fund\ncorrupt politicians who seek power. The international\ncommunity must provide technical, economic and\nother support to Afghanistan\u2019s neighbours, including\nthe Central Asian countries, to build an effective\nshield to neutralize and localize drug trafficking from\nAfghanistan.\nWe believe that the mission of the United Nations,\nas the single universal multilateral Organization, is to\nbe on the front line in tackling all modern challenges\nand issues.\nWe should recognize that the global prevention\narchitecture, the international and regional security\nsystem of today, does not reflect the requirements of\nour time. It is unfortunate that despite the search for\nuniversal methods for mediation and peaceful conflict\nresolution, the international community still has not\nresolved those issues.\nThe need to reform the United Nations architecture\nand adapt it to the realities of the modern international\nsituation has not abated. A top priority is the reform\nof principal organs of the United Nations, namely, the\nSecurity Council and the Economic and Social Council.\nWe should point out that the tasks of those structures,\nin the light of the current international situation, require serious transformation and integration of\nfundamentally new approaches.\nIn terms of the reform of the United Nations, we\npropose the expansion of the membership of the Security\nCouncil to make it more representative, transparent and\ndemocratic. The reform should be based on principles\nof universality, efficiency and broad geographic\nrepresentation, particularly for those countries that\nhave not yet had the chance to take part in its work as\nnon-permanent members.\nAt the same time, we need to strengthen the\ncoordinating role of the Economic and Social Council\nas a global governance mechanism on issues of\nsustainable development, food security, humanitarian\nassistance, environmental cooperation and achievement\nof the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by the\n2015 deadline.\nThe current global situation dictates the need\nto consolidate the efforts of all countries to develop\ntangible action based on objective, fair ref lection of\ntheir interests and needs. On that basis, the Kyrgyz\nRepublic has submitted its candidature for the Economic\nand Social Council for the period 2013-2015. If elected\nby Member States to that organ with such enormous\npotential, the Kyrgyz Republic intends to play its part\nin tackling problems on the global agenda.\nThe problems of sustainable development\nand global climate change have presented serious\nchallenges in recent years, and the attention of\nthe international community must not slacken. In\nsupporting the global discussions on a green economy\nmodel that took place at the Rio+20 Conference on\nSustainable Development, Kyrgyzstan chose its future\npath towards long-term sustainable green development\nand an environment-minded economy. We would like\nto confirm our commitment to developing our economy\nthrough complying with requirements to protect our\nenvironment and with a safe approach to national\nresources, which are a national asset.\nAt Rio+20, the importance of development issues\nconcerning mountainous areas was acknowledged with\nregard to managing global natural resources, as was\nthe need for support for the sustainable development\nof mountain regions in developing countries. It should\nbe noted that despite the assistance of the international\nfinancial institutions, developing mountain States\ncontinue to suffer difficulties. High levels of poverty\nand isolation, increasing transport costs and large foreign debts comprise the main problems facing\nmountain countries. In that situation, it will be difficult\nto achieve the MDGs and attain the status set out in the\nUnited Nations documents on sustainable development.\nIn that respect, I wish to call attention to the\nimportance of the launching of international discussions\non the question of exchanging Kyrgyzstan\u2019s foreign\ndebt for sustainable development projects. We call on\nthe United Nations and its entities to render support on\nthat matter.\nBy the will of God, we gained independence 21\nyears ago. Previous leaders were unable to cope with\nthe task of building a truly independent Kyrgyzstan.\nThey could not build an effective, transparent State\nsystem for governing that would work for the benefit of\nthe people. Most of the important issues were tackled\nbehind closed doors, without informing society. For\nthe sake of personal enrichment and gain, some State\ndecisions were even taken to the detriment of national\ninterests.\nThe former Kyrgyz leaders declared a course for\ndemocracy that in fact did not take place. The former\nregimes established a clan-like system of governance\nthat f louted the principles of a free society and usurped\npower. They not only attempted to hand power down\nto their children, but brought the people to their knees\nmerely for the sake of their personal enrichment. The\nfreedom-loving people of Kyrgyzstan therefore carried\nout two revolutions, in 2005 and 2010, in response to\nthe unjust, tyrannical and authoritarian power.\nThe latest choice has proved a difficult one for our\npeople, despite our commitment to democratic values,\nwhich is almost hard-wired in the Kyrgyz people, part\nof their very heritage. Over 100 glorious sons of our\ncountry laid down their lives for democracy during the\nApril revolution of 2010. Their memory lives on. Also,\n1,500 people were injured.\nOver the past two years, our country has begun to\nimplement new, democratic governance. The Kyrgyz\npeople have chosen a parliamentary, presidential form\nof governance. We believe that was a just decision.\nAccording to impartial observers, our country has\nmade significant progress during the past year in terms\nof building a democratic State.\nWe began under difficult conditions. In the years\nof independence in Kyrgyzstan, industry virtually\nground to a halt. No new jobs were created. Labour migration grew. One third of the working population\nwas forced to find employment abroad. We were left\nwith ineffective public administration institutions,\nlow per-capita income, a reduced budget, rampant\ncorruption and organized crime, as well as unhampered\ndrug-trafficking from Afghanistan to the north, east\nand west.\nCurrently, we are waging an uncompromising\nstruggle against the corruption that is wearing away the\nState system from within. Civil servants who are found\nto be involved in corruption are being prosecuted under\nthe law. In modern Kyrgyzstan, there will be no caste\nof those whom the law does not touch.\nThe battle against corruption is already seeing\ntangible results. Senior State officials under\ninvestigation have been arrested, including members\nof Parliament, ministers, their deputies and others.\nLeaders of organized crime groups are either in prison\nor on the run outside of the country.\nWe are determined to extradite for prosecution\nthose people for whom international warrants have\nbeen issued. In the name of fairness, the former leaders\nof Kyrgyzstan, who have taken shelter in neighbouring\ncountries along with their inner circle, must be\nsanctioned in strict compliance with Kyrgyz legislation.\nKyrgyzstan stresses that they are being prosecuted not\nfor politically motivated acts, but for specific crimes\npunishable by law. They gave the orders to open fire on\npeaceful civilians and to destroy innocent people. They\npillaged their own people and the country\u2019s budget and\ntook enormous financial assets out of the country. They\nhave used criminal gains to buy villas, land and other\ncostly material goods. In such issues, punishment must\nbe just and inevitable so as to deter future leaders from\nrepeating such actions.\nTherefore, we still hope that the Byelorussian\nauthorities, partners of ours in the Collective Security\nTreaty Organization and the Eurasian Economic Union\nand who have assumed responsibilities under the Minsk\nand Kishinev Conventions, will show their commitment\nto their international legal obligations and extradite\nthe relatives and the retinue of the former President of\nKyrgyzstan, Kurmanbek Bakiyev, who have been hiding\nin their territory and even have Byelorussian passports.\nThe United Nations needs to establish clear standards\nand procedures to ensure justice at the international\nlevel, and especially for the return of illegally gained\nassets.\nKyrgyzstan is steadfastly building a parliamentary\ndemocracy, a direct authority that represents the\npeople, their wishes and their needs. At present, there\nare processes in place that are gradually bringing our\nsociety to a healthy state. Today, Parliament is engaged in\npolitical processes. Gradually, polemics and arguments\nare transitioning from street democracy to a civilized\nform for resolving any significant controversial issues\nwithin the walls of Parliament. Under the national\nConstitution, the Kyrgyz Parliament is the highest\nrepresentative body, carrying out the functions of\nlegislative authority and control. The Government is\nfully accountable to the Parliament.\nA major test, and at the same time an indicator, is the\nfact that since the adoption of the new Constitution in\n2011, we have seen the peaceful launch of all institutions\nof authority in accordance with the letter of the law. The\nmembers of Parliament have been elected. At the end of\n2011 we saw, for the first time in Kyrgyzstan\u2019s history,\na peaceful transfer of power from the President to the\nnewly elected Head of State, Almazbek Atambayev. A\nfunctioning coalition Government is in place.\nWe are reforming the judicial system, which must\nbe equitable and fully independent. Despite strong\nopposition from certain quarters who are not interested\nin seeing the successful conclusion of that issue,\nwe have, in the space of two years, launched a new,\ntransparent mechanism for the selection of judges. In\nmid-September, the Parliament approved the 25 judges\nof the Supreme Court. The selection of judges to the\nConstitutional Court and local courts is also under way.\nThe establishment of an independent judiciary\nis extremely important for us. It will allow us to\nachieve a just public administration in which every\ncitizen will be equal before the law. We are working\neffectively with the Office of the United Nations High\nCommissioner for Human Rights and other agencies on\nthe legal system and on improving legislation to ensure\neveryone\u2019s equality before the law.\nWith the participation of the Parliament, the\ncountry has undertaken planning and reforms in all\nspheres of the State system \u2014 in the justice system,\nlaw enforcement, taxation, oversight and others. All of\nthat requires stronger legislation. Kyrgyzstan is taking\nits first steps in the new format of a parliamentary\nrepublic. Sustainable development depends on the level\nof governance, on the rule of law and on human rights.\nWe believe in the bright future of our country and that\nvery soon all our countrymen will be able to say with\npride that they are the citizens of a strong, prosperous\nKyrgyzstan.\n\nOne can more clearly see the sanctity of our\nfatherland and our true values of independence from afar.\nI would like to appeal to my countrymen from the\nhighest podium in the world. Twenty years ago, God\ngranted us the independence that our ancestors had\ndreamed of for centuries, for which they had shed\ntheir blood and sacrificed their lives. The freedom that\nwas sent down to our people as a blessing should be\nstrengthened without division, by tireless effort and\nlabour united in harmony. Regardless of provocation\nby two-faced forces, we need to continue to strengthen\nthe path on which we set forth. Let us build a strong,\nunited beloved Kyrgyzstan. To reach a bright future we\nneed to continue to move forward. Life is a struggle\nbetween light and dark, good and bad. We need unity.\nWe need work and welfare, not animosity and discord.\nMay the Creator bless our nation as it moves towards\nbright goals.\n\nUnfortunately, our country is still weak and\neconomically dependent. We are not free in the choice\nof our foreign sources of energy, but that problem is\ngradually being tackled with the assistance of our\nstrategic partners. Kyrgyzstan needs the help of the\ninternational community to tackle the problem of\nour foreign debt, which is hampering the process of\neconomic growth of the State and the implementation\nof fundamental reforms.\nWe fully share what Secretary-General Ban\nKi-moon said here in his opening statement at the\nAssembly\u2019s sixty-seventh session, namely, that\ndeveloping States need support (see A/67/PV.1). We\nbelieve that developing democracies in particular need\nsupport from countries of the democratic club and\nfrom economically developed States. To consolidate\nparliamentary democracy, Kyrgyzstan vitally needs\nthe support of our principal partners for the complex\nreforms undertaken in restructuring or in writing off\nof Kyrgyzstan\u2019s State debt. I wish to stress that we\nhave a clear vision of how to conduct reforms and how\nto achieve development of the State. However, in the\nlight of the high deficit, we need significant additional\nresources, which we will certainly return once we have achieved development and prosperity in the country in\nthe coming years.\nWe are open to mutually beneficial, trusting\npartnerships and cooperation with all States. Kyrgyzstan\nhas great economic potential. We are an open country,\nwilling to engage in mutual dialogue. We have great\nindustrial and metallurgical potential. In Kyrgyzstan\nyou can find most of the elements on Mendeleev\u2019s table\nof elements.\nCritically important for many energy projects,\nwe have a highly qualified labour force and cheap\nelectricity. In the modern world, energy is the driver of\nprogress. Kyrgyzstan has huge hydroelectric potential,\nwhich we have begun to exploit. Every year we develop\naround 14 billion kilowatts per hour of electricity, which\nis not enough to satisfy the hydro-energy demand of\nKyrgyzstan, which is around 142.5 billion kilowatts per\nhour.\nOn 20 September, Kyrgyzstan and Russia concluded\nan agreement that is vital for the entire Central Asian\nregion on building and operationalizing the Kambar-\nAta and the Naryn Cascade power plants. Participation\nin building one of the biggest hydroelectric projects\nin Central Asia will include our neighbours in the\nregion and allow Kyrgyzstan not only to increase\nthe development of cost-effective, environmentally\nclean electricity but also to preserve the water in the\nfoothills that is currently supplying our neighbours\nduring the growing season. The benefit of the effective\nimplementation of such projects is clear. It will enhance\nour hydroelectric export potential and protect drinking\nwater for our neighbours. We invite all investors to take\npart in building those projects.\nTo conclude, I would like to note that the\ninternational community is undergoing a difficult\nperiod. Political and social upheavals are creating\nnumerous obstacles on the path to human development.\nWe are seeing a new era for the world order, combined\nwith new historical challenges and changes. At this\ncritical stage the Organization must continue its lofty\nmission to build peace and to achieve sustainable\ndevelopment throughout the world. Kyrgyzstan, in the\nspirit of solidarity and cooperation with the United\nNations, is prepared to play its part in tackling the\nmajor challenges of this day."

        "file_text": "\ufeffLast month, I visited\na refugee camp at the border between Turkey and Syria.\nI met children, women and men, who told me how they\nhad escaped the violence and suffering in their home\ncountry. They had f led the bloodshed of a regime that\nis using indiscriminate violence against its own people.\nThey had f led a country where children are being\ntortured, women raped and innocent civilians killed.\nThey had lost their friends, family and homes, but they\nhad not lost hope for a better future.\nOne of the people whom I met near the border was\nMedya, the 25-year-old mother of a five-year-old girl.\nShe had f led the city of Homs eight months earlier.\nNow, she travels back and forth between Homs and a\nrefugee camp in Turkey at great personal danger. She\nrisks her life to report to the world on the situation in\nSyria. Her reports are broadcast on major international\nnetworks.\nMedya told me about the terrible events that she had\nwitnessed. I was touched by her sorrow and impressed\nby her determination. Her strong desire for freedom is\nsomething to which we can all relate. Those who have\nstruggled for freedom do not give up easily. However,\nit is also clear that those refugees need the support of\nthe international community at large. They need food,\nshelter and security. Ultimately, they need an effective\nUnited Nations and a strong international legal order.\nPromoting the international legal order is enshrined\nin the Constitution of the Kingdom of the Netherlands.\nIt is a mission that we share with many in this Assembly.\nTogether with 49 other countries, we are helping to\nestablish legal order and security in Afghanistan, for\nexample. I want to pay tribute to the Dutch and the\nother men and women, soldiers and civilians, currently\nserving there.\nThe Hague, a city of peace and justice, is known\nfor its contribution to the international legal order. It\nis home to the International Court of Justice and the\nPermanent Court of Arbitration, which are both based at the Peace Palace. Next year, we will proudly celebrate\nits centenary. Former Secretary-General Boutros\nBoutros-Ghali recognized the role of the Netherlands\nin the international legal order by naming The Hague\nthe legal capital of the world.\nWe need international law to protect people,\nsocieties and nations, or, as former Secretary-General\nKofi Annan recently wrote, the United Nations Charter\nwas issued in the name of we the peoples, not we the\nGovernments. So we need a stronger international legal\norder, first, to preserve peace and security; secondly,\nto protect freedom; and thirdly, to promote prosperity.\nThat is the task that we face.\nA strong international legal order helps to preserve\npeace and security. To achieve that goal, we need\ngreater unity. I regret the persistent disagreement in the\nSecurity Council. It has prevented the United Nations\nfrom taking decisive action on Syria. The world is\nin desperate need of a strong, united and determined\nSecurity Council.\nMediation, arbitration and judicial settlement are\nindispensable for the peaceful settlement of conflicts.\nWe should cherish and develop those tools, as Deputy\nSecretary-General Jan Eliasson has so rightly said.\nBetter implementation of existing treaties on\nnon-proliferation, arms control and disarmament is of\nparamount importance.\nAn effective international legal order means that\ncountries are bound by their promises. Iran must\ncompletely fulfil its International Atomic Energy\nAgency obligations and abide by Security Council\nresolutions. The burden of proof is on Iran. As I said\nto my Iranian colleague, Minister Salehi, earlier this\nweek: You are the one to convince the world of the\npeaceful character of your nuclear programme \u2014 not\nus.\nThe international agendas on nuclear, chemical and\nconventional weapons must lead to concrete results and\nnew treaties. The United Nations and the Conference\non Disarmament in Geneva need to do better.\nThe Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical\nWeapons in The Hague will this year celebrate its\nfifteenth anniversary. It should stand ready to assist in\naddressing the chemical weapons problem in Syria.\nThe Netherlands will host the next Nuclear Security\nSummit, in 2014, as part of our efforts to enhance\nsecurity and fight nuclear terrorism. Negotiations on a robust and effective arms trade\ntreaty should recommence as soon as possible.\nA stronger legal order also promotes freedom. It\npromotes human rights, reinforces the responsibility to\nprotect and helps prevent atrocities. Greater freedom\nmeans equal rights for men and women alike. Women\nmake up 50 per cent of humankind. We need the full\n100 per cent of humankind. It is in every country\u2019s\nown interest to make sure that women are actively\ninvolved in society, the economy and politics. They\nmust participate in the power structures as leaders of\nthe world.\nHuman rights cannot be imposed from the outside.\nBut Governments carry the responsibility for observing\ntheir international human rights obligations and\ncommitments. There is therefore a need to communicate\nconstantly about the obligations and commitments.\nThe role of the Human Rights Council in promoting\nfreedom is crucial. We need to improve the way in which\nit functions. Countries that aspire to join the Council\nshould be genuinely committed to respecting human\nrights. I am proud to reiterate our genuine commitment\nand to announce the Dutch candidature for the Human\nRights Council from 2015 to 2017.\nPeople should be free to live their lives in peace\nand security. Therefore, every State has an obligation to\nprevent aggression, genocide, crimes against humanity\nand war crimes. Prevention is key. But if countries\ncannot or will not act, the international community has\na responsibility to protect.\nA strong international and domestic legal order\npromotes prosperity and, let me state it emphatically,\neconomic growth. Trade, investment, innovation and\neconomic development will all benefit from a stable,\npredictable and rules-based business climate.\nThe economy cannot thrive in societies where\nhuman rights are violated, corruption is rampant and\nGovernment revenues are wasted. That is one of the\nlessons of the Arab awakening. Sustainable prosperity\nand sustainable economic growth depend upon a strong,\nlegitimate and reliable legal order.\nFor that matter, free trade agreements and a well-\nfunctioning World Trade Organization are crucial for\nstimulating growth. According to the World Bank, a\nnew global trade deal would increase global welfare\ntremendously.\n\nA good way to promote foreign direct investment\nis by enhancing arbitration and conflict resolution\nmechanisms. The Permanent Court of Arbitration in\nThe Hague has an increasingly important role to play.\nProtecting intellectual property rights effectively\nfosters innovation. We should therefore strengthen the\nWorld Intellectual Property Organization.\nFinally, the Millennium Development Goals need a\nnew agenda, with bold ideas to end poverty and plans to\npromote sustainable development and foster economic\ngrowth. The private sector is crucial to achieving\nthose goals, especially when it comes to unlocking the\npotential of small and medium-sized enterprises. To\nquote renowned economist Paul Collier, \u201cWe cannot\nmake poverty history unless the countries of the bottom\nbillion start to grow\u201d.\nThe United Nations is indispensable for the agenda\nof peace, freedom and prosperity. The widening gap\nbetween the increasing expectations we have of the\nUnited Nations, on the one hand, and of its capacity\nto deliver, on the other, is a cause of serious concern.\nTherefore, we need a more effective, efficient and\ncoherent United Nations.\nThe Security Council must act decisively when\nserious crimes are involved and international peace and\nsecurity are at stake. All United Nations organizations\nshould deliver as one. The Secretary-General\u2019s reform\nproposals must be implemented.\nEmerging Powers rightly ask for more influence,\ndue to new political and economic realities. The\nSecurity Council should be reformed while taking those\nrealities into account. At the same time, the larger share\nof those emerging Powers in the world economy should\nbe reflected in the relative contributions of Member\nStates to the United Nations budget.\nThe Members of the United Nations need to take\naction in five areas. First, countries should respect\nuniversal human rights without distinction. That\nkey principle also applies to lesbian, gay, bisexual\nand transgender individuals. Secondly, the rights of\nreligious minorities should be guaranteed all over the\nworld. Governments should protect religious groups\nagainst violence. Thirdly, countries should recognize\nthe compulsory jurisdiction of the International Court\nof Justice, as the Secretary-General has requested.\nFourthly, countries should adhere to the principle of\nthe responsibility to protect. That applies to prevention, protection and prosecution. Fifthly, countries that have\nnot done so to date should join the International Criminal\nCourt. That will ensure that civilians are protected and\nthe perpetrators of atrocities are prosecuted.\nThat takes me back to Syria. The Syrian crisis\nhighlights the mounting challenges of the United\nNations and its States Members. I applaud the active\nstance of the Secretary-General with regard to Syria.\nThe Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian\nAffairs, the World Food Programme, the Office of\nthe United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees\nand many other organizations are providing crucial\nassistance to the victims of the violence. I want to pay\nexplicit tribute to the Governments of Turkey, Lebanon\nand Jordan for their invaluable efforts to alleviate the\nsuffering of the thousands of refugees.\nIn conclusion, for me, meeting \u041cedya, that\ncourageous Syrian journalist and mother, has given a\nvoice to those refugees. I hope that I will meet Medya,\nthat 25-year-old mother of a five-year-old child, again\nin the near future in Homs, Syria. I want to see her live\nin an inclusive and prosperous Syria, where democracy\nand human rights replace terror and violence. It is about\ndemocracy and human rights. That is our aim. I want\nto see her live in a Syria where jobs and economic\nopportunities have replaced poverty and despair.\nThat woman, \u041cedya, has already shown the courage\nand the will to contribute to Syria\u2019s future. Together,\nwe, the peoples of the United Nations, should show\nthat same courage. Together, we must preserve peace,\nprotect freedom and promote prosperity. Together, let\nus build a stronger international legal order."

        "file_text": "\ufeffYou now preside, Sir, over\na forum for every voice \u2014 an Assembly of all people and\nnations, one for no country or bloc to dominate solely\nor lead as one alone, where small and medium-sized\ncountries are truly heard. Australia warmly welcomes\nyour election.\nThe story of the United Nations is truly global,\nencompassing all the people of the world. It is a story of\nthe progress of small and medium-sized countries, not\njust of great Powers. It is a story of reconstruction after\nworld war and of the resettlement of massing millions,\nof navigating the winds of change and of the end of\ncolonialism, bringing self-determination to the world\u2019s\ngreat majority, the billions of the global South. It is\nthe story of harnessing new sources of wealth and new resources through a revolution of rising expectations\nand during decades of dictatorship, famine and war. It\nis the story of bringing to justice the perpetrators of\nthe worst international crimes and of preventing the\nworst human atrocities. Now, extending freedom and\nharnessing new markets, it is the story of lifting billions\nmore out of poverty and oppression. That has been the\nwork of the United Nations for seven decades.\nThis year we assemble in the knowledge born of\nthose years, neither expecting perfection nor accepting\nthe status quo. We understanding that there is much that\nwe can do together, and more that we can do together\nthan we could ever do alone.\nThe United Nations articulates humankind\u2019s\nhighest ideals. Even more, it makes practical progress\ntowards realizing those ideals in the world. There\nis no better example of that than the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) \u2014 specific, measurable\ntargets of the highest human importance that are now\nfamiliar to us all. Twelve years after 2000 and three\nyears from 2015, the progress we have made must\nbe just as familiar. The global economy has grown.\nHundreds of millions of people have lifted themselves\nup. That first fundamental Goal, to halve the proportion\nof the world\u2019s population living in extreme poverty, has\nnow been achieved: 1 billion human lives transformed.\nA decade ago 100 million children did not get to go\nto school. That number has been reduced by fully one\nthird, and 33 million human futures have been entirely\nremade.\nBut we must all acknowledge that there are vital\nareas where the international community is failing to\nachieve change. That is why I accepted the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s invitation to co-chair the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals Advocacy Group alongside\nRwanda: to advocate for practical progress in the\ncoming three years. Where the world has fallen short\nof ambitious goals, our response must be action, not\ndisillusion. That is what Australia will do. We will act.\nWe will help improve education. Australia\u2019s\ndevelopment spending on education doubled in the\npast five years. We will be among the world\u2019s largest\neducation donors in 2015. I am especially pleased to join\nas an education champion in support of the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s Education First initiative to mobilize global\nsupport to help achieve education for all children by\n2015. I am honoured to lend it Australia\u2019s support.\n\nWe will help increase gender equality. I am proud\nto announce that at the Pacific Islands Forum Australia\nsaid that it would work alongside our partners in the\nPacific on an unprecedented gender initiative: Pacific\nWomen Shaping Pacific Development. Australia will\nprovide $320 million over 10 years to support women\u2019s\npolitical participation, to expand women\u2019s leadership\nand to spread economic and social opportunities in\nthe Pacific. That is a principle underpinning every\nAustralian aid intervention and initiative: empowering\nwomen and girls.\nWe will help fight drug-resistant malaria. The\nSecretary-General has made malaria one of his key\npriorities for his second term. It is a priority we share.\nSince 2000, the world has cut the number of deaths\nfrom malaria by 26 per cent. Without those advances,\n330,000 more people would have died of malaria last\nyear, the great majority of them in Africa. But malaria\nitself is fighting back. New drug resistance in malaria\nmust be overcome. Later this year, Australia will hold\nthe Malaria 2012 meeting, bringing together political\nleaders, civil society and the private sector to accelerate\nefforts to control and eliminate malaria and combat\ngrowing drug resistance.\nWhile we are working hard to realize the MDGs in\nthe next three years, Australia is looking further ahead.\nThe year 2015 is a goal, but it is not a destination. Rather,\nit must be a new point of departure for much new work.\nAustralia pledges to contribute to the important work\nof the high-level panel on the post-2015 development\nagenda.\nAustralia brings considerable national experience\nin working with conflict-affected States and least\ndeveloped countries, especially in our own region. We\nwill seek to apply what we have learned in our work since\n2000 to the world\u2019s plans for beyond 2015. First, peace\nis an essential foundation to development, and building\npeace is vital to the progress of societies recovering from\nconflict. Peacekeepers today must be peacebuilders,\nnot just stopping conflict but enabling development.\nSecondly, there can be no poverty alleviation without\nthe creation of wealth and jobs. Growth alone is never\nsufficient; but to achieve development in the interests\nof all people we must create jobs and wealth. Thirdly,\nwe cannot make poverty history unless we also consign\nto history the argument that environmental protection\nand human development are conflicting global goals.\nClimate change threatens the security of the food supply that guarantees development. New, clean sources of\nenergy deliver a new source of economic growth.\nAustralia is one of the world\u2019s most successful\nmulticultural and multi-faith nations. The Australian\nexperience proves a deeply important fact. There is\nnothing natural or inevitable about violent conflict over\nreligious belief. We must reaffirm that again today.\nThe denigration of religious beliefs is never acceptable.\nAustralia seeks to be an example of freedom for all\nfaiths, and we support that in the wider world. However,\nour tolerance must never extend to tolerating religious\nhatred and incitement to violence. Whether such\nattitudes lead to attacks against members of religious\nminorities or diplomats or to attacks against houses of\nworship or diplomatic missions, the perpetrators of all\nsuch violence must be brought to justice and all such\nincitement must be condemned. Australia condemns\nviolence and we work for peace.\nWe proudly do our full part in the work of the\nUnited Nations for peace and security. We stringently\nobserve Security Council resolutions aimed at\ncurtailing weapons proliferation activities, like those\nof North Korea. We take the leading role in the United\nNations Integrated Mission in Timor-Leste. We lead\nthe Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands,\nwhich operates with the United Nation\u2019s endorsement.\nAnd we have been the largest non-NATO contributor\nto the United Nations-mandated International Security\nAssistance Force in Afghanistan. Australia will bring\nthat record of service to the international community\nto our service on the Security Council, should we\nhave the privilege to be elected by the United Nations\nmembership in October. There and beyond, our work\nand the work of every nation for peace must continue.\nAs we meet, the Syrian Government is turning\nthe instruments of State power against the very people\nwhom State power ought to protect, employing heavy\nweapons and ground-attack aircraft against civilians\nand engaging in systematic human rights abuses.\nSyria\u2019s neighbours \u2014 in particular Jordan, Turkey,\nLebanon and Iraq \u2014 are burdened by growing numbers\nof refugees and are delivering vital help to desperate\npeople.\nThe United Nations has done important work\nalready. Australia is doing its part to help through\nhumanitarian aid. We must do everything we can to end\nthe suffering of the Syrian people and to rebuild Syrian\nsociety. Those who are committing crimes against humanity must be held accountable. The international\ncommunity must unite behind Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi,\nthe Joint Special Representative of the United Nations\nand the League of Arab States for Syria. We urge the\nmembers of the Security Council to do so and to act\ndecisively.\nThe international community must also unite in\nguarding against the proliferation of weapons of mass\ndestruction. It is now six years since the Security\nCouncil first expressed concern about Iran\u2019s nuclear\nweapons programme. Iran still refuses to take the urgent\nsteps necessary to build confidence that its nuclear\nprogramme is exclusively peaceful. In contravention\nof successive International Atomic Energy Agency and\nSecurity Council resolutions, Iran is moving closer to\nhaving the capacity to produce weapons-grade material.\nWe therefore stand with the world, united in\nsending a strong signal, through Security Council\nsanctions, that Iran must change its behaviour now. A\nnuclear-armed Iran would be a major threat to regional\nand global security, especially given the shocking and\naggressive statements about Israel by Iran\u2019s leadership.\nThere remains the opportunity for diplomacy, backed\nup by robust sanctions, to persuade Iran to change its\ncourse. Iran must take this opportunity for change, and\nthe nations of the Assembly must press it to do so.\nThere must also be change in the Middle East peace\nprocess. Australia shares the frustration of the parties\nat the current impasse.\nWe understand the strong desire of the Palestinian\npeople for national self-determination. Australia\nis resolutely committed to the establishment of a\nPalestinian State that is both independent and viable.\nThat is why we provide significant support to the\nfoundations of a future Palestinian State and build its\ninfrastructure and economy. More than $300 million in\naid has been provided for the period from 2011 to 2016.\nWe commend the genuine progress President Abbas\nand Prime Minister Fayyad have made in building\nthe institutions and infrastructure for statehood. And\nno one can doubt Australia\u2019s close and continuing\nfriendship with Israel. Our support for the right of\nIsrael and its people to exist in security and peace is a historic commitment in Australian policy, and it will\nendure.\nWe urge a return to direct negotiations and that\nthose negotiations be between the two parties. That is\nthe only durable basis for achieving a two-State solution.\nThe present impasse must be overcome. Both sides\nneed to make compromises and avoid provocations. It\nwill take sacrifice on both sides to settle complex and\ndifficult issues such as settlements, borders, security\nand Jerusalem. The Israeli and Palestinian people\ndeserve no less.\nAustralia\u2019s ideals in the world are those of the\nUnited Nations, and Australians know the practical\nvalue of the United Nations work. That is why Australia\nseeks to serve in all the work of the United Nations and\non the Security Council. We are a strong democracy,\nwelcoming all the peoples, languages and religions\nof the world. We are a country of the Asia-Pacific, a\nneighbour to developing countries, with a perspective\nof both the North and South. We are a State with a\ndecades-long tradition of capable and committed work\nin the United Nations. We contributed to the first\nUnited Nations peacekeeping force in 1947, and we lead\ncontemporary peacebuilding in our own region.\nWe support the development of new norms to\nenable the United Nations and its States Members to\nact to prevent atrocities and to make the perpetrators of\nthe worst crimes accountable for them. We act as a first\nresponder to humanitarian need, as a donor who stays\nthe course and as a partner in rebuilding after conflict.\nAustralia embraces the high ideals of the United Nations\nand takes a practical approach to achieving change. The\nwork of the United Nations is a historic task in which\nAustralia wholeheartedly joins."

        "file_text": "\ufeffAt the outset,\nI would like to address my warmest congratulations\nto Mr. Vuk Jeremi\u0107 on the confidence that the entire\nUnited Nations family has invested in him by electing\nhim to the high office of President of the General\nAssembly at its sixty-seventh session.\nI would also like to take this opportunity to reiterate\nTogo\u2019s support to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for\nall of the work that he continues to undertake in order to\npromote peace in the world. We appreciate the immense\nefforts that he is pursuing in Africa and many other\nregions of the world in order to find a peaceful outcome\nto the conflicts that they face by prioritizing dialogue,\nmediation and cooperation.\nThe choice of the peaceful settlement of disputes as\nthe central theme of this session is a wise choice, and I\nwelcome it. Indeed, it allows us, in the complex world\nwe live in today, to reconnect with the original purpose\nand founding values of the United Nations. Over the\ndecades, our Organization has taken it upon itself to\nrespond to the many challenges posed by a world that\nis constantly changing. It remains present and active in\nall the areas that present opportunities for progress by\nhumankind.\nHowever, in spite of our efforts and the progress\nthat has been achieved, here and there, in the areas\nof technology, economy and social issues, we note,\nunfortunately, that force continues to be used all\ntoo frequently in international relations. On many\noccasions, recourse to the use of armed force has been\nchosen before all avenues for the peaceful means of\ndispute resolution have been exhausted.\nThe African continent, unfortunately, has paid and\ncontinues to pay a heavy price when it seeks to save\ntime by prematurely cutting short the process for the\npeaceful settlement of disputes. Yet, experience has\nshown that even in the rare cases where recourse to the\nuse of weapons has allowed one of the parties to the\nconflict to quickly prevail over the other, lasting peace\nand stability have not been achieved.\nThat is why my country, Togo, welcomes the fact\nthat the sixty-seventh session of the General Assembly\ngives all of us the opportunity to revisit the original\nvalues of the United Nations Charter in order to better\nguide our work in dealing with the challenges of our\ncontemporary world. Indeed, perhaps it is time to put\ndialogue among nations at the centre of the international\nagenda again. But today we need to go further, and also make dialogue within nations an important component\nof our efforts to achieve peace. Dialogue within nations\nis in fact an indispensable corollary of dialogue among\nnations. It should be encouraged and cultivated in the\nsame vein, because it is the prelude to preserving peace\namong nations.\nIndeed, since the contemporary world is marked by\ninterdependence, when misunderstandings degenerate\ninto internal conflicts because there is no dialogue, it is\nrare that they do not have repercussions in neighbouring\ncountries. The Syrian crisis and the climate of growing\ninsecurity in the Sahel-Sahara region are textbook\nexamples.\nThat is why I would like to urge our common\nOrganization and its Member States to persevere in\nthe efforts already under way to make dialogue within\nnations a cornerstone of their conflict-prevention work\nin the world. Before all else, encouraging dialogue\nwithin nations comes down to adopting a constructive\napproach that strives to promote universal values\nwhile taking into account the realities specific to each\ncountry, as well as local and regional specificities. It\nis also a matter of making citizens, whatever country\nthey live in, responsible through various means for the\nculture of peace, for listening to one another and for a\nsense of compromise in order to make dialogue a cross-\ncutting value in our modern societies.\nWith that in mind, the West African Economic\nand Monetary Union \u2014 over which Togo is honoured\nto preside and which now enjoys observer status in the\nGeneral Assembly \u2014 decided at its May 2012 meeting\nin Lom\u00e9 to give higher priority to matters of peace\nand security than to purely economic issues. That\nnovel move by a regional economic organization is\nfundamentally guided by the desire to make dialogue a\npriority tool for conflict prevention.\nIn that regard, I remain profoundly convinced that\ndecentralization of conflict prevention and resolution\nthat makes use of the contribution of subregional\norganizations is one of the most viable options for\npeacekeeping in the world. The proximity of such\nbodies to the geographic areas of conflict and to their\nhistorical and cultural roots is a major asset that should\nbe maximized in conflict prevention and the settlement\nof disputes.\nStill, the increased responsibility of subregional\norganizations should not be a pretext to justify a kind of\ndisguised renunciation of our collective responsibility in the area of promoting peace and security in the\nworld. As Members of the United Nations, we do not\nhave that choice, because the community of values\nthat unites us is a permanent call to promote solidarity\nand even complementarity between the specific\ngoals of subregional organizations and the search for\nuniversality that is the very foundation of the United\nNations.\nOn that point, it should be noted that the protocol\nestablishing a Peace and Security Council in the\nAfrican Union in 2002 created a great deal of hope\nat the time. Modelled on the Security Council of the\nUnited Nations, that new institutional tool was intended\nto enable the African Union to intervene directly in\ncountries in crisis. Sadly, recent experiences, whether\nin Libya or C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, have shown that, faced with\nthe antagonisms that characterize the international\ncommunity, that tool has not been able to fulfil our\nexpectations. Those modest beginnings confirm the\nurgent need for close cooperation between regional\npeacekeeping mechanisms and the system established\ndecades ago by the United Nations to ensure collective\ninternational security.\nFrom that point of view, I would like to join my\nvoice to those of previous speakers to invite the entire\ninternational community to assist all the institutional\nplayers who are proceeding with good will to help Mali\nin its determination to recover its territorial integrity as\nquickly as possible and to help that country re-establish\npeace so that the transition period can be successful.\nThat obligation of solidarity is a call to all of us.\nRecent events in the north of the African continent have\nonce again exposed the sad reality that the reduction of\ntension and the prevention and settlement of internal\ndisputes all too often involve elements that extend well\nbeyond individual States.\nDrawing on its experience of the past two decades,\nwhich were marked by major political shocks, and\nhonoured to sit as a non-permanent member of the\nSecurity Council, Togo resolutely joins the dynamic of\nthe continuing search for peace focusing on dialogue\nand cooperation. In that regard, on behalf of my\ncompatriots, and from this high rostrum, I would\nlike to salute the United Nations, other international\norganizations and all friendly nations and partners of\ngoodwill who recently helped the Togolese people set\nout on the path of dialogue to overcome the weight of\nthe past. That wise choice enabled us to embark on the construction of a new country, one reconciled with\nitself and facing out onto the world.\nOur feeling of gratitude is all the more profound\nbecause we have been able to see in just a few years\nthe economic and social progress that the Togolese\npeople can achieve on their own, now that they are\nliving in peace and harmony among themselves, with\ntheir neighbours and with the rest of the world. We have\nrenewed our economic growth and are intensifying\nour efforts to ensure better political and economic\ngovernance through sweeping institutional and\nconstitutional reforms. We intend to implement them\nout of respect for the republican agenda.\nFrom one year to the next, public freedoms have\ntaken root in Togo. Political pluralism, which is deeply\ningrained in Togolese customs, has a natural ally in the\nacknowledged right of all citizens to demonstrate in\ncomplete freedom, so long as they respect prevailing\nrules.\nThe challenge in Togo today is to consolidate\neconomic recovery, to promote a firm foundation for\ndemocracy and the rule of law, and to promote the\nindivisibility of human rights in order to propel the\ncountry towards new gains, particularly in the social\narena, where expectations are both numerous and\nurgent. Of course, the progress made in recent years\nin the economic, political and social realms is still\nfragile. That is why the Government remains alert\nto the different views expressed on the best ways to\nconsolidate that progress. We have opted to make the\nsearch for consensus a central axis for managing the\naffairs of State.\nIn that same spirit, the Togolese Government is\nworking to build on the excitement that has gripped\nthe country\u2019s political class on the eve of legislative\nelections. Now that dialogue has been reopened, I\nhave good reason to hope that it will lead to broader\nmembership in that class so that its conclusions will\nbe accepted by all. Our immediate priority is to hold\nsuccessful, free, peaceful and transparent legislative\nelections. Indeed, we aim to raise Togo to the ranks\nof those countries that have managed to eradicate the\nsyndrome of violence before, during and after elections.\nNonetheless, we must recognize that such violence has\nunfortunately turned elections into a cause of mortality\nin various regions of the world.\nThat scourge has caused so much damage on the\nAfrican continent, in both the loss of human lives and in material destruction, that it is urgent to do everything\nto prevent its reappearance in Togo or elsewhere. That\nis both an individual and a collective responsibility. We\nshould leave no stone unturned in the struggle that has\nbeen launched at all levels to prevent the elections from\nbeing synonymous with violence and chaos.\nCivil society has an important role to play in that\ncrucial area. States must help civil society to better\norganize itself in order to play its full role and to become\na type of citizens\u2019 watch that can truly contribute to the\nevolution of human societies. However, in return, those\norganizations must demonstrate their probity and lack\nof bias. They must also refrain from aligning themselves\nwith belligerent factions or fighting for the cause of the\nprotagonists in political battles. Civil society must not\nbe a Trojan horse for political groups.\nMr. Charles (Trinidad and Tobago), Vice-President,\ntook the Chair.\nBecause of their proximity to citizens, the\norganizations of civil society must free themselves\nfrom political cliques so as to contribute to the rapid\ndevelopment of human societies in key areas of\neconomic and social life. In that regard, I welcome\nthe decision taken several years ago to encourage\ncitizen action by accrediting to the Economic and\nSocial Council those organizations that have been\nrecognized for their usefulness. That is a judicious\nway to encourage, within those citizen organizations,\na heightened awareness of their responsibilities when\nfacing today\u2019s major challenges, economic crises,\nenvironment crises and the aspirations to democracy\nand freedoms that, although they assume new forms,\nshould not obstruct the momentum of our societies.\nThe peoples\u2019 fight for more open and democratic\nsocieties should not dissipate at the borders of nation\nStates. That fight must extend to the international level,\nin which the rules of the game must also continue to\nevolve in order to take into account the major changes\nthat have taken place since the creation of the United\nNations. And yet, since 1945, the basic rules that govern\nthe functioning of the Security Council have literally\nbeen frozen in an immobility that is increasingly\nappalling. It is obvious that maintenance of the status\nquo in a context of profound change cannot fail to\ngenerate serious dysfunctions. The Council\u2019s incapacity\nto agree on certain major cases of great importance\nis a perfect illustration, and again sharply raises the\nquestion of reform of that body, which is at the heart of the entire United Nations system. That process, which\nhas countless times been broached and put off for later,\ntoday deserves full and immediate attention.\nThus, Togo would like to solemnly reaffirm its\nsteadfast support for the African Union initiative\nthat seeks to grant the African continent, following\nthe modalities that have not yet been defined, more\nadequate representation within the United Nations\nSecurity Council. I firmly believe that it is up to the\nnations that have always had the privilege of having\na permanent seat on the Council to take a small step\nthat would allow all of humankind to make a giant leap\nforward. That gesture seems essential to me because\nit is a sine qua non for generating a new dynamic that\nwould allow us to collectively deliver more coordinated,\nbolder and determined responses and to thus forge a\nglobal governance that is more mature and more free,\nwith greater analytical capacity."

        "file_text": "\ufeffFirst and foremost, I\nwould like to congratulate Mr. Jeremi\u0107 on his well-\ndeserved election as President of the General Assembly\nat its sixty-seventh session. His country, Serbia, and\nMyanmar have traditionally enjoyed a close friendship\nand cooperation. Under his able leadership, the General\nAssembly will hold deliberations on measures to\naddress the challenges faced by the world today. I am\nconfident that his great wisdom, rich experience and\ngreat diplomatic skills will guide our discussions to\nproduce the desired outcomes.\nI would also like to take this opportunity to extend\nour sincere thanks and appreciation to his predecessor,\nHis Excellency Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser, for his\noutstanding leadership at the sixty-sixth session.\nMyanmar consistently pursues an independent and\nactive foreign policy, a basic tenet of which is to actively\ncontribute to the maintenance of international peace\nand security. In so doing, we encourage efforts to settle\ndifferences among nations by peaceful and amicable\nmeans. Our position is consistent with the essence of\nthe theme of the current session, namely, \u201cBringing\nabout adjustment or settlement of international disputes\nor situations by peaceful means\u201d.\nThere are different views and assessments regarding\nthe outcome of the United Nations Conference on\nSustainable Development, held in Brazil in June. A\nnumber of important decisions were taken on various\nissues, such as the renewal of commitments, the\nlinkage of sustainable development to the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals, renewable energy and the\nestablishment of arrangements for better coordination\non sustainable development. Member States must turn those decisions into actions in order to leave the legacy\nof a safe and sustainable environment to our future\ngenerations.\nSince becoming a Member State, Myanmar has\nalways adhered to the founding principles of the United\nNations. Our participation in the General Assembly\nhere in New York amply demonstrates our commitment\nto active participation in, and support of, the work of\nthe Organization.\nToday\u2019s world is full of new challenges and\nopportunities. Urbanization and industrialization\nare taking place in developing countries on an\nunprecedented scale. Rapid progress in information\ntechnology gives the impression that our world is\ngetting smaller. Meanwhile, the natural environment\nand the climate are facing new threats and challenges.\nIn short, the world is changing as never before. It is\nalso timely and appropriate to devote attention during\nthe current session to issues such as the post-2015\ndevelopment agenda and the rule of law.\nMyanmar is moving forward on the democratic\npath, but that has not been an easy task. I would therefore\nlike to take this opportunity to share our experiences\nin that regard. In the ongoing reform process, we face\nchallenges as well as opportunities. Within a short time,\nthe people of Myanmar have brought about remarkable\nchanges. I feel greatly privileged and honoured to\ndutifully serve the people as their President at this\ncrucial time in the history of our nation. I truly consider\nmy people as my own parents and elders.\nSince I took office some 18 months ago, the\nparliament, the judiciary, the armed forces, the ethnic\ngroups, the political parties, civil society and the people\nat large have been taking tangible and irreversible steps\nin the democratic transition and reform process. Leaving\nbehind a system of authoritarian Government, in which\nthe administrative, legislative and judicial powers were\ncentralized, we have now established a democratic\nGovernment and a strong and viable parliament that\nfollows a practice of checks and balances.\nDespite the challenges, we can now see encouraging\nprogress and significant developments in the country.\nThose include the granting of amnesties to prisoners; the\ndignified return of exiled political forces; the successful\nconvening of the 2012 by-elections in a free, fair and\ntransparent manner; the abolition of media censorship;\nfreedom of access to the Internet; the establishment of worker and employer organizations; and increased\nparticipation by the people in the political process.\nAt the current stage of the political process, we\ncan see the emergence of democratic traits, such as\nthe increasing participation of various political forces\nand their mutual tolerance, magnanimity, the expanded\nscope of political participation, representation and\naccountability. Our Government and other stakeholders\nhave fostered a new political culture of tolerance and\ndialogue.\nThe former main opposition leader, Nobel laureate\nDaw Aung San Suu Kyi, now participates in parliament,\nnot only in her capacity as a member but also as\nChairperson of the parliamentary Rule of Law and\nStability Committee. She is also in New York this week.\nAs a Myanmar citizen, I would like to congratulate her\non the honour that she has received in this country in\nrecognition of her efforts for democracy.\nOur country\u2019s political progress is strengthening\nits political legitimacy. That, in turn, facilitates the\nestablishment of basic political stability, thereby paving\nthe way for the economic and social transformation\nnecessary for better living standards for the people.\nThe legislative body has also developed well and\nfunctions more effectively at every sitting. Parliament\nhas now adopted landmark laws through democratic\npractices. We are promulgating laws and by-laws,\ntaking into account the fact that economic development\nmust not widen the gap between the rich and the poor.\nThe rights of citizens must be protected. The natural\nenvironment must be preserved. Our workers should\nenjoy rights in line with international standards. We give\ncarefull consideration to investments in the extractive\nsectors, such as energy, to ensure transparency and\nimpartiality.\nWe believe that the cessation of all armed conflicts\nis a prerequisite to building genuine democracy. As\nsuch, we place high priority on achieving lasting peace\nin the country. In accordance with our motto \u201cFrom war\nto peace\u201d, we are striving to put an end to the long-\nstanding problems in regions inhabited by our ethnic\ngroups. To date, we have reached ceasefire agreements\nwith 10 armed groups. We will continue the peace\ntalks, while further strengthening confidence-building\nmeasures. Peace negotiations at the national level will\nthen continue towards a final peace agreement, which\nwould completely end the armed hostilities. In order to redress the situation in northern\nMyanmar, leaders of the Union Peace-making Work\nCommittee and the Kachin armed group are holding\ninformal consultations and are working to further\nstrengthen confidence-building measures. We consider\nany loss of life and property on either side in the armed\nconflict as a loss for the country.\nWhile the Government is resolutely pursuing\npolitical, social and economic reforms, some\nunfortunate and unexpected issues have arisen. A case\nin point is the recent communal violence in Rakhine\nState. In that connection, I would like to mention in\nthe first place that the people inhabiting our country,\nregardless of race, religion and gender, have the right to\nlive in peace and security.\nAs the Assembly is aware, an independent\nnational-level investigation commission has been\nestablished to look into the issue. To ensure impartiality,\nthe commission is composed of representatives from all\nstrata of society, including widely respected personalities\nfrom the Buddhist, Muslim, Christian and Hindu faiths.\nUpon completion of its task, the commission will submit\nits findings and recommendations to me.\nDemonstrating our determination to resolve the\nissue in a transparent manner, we have facilitated field\nvisits to Rakhine State by representatives from the\nOrganization of Islamic Cooperation, the Association\nof Southeast Asian Nations, United Nations agencies,\nthe United States and resident foreign diplomats\nin Myanmar. Access is being facilitated to those\norganizations that are willing to provide relief\nassistance to both communities without discrimination.\nThe issue at hand cannot be resolved overnight. It\nwill be resolved by taking short-term and long-term\nmeasures through a multifaceted approach, taking\ninto account political, economic and social aspects. I\nsincerely believe that as an independent and sovereign\nState, Myanmar has done the right thing to secure our\nborders and to safeguard our sovereignty. We will do\nour utmost to resolve the issue in line with international\nnorms.\nI am well aware of the fact that Myanmar\u2019s\ndemocratic transformation process will be a complex\nand delicate one that requires patience. To complete\nthe process, we certainly need the understanding and\nsupport of the United Nations and its States Members,\nthe international community as a whole and, last but\nnot least, the people of Myanmar. At the same time, it is equally important that Myanmar should be viewed from\na different and new perspective. It is also necessary for\nus to be able to work in a more favourable environment\nthan ever before.\nMyanmar is now ushering in a new era. As a\nmember in the family of nations, Myanmar will\nparticipate more actively in the activities of the United\nNations in various fields. Standing as a responsible and\nrespectable nation on the world stage, we will take on\nthe challenges of the twenty-first century in a bold and\nresolute manner.\nI would also like to take this opportunity to\ncongratulate Mr. Ban Ki-moon on his reappointment\nas General-Secretary and on his achievements thus far.\nBefore I conclude, allow me to brief ly mention\nan important figure, namely, U Thant, a brilliant\nson of Myanmar who served as the third Secretary-\nGeneral. Even in those days, U Thant had a vision of\none world. He envisioned a global society guided by\nthe spirit of one world \u2014 a world safe for diversity and\na place of peaceful coexistence where global citizens\ncould practice the virtues of tolerance, cooperation,\nunderstanding and compassion. We believe that if we\nmake his vision a reality, we will soon achieve a world\nthat is more peaceful and prosperous. U Thant\u2019s tireless\nendeavours for peace and his achievements during his\ntenure as the Secretary-General will never be forgotten.\nThe people of Myanmar will always take pride in and\nremember him as a great son of Myanmar."

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt is an honour and a pleasure\nfor me to once again address the General Assembly.\nKenya is at a time in its history that is full of hope\nfor a bright future. Over the past 10 years, our country\nhas enjoyed a sustained blossoming of democracy.\nIn the year 2010, Kenya adopted a new Constitution.\nWith that constitution, we further secured the human\nrights and civil liberties of our citizens and entrenched\nconstitutional governance and justice.\nEqually important, over the past 10 years, we have\nscored significant victories against diseases including\nHIV and AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis and other\nchildhood and adult maladies. Hundreds of thousands\nmore children have found their way into school and\nmany more adults have found new life skills through\ntraining and capacity-building. We have also pulled\nhundreds of thousands of Kenyans out of poverty and\nput them on the pathway to economic independence\nand self-reliance. In doing so, we have also expanded\nour economic base, opening up new and extensive\ninfrastructure, energy and information technology\nprojects.\n\nThe achievements in our country have been\nattained through respect for the rule of law, sound\npolicies, improved governance and open and innovative\ndemocracy. However, as all Kenyans recognize,\nwe still have a lot more work to do. Poverty, disease\nand unemployment still remain big challenges for\nus. Nevertheless, I am confident that we will seize\nopportunities to innovate and invest, and thus keep our\ncountry on the road to even greater prosperity.\nIn accordance with this year\u2019s theme, \u201cBringing\nabout adjustment or settlement of international disputes\nor situations by peaceful means\u201d, Kenya\u2019s achievements\nover the past 10 years have been built on the bedrock\nof the peaceful resolution of disputes and situations in\nour country. In addition, it is our belief that inclusive\nsolutions to disputes can bring about lasting peace. We\nknow from our own history and that of our neighbours\nthat when conflicts and disagreements are not resolved\npeacefully what follows are the tragic consequences of\nsuffering, bloodshed and the collapse of economic and\nsocial development.\nThat is why we are convinced that Kenya\u2019s own\nwell-being and prosperity are hinged on sustained\npeace, security, stability and inclusive democracy in\nour region. My country therefore remains supportive\nof efforts spearheaded by the African Union, the\nIntergovernmental Authority on Development, the\nInternational Conference on the Great Lakes Region\nand the East African Community for the peaceful and\ninclusive settlement of disputes and situations. Such\nregional efforts are central to the future of multilateral\npeacebuilding. They must be the building blocks of\ninternational efforts to maintain peace and security in\nour region and the world.\nKenya therefore welcomes the Secretary-General\u2019s\ninitiative to convene a series of high-level meetings\nduring this week to discuss the political and security\nsituations in Somalia, the Democratic Republic of the\nCongo, the Sudan and South Sudan. With regard to\nSomalia, Kenya joined the African Union Mission in\nSomalia (AMISOM), and through the combined efforts\nof AMISOM and Transitional Federal Government\nforces, we have witnessed the progressive liberation of\nlarge areas of Somalia from Al-Shabaab occupation.\nThat development enabled the Transitional Government\nto focus on the implementation of the Kampala Accord\nroad map, with a view to forming a unified Government\nanchored on the pillars of good governance and the rule\nof law. We are encouraged by recent developments in Somalia, in particular the election of a new President,\nPrime Minister and Parliament and the adoption of a\nnew Constitution.\nThere are millions of Somalis who are forced to live\noutside Somalia. More than 650,000 are in one refugee\ncamp in Kenya. Following the liberation of large\nsections of south-central Somalia from Al-Shabaab,\nwe look forward to working with the relevant United\nNations agencies and the international community\nin facilitating the return of Somali refugees to those\nareas. That will enable the effective participation of all\nSomalis in rebuilding Somalia.\nWith regard to the Republic of the Sudan and the\nRepublic of South Sudan, Kenya is appreciative of\nthe positive developments of 4 August related to the\nlong-standing dispute over oil resources. We hope that\nthat important agreement marks a first step towards\nreducing tensions between the two sister countries.\nKenya also appreciates the efforts of the international\ncommunity, both directly and through the African\nUnion, and encourages the two sides to work towards\nreaching a compromise. I especially commend the\nAfrican Union High-level Implementation Panel\nfor its determination and leadership in steering the\nnegotiations. We are confident that both countries will\nagree to urgently address contentious issues on border\ndisputes. Kenya will continue to support efforts to find\na peaceful and lasting solution to disputes between the\npeople of the Sudan and South Sudan. We encourage\nthe international community to redouble its efforts to\nfast-track support for social and economic development\nin South Sudan for the benefit of citizens of the new\ncountry.\nKenyans are saddened by the great suffering and\nbloodshed endured by populations around the world,\nespecially in the Middle East, the Horn of Africa and\nCentral Africa. It is our belief that nations should\nembrace dialogue and the peaceful settlement of\ndisputes instead of rushing to arms, for suffering and\nbloodshed will ensue. We call upon all warring parties\nin the world to lay down their arms and pursue the\npath of peace, dialogue and the inclusive resolution of\ndisputes.\nWe also remain concerned that no progress has\nbeen achieved on the issue of Palestine. As I said last\nyear here in the General Assembly, Kenya believes in\nthe two-State solution, in which the territorial integrity\nof Palestine within the 1967 borders is upheld and the peace and security of Israel are both assured and\nguaranteed. In that regard, it is our hope that Palestine\nwill soon be welcomed into the community of nations\nwith full membership in the United Nations.\nThere can be no lasting peace without sustainable\nand inclusive development. Kenya therefore greatly\nappreciates the achievements of the United Nations\nConference on Sustainable Development held earlier\nthis year in Brazil. Kenya is encouraged that, in line\nwith recommendations proposed during the Conference,\nthe General Assembly has placed high on its agenda for\nthis session some of the decisions we took in Rio de\nJaneiro. That is indeed an indication of our collective\npolitical will to ensure that the decisions contained in\nthe outcome document are implemented.\nKey among those is the decision to strengthen the\ninstitutional framework for sustainable development,\nincluding the upgrading of the United Nations\nEnvironment Programme (UNEP). Kenya appreciates\nthat historic decision to strengthen and upgrade UNEP,\nwhich will enable it to fulfil its mandate effectively.\nKenya reiterates its commitment to continue to host\nand facilitate the work of a revamped UNEP, and we\nlook forward to its eventual transformation into a full-\nfledged organization for the global environment.\nFinally, we are all aware that many of our modern\ndisputes and conflicts revolve around concerns about\nwater, available land and agriculture, forests, rivers\nand lakes. Dealing with our environment and the\neffects of climate change is therefore an important part\nof resolving disputes and conflicts around the world.\nStrengthening global institutions that deal with the\nenvironment, biodiversity and climate change must\ntherefore be a core part of our strategy to avoid conflict\nand disputes among the peoples of the world.\nIt is important that, as the community of nations,\nwe invest in the peaceful settlement of international\ndisputes. However, we must invest first in the prevention\nof disputes and, secondly, in addressing the root causes\nof conflicts, such as poverty, inequality, disregard\nfor international law and disrespect for each other\u2019s\nsociocultural and religious beliefs, among others. Only\nby addressing the root causes of conflict and disputes\ncan we hope to find lasting peace in a just and equitable\nworld."

        "file_text": "\ufeffOn behalf of\nmy delegation, please allow me to extend our sincere\ncongratulations to you, Sir, on your election as\nPresident of the General Assembly at its sixty-seventh\nsession. I have no doubt that under your able leadership\nthis session will yield fruitful outcomes. I would also\nlike to convey my admiration to Mr. Ban Ki-moon for\nhis untiring efforts to overcome the many multifaceted\nchallenges confronting our world today.\nLet me start with the obvious. The twenty-first\ncentury we live in is facing one of its most difficult\nmoments. Never before has the pressure of global\ninterdependency been so intense. As economies become\nmore and more interdependent, not only are opportunities\nto create wealth multiplied, but so are opportunities\nto transmit destabilizing shocks from one country to\nanother. Imbalances and risks are omnipresent. In the\ncontext of declining economic prospects and mounting\nglobal challenges, collective actions are required to\nremedy the shortcomings of global governance in\nensuring systemic financial stability, a stable monetary\nsystem and the regulation of international financial\nmarkets, and in dealing with major systemic shocks. The\nmultilateral system, devised more than half a century\nago, is facing challenges to its capacity to deliver on\nits mandate as the international agenda has become\nincreasingly complex. Clearly, the current multilateral\nsystem needs to be radically reformed and made into\na well-coordinated and permeable body of institutions\nthat can deliver innovative and feasible solutions to a\nglobalized international society.\nIn order to respond to systemic risk in the financial\nsector, we have closely cooperated with China, Japan\nand the Republic of Korea within the Association of\nSoutheast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to strengthen a\nregional financial safeguard mechanism, called the\nChiang Mai Initiative Multilateralization, which has\nrecently increased its funding level from $120 billion\nto $240 billion. We strongly believe that that regional\nfinancial arrangement will complement the global\nfirewall for regional crisis resolution. ASEAN has also\nestablished a macroeconomic and finance surveillance\noffice in Singapore to achieve a more integrated, even-\nhanded and effective surveillance mechanism. As we all struggle to overcome the effects of the\nglobal financial crisis, we should not lose sight of new\nemerging challenges and threats, such as obstacles\nto sustainable development, the achievement of the\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs), climate\nchange, food security and so on. Many developing\ncountries still face many obstacles to achieving all\ntheir MDGs by the target date of 2015, owing to their\nvulnerability to the global financial crisis, the challenges\nof the debt burden and the unmet commitments of\nofficial development assistance. Having achieved stable\ngrowth successively for a number of years, Cambodia\nis confident that, despite its limited resources, it will\nachieve the Cambodian MDGs by 2015. We welcome\nthe adoption of resolution 66/288, entitled \u201cThe\nfuture we want\u201d, by the United Nations Conference\non Sustainable Development (Rio+20), held in Rio de\nJaneiro on June 2012, and strongly advocate that the\nMDGs should remain a fundamental milestone in the\ndevelopment agenda. We also call for renewed efforts\nto enable the developing countries to achieve their\nMillennium Development Goals on time.\nClimate change is a critical problem for the whole\nworld, requiring immediate and concerted actions. The\nrapid pace of climate change could have devastating\neffects, particularly on small States in the Asia-Pacific\nand the Caribbean regions, in the form of rising sea\nlevels. Other developing countries, mostly dependent on\nagriculture, are threatened by similar negative effects,\nsuch as extreme f loods and drought, which affect their\nlivelihood. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon described\nsuch phenomena as a real threat to international peace\nand security.\nRegrettably, despite all the adversities inf licted on\nthe world\u2019s most vulnerable people by climate change,\nthe international community remains divided on\nimplementing a rapid and critical global response. We\ncall on developed countries to reduce greenhouse-gas\nemissions in accordance with the United Nations\nprinciple of common but differentiated responsibility.\nIt is disappointing that, for the most part, the promises\nmade by developed nations in Copenhagen in 2009, in\nCanc\u00fan in 2010 and in Durban in 2011 have not been\nfulfilled in a timely manner.\nIn the same vein, we are of the view that\nnatural-disaster management and cooperation\nmechanisms should be further developed and\nstrengthened at both the regional and the global\nlevels, with a view to preventing natural disasters and addressing related issues that have become more\npressing owing to climate change. ASEAN has made\ngreat progress in that area at the regional level; the\nestablishment of the ASEAN Coordinating Centre for\nHumanitarian Assistance on disaster management,\nknown as the AHA Centre, deserves mention in that\nregard.\nFood security is another serious issue of the present\ntime. At the speed the world\u2019s population is growing,\nthe United Nations Environment Programme predicts\nthat by 2030 we will need to produce 50 per cent more\nfood, 30 per cent more clean water and 40 per cent more\nenergy. Consequently, the increased competition for\nnatural resources and between biofuel energy and food\nfor human needs will only further exacerbate the food\nsecurity situation. A major global reform is needed\nurgently to implement the Rio+20 recommendations\non sustainable development, which emphasize both the\nneed for major investments to modernize agriculture\nand encourage small-scale agricultural projects around\nthe world and the vital importance of addressing\ninterlinkages between energy and agricultural prices.\nRising oil and food prices are a common concern of\nthe majority of countries in the world. High oil prices\ncontribute to soaring food prices. Rising oil and food\nprices mean increased poverty levels at a time when\nglobal growth is still weak and the number of the\nunemployed and underemployed is continuously rising\nin many countries. Our modern global food system is\nhighly oil-dependent, but petroleum is becoming less\nand less affordable. Thus, there is no solution yet for\nthe world\u2019s worsening food crisis within the current\nenergy and agricultural system. What is needed is a\nmajor rethinking of both food and energy prices and the\ncoordination of agricultural and energy policies. We\ncan but appeal to the world oil-producing countries to\nconsider the negative effects of higher fuel prices and\ntheir impact on food and energy security.\nIn our regional context, ASEAN has adopted a\ncomprehensive strategy on food security with the signing\nof the Emergency Rice Reserve Agreement with China,\nJapan and the Republic of Korea, which is a permanent\nscheme for meeting emergency requirements.\nThe Group of 20 (G-20) has a crucial role to play\nin meeting those global challenges. Cambodia, as Chair\nof ASEAN, appreciated the opportunity to represent\nASEAN at the G-20 Summit held in Los Cabos in June.\nCambodia\u2019s views reflected the need to, among other\nthings, to sustain economic stability and structural reform for growth and employment; the urgency to\nimprove and strengthen the international financial\narchitecture in an interconnected global economy;\nthe imperative of completing the Doha Round and the\nprevention of the return of trade protectionism; and\nthe priority of further facilitating trade, an important\nconducive factor for stimulate international economic\ngrowth, which all our countries need.\nCambodia fully supports all the priorities agreed\namong the G-20 countries in Los Cabos to promote\ntrade, job creation and economic growth, including\ntheir determination to finalize negotiations on the Doha\nRound agenda as soon as possible. International trade\nis one of the most important factors that will bring\nabout economic growth and job creation in both the\nimmediate and longer term.\nSince the establishment of the United Nations, in\n1945, the global situation has changed so dramatically\nthat global diplomac urgently needs to be strengthened.\nIt is therefore in everyone\u2019s interest to push for\ncomprehensive reform of the United Nations so that\nit reflects the diverse needs and representativeness of\nthe world today. That reform should be comprehensive\nand should cover not only the Security Council but\nalso other United Nations organs in order to preserve\nits relevance and legitimacy as an effective global\ngovernance institution to cope with the reality of the\npresent-day world, which is different from that of the\npost-Second World War era.\n\nThe General Assembly should be further\nempowered to enable it to play a leading role in\naddressing today\u2019s global problems as a democratic,\ndeliberative policymaking organ of the United Nations.\nBoth the permanent and non-permanent membership\nof the Security Council should be equitably expanded\nso that it represents both developed and the developing\ncountries.\nIn the spirit of the United Nations peacekeeping\nmission for the advancement of world peace, security\nand development, Cambodia has contributed 1,000 men\nto United Nations peacekeeping operations in Africa,\nespecially in South Sudan and Lebanon.\nThrough its experience of close collaboration with\nthe United Nations and its own experience in ending\nwar, and thanks to its win-win policy and post-conflict\nmanagement, in particular with respect to economic and social development and national reconciliation,\nCambodia wishes to contribute more effectively, through\nthe Security Council, to the cause of peace, security and\nthe peaceful settlement of conflicts in many parts of the\nworld. To that end, for the very first time since joining\nthe United Nations, in 1955, Cambodia has presented\nits candidature as a non-permanent member of the\nSecurity Council for the period 2013-2014, for which\nvoting will be held next month. I also wish to note that,\nsince 1955, Cambodia has never occupied any seat in\nthe United Nations system and that its candidature has\nbeen endorsed and supported by all ASEAN member\nStates.\nBefore I conclude, I would like to take this\nopportunity to stress that Cambodia deeply regrets the\nacts of violence against the United States Consulate in\nBenghazi, which caused the death of four American\ndiplomats, including the United States Ambassador,\neven though we very well understand the legitimate\nanger at disrespect towards the Muslim religion."

        "file_text": "\ufeffAt the outset, I express my\ndelegation\u2019s warmest congratulations to the President on\nassuming office to preside over the General Assembly\nat its sixty-seventh session. I would like to record our\ndeepest appreciation to his predecessor, His Excellency\nMr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser, for his untiring efforts\nin steering the deliberations of the sixty-sixth session to\na successful conclusion.\nI also wish to congratulate the Secretary-General,\nHis Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for his extraordinary\nreport (A/67/1) presented to the Assembly on Tuesday.\nDespite the many unprecedented challenges facing the\nUnited Nations today, we remain confident that the\nSecretary-General\u2019s leadership and the resolve of the\nOrganization and of humankind will not waver.\nI represent a small yet proud island nation that has\nlong advocated for an effective international framework\nfor the security of small States, that has vigorously\ncampaigned for international actions to combat climate\nchange and that has contributed to breaking the\ninternational silence on the human rights implications\nof climate change.\nI come from a nation that has successfully moved\nfrom an authoritarian system to a multiparty democratic\nsystem of governance \u2014 a historic transition achieved\npurely by peaceful means. That is why Maldivians show\ntheir solidarity with people everywhere in the world\nwho struggle to replace despotism with democracy.\nThat is why we support the ongoing democratization\nprocess in the Middle East and North Africa, and that\nis why we applaud Tunisia and Egypt for holding their\nfirst post-transition elections in a free and fair manner.\n\nWhile the democratization processes in other\ncountries in the region are on an upward trajectory, we\nsee violence and human rights violations in Syria. We\nurge the Syrian security forces and anti-Government\narmed groups to immediately cease all hostilities and\nviolence. We welcome the latest findings of the United\nNations commission of inquiry on the human rights\nsituation in Syria.\nWe strongly believe that tolerance and mutual\nrespect should prevail among different religions and\ncultures to ensure that the world we live in remains\npeaceful and harmonious for the future of our children.\nThe Maldives strongly condemns the recent anti-Islamic\nvideo demeaning our Prophet Muhammad \u2014 peace be\nupon him. Freedom of expression should not be used as\nan excuse to insult religions, incite hatred or provoke\ncommunal violence. While the video has provoked\ndemonstrations around the world, the Maldives does\nnot believe that violence is the way to respond to such\nlow-level blasphemous acts.\nThe Maldives has also condemned the attack on\nthe United States Consulate in Benghazi, which took\nthe life of the United States Ambassador to Libya. On\nbehalf of the Maldivian people, I express my deepest\ncondolences to the United States Government and the\nfamilies of the bereaved.\nMy delegation and I express the wishes of the\nMaldivian people to see the day that the Palestinian\npeople join the United Nations as a full Member. The\nMaldives strongly calls on all Member States to support\nthe true aspirations of the Palestinian people and their\nright to self-determination in a Palestinian State.\nIn June we, the leaders of the world, agreed\nto signal our solid political commitment towards\nestablishing sustainable development goals. We believe\nthat those goals would further strengthen the social,\neconomic and environmental well-being of nations.\nThe 2015 development agenda should recognize the\nparticular characteristics and needs of small States. It\nshould support the creation of a stronger international\narchitecture to achieve a sustainable future for all.\nClimate change remains the most important and\ncomplex developmental challenge that small States face.\nWe face the threat of rising sea levels. We experience\nocean acidification, changes in average temperature\nand variable precipitation. Coastal erosion is a serious\nproblem in the Maldives, affecting more than 113\nislands. An additional 120 islands need emergency\nwater during the dry season. The Government now\nspends more than 27 per cent of our national budget on\nbuilding our resilience to combat the effects of climate\nchange.\nThe Maldives reiterates its call for a binding\nagreement to reduce global carbon emissions. The world\ncannot afford to wait any longer for such an agreement;\nnor can we. The absence of a global accord is no excuse\nfor doing nothing. The Maldives is one of the smallest\nisland economies in the world. Our contribution to\nglobal emissions is 0.003 per cent, yet we are the most\nvulnerable to the effects of climate change. For that\nreason, we are also taking difficult and bold measures\nto combat climate change. We were among the first\ncountries in the world to eradicate chlorof luorocarbons\nwell ahead of time. We intend to become the first to\neradicate hydrochlorof luorocarbons (HCFCs) by 2020.\nAnd we intend to become the first to ban the import\nof HCFC-based equipment. A number of our islands\nare also scaling up renewable energy, not only to avoid\nspending 20 per cent of our gross domestic product\non importing fossil fuel, but also to reduce harmful\nemissions.\nHence, we are converting to solar or hybrid sources.\nA total of 20 islands in the Maldives will switch to\nrenewable energy sources for power by next year. Those\nmeasures are part of a national initiative to transform\nthe country\u2019s economy into a low-carbon one. If we\ncan take those measures, why cannot the larger States,\nendowed with more resources, take stronger measures?\nThat requires political commitment and difficult\nchoices. I therefore call upon carbon-emitting countries\nto develop and utilize clean and renewable energy to\nreduce their carbon footprint.\nClimate change is just one of many challenges\nfaced by the Maldives. The country\u2019s transition to\ndemocracy, which has reached a critical point, is\nanother pressing challenge that we are determined to\novercome. Four years ago, the Maldives held its first\ncompetitive, multiparty presidential elections. That\nwas a watershed moment in the country\u2019s long march\ntowards democratic governance. Four years after\nthat historic election, in October 2008, people in the\nMaldives ask if their lives are any better. The answer,\nregrettably, is, not yet. Multiparty democracy in the\nMaldives has so far been deeply divisive. It is also\npolarizing, tearing apart families and the fabric of a\nsmall, homogenous society. Political leaders elected\nto office by popular vote chose to act with impunity.\n\nCenturies-old values of respect and tolerance have been\nreplaced by intolerance and hatred in the islands where\nalmost everyone literally knows everybody else. That\nis not because there is any inherent deficiency in the\ndemocratic form of governance; rather, it is because\nthe road to liberal democracy is always rocky and long\nand must be navigated by a political leadership with an\nunshakeable commitment to the principles and values\nof democracy.\nThe past eight months have been particularly\nchallenging for the consolidation of democracy in my\ncountry. The elected President of the country resigned\nin February, and later claimed that he was forced to do\nso. The Government opened a commission of inquiry to\ninvestigate the allegations. Some of our friends rushed\nto conclusions, and that did not make it any easier for\nus. Some big States and some not so big States took\nsides in a domestic political crisis and contributed to\nmaking a bad situation worse. While the Government\nwas striving to strengthen the country\u2019s institutional\ncapacity to manage the new democracy, some\ninternational actors continued to publicly criticize the\ncountry\u2019s young institutions.\nWe look for new ideas and are receptive to good\nones, irrespective of where they come from. That\nis why we engage in international cooperation. We\nexpect the result of international cooperation to help,\nnot hinder, a country\u2019s march towards a better, more\ndemocratic society. It is supposed to build a country\u2019s\ninstitutions and to gain public confidence. International\ncooperation should not be used to undermine national\ncapacities. It should not be used as an excuse for larger\ncountries to interfere in the domestic politics of small\nStates.\nSmall States are vulnerable in many ways. We\nalone are not able to stop larger and stronger countries\nfrom dictating terms. Our vulnerability is particularly\nacute when there is discord and system breakdowns in\nour countries. This is the time when the larger States\nshould help the smaller States in the international\nsystem.\nThe history of a nation is never a single event or\na single person. The life of our nation is composed of\nthe lives of all of us who live there. We are the building\nblocks in the evolution of our countries. The knowledge,\neducation, experience and commitment we bring to\nour nation are what shapes our history. They make our\nhistory unique. Respect for us and our small nation\nrequires that our external partners not underestimate\nour capacity to contribute to the shaping of our own\ndestiny. Nations must be allowed to resolve their\nproblems on their own. The international community\nshould not take punitive actions against any sovereign\nState unless there is verifiable and blatant abuse of\nhuman rights.\nYet I believe that international cooperation can\nand should promote positive change in emerging\ndemocracies. I believe that international organizations\nsuch as the United Nations can play a pivotal role in\nstrengthening democratic institutions in such nations.\nI believe that some of the advanced democracies\ncan also help small States with technical expertise in\nconsolidating democracy.\nTo do that, it is important to recognize the unique\nchallenges and characteristics of small States. It is\nimportant to protect the social fabric of the tightly knit\nsocieties in our countries. It is important to review\ncurrent approaches and modalities for extending\ninternational cooperation in the promotion of democracy.\nIt is important that international cooperation not be\nseen to be promoting a particular ideology. It should\nnot be seen to be taking sides in domestic politics.\nInternational cooperation should be seen to promote and\nencourage a home-grown democracy that is consistent\nwith universally accepted values and principles.\nRegular, free and fair elections are a fundamental\ncomponent in any democracy. Yet holding elections is\nnot, by itself, a sufficient condition for consolidating\ndemocracy. It requires patience. It requires making hard\nchoices and compromises. And it requires cultivating\nand nurturing democratic values. My Government is\nimplementing a comprehensive plan to nurture such\nvalues in the Maldives. We are committed to creating an\nenvironment that guarantees individual freedom, where\nhuman rights are fully protected, where democratic\nvalues flourish and where human innovation thrives.\nWe are committed to creating a democratic and free\nsociety that is able to shape its own destiny.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt is a pleasure to see the\nGeneral Assembly presided over by the Ambassador from Israel, and it is good to see all of the representatives\nhere.\nThree thousand years ago, King David reigned\nover the Jewish State in our eternal capital, Jerusalem.\nI say that to all those who proclaim that the Jewish\nState has no roots in our region and that it will soon\ndisappear. Throughout our history, the Jewish people\nhave overcome all the tyrants who have sought our\ndestruction. It is their ideologies that have been\ndiscarded by history. The people of Israel live on. We\nsay in Hebrew, the Jewish State will live forever.\nThe Jewish people have lived in the land of Israel\nfor thousands of years. Even after most of our people\nwere exiled from it, Jews continued to live in the land\nof Israel throughout the ages. The masses of our people\nnever gave up the dream of returning to our ancient\nhomeland. Defying the laws of history, we did just that.\nWe ingathered the exiles, restored our independence\nand rebuilt our national life. The Jewish people have\ncome home. We will never be uprooted again.\nYesterday was Yom Kippur, the holiest day of\nthe Jewish year. Every year, for over three millennia,\nwe have come together on this day of reflection and\natonement. We take stock of our past. We pray for our\nfuture. We remember the sorrows of our persecution;\nwe remember the great travails of our dispersion; we\nmourn the extermination of a third of our people,\n6 million, in the Holocaust.\nBut at the end of Yom Kippur, we celebrate. We\ncelebrate the rebirth of Israel. We celebrate the heroism\nof our young men and women who have defended our\npeople with the indomitable courage of Joshua, David\nand the Maccabees of old. We celebrate the marvel\nof the flourishing modern Jewish State. In Israel we\nwalk the same paths as those trodden by our patriarchs\nAbraham, Isaac and Jacob. But we blaze new trails in\nscience, technology, medicine and agriculture. In Israel\nthe past and the future find common ground.\nUnfortunately, that is not the case in many other\ncountries. For today, a great battle is being waged\nbetween the modern and the medieval. The forces of\nmodernity seek a bright future in which the rights of\nall are protected, in which an ever-expanding digital\nlibrary is available in the palm of every child, in which\nevery life is sacred.\nThe forces of medievalism seek a world in which\nwomen and minorities are subjugated, in which knowledge is suppressed, in which not life but death\nis glorified. Those forces clash around the globe, but\nnowhere more starkly than in the Middle East. Israel\nstands proudly with the forces of modernity. We protect\nthe rights of all our citizens, men and women, Jews and\nArabs, Muslims and Christians \u2014 all are equal before\nthe law.\nIsrael is also making the world a better place. Our\nscientists win Nobel Prizes. Our know-how is in every\ncell phone and computer that every one of us uses. We\nprevent hunger by irrigating arid lands in Africa and\nAsia. Recently, I was deeply moved when I visited\nTechnion, one of our technological institutes in Haifa,\nand I saw a man paralysed from the waist down climb\nup a f light of stairs, quite easily, with the aid of an\nIsraeli invention. And Israel\u2019s exceptional creativity is\nmatched by our people\u2019s remarkable compassion. When\ndisaster strikes anywhere in the world \u2014 in Haiti,\nJapan, India, Turkey, Indonesia and elsewhere \u2014 Israeli\ndoctors are among the first on the scene, performing\nlifesaving surgeries.\nIn the past year, I lost both my father and my\nfather-in-law. In the same hospital wards where they\nwere treated, Israeli doctors were treating Palestinian\nArabs. In fact, every year, thousands of Arabs from\nthe Palestinian territories and Arabs from throughout\nthe Middle East come to Israel to be treated in Israeli\nhospitals by Israeli doctors. I know that that is not\ngoing to be spoken by speakers at this podium, but it\nis the truth. It is important that the world be aware of\nthat truth. It is because Israel cherishes life that Israel\ncherishes peace and seeks peace. We seek to preserve\nour historic ties and our historic peace treaties with\nEgypt and Jordan. We seek to forge a durable peace\nwith the Palestinians.\nPresident Abbas just spoke here. I say to him and\nI say to the Assembly: we will not solve our conflict\nwith libellous speeches at the United Nations. That is\nnot the way to solve it. We will not solve our conflict\nwith unilateral declarations of statehood. We have\nto sit together, negotiate together and reach a mutual\ncompromise, in which a demilitarized Palestinian State\nrecognizes the one and only Jewish State.\nIsrael wants to see a Middle East of progress and\npeace. We want to see the three great religions that\nsprang forth from our region \u2014 Judaism, Christianity\nand Islam \u2014 coexist in peace and in mutual respect. Yet the medieval forces of radical Islam, which\nthe world just saw storming American Embassies\nthroughout the Middle East, oppose that. They seek\nsupremacy over all Muslims. They are bent on world\nconquest. They want to destroy Israel, Europe, America.\nThey want to extinguish freedom. They want to end the\nmodern world.\nMilitant Islam has many branches, from the rulers\nof Iran with their Revolutionary Guards to Al-Qaida\nterrorists to the radical cells lurking in every part of the\nglobe. But despite their differences, they are all rooted\nin the same bitter soil of intolerance. That intolerance\nis directed first at their fellow Muslims and then at\nChristians, Jews, Buddhists, Hindus, secular people,\nand anyone who does not submit to their unforgiving\ncreed. They want to drag humankind back to an age of\nunquestioning dogma and unrelenting conflict.\nI am sure of one thing. Ultimately, they will fail.\nUltimately, light will penetrate the darkness. We\nhave seen that happen before. Some 500 years ago,\nthe printing press helped pry a cloistered Europe\nout of a dark age. Eventually, ignorance gave way to\nenlightenment. So too, a cloistered Middle East will\neventually yield to the irresistible power of freedom\nand technology. When that happens, our region will be\nguided not by fanaticism and conspiracy but by reason\nand curiosity.\nI think the relevant question is not whether this\nfanaticism will be defeated. It is how many lives will\nbe lost before it is defeated. We have seen that happen\nbefore too. Some 70 years ago, the world saw another\nfanatic ideology bent on world conquest. It went down\nin flames, but not before it took millions of people with\nit. Those who opposed that fanaticism waited too long\nto act. In the end they triumphed, but at a horrific cost.\nMy friends, we cannot let that happen again. At\nstake is not merely the future of my own country. At\nstake is the future of the world. Nothing could imperil\nour common future more than the arming of Iran with\nnuclear weapons. To understand what the world would\nbe like with a nuclear-armed Iran, just imagine the\nworld with a nuclear-armed Al-Qaida. It makes little\ndifference whether these lethal weapons are in the\nhands of the world\u2019s most dangerous terrorist regime or\nthe world\u2019s most dangerous terrorist organization. They\nare both fired by the same hatred; they are both driven\nby the same lust for violence. Just look at what the Iranian regime has done up\nuntil now, without nuclear weapons. In 2009, they\nbrutally put down mass protests for democracy in their\nown country. Today, their henchmen are participating\nin the slaughter of tens of thousands of Syrian\ncivilians, including thousands of children \u2014 directly\nparticipating in those murders. They abetted the killing\nof American soldiers in Iraq and continue to do so\nin Afghanistan. Before that, Iranian proxies killed\nhundreds of American troops in Beirut and in Saudi\nArabia. They have turned Lebanon and Gaza into terror\nstrongholds, embedding nearly 100,000 missiles and\nrockets in civilian areas. Thousands of such rockets and\nmissiles have already been fired at Israeli communities\nby their terrorist proxies.\nIn the past year, they have spread their international\nterror networks to two dozen countries across five\ncontinents, from India and Thailand to Kenya and\nBulgaria. They have even plotted to blow up a restaurant\na few blocks from the White House in order to kill a\ndiplomat. And of course, Iran\u2019s rulers repeatedly deny\nthe Holocaust and call for Israel\u2019s destruction almost\non a daily basis, as they did again this week from the\nUnited Nations.\nSo I ask, given this record of Iranian aggression\nwithout nuclear weapons, just imagine Iranian\naggression with nuclear weapons. Imagine their long-\nrange missiles tipped with nuclear warheads, their\nterror networks armed with atomic bombs. Who here\nwould feel safe in the Middle East? Who would be safe\nin Europe? Who would be safe in America? Who would\nbe safe anywhere?\nThere are those who believe that a nuclear-armed\nIran can be deterred like the Soviet Union. That is a\nvery dangerous assumption. Militant jihadists behave\nvery differently from secular Marxists. There were\nno Soviet suicide bombers. Yet Iran produces hordes\nof them. Deterrence worked with the Soviets, because\nevery time the Soviets faced a choice between their\nideology and their survival, they chose their survival.\nBut deterrence may not work with the Iranians once\nthey get nuclear weapons.\nA great scholar of the Middle East, Professor\nBernard Lewis, put it best. He said that for the ayatollahs\nof Iran mutually assured destruction is not a deterrent,\nit is an inducement. Iran\u2019s apocalyptic leaders believe\nthat a medieval holy man will reappear in the wake\nof a devastating holy war, thereby ensuring that their brand of radical Islam will rule the Earth. That is not\njust what they believe; it is what is actually guiding\ntheir policies and their actions. Just listen to Ayatollah\nRafsanjani who said, \u201cthe use of even one nuclear bomb\ninside Israel will destroy everything, however it would\nonly harm the Islamic world.\u201d Rafsanjani said: \u201cIt is\nnot irrational to contemplate such an eventuality\u201d. \u201cNot\nirrational\u201d is what he said. And that is coming from one\nof the so-called moderates of Iran.\nShockingly, some people have begun to peddle the\nabsurd notion that a nuclear-armed Iran would actually\nstabilize the Middle East. That is like saying a nuclear-\narmed Al-Qaida would usher in an era of universal\npeace.\nI have been speaking about the need to prevent Iran\nfrom developing nuclear weapons for over 15 years.\nI spoke about it in my first term in office as Prime\nMinister, and then I spoke about it when I left office.\nI spoke about it when it was fashionable, and I spoke\nabout it when it was not fashionable.\nI speak about it now because the hour is getting\nlate, very late. I speak about it now because the Iranian\nnuclear calendar does not take time out for anyone or\nfor anything. I speak about it now because when it\ncomes to the survival of my country, it is not only my\nright to speak, it is my duty to speak. And I believe that\nit is the duty of every responsible leader who wants to\npreserve world peace.\nFor nearly a decade, the international community\nhas tried to stop the Iranian nuclear programme with\ndiplomacy. That has not worked. Iran uses diplomatic\nnegotiations as a means to buy time to advance its nuclear\nprogramme. For over seven years, the international\ncommunity has tried sanctions with Iran. Under the\nleadership of President Obama, the international\ncommunity has passed some of the strongest sanctions\nto date.\nI want to thank the Governments represented here\nthat have joined in that effort. It has had an effect. Oil\nexports have been curbed and the Iranian economy\nhas been hit hard. It has had an effect on the economy,\nbut we must face the truth. Sanctions have not stopped\nIran\u2019s nuclear programme either.\nAccording to the International Atomic Energy\nAgency, during the last year alone, Iran doubled the\nnumber of centrifuges in its underground nuclear\nfacility in Qom. At this late hour, there is only one way to peacefully prevent Iran from getting atomic bombs.\nThat is by placing a clear red line on Iran\u2019s nuclear\nweapons programme.\nRed lines do not lead to war. Red lines prevent war.\nLook at NATO\u2019s charter. It made clear that an attack on\none member country would be considered an attack on\nall. NATO\u2019s red line helped keep the peace in Europe\nfor nearly half a century. President Kennedy set a red\nline during the Cuban missile crisis. That red line\nalso prevented war and helped preserve the peace for\ndecades.\nIn fact, it is the failure to place red lines that has\noften invited aggression. If the Western Powers had\ndrawn clear red lines during the 1930s, I believe they\nwould have stopped Nazi aggression, and the Second\nWorld War might have been avoided. In 1990, if\nSaddam Hussein had been clearly told that his conquest\nof Kuwait would cross a red line, the first Gulf War\nmight have been avoided.\nClear red lines have also worked with Iran. Earlier\nthis year, Iran threatened to close the Straits of Hormuz.\nThe United States drew a clear red line and Iran backed\noff. Now, red lines could be drawn in different parts of\nIran\u2019s nuclear weapons programme, but to be credible,\na red line must be drawn first and foremost in one vital\npart of their programme: on Iran\u2019s efforts to enrich\nuranium.\nNow let me explain why. Basically, any bomb\nconsists of explosive material and a mechanism to\nignite it. The simplest example is gunpowder and a\nfuse \u2014 that is, you light the fuse and you set off the\ngunpowder. In the case of Iran\u2019s plans to build a nuclear\nweapon, the gunpowder is enriched uranium. The\nfuse is a nuclear detonator. For Iran, amassing enough\nenriched uranium is far more difficult than producing\nthe nuclear fuse. For a country like Iran, it takes many\nyears to enrich uranium for a bomb. That requires\nthousands of centrifuges spinning in tandem in very\nbig industrial plants. Those Iranian plants are visible\nand they are still vulnerable.\nIn contrast, Iran could produce the nuclear\ndetonator, the fuse, in a lot less time \u2014 maybe under a\nyear, maybe only a few months. The detonator can be\nmade in a small workshop the size of a classroom. It\nmay be very difficult to find and target that workshop,\nespecially in Iran. That is a country that is bigger than\nFrance, Germany, Italy and Britain combined. The\nsame is true for the small facility in which they could assemble a warhead or a nuclear device that could be\nplaced in a container ship. Chances are you will not\nfind that facility either.\nSo in fact, the only way that you can credibly\nprevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon, is to\nprevent Iran from amassing enough enriched uranium\nfor a bomb. So how much enriched uranium do you\nneed for a bomb, and how close is Iran to getting it?\nLet me show you. I brought a diagram for you. Here\nis the diagram. This is a bomb. This is a fuse.\nIn the case of Iran\u2019s nuclear plans to build a bomb,\nthis bomb has to be filled with enough enriched\nuranium, and Iran has to go through three stages. In\nthe first stage they have to enrich enough low-enriched\nuranium; in the second stage they have to enrich enough\nmedium-enriched uranium. And in the third, and\nfinal, stage they have to enrich enough high-enriched\nuranium for the first bomb.\nWhere is Iran? Iran has completed the first stage. It\ntook them many years, but they completed it, and they\nare 70 per cent of the way there. Now they are well\ninto the second stage. By next spring, at most by next\nsummer, at current enrichment rates, they will have\nfinished the medium enrichment and moved on to the\nfinal stage. From there, it is only a few months, possibly\na few weeks, before they get enough enriched uranium\nfor the first bomb.\nWhat I told the Assembly just now is not based\non secret information. It is not based on military\nintelligence. It is based on public reports of the\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency. Anybody can\nread them. They are online.\nSo if these are the facts \u2014 and they are \u2014 where\nshould a red line be drawn? A red line should be drawn\nright here, before Iran completes the second stage of\nnuclear enrichment necessary to make a bomb and\nbefore Iran gets to a point where it is a few months away\nor a few weeks away from amassing enough enriched\nuranium to make a nuclear weapon.\nEach day, that point is getting closer. That is why\nI speak today with such a sense of urgency, and that is\nwhy everyone should have a sense of urgency.\nThere are some who claim that even if Iran\ncompletes the enrichment process, even if it crosses\nthat red line that I just drew, our intelligence agencies\nwill know when and where Iran will make the fuse, assemble the bomb and prepare the warhead. No one\nappreciates our intelligence agencies more than the\nPrime Minister of Israel. All these leading intelligence\nagencies are superb, including ours. They have foiled\nmany attacks, they have saved many lives, but they\nare not foolproof. For over two years, our intelligence\nagencies did not know that Iran was building a huge\nnuclear enrichment plant under a mountain. Do we\nwant to risk the security of the world on the assumption\nthat we would find a small workshop in a country half\nthe size of Europe in time?\nThe relevant question is not when Iran will get\nthe bomb. The relevant question is at what stage can\nwe no longer stop Iran from getting the bomb? The\nred line must be drawn on Iran\u2019s nuclear enrichment\nprogramme because these enrichment facilities are the\nonly nuclear installations that we can definitely see and\ncredibly target.\nI believe that faced with a clear red line, Iran will\nback down. This will give more time for sanctions and\ndiplomacy to convince Iran to dismantle its nuclear\nweapons programme altogether.\nTwo days ago, from this podium, President Obama\nreiterated that the threat of a nuclear-armed Iran cannot\nbe contained (see A/67/PV.6). I very much appreciate\nthe President\u2019s position, as does everyone in my country.\nWe share the goal of stopping Iran\u2019s nuclear weapons\nprogramme. This goal unites the people of Israel. It\nunites Americans, Democrats and Republicans alike.\nand it is shared by important leaders throughout the\nworld. What I have said today will help ensure that this\ncommon goal is achieved. Israel is in discussions with\nthe United States over this issue, and I am confident\nthat we can chart a path forward together.\nThe clash between modernity and medievalism\nneed not be a clash between progress and tradition. The\ntraditions of the Jewish people go back thousands of\nyears. They are the source of our collective values and\nthe foundations of our national strength. At the same\ntime, the Jewish people have always looked towards the\nfuture. Throughout history, we have been at the forefront\nof efforts to expand liberty, promote equality and\nadvance human rights. We champion those principles\nnot in spite of our traditions but because of them. We\nheed the words of the Jewish prophets Isaiah, Amos and\nJeremiah to treat all with dignity and compassion, to\npursue justice and cherish life and to pray and strive for\npeace. Those are the timeless values of my people, and they are the Jewish people\u2019s greatest gift to humankind.\nLet us commit ourselves today to defending those\nvalues so that we can defend our freedoms and protect\nour common civilization.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffOn behalf of\nthe Government and people of Saint Kitts and Nevis, I\nextend my sincere congratulations to Mr. Vuk Jeremi\u0107\non his election to the presidency of General Assembly at\nits sixty-seventh session. His task, we know, will be far\nfrom easy in the light of the wide range of taxing issues\nthat will be brought before him. As he embarks on his\ntenure, it is our hope that under his astute leadership,\nthe myriad issues that define the work of the Assembly\nwill continue to find relevance for all of us.\nIt is imperative, therefore, that the mobilization of\ncommitments required to advance the agenda of this\nsixty-seventh session begin now. We are aware that\nthe challenges associated with that task are demanding\nand will indeed require our focused attention, strong partnership and visionary leadership if we are to make\nsignificant strides in an era embattled by a plethora\nof issues that threaten the realization of our various\ndevelopment goals. We have no doubt that he will\nprovide the degree of attention they so urgently deserve.\nI must also at this point, on behalf of my delegation,\nthank Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser, President of the\nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-sixth session, for so ably\npresiding over the work of the Assembly during the past\nyear.\nOur focus this year is on continuing to steadfastly\npromote an environment of peace and security, which are\nthe critical requirements for sustainable development\nfor our peoples. As the geographic distance that divides\nus shrinks into insignificance and becomes increasingly\nreduced by our interdependence and partnership, it is\nequally significant that we strive for the effective and\nlasting settlement of disputes.\nLibya and Syria, of course, are just two of the\nmany cases that come to mind, with the myriad and\nmultifaceted questions that they raise, not only\nregarding the advisability of intervention, but also\nwith reference to such issues as the timing of any\nintervention, the form of any intervention and, of\ncourse, the associated humanitarian and relief-related\nconsequences of any such intervention. The complexity\nof those challenges demands a sober redoubling of our\nefforts and underscores the fact that social upheaval\nand human trauma anywhere must indeed concern us\nall.\nThe Security Council must continue to ensure that\nit executes its mandate to enable the institutionalization\nof a culture of peace and security. Respect for\ndemocracy and the democratic principles espoused\nby the United Nations must inform the thrust of our\nengagement as we reject intolerance for diversity and\nembrace peaceful coexistence for all people. I take this\nopportunity to condemn the recent, senseless attack on\nthe United States consulate in Libya, which resulted in\nthe loss of innocent lives. It must be condemned from\nthe highest level.\nSaint Kitts and Nevis is grateful to be a stable,\nsocially cohesive nation. On behalf of my Government,\nI would also like to express our deep appreciation to the\nUnited States of America for its highly valued support,\nin the form of the Caribbean Basin Security Initiative,\noffered to both my country and our Caribbean region\nin our fight against drugs and criminality. It also addresses the issue of the reform that is required to\nensure that our youth embrace renewed alternatives to\nlives of unproductivity and look towards a new hope for\npeace and prosperity through respect for human life.\nThat is of great importance to us. The continuing f low\nof foreign-made small arms into our Caribbean region,\nhowever, concerns us greatly. Originating beyond our\nshores, those weapons have dire consequences in terms\nboth of human life and of the economic stability of our\nnations.\nWe are aware that changing cultural values\nare influencing the use of weapons by some in our\nnations, and we understand the importance of focused\nand effective policing and partnership on matters\nof security. In that regard, we urge the international\ncommunity to make the production of a much-needed\nand long-overdue arms trade treaty an absolute priority.\nThe interests of democratic nations everywhere cry\nout for the establishment of international standards\nand controls governing the illicit f low of conventional\nweapons, and I urge the establishment of a dedicated\nsecretariat to assist States parties in that regard.\nI ask: How can small Caribbean nations be expected\nto deal single-handed with the double misfortune\nof being located between regions of massive drug\nproduction and regions of massive drug consumption?\nSmall arms and light weapons always follow illegal\ndrugs, and we in the Caribbean are simply not equipped\nto deal with the externally created crime fallout. On\nthat point, I wish to stress that before its closure, the\nBarbados branch of the United Nations Office on Drugs\nand Crime provided critical, hands-on collaboration\nin this high-priority area of fighting crime. With\nits presence now having been withdrawn, the vital\nsupport that we need simply is not there, leaving us to\nadjust as best we can at precisely the time when drug-\nand deportee-related crimes continue to be a major\nhemispheric challenge.\nWhile we focus on the well-being of our people, my\nGovernment has strengthened its primary health care\nwith increased attention to reducing the prevalence of\nnon-communicable diseases (NCDs) and has updated\nan implementable plan of action that addresses the\npriorities in keeping with the Political Declaration on\nNCDs (resolution 66/2, annex). As part of our national\nsensitization mechanism on health-related issues, we are\ninstitutionalizing a culture of wellness with emphasis on\nhealthy lifestyles. Similar responses have been initiated\nat the regional level, as we encourage Member States to participate effectively in the multilateral institutions to\nvoice our positions on the issue of NCDs. That is why\nthe Caribbean Community has taken the lead on this\nmatter in recent years, with the High-level Meeting of\nthe General Assembly on the Prevention and Control of\nNon-communicable Diseases.\nTherefore, in the light of the clear nexus between a\nhealthy workforce and a nation\u2019s economic potential, I\nurge this body today to move forward to launch a United\nNations campaign to curb the global toll of NCDs as\nwe move towards the realization of our Millennium\nDevelopment Goals. At the time of last year\u2019s High-\nlevel Meeting on NCDs, there was a commitment both\nto ensuring that this grave issue remains high on the\ndevelopment agenda and to ensuring concrete action in\nthat regard. Hence, the type of global effort previously\nrecommended would constitute precisely the type of\nconcrete action to which we committed ourselves one\nyear ago.\nAny discussion of global health must address the\nissue of HIV/AIDS, and because our ultimate objective\nmust be the complete eradication of that dreaded\ndisease \u2014 as opposed to the lifelong management and\naccommodation of same by millions of people around\nthe globe \u2014 I appeal today for a wise, determined\nand discerning onslaught against the scourge at the\nlocal, national, and international levels by us all. Here\nand now, we must recommit ourselves to eradicating\nthe stigmatization of and discrimination against\npeople living or associated with HIV/AIDS. The\nabuses of human lives that perpetuate discrimination\nand stigmatization must come to an end. We in the\nCaribbean are committed to achieving exactly that.\nI wish now to address a matter that is profoundly\ntroubling to small island States like mine. Whatever\nthe debate being waged internationally regarding the\nquestion of climate change, and however dramatic\nthe rhetorical jousting within various circles on the\nissue, we in the Caribbean can attest to the radical\nclimatic shifts that our region has undergone in recent\ndecades. Moreover, it is very troubling that the largest\ncontributors of greenhouse gases are still not taking\nresponsibility for the increasing temperatures, rising\nsea levels, coastal degradation, coral reef bleaching and\ndecimation, infrastructural damage and loss of lives\nthat their actions have wrought.\nOur peoples, our maritime integrity, our soils and\nour infrastructure are all interrelated contributors to our overall social and economic viability. And the absence\nof corrective and restitutional action on the part of the\nindustrialized nations involved is neither constructive\nnor understandable in this highly interdependent world.\nThe physical, mental and financial burdens that other\ncountries\u2019 energy usage has inf licted on countries\nlike mine has been enormous, plunging us deeper into\ndebt and severely frustrating our efforts to meet our\nMillennium Development Goals.\nWhile a shift to renewable energy will not instantly\nsolve the myriad problems caused by a significantly\nfossil fuel-based global economy, the embrace of green\nenergy will indeed help to halt the intense downward\nspiral into which our fossil fuel-based economies have\nthrust our planet. And so we strongly urge that green\nenergy be made an absolute priority globally. I must\ncommend the Secretary-General for his visionary\nleadership and the Governments and financial\ninstitutions that have committed generously to ensuring\nthat high-impact clean energy is utilized globally.\nMy Government wishes to place on record its\nappreciation to the Government of the Republic of\nChina on Taiwan and other development partners for\ntheir valuable assistance to my country in the area of\nrenewable energy, which will positively impact our\nenergy cost-reduction efforts as we move towards\nrealizing a full green economy by 2015 in order to bring\nmuch-needed financial relief to our people.\nThe recently held United Nations Conference on\nSustainable Development (Rio+20) set the stage for a\nreconfiguration of the global programme on sustainable\ndevelopment, and signaled a new era in the sustainable\ndevelopment agenda of the international community.\nTwo decades of debate and deliberation were\ninstrumental in our being able to frame the dialogue,\nand envision a path for the two decades ahead of us. If\nwe are to even approach the potential of Rio+20, it will\nbe essential that we first face up to, and then break,\nthe strictures of indifference and narrow self-interest\nthat have plagued us for far too long. It is therefore\nincumbent upon us and future generations to view our\nresponsibilities as parts of an ongoing continuum, with\neach of our efforts benefitting from and building upon\nthe work that came before.\nSaint Kitts and Nevis therefore applauds\nthe decision to convene the third United Nations\nConference on the Sustainable Development of\nSmall Island Developing States in 2014. Small island developing States, by virtue of our size and geographic\nprofile, are clearly among the world\u2019s most vulnerable\nnations \u2014 hence the recognition of our need for special\nattention where sustainable development is concerned\nand the importance of everyone remembering the\nabsolutely essential nature of special and differentiated\nresponsibilities where small island States are concerned.\nI therefore urge that clear targets be established\nnow so that we can all prepare thoroughly and well\nfor the 2014 Conference, at which urgently needed\nattention will be paid to the ways in which our own\nvulnerabilities as small developing States might best\nbe reduced. This body can be assured of our full\nparticipation in the process and in the post-Rio+20\nsustainable development agenda.\nPermit me to point out, however, the extent to\nwhich the best-laid plans of countries like mine are\nrepeatedly upended by decisions made in nations far\nbeyond our shores. I mentioned earlier the impact of\nexternally generated carbon emissions on our economic\nprospects. I also discussed the severe national security\nthreat posed to our region by foreign-made small arms\nand weapons that have been finding their way into our\nnations. Particularly trying as well, and very troublingly\nand destabilizing for many countries throughout the\nregion \u2014 and indeed the world at large \u2014 has been\nthe global economic crisis that made itself manifest in\n2008, the ramifications of which have been trying and\ntesting regional economic planners to the limits ever\nsince. In no way of our making, that global economic\ncrisis has severely complicated the task of governance\nin advanced economies and more so in highly indebted\nmiddle-income nations like mine. It has introduced\nboth new variables and additional unknowns to our\neconomic planning models, and has, in a nutshell,\nthrust upon us a backdrop of global volatility that none\nof us could have anticipated, that none of us welcome,\nand that has created immense difficulties for all of our\npeople.\nIndeed, Saint Kitts and Nevis was forced to pursue\na new economic development programme involving\nfiscal balance and debt restructuring, with built-in\nsocial safety nets. The assistance of the International\nMonetary Fund, the World Bank, the European Union\nand our many local, regional and international creditors,\nincluding the United Kingdom and the United States, as\nmembers of the Paris Club, have helped us to alleviate the\nseverity of the social impact of the economic adjustment\nand to restore confidence among our investors in the economy of Saint Kitts and Nevis. But we continue to\nface significant challenges, especially in relation to the\nattainment of economic growth in the context of a very\nsluggish and uncertain global economy. The mammoth\nchallenges and difficulties that our small multi-island\nState faces underscore the need to pay greater attention\nto the issue of special and differentiated responsibilities\nin a rather trying era. It also underscores the need for\nsmall, responsible nations like mine to have fair and\ncalm paths to redress in our relations with far larger\nand infinitely more powerful friends and allies.\nA few days ago in this very Assembly, the nations\nof the world held the High-level Meeting on the Rule\nof Law at the National and International Levels. While\nthere is often debate as to the exact meaning of the\nrule of law, my delegation and the people we represent\nare happy to align ourselves with the core principle\non the rule of law, as distilled by the late Mr. Thomas\nBingham, Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales. In\nhis book The Rule of Law, he stated:\n\u201cThe core of the existing principle is, I suggest,\nthat all persons and authorities within the state,\nwhether public or private, should be bound by\nand entitled to the benefit of laws publicly made,\ntaking effect (generally) in the future and publicly\nadministered in the courts.\u201d\nAlthough not comprehensive, in my country\u2019s view\nthat represents a solid basis from which to identify the\nessential elements of a continually evolving concept\nand an essential mechanism for conflict resolution\nand for ensuring respect for the fundamental rights\nand freedoms of our people. I support the call of the\nSecretary-General for a comprehensive approach to\nstrengthening the rule of law at the international and\ndomestic levels.\nI make the point because, over our almost 30 years\nof nationhood, Saint Kitts and Nevis has studiously\nexamined both trends here at the United Nations and\ndevelopments throughout the international community\nas we have evaluated our place in the world. Throughout\nthat time, we have been faithfully guided by our belief\nin the rule of law. We believe that in the international\narena, the rule of law was created to protect the\nvulnerable, like ours, and to remind us of obligations\nto our fellow human beings. We further believe that\norderly and constructive coexistence requires not only\ncitizens, but nations as well to be bound by the rule of\nlaw. Respect for international law has therefore, for our nation, always been our guiding force. My delegation\ncalls on all States members of this great body to\nsimilarly respect that most sacred pillar of international\ncoexistence.\nThroughout the 29 years of our existence as a\nsovereign nation, the Republic of China on Taiwan\nhas been a highly valued partner and ally. Throughout\nmy nation, evidence of our collaborative efforts\nabound in areas as diverse as agriculture, agritourism,\ngreen energy, information technology, community\ndevelopment and education, to name just a few.\nIn my own nation or even my region, however,\nTaiwan\u2019s unfailing and valued contributions to the\nwork of the United Nations Framework Convention\non Climate Change, the International Civil Aviation\nOrganization, the World Health Assembly and other\nforums have long demonstrated its outstanding\ncredentials as a valued and impactful member of the\nglobal community. It is only fitting and just that all\nremaining strictures pertaining to Taiwan\u2019s standing\namong the international community of nations be\nremoved. Saint Kitts and Nevis appeals to this body to\nensure that that will indeed be done.\nIn closing, I wish to stress here how unfortunate\nit is that, yet again, the case has to be made for the\nlifting of the embargo on Cuba. The embargo is not,\nas some may wish to suggest, a matter of merely\nbilateral import. Not only have we repeatedly heard\nCuba oppose the situation in this very body, but we\nalso know that the embargo\u2019s continued denial of\ncertain medical treatments to the Cuban people is\nsimply unconscionable. Cuba and its people have made\nconsiderable contributions to international medicine\nand higher education, and the Caribbean has been\namong its most sustained beneficiaries. It is therefore\nwith the utmost conviction and clearest possible resolve\nthat Saint Kitts and Nevis calls for the immediate end\nto the embargo.\nI recall that it was in July and August of this year\nthat the international community participated in the\ngames of the thirtieth Olympiad. At a time of rising\ninternational tensions and intensifying antagonisms,\nthe time has probably come for us to introduce to\nother areas of international and intra-State realms of\ninteraction the keen spirit of cooperation and mutual\nrespect that has enabled the Olympics to function so\nconstructively and so well for so many years. The international community is, by definition,\ndiverse. Throughout the community, however, there\nrun strong seams of commonality that can and must\nbe better utilized in order to promote peace, the\nconstructive airing of differences and the avoidance of\nviolent conflict. Most importantly, when all else fails,\nwe can and must settle the most vexing international\ncrises through the good offices of this institution, our\nUnited Nations. That is the path that would serve all our\nbest interests. I sincerely urge that we take it."

        "file_text": "\ufeffVanuatu wishes to\nassociate itself with other delegations in congratulating\nthe President and the members of his Bureau on their\nelection to lead us through this sixty-seventh session\nof the General Assembly. I am indeed profoundly\ndelighted, as Mr. Jeremi\u0107 assured us in our meeting\nearlier this week, that he will do his utmost to assist\nwith and bring to the forefront the issues that confront\nthe Pacific island States and other marginalized\nnations. We trust that with his guidance, this session\nwill conclude with successful outcomes.\nAllow me also to pay tribute to his predecessor,\nMr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser, who, with strong\nleadership and diplomatic finesse, led us to great\noutcomes during the sixty-sixth session of the Assembly.\nOur world has seen unprecedented disputes and\nconflicts, most of which have spanned successive generations. The theme of the sixty-seventh session,\n\u201cBringing about adjustment or settlement of\ninternational disputes or situations by peaceful means\u201d,\nshould therefore lead us to focus on finding lasting\nsolutions to the numerous ongoing conflicts in various\nparts of the world that are causing vulnerable people to\nsuffer. Members have the solemn responsibility to steer\nthis multilateral gathering towards deeper consideration\nof the founding goals of the Organization, which are\nto encourage and create a more secure and peaceful\nworld in which diverse cultures and civilizations can\ncoexist without having to resort to force and violence\nto achieve their goals.\nThis rostrum can testify to all the speeches that\nhave been delivered by the world\u2019s great leaders on a\nvast array of issues that affect humankind. Many of us\nrepresenting politically independent nations here have\nshared the journey and the litany of heartaches and\ndreams deferred of many of our global citizens, whose\nhuman rights to larger political and civil freedom are\nstill bound by the tentacles of imperialism and the\nlegacy of colonialism. Even now, for the remaining\ncolonized territories, this rostrum represents the\npinnacle they so greatly aspire to reach one day.\nSince 1980, the Republic of Vanuatu has repeatedly\ncalled for the United Nations to strengthen its efforts\ntowards achieving the full decolonization of territories\nstill controlled by administrative Powers. I call on the\nindependent, free nations of the world to complete the\nstory of decolonization and to close that chapter.\nAt this juncture, I urge the United Nations not\nto reject the demands for French Polynesia\u2019s right to\nself-determination and progress. In the same manner,\nnegotiations for the self-government of the indigenous\npeople of New Caledonia must continue. We encourage\nthe parties to ensure that the process towards achieving\nself-government will stay on track.\nI also call upon Members to ensure that collective\naction is taken to lift the embargo on Cuba. We, the\nMembers of the United Nations, must revive our\npolitical motivation and courage, dispel our feelings of\nanimosity, and ensure that United Nations resolutions\non that issue are fully implemented. Our actions must\nnot detract from the universal values of love and respect\nfor people, no matter how insignificant they may be to\nthe powerful nations. I hope that one day we will at last\nbe able to echo the message of freedom to many of our\nfriends who still suffer from the burden of conflicting\nideologies.\n\nLast year, I reiterated to this Assembly our serious\nconcerns over the denial of a country\u2019s right to exercise\nits full political freedom and inherent cultural rights\nover its maritime territories. Since we gained our\nindependence 32 years ago, our territorial dispute with\nthe French Republic over the southern two islands of\nVanuatu, Matthew and Hunter, has been a reminder\nthat we must continue to uphold the notion that the rule\nof law should not be used by powerful nations as an\ninstrument to coerce weak and small nations, especially\nin territorial disputes.\nThe French and the Vanuatu Governments met in\nParis in April to commence dialogue on the issue of the\nterritorially disputed islands. We take this opportunity\nto thank the French Government for finally opening its\ndoor to dialogue and negotiation in an attempt to resolve\nthat outstanding international dispute. We acknowledge\nthe procedures outlined within the United Nations to\nensure that such disputes are amicably resolved.\nAs a small island State surrounded by the vast\nPacific Ocean, Vanuatu is exposed to the notorious\nillegal transshipment of and trade in illicit arms. The\ninternational arms trade has continuously lacked proper\nand coherent regulation and is responsible for the loss of\ninnumerable lives. Like many other countries, we call\non the United Nations to take a much firmer approach\nin expediting the conclusion of an arms trade treaty,\nwhich would provide greater security and control over\nsuch illegal activity. That is an issue of paramount\nimportance to all countries exposed to the illegal trade\nin arms and light weapons.\nMy country has consistently argued that the\nmechanisms and criteria for assessing graduation\neligibility must not be isolated from the permanent and\ninherent vulnerabilities of our countries. It is unrealistic\nfor United Nations agencies to assess progress and\nmake projections without taking into consideration the\nmatter of permanent vulnerabilities and the capacity\nto sustain growth in our countries after graduation. I\nwish to further state that, according to the World Risk\nReport 2011, Vanuatu scored highest on the World Risk\nIndex as the country with the greatest disaster risk, due\nto its high exposure and weak coping capacities. The\nfindings of that report are critical, and we therefore ask\nthat the United Nations Committee for Development\nPolicy carefully weigh its arguments and reassess the\nvulnerability graduation criteria.\nI would also like to state that, prior to another\ntriennial review of the least developed country (LDC) category, the United Nations will need to ensure that\nproper resolutions are adopted by the General Assembly\nto ensure that small island States graduating from LDC\nstatus continue to enjoy certain preferential treatment,\neven after graduation, to offset the vulnerability factor.\nLet me take this opportunity to invite the members of\nthe triennial review to visit my country to establish\nfirst-hand information and ascertain the findings of\nthe World Risk Report prior to escalating the process of\ngraduation in 2013.\nOur own experience has shown that the different\nways that multilateral organizations and institutions\ncategorize member countries can affect the f low of\ndevelopment assistance. For instance, Vanuatu, together\nwith 15 other countries, was selected several years ago\nfrom among the Pacific island countries to benefit from\nthe Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) funding\nof the Government of the United States of America. At\nthe time of our selection, Vanuatu was graded as a low-\nincome country and, by the eligibility criteria of the\nMCC, was automatically qualified for and benefited\nfrom $66 million to build two major national roads on\ntwo different islands in the country. I wish to express\nour appreciation to the United States Government for\nits assistance.\nHowever, when the Report on Countries that are\nCandidates for Millennium Challenge Corporation\nAccount Eligibility for Fiscal Year 2010 was released,\nVanuatu failed to qualify. The reason was simply that\nthe MCC was using World Bank criteria and graduated\nVanuatu from the status of low-income country to that\nof low-middle-income country. In other words, the\nWorld Bank\u2019s criteria may be totally different from the\nLDC criteria defined by the United Nations. I therefore\nwish to call on the United Nations, especially the\nEconomic and Social Council, to ensure that the LDC\ndefinition and criteria used by United Nations agencies\nare compatible with those of the international financial\ninstitutions.\nThe vast Pacific Ocean is our heritage and the\nprime means of livelihood of the people living in its\nisland countries. Like other Pacific Island countries,\nVanuatu continues to be exposed to and threatened by\nthe negative impacts of climate change, such as coastal\nerosion, coral bleaching and ocean acidification. At the\nForty-Third Pacific Islands Forum in the Cook Islands,\nthe Forum leaders noted that many challenges remain in\nrealizing benefits from the pledged new and additional\ntargets of the Copenhagen Accord. In that respect, I would like to seize this opportunity to express our wish\nfor United Nations assistance in facilitating effective\nresponses to global climate change, particularly through\nthe prompt implementation of adaptation measures, as\nwell as mitigation efforts, climate change financing,\ncapacity-building and international negotiations.\nWhile we tend to direct our main focus of attention\ntowards global climate change, we must address other\nmatters, such as environmental pollution, with the\nsame exigency and rigor. The potential for permanent,\nirrevocable damage to the environment by marine\npollution has been constantly highlighted by the\nscientific community and should not be tolerated.\nThe future growth of international maritime traffic\nwill further exacerbate the situation. Vanuatu urges\nall remaining States that have not yet done so to\nexpeditiously sign and ratify the 1972 London\nConvention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by\nDumping of Wastes and Other Matter, as well as the\n1996 Protocol thereto, and to promulgate and enforce\nlegal regimes, both in the domestic and international\narenas.\nAt this point, I would like to reiterate the\nunnecessary risk to which we expose our children and\nourselves by not taking a firm precautionary approach\nwith regard to marine geoengineering practices,\nsuch as sub-seabed carbon sequestration and ocean\nfertilization. In our global efforts to combat climate\nchange, the strict promotion of and adherence to only\nthose responses that are environmentally sensible is\nour crucial responsibility, and I am not only speaking\non behalf of a small island nation when I recall that,\nby forgetting the essentiality of the oceans as the\nvery foundation of life on Earth, one neglects a vital\nguarantor of mankind\u2019s future survival.\nAs I conclude this speech, I have to make a last\nappeal to all assembled leaders. I urge them to take\nimmediate action upon their return to their home\ncountries to initiate the change that needs to come about\nif we wish to preserve a planet capable of providing our\nsons and daughters with a bright future. If the leaders\nof the industrialized countries want to achieve the\nproposed 1.5\u00b0 C target, they have less than eight years\nleft to close a vast mitigation gap. Who if not they can\nor will implement the required measures for that crucial\nchange? This may well be their last chance. In their\nhands lie the hope and destiny of the world\u2019s nations.\nIt is a responsibility that they must assume not only for\ntheir own people, but for humankind as a whole. I am grateful for the opportunity to express my\nviews in this forum. Long live our aspirations to create\na better and a more secure world for everyone, and may\nGod bless the United Nations."

Once again, Cuba\nwas excluded at the insistence of the United States.\nArgentine sovereignty over the Malvinas Islands, which\nour country fervently supports, and the lifting of the\nblockade against Cuba were the focus of a declaration\nthat demonstrated that the American homeland\nenvisaged by Bolivar \u2014 our America as envisaged by Marti \u2014 has entered a new era: the century of its\nultimate independence.\nSome months prior, the Community of Latin\nAmerican and Caribbean States (CELAC) held its\ninaugural summit meeting in Caracas. No other\ninstitutional entity in our hemisphere in the course of\nthe last century is of such major importance, wrote\nthe leader of the Cuban Revolution, Fidel Castro Ruz,\nabout CELAC. We know that CELAC still has not yet\nreached its full development, so that our peoples can\ngo forward in ranks as compact as the veins of silver\nin the roots of the Andes. But Latin America and the\nCaribbean have definitively changed, and they are\nprepared to make a greater contribution to the world\norder. However, the threats, dangers and obstacles\nshould not be underestimated.\nThe policy of the United States with regard to\nour region, under both Democratic and Republican\nAdministrations, has been essentially the same.

Tireless efforts have been made to\ncontrol our wealth, to impose their models, culture and\nideas, and to interfere in our internal affairs. Despite\ntalk of \u201cintelligent power\u201d and the use of fabulous new\ntechnology, the focus remains on security and military\ndeployment, rather than on democratic and mutually\nbeneficial relations between equal, sovereign States.\nIn the circumstances of a global economic crisis,\nthe depletion of resources and the shifting balances in\nthe world, NATO continues to perceive our region as\na mere periphery of the Euro-Atlantic area, in which\nit might intervene to protect its interests, however\nillegitimate.\nThe upcoming elections in the sister nation of the\nBolivarian Republic of Venezuela will be decisive\nfor the shared destiny of our region. We would like\nto express to the Venezuelan people and their leader,\nPresident Ch\u00e1vez Fr\u00edas, our full solidarity in the face of\nthe looming attempts at destabilization. The governing\npowers in the United States would be making a very\nserious mistake of untold consequences if they were\nto attempt to reverse by force the social achievements\nattained by our peoples.\nCuba has continuously contributed to peace in\nColombia, with discretion and modesty. We fully\nsupported the confidential exploratory talks held\nthroughout this year in Havana, and we will continue to\ndo so as a guarantor and host of the upcoming process of dialogue between the Colombian Government and\nthe Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia.\nOur America will remain mutilated as long as\nPuerto Rico, a Latin American and Caribbean nation,\nlacks its independence \u2014 a cause that we fully support.\nToday\u2019s world is in no way similar to the one\nthat was envisioned by those who drafted the United\nNations Charter, over the ashes left by the Second\nWorld War, when they expressed their determination to\nsave our generations from the scourge of war; protect\nthe fundamental rights of human beings and equality\namong all nations, large and small; and promote justice,\ndignity and social progress. Today, the overthrow of\nGovernments through the use of force and violence is\nbeing blatantly encouraged. Regime change is being\nimposed from Washington and other NATO capitals,\nand wars of conquest are being waged for the control\nof natural resources and areas of strategic importance.\nThe Governments of the United States and some\nEuropean countries have decided to overthrow the\nSyrian Government. To that end, they have armed,\nfinanced and trained opposition groups, and turned to\nthe use of mercenaries.\nOwing mainly to the firm opposition of Russia\nand China, it has not been possible to manipulate the\nSecurity Council into imposing the interventionist\nformula that has been applied in the context of recent\nbellicose ventures.\nCuba reaffirms the right of the Syrian people to\nthe full exercise of its right to self-determination and\nsovereignty without interference or foreign intervention\nof any sort. The violence, massacres and terrorist acts,\nwhich have taken a high toll in innocent lives, must\ncease. The trafficking in arms and money f lows that\nhelps fund insurgent groups, as well as the shameful\nmanipulation of reality by the media, must also come\nto an end.\nIt is the duty of the General Assembly to make use of\nthe means at its disposal to promote a peaceful solution\nto the current situation, which is destroying that Arab\ncountry, and prevent foreign military aggression, which\nwould have serious consequences for the entire Middle\nEast region.\nThe General Assembly should act with resolve and\nrecognize the Palestinian State as a full Member of the\nUnited Nations, within the borders established prior\nto 1967 and with East Jerusalem as its capital; and it should do so now, with or without the consent of the\nSecurity Council; with or without a United States veto;\nand with or without new peace negotiations.\nThe global economic crisis, which is having a\nparticularly strong impact on Europe, reflects the\ninability of Governments and institutions to solve a\nproblem that requires a rethinking of the basic tenets of\nthe current system of international economic relations,\nwhich serves only to pillage underdeveloped countries.\nThe harsh consequences of the crisis in the\ndeveloped world and the failed policies adopted so far\nin an attempt to stop it continue to be borne by workers,\nthe increasing number of unemployed, immigrants and\nthe poor, whose protest movements are being brutally\nrepressed. The predicted increase in food prices as a\nresult of the drought that is affecting much of North\nAmerica threatens to exacerbate global food insecurity.\nEnvironmental destruction is also worsening.\nThe loss of biodiversity and of the natural balance\nof ecosystems is accelerating; and the growing\nirrationality of production and consumption patterns,\nthe marginalization of more than half of the world\u2019s\npopulation and the lack of comprehensive measures to\nhalt climate change pose an ever-increasing risk to the\nphysical integrity of entire nations, particularly small\nisland States.\nIn the face of those colossal challenges, we wonder\nif anything could ever justify the fact that, 20 years\nafter the end of the so-called Cold War, military budgets\nhave almost doubled, reaching the astronomical figure\nof $1.74 trillion. As President Ra\u00fal Castro Ruz asked,\nagainst what enemies will those weapons be used? Will\nthey be used to eliminate the masses of poor people\nwho can no longer tolerate their poverty, or to halt the\nunstoppable migrations of survivors?\nUnder these circumstances, it is urgent to save the\nUnited Nations and subject it to deep-seated reform, so\nas to put it at the service of all, equally sovereign States\nand free it from the arbitrariness and double standards\nof a handful of industrialized and powerful countries.\nInternational law and the purposes and principles of\nthe Charter of the United Nations should be resolutely\nenforced; the key role of the General Assembly should\nbe restored; and a democratic, transparent and truly\nrepresentative Security Council should be relaunched.\nThe Summit of Non-Aligned Countries was\nsuccessfully held in Tehran and reaffirmed the Movement\u2019s positions in defence of peace, independence\nand the sovereign equality of States; justice; the right\nto development; sovereignty over natural resources;\ngeneral and complete disarmament, particularly\nnuclear disarmament; and the right to the peaceful use\nof nuclear energy. We have pledged our full support to\nthe chairmanship of the Movement.\nOn July 31, the State Department of the United\nStates included Cuba once again on its unilateral,\narbitrary list of States that sponsor international\nterrorism. The true motive behind the inclusion of Cuba\non that spurious list is to fabricate pretexts to increase\nthe persecution of Cuba with respect to its financial\ntransactions and justify the policy of blockade, which\nhas caused immense human and economic harm\ntotalling $1 trillion, based on the current value of gold.\nThe United States does not have the slightest moral\nor political authority to judge Cuba.It is well known\nthat the United States Government has resorted to State\nterrorism as a weapon in its policy against Cuba, which\nhas caused the deaths of 3,478 of our compatriots and\ninjured another 2,099. It is also harbouring dozens\nof terrorists, some of whom live in freedom in that\ncountry, and continues with the prolonged, inhumane\nimprisonment and cruel and arbitrary retention on its\nterritory of the five Cuban anti-terrorists.\nCuba strongly rejects the use of so sensitive an issue\nas terrorism to pursue political goals and calls for the\nUnited States Government to stop lying and put an end\nto this shameful exercise, which is an outrage against\nthe Cuban people, the North American victims and the\ninternational community and discredits the cause of the\nstruggle against terrorism.\nWe reiterate to the United States, on the eve of\nthe elections in that country, our irrevocable yearning\nfor peace and our interest in moving towards the\nnormalization of bilateral relations through dialogue,\non an equal footing and with absolute respect for our\nindependence.\nWith absolute certainty, our people, come what\nmay, with all and for the well-being of all, will continue\non the path they have already chosen until they have\nachieved full justice."

        "file_text": "\ufeffTen years ago, Switzerland joined the United Nations,\nthus becoming both the 190th Member State and the\nfirst country in which United Nations membership\nwas approved by its citizens in a popular vote. The\nUnited Nations and Switzerland share the same values\nand pursue common goals: the promotion of peace\nand security, sustainable development, the protection\nand promotion of human rights, and the provision of\nemergency relief to victims of conflict and natural\ndisasters.\nWe face significant and pressing challenges\nin all these areas. Climate change, food and water\nscarcity, migration, organized crime, terrorism and the\nproliferation of weapons do not respect borders. These\nare global challenges that threaten entire regions. In an\nincreasingly interconnected world, we have to search\nfor global solutions that respond to regional and national\nneeds. It is not enough to simply maintain the status\nquo. We have to find today the solutions of tomorrow.\n\nThe United Nations spans the entire world. Its\nuniversality gives it unparalleled legitimacy and\nenables it to find and implement solutions to global\nchallenges that enjoy broad support. In view of the\ngrowing interdependence of those challenges, the\nUnited Nations is now more important than ever. It must\nbe at the heart of international governance. The support\nof every Member State and every one of us is therefore\ncrucial. In order to accomplish the Herculean tasks\nawaiting it, the United Nations can no longer settle for\nthe lowest common denominator, as it does all too often\nwhen consensus is reached among its Members. If the\nUnited Nations is to overcome the challenges facing it,\nit must be efficient, innovative and active. What does\nthat mean?\nThe United Nations is efficient when it updates and\nimproves its processes so that it can act more rapidly\nand in a more coordinated manner, despite growing\nbudgetary pressures. In this respect, Switzerland\nsupports the reform agenda of the Secretary-General. It\nshould be implemented swiftly.\nThe United Nations is innovative when it develops\nnew ideas and solutions that are tailored to the big\npicture. United Nations structures have evolved\norganically over past decades. They do not encourage\npeople to stray from the beaten path. More intensive\nexchanges within the United Nations and between the\nOrganization and scientific circles, civil society and\nthe private sector promote creativity and ensure broad\nsupport for United Nations activities. At the seat of\nthe United Nations in Geneva that type of exchange\nis encouraged in a targeted manner. Switzerland\nalso supports the strengthening and development of\nref lection and research activities within the United\nNations. Bringing those activities together in Geneva\nwould further strengthen the creative potential of the\nOrganization.\nFinally, the United Nations will show its strengths\nif it can achieve consensus in conflict situations and\npush through to find solutions. Resorting to the right\nof the veto in the Security Council is difficult to justify\nin the event of genocide, war crimes or crimes against\nhumanity. That is why Switzerland, together with\nother countries, continues to clamour for reform of the\nworking methods of the Security Council. Transparency\nand the Council\u2019s collaboration with other bodies within\nthe Organization should be improved, and the right of\nveto should be limited.\n\nAs Switzerland traditionally defends dialogue, we\ncall upon all States and peoples to commit to greater\nunderstanding and peaceful coexistence among\ncultures, religions and beliefs. Freedom of belief and\nreligion, like freedom of opinion and expression,\nare universally guaranteed core values that must be\nprotected and respected. Moreover, responding to an\nunpleasant opinion with violence can never be justified.\nIt must be countered by ideas and logical arguments,\nand if necessary through legal recourse, especially if\nnational, religious or cultural hatred has been incited.\nThe attacks in recent weeks against diplomatic missions\nare therefore unacceptable regardless of the motivation\nbehind them. We all bear a common responsibility to\npromote tolerance and the respect for beliefs.\nFor the current session of the General Assembly,\nthe President has chosen as the theme for the high-level\ndebate \u201cBringing about adjustment or settlement of\ninternational disputes or situations by peaceful means\u201d.\nI applaud his choice. In recent years, the United Nations\nhas strengthened its capacity in the area of mediation\nand preventive diplomacy, which has brought about a\nre-evaluation of mediation processes. We need to go\nfurther, however, as most of the United Nations budget\ncontinues to be spent on peacekeeping operations.\nSwitzerland is therefore convinced that greater\ninvestment in peaceful means that could bring about\na settlement of disputes, especially through mediation\nand preventive diplomacy, would pay off in the long\nrun. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure;\nthat is as true for States as it is for people.\nIt is not just a matter of funding. Every single\nconflict that is averted means the avoidance of human\nsuffering and the non-interruption of development in the\ncountries concerned. Over the past decade, Switzerland\nhas actively participated in more than 30 mediation\nprocesses in some 20 countries. Moreover, Switzerland\nregularly makes its experts and know-how available to\nthe United Nations and hopes to see its collaboration\nwith the Organization grow. Adapted to current needs,\nspecial political missions respond to the complexity of\npolitical realities. Thanks to those missions, the United\nNations is in a position to react f lexibly and quickly\nin the event of a constitutional crisis or a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat.\nAs the main instruments of preventive diplomacy, such\nmissions should be strengthened, specifically through\nthe introduction of modalities, financing and optimal\nsupport.\n\nWhen prevention is not enough, the international\ncommunity must act firmly. The United Nations should\ntherefore demonstrate that it is capable of intervening\nand imposing itself. Switzerland is deeply concerned by\nthe dramatic worsening of the situation in Syria, where\nhuman rights and international humanitarian law are\nbeing f louted. At this very moment, as I speak, innocent\npeople are dying from bullets fired by the Syrian army\nand the armed opposition. Thousands of people have\nbeen killed, more than 1 million are on the run in their\nown country and some 250,000 have sought refuge\nin neighbouring countries. It is difficult, maybe even\nimpossible, to reach hundreds of thousands of victims\nwho, wounded and traumatized, are condemned to wait\nin zones under siege. United Nations agencies estimate\nthat approximately 2.5 million people need urgent\nhumanitarian assistance. Switzerland has therefore set\naside more than $15 million for humanitarian assistance\nin Syria and neighbouring countries.\nAs long as human rights continue to be trampled upon\nand those responsible are not sufficiently perturbed, it\nwill be impossible to guarantee security. Switzerland\ntherefore calls for the perpetrators of serious violations\nof human rights answer for their actions. The impunity\nof perpetrators is not just immoral; by compromising\nthe process of reconciliation that gets under way in a\nsociety after a war, it encourages history to repeat itself.\nSwitzerland leads a group of some 30 countries\nthat are asking that the International Criminal Court\ntake up the case of Syria. I would invite all heads of\nState and Government present here today to rally to that\ninitiative. The international community must be made\naware of the extent of human rights violations in Syria.\nSwitzerland welcomes the work of the commission\nof inquiry set up by the Human Rights Council and\ncalls for it to be strengthened. It also welcomes the\nappointment of Mr. Brahimi as the new Joint Special\nRepresentative of the United Nations and the League of\nArab States for the Syrian crisis and will do its utmost\nto help him find a political solution to the conflict in\nthat country.\nWe know that our use of the world\u2019s available\nresources is not sustainable at the global level. We\nare exploiting those resources without concern for\nthe future. We also know that human beings are the\ncause of climate change. The fate of our planet rests in\nour hands. Much will depend on whether we succeed\nin making the transition to sustainable development\nand whether we succeed in moving towards a green\neconomy. The Rio+20 outcome document provides us\nwith an opportunity that we must embrace. We must act\ntoday so that future generations do not have to pay the\nprice for our inaction.\nHowever, a great deal of mutual distrust remains, as\ndoes the fear that not everyone will be able to compete\non equal terms in a green economy. We must overcome\nthat hurdle. Switzerland will play its part in sharing the\nburden of efforts between the North and the South. The\nGreen Climate Fund will be a key element in financing\nthat transition. It should therefore be set up without\ndelay and in an optimal environment. I am convinced\nthat Geneva can offer such an environment.\nThe transition to a green economy also requires\nnew approaches, in terms of both thinking and acting.\nIn any process of change, there are winners and losers.\nHowever, with regard to sustainable development\nthe winners and losers are the same, namely, future\ngenerations. Either they will be able to continue to live\nin an intact environment where they benefit from the\nnatural resources they need, or they will have to put\nup with a decline in the standard of living due to the\nexhaustion of resources and the broad consequences of\nclimate change. Our common challenge lies in ensuring\nthe well-being of all without overexploiting our natural\nresources.\nSwitzerland attaches the greatest importance to\nthe post-2015 agenda, which will allow us to benefit\nfrom our experience with the Millennium Development\nGoals in order to prepare for the future. That approach\ngives us the opportunity to consider all dimensions of\nsustainable development together and, for the first time\never, develop a universal system of targets for the well-\nbeing of future generations throughout the world.\nSwitzerland is convinced that setting sustainable\ndevelopment goals is an important element in\nstrengthening that development. It will play an active\npart in defining a new system of goals. Switzerland\nbelieves it imperative to combine discussions on the\npost-2015 agenda and on sustainable development goals\ninto a single process.\nAccording to the Roman philosopher Seneca, it is\nnot that we have a short space of time, but that we waste\nmuch of it. So let us today take on the great challenges\nbefore us. Let us join forces to bring about more peace\nand security in the world and better protect human rights.\nLet us put an end to the impunity of the perpetrators of\nserious human rights abuses and bring them to account.\n\nLet us take bold steps for more sustainable development\nin the interests of our children and grandchildren. And\nlet us strengthen the United Nations so that, as the only\ntruly universal Organization, it is better equipped to\naddress those immense challenges."

        "file_text": "\ufeffLet me start by extending my\nsincere congratulations to the President of the General\nAssembly and his country, Serbia, upon his election to preside over the sixty-seventh session. I am confident\nthat, with his extensive experience and diplomatic skill,\nhe will lead this session of the General Assembly to\na successful conclusion. I pledge the support of the\nEritrean delegation for his noble efforts for the common\ngood.\nI wish to pay profound tribute to the outgoing\nPresident, Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser, for his\ncommendable work at the sixty-sixth session of the\nGeneral Assembly. He indeed served us well. I would\nalso like to thank Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for\nhis leadership and his report (A/67/2) on the work of\nour United Nations at the outset of this general debate.\nAlmost seven decades have elapsed since the\nestablishment of the United Nations, and, undoubtedly,\nthe world has seen much political, economic, social\nand technological progress. However, it is clear that\nthe United Nations has not succeeded in its paramount\npurpose of saving humankind from the scourge of\nwar. In the past 67 years, there has hardly been one in\nwhich no war raged somewhere in the world. What is\nparticularly significant is the fact that in most of these\nwars, the major Powers were the main architects and\nactors \u2014 those same Powers which, by virtue of their\nposition in the Security Council, should have shouldered\nthe greatest responsibility in the maintenance of peace\nand stability.\nOn another front, and again despite the progress\nmade, in the twenty-first century, hundreds of\nmillions of people in the developing world, as well as\nin developed countries, continue to suffer from the\nscourge of poverty, easily preventable diseases and\navoidable premature deaths.\nIn addition to the twin scourges of war and\npoverty, our world now faces an environmental threat\nthat puts human livelihoods and survival at risk. It is\ntherefore disconcerting that the current global political,\neconomic and security architecture is inadequate to\naddress the challenges that we all face. The United\nNations system, as has been repeatedly pointed out,\nis indeed outdated. The General Assembly has been\nemasculated. The Security Council is dominated by\none powerful permanent member, and is increasingly\nbecoming paralysed. Change is being resisted by\nthose who believe they have benefited from the old,\nanachronistic order. Respect for the sovereign equality\nand territorial integrity of nations and non-interference\nin their internal affairs \u2014 which constitute the\npillars of international law and the Charter of the United Nations \u2014 are being eroded and wilfully\nf louted. The noble aims of protecting human rights\nand civilian lives are being selectively and cynically\nemployed to justify military aggression, external\nintervention and imposition of sanctions \u2014 collective\nas well as unilateral \u2014 to destabilize nations, change\nGovernments and gain economic advantages.\nThis summary assessment, Eritrea believes, is\nshared by the majority of States Members of the United\nNations. It is indeed the position of Africa, of most\ndeveloping countries, the Non-Aligned Movement, the\nemerging Powers and many in the developed world.\nWhat this emerging consensus now needs is a concerted\nand coordinated effort to effect real change, including\nin the United Nations system, that would lead to a more\npeaceful, just and equitable world.\nNo part of the world is in need of positive change\nmore than the African continent, which remains\nmarginalized and almost voiceless. And yet Africa is\na continent of massive potential, and there are already\nunmistakable, if tentative, signs of its awakening. A\nnumber of African countries are taking serious steps\nin the economic, political and social arenas and the\nrevitalization of the African Union proceeds apace.\nWe hope that this African initiative, which will have a\nsalutary effect on the world economy and international\ngovernance, will be supported by a more conducive\ninternational environment and by the United Nations.\nEritrea is convinced that our subregion, the Horn\nof Africa, will overcome its current difficulties and\nmake a substantial contribution to the re-emergence\nof a dynamic and prosperous Africa. Despite the\ndifficulties it has faced, it has made remarkable progress\nin providing and caring for its people and rebuilding\nits economy, and has embarked on modernizing its\ninfrastructure, including developing renewable energy,\nwith the perspective of regional trade, investment and\nintegration. It will continue to work to ensure a life of\ndignity and prosperity for its citizens, in a peaceful and\ncooperative region, and a more just and equitable world."

        "file_text": "\ufeffHis Excellency Mr. Alassane Ouattara, President of\nthe Republic of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, who was not able to\nbe here today, wishes me to express, on behalf of the\npeople and Government of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, the warmest\ncongratulations to His Excellency Mr. Vuk Jeremi\u0107\non his well-deserved election to the presidency of\nthe General Assembly at its sixty-seventh session. I\nwould like to assure Mr.Jeremi\u0107 of the full support of the Ivorian delegation for the success of his mandate.\nI would also like to convey to his predecessor, His\nExcellency Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser, my\ndelegation\u2019s satisfaction with the work undertaken and\nthe encouraging results achieved under his presidency.\nHis commitment to our common cause has allowed the\nOrganization to fully play the role conferred upon it\nby the United Nations Charter. I wish to reiterate to\nHis Excellency Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon my\nsincere thanks for his determined commitment and for\nhis persistent quest for peace throughout the world.\nI reiterate to him once again the infinite gratitude of\nmy President and the entire nation for his unfailing\ncommitment to C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire. Through the Secretary-\nGeneral, I would like to pay tribute to all the civil\nand military personnel of the United Nations for their\ntireless efforts on behalf of peace and security.\nThe theme chosen for this session, \u201cBringing about\nadjustment or settlement of international disputes\nor situations by peaceful means\u201d, follows on from\nthe theme of the previous session. In particular, it\nreflects the essence of the ideals of the San Francisco\nConference, which led to the birth of the Organization.\nThe purposes ascribed to the United Nations in its\nCharter can be summarized by the triptych of peace,\nliberty and development. To achieve those Charter\npurposes, the founding fathers of the Organization\nestablished a system of collective security on the basis\nof two major principles: the prohibition of recourse\nto the use of force in international relations and the\nobligation to settle disputes peacefully.\nNow more than ever, we must enhance our collective\nsecurity system and ensure that it has all the necessary\nresources to be effective. For his part, the President of\nC\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire is committed to strictly following a policy\nof peace and dialogue. These are principles that were\nenshrined as cardinal virtues, through trial by fire,\nby the late President, Mr. F\u00e9lix Houphou\u00ebt-Boigny,\nwho won a place in the history of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, and\nindeed of the African continent, through his pragmatic\napproach to the settlement of conflict through dialogue.\nFor that reason, President Allassane Ouattara spares\nno efforts in seeking lasting solutions, both nationally in\nthe post-electoral crisis in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, and regionally,\nespecially with regard to the situations in Mali and\nGuinea-Bissau. Indeed, the security of West Africa is\nseriously challenged by military and political crises\norchestrated by military, rebel or terrorist movements,\nparticularly in Mali and Guinea-Bissau. The Economic Community of West African States\n(ECOWAS), which has always promoted the path of\nnegotiation highlighted by the theme of this session, is\nworking tirelessly to ensure a positive outcome to those\ncrises and to ensure the restoration of constitutional\norder and democracy in Mali and Guinea-Bissau.\nWhile the situation has considerably improved in\nGuinea-Bissau, the one in Mali continues to be of major\nconcern. Rebel movements linked to terrorist networks\ncontinue to occupy the main towns in the north of that\ncountry, which they are now pillaging and destroying\nwith total impunity.\nDetermined to put an end to this abusive occupation\nof the north of Mali, ECOWAS plans to deploy a\nmilitary force at the request of the Government of Mali\nto help the Malian army efficiently fulfil its sovereign\nmission of defending the territorial integrity of the\ncountry. The establishment and deployment of such a\nforce requires major support from the African Union,\nthe United Nations and all development partners.\nIndeed, the presence of groups with links to terrorists\nin northern Mali is a genuine threat, which could lead,\nif nothing is done, to the implosion of the entire West\nAfrican region and the Sahel.\nWhen we look at the non-State players involved\nin the current conflicts in Guinea-Bissau and Mali,\nparticularly the terrorist networks and armed groups\nlinked to transnational crime and piracy in the Gulf\nof Guinea, we note how incomplete the current\ninstruments for resolving these crises are, based as\nthey are on negotiation and mediation. Today, there is\nno questioning the fact that the resurgence of terrorism\nin the Sahel region in general and in northern Mali\nin particular has created a sanctuary, a lawless zone.\nWestern Africa faces other dangerous threats to the\nsecurity of not only the region itself but also other\nregions, perhaps even Europe.\nEradicating these problems requires concerted and\ndiligent action by ECOWAS, the African Union and\nthe United Nations. I am pleased to note the creation of\nthe United Nations Counter-Terrorism Centre, which is\nfinanced and hosted by Saudi Arabia. I also welcome\nthe proposal made by the Secretary-General to appoint\na United Nations counter-terrorism coordinator, and I\nwould like to assure him of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire\u2019s full support.\nTransnational crime, drug trafficking, human\ntrafficking, piracy in the Gulf of Guinea and the\ndestruction of the environment are threats to the world in general and to Africa in particular. The International\nMaritime Organization, in its 2010 annual report, quite\nrightly said that the West African coast is one of the six\nmain centres of piracy in the world. Responsibility for\nthe measures to be taken to deal with these scourges\nlies first and foremost with the States of the subregion\nand the principal subregional organizations.\nIn that regard, I welcome the fact that the fortyfirst\nECOWAS Summit, held in Yamoussoukro on\n28 and 29 June, decided to convene a joint summit of\nWest African and Central African States to take joint\nmeasures on piracy and organized transnational crime\nin the Gulf of Guinea pursuant to Security Council\nresolution 2039 (2012).\nHowever, despite the goodwill of the countries of\nthe subregion, they cannot, on their own, deal with the\nthreats facing maritime security. My country welcomes\nthe proposal of the Secretary-General to facilitate the\norganization of a summit of heads of State of the region\nto enable them to draw up a regional strategy to combat\nmaritime piracy, together with the African Union.\nC\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, like many other African and\nnon-African States, sincerely hopes that the\nOrganization will be able to adopt in the near future\na legally binding arms trade treaty, following the\nefforts made by all parties to reach a consensus. The\ninternational community must not lose the historic\nopportunity it has to better regulate, if not outright\nprohibit, a trade that causes 500,000 deaths each year\nand that is the main cause of violations of human\nrights and the destabilization of our States, as well as\nworsening conditions for our people, and, above all,\nposes a constant threat to regional and international\npeace and security. With respect to the links between\neconomic development and the environment, the United\nNations Conference on Sustainable Development,\nheld in June in Rio de Janeiro, shows what we can\naccomplish when we work together to build a better\nworld for current generations and those to come. The\ncombined crises in food, energy and the environment\nthreaten the peace and security of all humankind. Yet\nwe have the means to achieve a world free of famine\nand hunger. It is within our capabilities.\nAllow me to stress that, with respect to the\ninternational system, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire urges all delegations,\nas we take up the eighth round of intergovernmental\nnegotiations concerning the reform of the Security\nCouncil, to show flexibility and a spirit of compromise. It is important to act quickly, because the composition\nof the Council is the keystone of our collective security\nsystem, and in that light its composition should be\ndesigned to maximize efficiency.\nIn order for the Security Council to be truly\neffective in its decisions, since it devotes two-thirds\nof its time to the African continent, we consider it\nmore critical than ever for Africa to hold a permanent\nseat with the right of veto, in accordance with the\nrecommendations defined in the Ezulwini Consensus.\nTaking duly into account the wishes of African heads\nof State and Government, the reform of the Security\nCouncil could represent a historical opportunity that\nthe international community should seize in order to\nrepair an anomaly in international relations. With that\nin mind, I hope that the forthcoming negotiations on\nSecurity Council reform will be crowned with success,\nyielding a Council that truly represents the realities of\nour shared history and our contemporary world.\nI would like now to make some remarks about the\nsituation in my country. Thanks to the most valuable\nsupport of the international community, especially the\nUnited Nations, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire has emerged from the\nmilitary and political crisis that rocked the foundations\nof its economic and social development for nearly\na decade. Resolutely committed to the path of postconf\nlict reconstruction, and with the aim of national\ncohesion, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire has made considerable\nprogress in the political, economic, social, security\nand humanitarian spheres since 21 May 2011, the\nofficial date on which President Ouattara assumed\nthe presidency of the Republic. Those results were\nmade possible by the determination of the Ivorian\nGovernment to implement the three central priorities\ndefined by the President when he took office.\nFirst, on security and stability, significant joint\nefforts by the Government and the United Nations\nOperation in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire lead to improvements in the\nsituation, even in the west of the country, which has\nbeen the most problematic area.\nSecondly, national reconciliation has been effected\nthrough the National Commission for Dialogue, Truth\nand Reconciliation, which has been serving as the\nstanding body for maintaining political dialogue.\nReconstruction and economic renewal are already\noff to a good start, with an estimated growth of more\nthan 8 per cent in the gross national product for 2012.\nThe economic situation has greatly improved, thanks\nto the support of our development partners, especially after we met the goals of the Heavily Indebted Poor\nCountries Initiative in June.\nThe resulting drop in our foreign debt and the\nadoption of our national development plan for the period\n2012-2015 allow C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire to hope that we can reach\nthe double-digit economic growth rate necessary for\nour country to become an emerging country by 2020,\nas envisioned by President Ouattara.\nBefore concluding, I would like to say that C\u00f4te\nd\u2019Ivoire notes that the President of the General Assembly\nat the previous session opened an informal interactive\ndialogue, at the level of the United Nations, on the issue\nof the responsibility to protect. In the aftermath of that\nuseful forum and in the light of the lessons learned,\nC\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, following the example of the Secretary-\nGeneral, believes that the principle of the responsibility\nto protect has achieved sufficient maturity and that\nwhat remains to be done now is to implement it.\nOn that basis, the Economic Community of\nWest African States and the Global Centre for the\nResponsibility to Protect jointly held a regional forum\nin Abuja devoted to that concept. A similar meeting is\nscheduled to take place in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire at the end of\nthis year.\nIn conclusion, I would like to reiterate the gratitude\nof President Ouattara, his Government and the Ivorian\npeople to the United Nations and the entire international\ncommunity for their commitment to peace and stability\nin C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire. That constitutes to be the precondition\nfor development."

        "file_text": "\ufeffAs\nalways, it is an honour to participate in this Assembly\nof the peoples of the world, which pursues the ongoing\nstruggle, among others, for the universal principles\nupheld since 1948. It is here and at this time that we can\nsee that we are different, precisely in this Assembly,\nwhich reflects the wealth of our diversity. It is here\nwhere we work constantly to overcome our natural\ndifferences, respond to our common problems and\nstrengthen the human family through agreed outcomes.\nThe international community must be consistent\nin that objective. We must be partners and allies at all\ntimes, ready to put forward initiatives, solutions and\nreforms that strengthen the need for close cooperation\nin the joint responsibility to protect not only the right\nto that diversity, but also the right to demonstrate it and\nto fully live it. All must participate in this forum, with\nno sister nation excluded or not invited. We are called\nupon to ensure the full recognition of each and every\none, with complete security for all.\nIn Honduras, for some years we have acknowledged\nin all areas the need for a reform process that\nensures respect for people\u2019s rights. Our first action,\nin accordance with our national law, was to invite\nregional and international organizations to come to\nHonduras and see our proposals and our work. We\nhave set up a unit to investigate crimes against sexual\ndiversity \u2014 lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender \u2014\nunder the Office of the Public Prosecutor. It focuses\nits attention on vulnerable groups and on furthering\ndialogue with the broader civil society.\nOn gender issues, the Honduran State has a policy\ngender progamme, which is a technical and political\ntool to help women achieve full equality and fairness.\nMy Government supports a 40-per-cent share of women\nin elected posts in the 2013 electoral campaign and a\n50-per cent participation in the following election in\n2017. In April, the National Congress of the Republic\nadopted a law against trafficking in persons. That is a\nmeasure of compliance by the State of Honduras with\nimportant recommendations on trafficking in persons\ndrawn up by international human rights bodies.\nAs we continue our fight for indigenous peoples,\nanother essential part of our national plan and vision\nfor the country is to put an end to the exclusion of such\npeoples and those of African descent and to ensure their full and legitimate right to preserve their culture,\nlanguage, traditions and world view. I am accompanied\nat this Assembly by a representation of all indigenous\npeoples in Honduras. Last year, we held the first World\nSummit for People of African Descent in Honduras.\nNext year, we will hold a world summit on indigenous\npeoples.\nToday\u2019s world presents a range of new threats to our\ncountries that are not traditional in form and that have\ncreated new dynamics. I am referring to the activities\nof transnational criminal organizations. According to\nresearch centres that track illicit economic activity, it is\nestimated that those groups now account for 10 per cent\nof the global gross domestic product. Those activities\ninclude money-laundering, bribes, drug trafficking,\ncounterfeit, piracy and illicit trafficking in persons and\nweapons.\nThat astounding amount of financial resources\ndangerously corrupts our societies and Governments. In\nmy view, it has become a threat to international security\nthat must be assessed, understood and fought against\nby all members of the United Nations. My country and\nour citizens are victims of the insatiable appetite for\ndrugs in developed countries and of the greed of the\nproducers and traffickers, who become rich on huge\nprofits stained with the blood of the innocent. Honduras\nis neither a consumer or producer country. Moreover,\nthe traffickers come from the south and the north but\nthose who die are Honduran. The mothers who suffer\nare Honduran, as are the orphans.\nHowever, Honduras is not unaware of the problem.\nDespite our limited economic resources, we are\nfacing such challenges with the necessary resolve\nto find comprehensive and immediate solutions to\nthat situation. Our primary objective is to defend the\nsovereignty and territorial integrity of our territory in\nthe face of the aggression of which we are victims. To\nthat end, by every means possible we must stop drugs\nfrom entering our country and ensure a complete\nprohibition of those that enter our national territory.\nWe have therefore updated the regulatory framework\nand are reforming our institutions and security system.\nAs violence and crime threaten our young people,\nwe have launched prevention programmes that can\nopen up better horizons and opportunities. Legal\nand institutional reform and the implementation of\nprogrammes and projects to stop the violence have\nstarted to yield results. The most recent figures of the independent Violence Watch in Honduras show that the\nrate of homicides has fallen by 8.5 per cent this year.\nThat figure, added to the 10-per cent drop in the annual\nincrease just recorded, represents a total reduction in the\nhomicide rate of 18.5 per cent per 100,000 inhabitants.\nHowever, it is not only up to us victims to make an\neffort. As was made clear at the Summit of the Americas\nand at the recent General Assembly of the Organization\nof American States, combating organized crime, in\nparticular illicit drug trafficking and related criminal\nactivities, is a common, shared, but differentiated\nresponsibility.\nAt this great Assembly, I wish to underscore the\nresolute cooperation of Colombia and Chile and the\nrecent memorandum of understanding signed between\nHonduras and the United States of America. We\nalso welcome the most recent measures taken by the\nBolivarian Republic of Venezuela on the issue of f light\nbans.\nWith regard to Colombia, allow me to congratulate\nits President Juan Manuel Santos Calder\u00f3n and his\nGovernment on his initiative to put an end to 50 years\nof war among brothers. We commend the Fuerzas\nArmadas Revolucionarias de Colombia for their\nreceptiveness. We also welcome the cooperation of the\nBolivarian Republic of Venezuela, Chile, Cuba and\nNorway. We wish them every success and hope that\npeace will return to that country.\nI would also like to thank the United Nations Office\non Drugs and Crime for its full support and recognition\nof the fact that we in Central America cannot face such\nscourges alone. We must seek every mechanism and try\nto be as creative as possible in dealing with that threat.\nWith greater respect for human rights and more\ncitizen security, we will have more and better education.\nHonduras has therefore launched a significant reform\nprocess. The National Congress has adopted laws to\nbolster education and to ensure the participation of the\nfamily and the community. Our focus and key objective\nare to provide a sound foundation for our children and\nour youth. We support the right of teachers to disagree\nand, on occasion, to demonstrate, but the rights of\nchildren and young people to the education that they\nreceive in their classrooms cannot be allowed to be\ninterrupted.\nLook at what is happening to us, according to\nUNICEF data. In Honduras, approximately 600 teaching days have been lost in State schools and colleges in the\npast 10 years. That data is equivalent to three school\nyears of 200 days. That means that a boy or a girl who\nhas completed ninth grade in their studies has, in fact,\nonly received a sixth-grade education. Clearly, that is\na step backwards for society in general. According to\nfigures from the Department of Education, in 2009, 80\nschool days were lost, in 2010, 30 days and, in 2011,\n40 days. All those days correspond to calls for massive\nteacher walk-outs. According to a study of the National\nIndependent University of Honduras, the country\u2019s\nprincipal university, of the top 100 colleges, that\nleading State college is ranked in seventeenth position.\nWhat an injustice.\nIt is our poorest children and young people, those\nwho cannot afford private education, who go to State\nschools. We are condemning them to remain victims of\nthe most serious exclusion. Those who most need them\nare denied opportunities. Why do we not declare in this\nAssembly of peoples that classrooms are sanctuaries of\neducation and must never be closed?\nWe must continue our efforts to ensure greater\naccess for the poor to the productive sectors of the\nnational economy. Rapid, fair and sustainable growth\nis the true productive development of the country and,\nalong with education and health care, the best way to\nreduce poverty and extreme poverty.\nFrom the Office of the President and the First Lady,\nwho is here with me at the Assembly, among others,\nwe are working on a very important conditional cash\ntransfer programme. It currently reaches 30 per cent of\nour poor families. That is an immediate and specific\nresponse to social exclusion.\nOur geographic location makes Honduras one of\nthe countries most vulnerable to climate change. Along\nwith our socio-economic characteristics, that compels\nus, both nationally and regionally, to remain constantly\nvigilant in order to respond to natural threats and\ndisasters. That is why we deem it key to participate in\nall specialized forums, in particular the United Nations\nConference on Sustainable Development.\nToday and now, in this Hall, Honduras reiterates\nits commitment to the international community to the\ncomprehensive reform of the United Nations system.\nThat will help to strengthen the principle of universality\non the basis of just, fair and inclusive representation.\nThe challenge is for us all and our commitment is\nuniversal. That is why we are gathered here now."

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt is an honour and a\nprivilege to address this forum today and to share the\nviews of the Republic of Macedonia regarding a number\nof issues of concern for all of us.\nAllow me first to extend our congratulations to\nMr. Vuk Jeremi\u0107 on his election to the prestigious\nposition of President of the General Assembly at\nits sixty-seventh session. I believe Mr. Jeremi\u0107 will\nrespond to all the challenges and tasks that await him,\nand I wish to express our full readiness to cooperate.\nAllow me also to express my thanks and to compliment\nthe former President of the Assembly, Mr. Nassir\nAbdulaziz Al-Nasser, for his successful presidency\nduring the sixth-sixth session.\nI would like to take this opportunity to welcome\nthe work and efforts of the Secretary-General, Mr. Ban\nKi-moon, which undoubtedly have contributed to\nstrengthening the role and reputation of the world\nOrganization. It was a real honour for me and for the\ncitizens of Macedonian to be his host. The Republic of\nMacedonia highly values and supports the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s endeavours, and he can count on our\ncontinued full support.\nNow, more than ever in the history of humankind,\nthe nations of the world are confronted with the same\nchallenges, are victims of the same threats and share the\nyearning for a better future. Effective multilateralism\nis of essential importance for the development of\ncollective action to respond to common challenges. The\nUnited Nations is an organization whose legitimacy\nto tackle global challenges through global actions is\nuniversally accepted and undeniable. The support\nprovided by Member States is of crucial importance.\nI wish to assure the Assembly that the Republic of\nMacedonia will continue to contribute actively to the\nreinforcement and improvement of the efficiency of the\nsystem.\nThis diverse world is in need of a common\ndenominator, a link that unites all individuals, peoples\nand countries regardless of differences in culture,\nlanguage and religion. That link is the Charter of the\nUnited Nations, with its principles and fundamental values. The Republic of Macedonia is firmly dedicated\nto respect for the Charter, which serves as the basis\nof its foreign policy. Ever since our declaration of\nindependence and after becoming a Member of the\nUnited Nations, the peaceful resolution of international\ndisputes has been one of our leading principles and\nguidelines for our behaviour as a responsible member\nof the international community. Therefore, I wish to\nwelcome the General Assembly recommendation to put\nthe issue forward as a topic of debate this year.\nAn ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.\nWhen speaking about international disputes, it is\ninevitable to refer to prevention activities as one of the\nmechanisms for their resolution.\nToday preventive diplomacy has proven its relevance\nonce again. In the early days of our independence,\nthe Republic of Macedonia was host to the United\nNations Preventive Deployment Force, a one-of-a-kind\nmechanism for the United Nations at the time. It was a\npositive experience for Macedonia, the United Nations\nand the Member States involved. We are witness to the\nfact that the evolution of international relations and the\nincreased complexity of challenges in our globalized\nworld confirm the need to develop mechanisms and to\nuse good offices.\nAt this point, I would like to commend the\nSecretary-General for advocating more thorough\nanalysis of this issue in his report on strengthening the\nrole of mediation in the peaceful settlement of disputes,\nconflict prevention and resolution (A/66/811), which\nproduced good, operative solutions for upgrading the\ncapacity of the United Nations in this area. I believe\nwe can and must explore new ways and possibilities for\nstrengthening the role of the Secretary-General in the\nresolution of international disputes.\nIn a time of global economic crisis, the focus of\nthe United Nations on preventing conflicts and further\ndeveloping preventive diplomacy is understandable. The\nRepublic of Macedonia believes it makes sense to focus\non the effective and efficient use of resources \u2014 which\nare shrinking \u2014 which is why we have been attentively\nfollowing all activities relating to the report of the\nSecretary-General on civilian capacity in the aftermath\nof conflict (A/66/311) and to the implementation of\nthe recommendations of the Senior Advisory Group\nfound therein. It is very important that the international\ncommunity make progress in preventing new conflicts\nand relapses into conflict in vulnerable countries. The Republic of Macedonia stands ready to offer its\nexperience in the area of democratic institution-building,\nbased on the Macedonian inclusive, democratic model\nof integration without assimilation. In that context, I\nwish to refer to the recent High-level Meeting on the\nRule of Law at the National and International Levels.\nThe Republic of Macedonia attaches great importance\nto this issue, which is undoubtedly the basis of all\ndemocratic societies, and the report of the Secretary-\nGeneral on the rule of law (A/66/749) has provided\nfood for thought and further action. The Republic of\nMacedonia believes that inclusiveness is an important\nprinciple that needs to be implemented when it comes\nto the rule of law. The rule of law is multifaceted and\nshould cover all stakeholders, especially civil society.\nThe rule of law is incomplete and is impossible\nto achieve without respect for human rights. As the\nSecretary-General said in his statement at the opening\nof the general debate at this session, \u201cWe shall have\nneither peace nor development without respect for\nhuman rights and the rule of law\u201d (see A/67/PV.6). As\na country building a model of inclusive democracy, the\nRepublic of Macedonia attaches particular importance\nto the development, promotion and protection of\nhuman rights. It is the right and duty of every country\nto safeguard and promote the rights of its citizens.\nHuman rights should reinforce and reaffirm national\nsovereignty. This, then, will be the best guarantee that,\nas a principle, the responsibility to protect will remain\nthe desired first and primary pillar. The Republic of\nMacedonia will continue its efforts to preserve and\npromote human rights \u2014 to promote democracy and\nthe rule of law, gender equality and the improvement\nof the role of women, and to protect vulnerable and\nmarginalized groups.\nWe also strongly support Member States\u2019 active\nparticipation in the universal periodic review as a\nmechanism for promoting the effectiveness of the\nHuman Rights Council. In that context, I would like to\nremind the Assembly that the Republic of Macedonia\nhas presented its candidature for membership in the\nHuman Rights Council for the period 2014-2016. We\nare convinced that our experience in this area, along\nwith our particular achievements and ambition to\npromote this area of global governance, will enable us\nto make a full contribution to further strengthening and\naffirming human rights in subsequent years.\nOnce again this year all priorities are focused on the\nthree most important pillars of our world Organization: peace and security, sustainable development and\nhuman rights. All are mutually related. There can\nbe no sustainable development without peace and\nsecurity, and there can be no sustainable peace without\ndevelopment and poverty reduction. The Millennium\nDevelopment Goals continue to be the parameters by\nwhich we evaluate our success.\nThe Republic of Macedonia\u2019s aspiration to\nbecome a member of the European Union has created\nthe necessary spur for political, economic and social\nreforms. Promoting equitable and comprehensive\ndevelopment founded on human rights has provided a\nsolid base for the national development agenda. The\nGovernment of the Republic of Macedonia therefore\nestablished a programme focused on emphasizing\neconomic development, improving our citizens\u2019\nstandard of living, creating jobs, fighting corruption,\nincreasing education opportunities and promoting\ndemocracy and inter-ethnic relations.\nBalanced and sustainable development is a major\ninvestment in the future, and in the interest of the\ngeneral well-being, everyone must participate. The\noutcome document of Rio+20 \u2014 the United Nations\nConference on Sustainable Development (resolution\n66/288, annex) \u2014 should be taken as an additional\nimpetus to use alternative possibilities for achieving\nsustainable development. The Republic of Macedonia,\nin coordination with the policies of its European\npartners, will advocate expanding those alternatives.\nSustainable development is closely linked to\ndisaster risk reduction and adaptation to climate\nchange. Recognizing that interdependence, the\nRepublic of Macedonia supports a holistic approach to\nthe implementation of these goals in national, regional\nand global strategies, policies and plans.\nWe have demonstrated our dedication to the region\nof South-eastern Europe and to regional cooperation\nthrough our chairmanship of the South-East European\nCooperation Process. The region is not immune to\nglobal challenges and threats, and such threats can be\nremoved only by meeting the obligations and numerous\ncommitments we have all undertaken. I am convinced\nthat intensive regional cooperation in this area will help\nus build a region more resistant to natural disasters. We\nwish focus our chairmanship on the process of meeting\nthe real and everyday needs of our citizens \u2014 those of\npeace, security and development \u2014 that are the result\nof global challenges that recognize neither political and ethnic barriers nor religious groups. Among\nthe priorities of Macedonia\u2019s chairmanship will be\ncooperation in economic and agricultural matters,\nculture and tourism, science and education, cross-\nborder concerns and the protection of the environment.\nOur principles are based on solving citizens\u2019 problems\nregardless of ethnic, religious or any other affiliation.\nI see no way of doing this other than through close\nregional cooperation.\nLet us build good-neighbourly relations on the\nbasis of solidarity. In return, we expect our neighbours\nto show solidarity in actions for a safer region. We\ncan and we must be ready for future challenges so as\nto provide a safer future for future generations. Our\nyoung people will hold us to this. They expect our\ngeneration to behave responsibly. They live in a time of\nnew technologies, and they already know what is going\non at the global level. I believe firmly that we should\nfocus all our energy on young people, to create youth\nfor the future and a future for our youth, formed in a\nspirit of dialogue, tolerance and respect for diversity.\nThat is why, in parallel with the South-East European\nCooperation Process summit, we will also host the\neleventh Forum of the Dialogue among Civilizations, in\ncooperation with UNESCO and the Council of Europe,\nwith the focus on youth.\nAs President of the Republic of Macedonia, permit\nme to say that we are greatly looking forward to\ncelebrating the tenth anniversary of the first regional\ngathering of the dialogue among civilizations, which\nwe are preparing together with UNESCO. It was here,\nat this rostrum, that my predecessor, President Boris\nTrajkovski, with the strong backing of the United\nNations and UNESCO, shared his dreams about that\ninitiative, which was then realized in Ohrid in 2003,\nwhen the wounds from the bloody conflict in the\nformer Yugoslavia were still fresh. The words of the\nOhrid message speak of the undoubtedly enormous\npotential of the Republic of Macedonia: to be a\nfunctional multi-ethnic, multilingual and multireligious\nfoundation of the European Balkans and of the Balkans\nin Europe.\nNext year we will host the third World Conference\non Dialogue among Religions and Civilizations.\nThe Republic of Macedonia has always believed that\ndialogue is irreplaceable and put its belief into practice.\nWe condemn all forms of violence. No one should be a\nvictim of violence \u2014 not individuals, peoples, States\nor their official representatives. Just as the limits of decency must be observed in public spaces, so violence\ncan never be a fitting response.\nThe rule of law and human rights are fundamental\nprinciples and they cannot be subject to compromise. I\nfully agree with the position of the Secretary-General,\nstated during his visit to Macedonia in July, that we\nshould never make compromises when it comes to\nuniversally acknowledged principles. It is the duty\nof the United Nations and of each and every one of\nus not to subject the rule of law and human rights to\ncompromise. Therefore, I have asked the Secretary-\nGeneral to bring renewed attention to the 2008 report\nof the Independent Expert on minority issues, Ms. Gay\nMcDougall, entitled \u201cPromotion and protection of all\nhuman rights, civil, political, economic, social and\ncultural rights, including the right to development\u201d\n(A/HRC/7/23).\nAllow me as well to recall the recommendation\nin that report that the Government of our southern\nneighbour should abstain from disputing whether there\nis a Macedonian minority, and instead focus on the\nprotection of the right to self-identification, freedom\nof expression and freedom of association of that\ncommunity. In the recommendation, our neighbour is\nurged to respect the judgment of the European Court of\nHuman Rights, according to which the country should\nbe allowed to use the word Macedonian to denote its\nname and to freely express its ethnic identity. The\nreport concludes that the right to protection must be\nrespected, as elaborated in the 1992 Declaration on\nMinorities and in the basic international conventions\non human rights.\nI expressed my expectation that the Secretary-\nGeneral would make use of his authority and engage in\norder to overcome the impasse on the talks regarding\nour country\u2019s name that are taking place under his\nauspices. Respect for the judgment of the International\nCourt of Justice will mean respect for international law\nand the rule of law in practice. I believe in this process.\nI believe that this process can lead to a solution, but we\ncannot wait another 19 years for that to happen.\nToday, in the twenty-first century, it seems quite\nabsurd to be called \u201ca former nation\u201d or \u201ca former\ncolony\u201d. In the name of the dignity of my people, I\nhereby take this opportunity to publicly thank all 134\nMembers of the United Nations that have recognized\nthe constitutional name of my country, which is the\nRepublic of Macedonia. And here is my appeal to\neveryone here: address us from the point of view of the\nfuture.\nI fully subscribe to what was said by the United\nStates President, Mr. Barack Obama, just a few days\nago, in this very Hall. We believe that freedom and self-\ndetermination are not unique to one culture. Those are\nnot simply American values or Western values, they are\nuniversal values.\nIt has happened in the history of the United\nNations that a country was given additional criteria\nto become a Member, but the 1948 advisory opinion\nof the International Court of Justice stated clearly that\nthis was not correct and was contrary to the Charter\nof the United Nations. Except in our case, no one has\nbeen deprived of the right of self-identification thus\nfar. Macedonia should get what it rightfully deserves;\nsomething that all Member States represented here\nalready have and enjoy. Without the right of self-\nidentification, Macedonia is prevented from being\nequal to all other Member States.\nIn that regard we are discussing international\nlaw. We are talking about the rule of law. Here is the\njudgment of the International Court of Justice adopted\n10 months ago in favour of the Republic of Macedonia.\nWe are asking for this judgment, adopted by a body\nof the United Nations, to be respected. We ask for\nthis because we have been prevented from using our\nconstitutional name even at this very rostrum. The\nInternational Court of Justice, in paragraph 95 of the\njudgment, states clearly that Macedonia has the right\nto refer to itself as the Republic of Macedonia in its\nrelations with the other party and within international\norganizations.\nIn a spirit of good-neighbourly relations, and because\nof our strong determination to overcome and settle\nunresolved issues, I take this opportunity to appeal to\nour neighbour to work together with us in that direction.\nFrom this rostrum in the heart of the United Nations, I\nurge them to respect the judgment of the International\nCourt of Justice and their own internationally assumed\nobligations. We are neighbours, but we wish to be more\nthan just neighbours. We wish to be partners, allies and\nfriends, and to be able to build together the present and\nfuture of our people, our countries and our region. We\nwish to work together with them and build a safe and\nfree world for our children.\nThe protracted nature of the reform of the Security\nCouncil and the revitalization of the General Assembly, as well as the comprehensive process of reinforcing\nthe coherence and efficiency of the system, should not\ndiscourage us. On the contrary, they should serve as an\nimpetus for further mobilization.\nOnly the United Nations can provide integrated\nsolutions for interdependent issues such as development,\npeace and security, human rights and humanitarian\naction.\nIn conclusion, I invite all Member States to recall\nthe words of Jean Monnet, the father of modern\nEurope. He described the use of the veto in modern\nEuropean history as the expression of lack of power for\ndialogue and the impossibility of overcoming national\negoism. Let us build a prosperous world for our future\ngenerations.\nWe hope that our neighbour will make its way\nout of crisis as soon as possible. We have proposed a\nseries of practical measures on how to upgrade our\neconomic and good neighbourly cooperation, which\nshould include a bilateral agreement on the avoidance\nof double taxation. Macedonian taxes are favourable for\nour neighbour\u2019s businessmen and, as always, the doors\nof the Republic of Macedonia are wide open to them.\nThe Republic of Macedonia firmly believes that the\nUnited Nations remains the centre of multilateralism\nand global governance. The Organization inspires\nuniversal dialogue, which in most cases results in joint\nsolutions for handling global problems in order to reach\na shared vision of the future of the international system."

I\nhave every confidence that under his able leadership\nthis session will be crowned with great success.\nHumankind continues to advance, drawing on our\ncollective wisdom to address challenges throughout\nhuman history. Although new global challenges to\nmankind such as climate change, poverty and disease,\nunderdevelopment, terrorism and proliferation of\nweapons of mass destruction are now testing the\ninternational community, I have no doubt that we will\novercome those challenges on our future path.\nThe United Nations, the symbol of our collective\nwisdom, should take greater responsibility in coping\nwith the challenges. I note with great satisfaction that\nthe United Nations is becoming a more accountable and\ntrusted international Organization under the prominent\nleadership of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. In that\nregard, I recognize and support the Secretary-General\u2019s\nfive-year Action Agenda, which I believe will guide\nus in addressing current world challenges and onward\ntowards the future we are aiming for.\nThe United Nations Conference on Sustainable\nDevelopment (Rio+20), held in June in Rio de Janeiro,\nrepresented a critical step forward towards ushering in the world we hope for. The outcome document, entitled\n\u201cThe future we want\u201d (resolution 66/288, annex),\nmarks a substantial advancement for sustainable\ndevelopment. The task before us now is to capitalize on\nour achievements thus far and exert even greater effort\non follow-up actions such as developing sustainable\ndevelopment goals, strengthening the institutional\nframework and mobilizing finance.\nAs part of such endeavours, the Republic of Korea\nestablished the Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI).\nSixteen countries signed the agreement to establish the\nGGGI on the margins of the Rio+20 meeting, and the\nInstitute will be launched as an international organization\nstarting in October. The GGGI will engage in a range of\nactivities for disseminating the green growth paradigm,\nin which the economy and the environment form a\nvirtuous cycle. Moreover, the Korean Government is\nprepared to step up its contribution to international\nefforts to achieve a sustainable future by hosting the\nsecretariat of the Green Climate Fund. The Republic of\nKorea stands ready to render wholehearted support for\nthe successful launch and stable operation of the Fund.\nThe Republic of Korea is keen on contributing\nto the balanced and harmonious development of the\ninternational community and is fully cooperating\nin such efforts in the context of the United Nations.\nThe Korean Government continues to increase its\nofficial development assistance to help achieve the\ninternationally agreed development goals, including\nthe Millennium Development Goals. The Republic of\nKorea underscored the importance of inclusive growth\nand development partnership at the 2010 Seoul Summit\nof the Group of Twenty and the Fourth High-level\nForum on Aid Effectiveness, held in Busan in 2011. In\nJune, the Global Partnership for Effective Development\nCooperation was launched for the implementation of the\nBusan commitments. The Busan Forum and the launch\nof the Global Partnership will mark a turning point for\ninternational development cooperation by broadening\nour perspective from aid effectiveness to development\neffectiveness.\nOur own experience has taught us that investment\nin education is at the heart of effective development.\nIn that vein, we are confident that the Education First\ninitiative of the Secretary-General will, indeed, provide\na solid foundation for achieving the international\ndevelopment goals. The Korean Government extends\nits strong support for the initiative. The Republic of Korea is also taking an active part\nin the discussions on shaping the post-2015 development\nframework. We fully recognize the importance of a\ncomprehensive approach that takes into account the\neconomic, social and environmental dimensions of\nsustainable development.\nThe aspiration for human rights, fundamental\nfreedoms and democratic values is the primary driving\nforce for the advancement of humanity. Today, many\ncountries have been striving to advocate human rights\nin tandem with democracy. The United Nations, as the\nepicentre of the international community\u2019s efforts to\npromote and protect human rights, has provided timely\nassistance to such countries.\nRecently, we witnessed the strong desire of people\nin the Middle East and North Africa to realize their\naspirations for democracy and respect for human\nrights. The recent positive developments in Myanmar\nare also well worth noting in that regard. However,\nwhile those changes are still unfolding, enormous\nchallenges and difficulties still lie ahead. In Syria, a\ngreat number of civilians have been killed and gross\nviolations of human rights have been witnessed. With\nhigh hopes towards the efforts of Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi,\nthe Joint Special Representative of the United Nations\nand the League of Arab States for Syria, the Korean\nGovernment will stand by the Syrian people through\nthis time of suffering together with the international\ncommunity.\nThe Korean Government expresses deep concern\nat the recent attacks against diplomats and diplomatic\nmissions in several places. Such violence cannot be\njustified regardless of the motivation.\nPutting an end to sexual violence against women\nin armed conflict is another issue that warrants serious\nattention. Wartime sexual violence is a fundamental\ninfringement of human rights and is, in fact, an affront to\nhuman dignity and integrity. History has left important\nlessons that warn against such egregious acts.\nThe Republic of Korea would like to urge the\nUnited Nations system and all Member States to do\ntheir utmost to put an end to such atrocities, not only\nby taking all measures to protect women and girls in\narmed conflict, but also by providing effective remedies\nand reparations for victims and ending impunity by\nbringing the offenders to justice in accordance with the\nrelevant resolutions of the United Nations. Both a sound historical consciousness and a\nheartfelt soul-searching into any past wrongdoings are\nrequired in order to establish solid peace and stability\nbetween nations. A country\u2019s true valour is proven when\nit confronts the dark side of its history and endeavours\nto rectify past wrongdoings.\nIt is the firm conviction of the Korean Government\nthat respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty\nas enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations,\nshould be the guiding principle for stable international\nrelations.\nNo country should abuse international legal\nprocedures or the concept of the rule of law in order to\ninfringe upon the territorial integrity and sovereignty\nof other countries or distort historical justice.\nThe Republic of Korea is actively contributing\nto the global efforts being undertaken in pursuit of a\nworld without nuclear weapons. The Seoul Nuclear\nSecurity Summit held last March brought together\nleaders from across the world to galvanize the vision\nand the determination of the international community\nto achieve a peaceful world without nuclear terrorism.\nDuring the Summit, the Korean Government played a\nleading role in forging a consensus to take important\npractical steps, such as the substantial reduction of\nnuclear materials, the promotion of the universality of\ninternational conventions and cooperation to combat\nillicit trafficking of nuclear materials. I am delighted\nthat the High-level Meeting on Countering Nuclear\nTerrorism, which was convened this morning, has\nprovided new momentum to further energize the efforts\nseen at the Seoul Summit for the prevention of nuclear\nand radiological terrorism.\nFurthermore, existing and emerging threats\nin cyberspace, such as rampant transnational\ncybercrime and potential cyber conflicts, present\na serious challenge. It is therefore imperative that\nthe international community address those threats.\nBy hosting the 2013 Conference on Cyberspace, the\nRepublic of Korea hopes to contribute in multiple ways\nto the ongoing global efforts to maximize the benefits\nof digital networks. We further believe that the event\nwill provide an unparalleled opportunity to pool our\nefforts to cope with threats stemming from the misuse\nof information and communication technologies.\nThe North Korean nuclear programme continues\nto pose a threat, not only to the security of the\nKorean peninsula and North-East Asia, but indeed to the very basis of the international non-proliferation\nregime. As long as the Democratic People\u2019s Republic\nof Korea continues to pursue its nuclear and missile\nprogrammes, achieving the goal of sustainable peace\non the Korean peninsula and in the region will remain\nfar off. Unfortunately, the international community\u2019s\naspirations were shattered once again when the\nDemocratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea launched a\nlong-range missile in April 2012. In response to that\nprovocative action, the Security Council reaffirmed\nthat the international community will not tolerate the\ncontinued pursuit by the Democratic People\u2019s Republic\nof Korea of its nuclear and missile programmes by\nissuing a firm and resolute presidential statement in an\nunprecedentedly swift manner (S/PRST/2012/13).\nWe urge with concern that the Democratic People\u2019s\nRepublic of Korea should take concrete measures aimed\nat denuclearization, which will also open an avenue to\nimproving the livelihood of its people. At the same\ntime, we sincerely hope that the Democratic People\u2019s\nRepublic of Korea will listen to the international\ncommunity\u2019s call for the improvement of that country\u2019s\nhuman rights situation, as repeatedly affirmed in the\nrelevant United Nations resolutions.\nAs a country that has risen from the ashes of war,\nwe have learned the values of peace and security. In\nthat context, we earnestly hope to have the opportunity\nto promote such values by serving as a non-permanent\nmember of the Security Council for the 2013-2014 term.\nThe Republic of Korea is determined to fulfil that role\nwith the greatest enthusiasm and devotion. We hope\nthat States Members of the United Nations understand\nand support our bid for membership in the Council.\nWe are united by the ideals set out in the United\nNations Charter. In pursuit of international peace\nand security, the continued promotion of social and\neconomic development and the promotion of human\nrights, we should embrace a spirit of cooperation and\ntolerance, with the United Nations at the centre of\ninternational efforts to that end. The Republic of Korea\nwill persist in fully playing its part in the invaluable\nwork of the United Nations, taking on the various\nchallenges that humanity will continue to confront."

        "file_text": "\ufeffI extend my\ncongratulations to Mr. Vuk Jeremi\u0107 on his election as\nPresident of the General Assembly at its sixty-seventh\nsession. I wish him every success in the year ahead.\nThe global economic situation remains uncertain.\nEurope is in recession and growth in other places is\nweakening. There is increasing concern that this\ncombination of weak consumer demand in developing\ncountries and a continuing crisis in the eurozone may\nlead to a global recession. An even greater danger,\nespecially for small States like Singapore that depend\non global trade, is the risk of increased protectionism.\nPopulist pressures in countries affected by austerity\nand economic crisis can cause further instability as\npoliticians become unwilling or unable to deal with\nlong-term, structural economic problems. While\nemerging economies focus on maintaining economic\ngrowth, developed economies are preoccupied with\nboth immediate and structural socioeconomic problems.\nUnderstandably, there is less focus on strategic regional\nand international issues. However, serious, long-term\nchallenges remain. Rising income disparities, climate\nchange issues and worries about food security are not\nbeing adequately addressed at the global level.\nAmid that uncertainty, no State or group of\nStates currently has the power to definitively set the\ninternational agenda. Decision-making and governance\non global issues have and will continue to become\nincreasingly complicated. The multiplicity of interests makes finding consensus in international forums that\nmuch more difficult. Frustration over the inability of\nexisting multilateral institutions to deal with those\nglobal challenges is growing, and that has given rise to\na greater tendency for countries to turn to smaller and\nmore exclusive groupings outside of the United Nations\nframework for solutions.\nThe Group of 20 (G-20) is one such example.\nWithout the G-20, the 2008 economic crisis may have\nwell led to a global depression. However, the G-20 is an\nexclusive grouping; it leaves out the vast majority of the\nUnited Nations membership, particularly small States.\nIt is a self-selected group, but one that is here to stay in\nthe foreseeable future. The Global Governance Group\nwas therefore established by like minded-countries,\nincluding Singapore, to strengthen the engagement\nbetween the G-20 and the general membership of the\nUnited Nations. Even as we work with the G-20, we\nshould look for ways to strengthen and reform existing\nmultilateral institutions, including the United Nations,\nthe World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and\nthe World Trade Organization. That will help us to\nachieve greater efficiency, rather than continuing to\ninvent more smaller groupings.\nMany of us often fault the United Nations, including\nthe Security Council, for its inability to act to resolve\nongoing conflicts. However, as frustrations mount, let\nus not forget that the United Nations and its organs,\nincluding the Security Council, can do only what\nits Members choose to do, so we are responsible for\nthe current state of affairs. The United Nations is an\norganization of sovereign nation States. It has no more\nauthority than what its Members give it. Any failure\nof the Security Council and the United Nations in\nmaintaining peace and security represents a failure of\nthe Member States themselves.\nWe should therefore support ongoing and new\nefforts aimed at strengthening the United Nations,\ninstead of denigrating it. The United Nations is unique\nin its ability to come up with global solutions because\nof its universal membership, legitimacy, experience\nand presence on the ground. No other organization\nis as well equipped to do so. A significant expansion\nof the United Nations mediation capabilities, good\noffices and peacekeeping efforts has made it central to\ninternational crisis prevention and the mediation and\nsettlement of disputes. We should continue to support\nthe strengthening of those aspects. The five permanent members of the Security\nCouncil, with their veto powers, have the primary\nresponsibility to make the Council more effective.\nThat is why Singapore has consistently called for\nimprovement in the Security Council\u2019s working\nmethods. The Security Council is not a rubber stamp\nfor the interests of its individual members. Its power, if\nnot visibly and openly wielded for the greater good and\nto discharge its mandate in all instances, will eventually\nundermine its legitimacy and leadership role in the\ninternational community. That is in no one\u2019s interest.\nSingapore believes that the long-term goal of the\nUnited Nations should be to provide an effective system\nof international law and resilient mechanisms for the\npeaceful settlement of disputes. That will provide a\nplatform for States under threat to bring their problems\nbefore those mechanisms with confidence, rather than\ntrying to resolve them by force.\nThe President has selected an important theme for\nthe sixty-seventh session of the General Assembly:\nbringing about adjustment or settlement of international\ndisputes or situations by peaceful means. In a fast-\nchanging environment, where the global governance\nstructure is fragmented and coordination is difficult,\nthe parameters of dialogue among States become\ncrucial.\nIn that dialogue among States, respect for the rule\nof law by all parties is essential. If that were not the\ncase, small States would lose their independence and\nautonomy, and even the larger and stronger States could\nnever feel entirely secure. A stable international system\nis critical to our collective security. Small States like\nSingapore are vulnerable even at the best of times, and\nthese are not the best of times. It is therefore particularly\nimportant for small States to be in an international\nenvironment where international law and institutions\nbased on law can flourish. We need a predictable and\nstable, rules-based international system in order for all\nof us to survive.\nSingapore firmly believes in the importance\nof safeguarding the international rule of law. We\nhave participated actively in various multilateral\nnegotiations, used international dispute mechanisms,\nsuch as the International Court of Justice and the\nInternational Tribunal for the Law of the Sea, to\nresolve disputes we have had with other countries. Our\nview is that disputes, including those over territorial\nsovereignty, can and should be resolved peacefully, in\naccordance with international law. As major beneficiaries of a stable international\nsystem, it is incumbent upon small States to not only\nsupport the international rule of law, but to also speak\nup against its violation. This year, the 105-member\nForum of Small States will commemorate its twentieth\nanniversary with a high-level conference on small\nStates on 1 October. The conference will discuss the\nrole of small States in international relations, including\nour commitment to the rule of law and the peaceful\nsettlement of disputes. We invite all Member States\nto attend the conference. We hope that the conference\nwill be a platform for small States to share our\nexperiences and remind the international community\nthat small States, too, have contributions to make to the\nmaintenance of an international system that benefits all\nnations of any size."

        "file_text": "\ufeffAt the outset, it gives me great pleasure\nto convey to Mr. Vuk Jeremi\u0107 my sincere congratulations\non his election as President of the General Assembly at\nits sixty-seventh session. We wish him every success\nin the performance of his duties and responsibilities,\nparticularly under the current critical circumstances\nin which the international community finds itself at\npresent. I would also take this opportunity to express\nmy deep gratitude and appreciation to his predecessor,\nAmbassador Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser, President of\nthe General Assembly at its sixty-sixth session, who\nfulfilled his mandate with wisdom and professionalism.\nMoreover, it gives me pleasure to commend once more\nthe great efforts of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in\nserving the Organization and promoting its message\naimed at achieving international peace and security,\nespecially under difficult and critical circumstances.\nThe Palestinian issue, which is at the core of the\nArab-Israeli conflict, has been a constant challenge\nfor the United Nations since its inception more than\n60 years ago. The cause of the stalemate is Israel\u2019s\nattitude. We all know how intransigent Israel has been\nin its positions, which have undermined negotiations\nand have emptied all discussions of any meaning.\nMoreover, Israel has taken unilateral actions that could\nlead to more complications in the occupied Palestinian\nterritories and to undermining the efforts of Arab\ncountries and others in the international community\nto reach a just, comprehensive and lasting solution by\nestablishing an independent, viable and contiguous\nPalestinian State, with Jerusalem as its capital.\nThe situation requires that the international\ncommunity, as represented by the United Nations,\nmove quickly in order to put an end to the calamity that\nthe situation represents for the Palestinian people and\nprovide all manner of support and assistance for the\nPalestinian Authority. My country finds that Palestine\nmust receive full membership in the United Nations, as\nthat is its natural and legitimate right, and we should all\nhelp the Palestinians to achieve that objective. For its\npart, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is sparing no effort\nin fulfilling its commitment to the peace process with\nrespect to our Palestinian brethren by providing various\ntypes of support and assistance.\nThe issue of Syria is a very complex and exacerbated\none and has led to the killing and displacement of tens\nof thousands of people. The international community\nhas shown its inability to act, because of divisions in the Security Council and because of the failure of all\nArab and international initiatives as a result of the\nintransigence of the Syrian regime, which still believes\nthat it can use the power of its security apparatus to\nend the crisis without taking into account the high\nhumanitarian cost.\nSince the first day of the crisis, my country has\nbeen dealing with it in accordance with the framework\nand resolutions of international legitimacy and with\nfull respect for the principles of human rights and\ninternational humanitarian law, through the Gulf\nCooperation Council, the League of Arab States, the\nUnited Nations and the outcomes of the Organization\nof Islamic Cooperation summit meeting, held in Mecca\nin August, on the status of Syria.\nThe success of Joint Special Representative Lakhdar\nBrahimi\u2019s efforts will depend on the implementation of\na new strategy and a clear plan that aims at achieving a\npeaceful transition of power. The Security Council must\nprovide him with the support he needs to deal with the\nSyrian crisis at both the political and the humanitarian\nlevels.\nWe call upon our brothers in Yemen to continue to\ntake the same positive and constructive approach and to\nstand against any foreign interference in their internal\naffairs in order to achieve security and stability and\neconomic development throughout Yemen. Meanwhile,\nwe call upon the international community to fulfil its\npledges to Yemen by providing it with all forms of\nsupport and assistance to achieve those goals. Saudi\nArabia reaffirms its full support for all international\nefforts undertaken in that context. We hosted the donors\u2019\nconference, held earlier this month, and participated\nin the Friends of Yemen conference held at the United\nNations on 27 September 2012.\nThe Iranian nuclear crisis is one of the most\nimportant challenges threatening international peace\nand security in general and the security and stability\nof the Arab Gulf region in particular. In that context,\nmy country supports the ongoing efforts of the five\nplus one group to peacefully resolve the crisis in a\nmanner that guarantees Iran and all countries in the\nregion the right to the peaceful use of nuclear energy,\nin accordance with the criteria and procedures of the\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and\nunder its supervision. On the other hand, we urge\nIran to respond to those efforts and to implement the\nrelevant Security Council resolutions by cooperating with IAEA inspectors monitoring its nuclear facilities\nin order to put an end to the crisis.\nIn that regard, Saudi Arabia reaffirms the\nimportance of making the Middle East a zone free\nfrom nuclear weapons and all other weapons of mass\ndestruction. We also stress the need for Israel to place\nits nuclear facilities under the international inspection\nand safeguards of the IAEA and to sign the Treaty on\nthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.\nThe security and stability of the Arab Gulf region\nwill be reached only through the establishment of\ngood relations based on good-neighbourliness and\nconstructive cooperation. Also, Iran must end its\noccupation of the three islands belonging to the United\nArab Emirates. We must solve that issue peacefully,\neither through bilateral negotiations or by referring the\nissue to the International Court of Justice.\nThe phenomenon of terrorism is one of the most\nimportant challenges that we currently face and the most\nimportant issue confronting the entire international\ncommunity. We must eliminate terrorism in all its forms\nand sources. In order to fight that scourge and uproot\nit completely, the efforts of the Kingdom have not\nbeen limited to fighting it locally. We have reinforced\nefforts at all levels, whether regional or international,\nincluding by hosting an international conference in\n2005 that resulted in many recommendations, including\nthe establishment of the United Nations Counter-\nTerrorism Centre, which was launched in New York on\n19 September 2011.\nOur world today urgently needs to spread the\nculture of tolerance and understanding and dialogue\nbetween the followers of different religions. Our\nefforts in that regard are led by the Custodian of the\nTwo Holy Mosques, King Abdullah Bin Abdulaziz\nAl-Saud, aimed at achieving a dialogue between\nreligions and cultures. That was reflected in the 2008\nWorld Conference on Dialogue, held in Madrid. There\nwas also a call for a high-level meeting hosted by the\nUnited Nations to promote dialogue and tolerance\nbetween different cultures and religions. Our call for\nmutual understanding, the acceptance of others and\ncoexistence has led to the establishment in Vienna of the\nKing Abdullah bin Abdulaziz International Centre for\nDialogue among Followers of Religions and Cultures.\nIn addition, the foresight of the Custodian of the Two\nHoly Mosques was demonstrated by his announcement\nof the establishment of a centre for dialogue among Islamic sects at the fourth special session of the Islamic\nSummit Conference, held in Mecca in August 2012.\nIn that regard, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia\nstrongly condemns the production by an irresponsible\ngroup of an offensive movie about the Prophet\nMuhammad \u2014 peace be upon him. The Kingdom\nasserts its rejection of all acts that offend or disdain\nreligions and their sacred symbols. In that context, the\nKingdom renews its call to enact the necessary laws\nand legislation that forbid the defamation and disdain\nof religions and their sacred symbols.\nMeanwhile, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia\ncondemns the acts of violence against the United States\nforeign missions and any attack against any foreign or\ndiplomatic mission around the world for any reason,\nregardless of the disagreement involved. Such acts\nprevent missions from carrying out their diplomatic\nfunctions and international interests.\nIn the light of the ongoing discussion on the question\nof global economic, social and human development, the\nKingdom of Saudi Arabia, through its participation\nin the Group of Twenty, emphasizes its support of\nthe efforts aiming to stabilize the global economy, to\nadvance world trade, to take further action to liberalize\ntrade and to avoid protectionist policies that impede the\nefforts to end the global financial crisis. Meanwhile,\nwe should not ignore the matter of helping developing\nStates to overcome the consequences of that crisis.\nFurthermore, my country believes that efforts\nto reform the international financial, monetary and\ntrade system should be channelled through existing institutions in order to build a global economic system\nthat is based on a new partnership between developing\nand developed countries. That partnership should\nbe established on the basis of cooperation, justice,\nequality, transparency and mutual benefits.\nConcerning energy security, the Kingdom of Saudi\nArabia has spared no effort in the pursuit of stability in\nthe world oil markets in a manner that has served the\ndevelopment and growth of the global economy. In that\nregard, we cannot ignore the fact that energy security\nis not limited to the security of supply, but includes the\nsecurity of demand as well. My country believes that\nthere should be a dialogue between energy producers and\nconsumers in order to avoid volatility and speculation\nin prices, and to avoid imposing discriminatory taxes\non oil. We welcome the establishment of the Secretariat\nof the International Energy Forum headquarters in\nRiyadh in order to promote such dialogue.\nThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, as one of the United\nNations founding countries, has since its inception\nparticipated in its meetings and conferences on the\nbasis of its belief in the Organization\u2019s noble principles\nand the role it can play in service to humanity and its\nadvancement.\nIn conclusion, I would like to reaffirm that the\nKingdom of Saudi Arabia will be at the vanguard of\nany international efforts aimed at implementing and\nachieving the principles and purposes of the United\nNations and achieving the security, stability and\nprosperity to which we all aspire."

        "file_text": "\ufeffMay I begin by congratulating\nMr. Vuk Jeremi\u0107 on his election as President of the\nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-seventh session. Let\nme assure him that Finland is fully behind him as he\nfulfils his important duties. We look forward to close\ncooperation with him.\nI have the pleasure and honour to address the\nGeneral Assembly for the first time as President of the\nRepublic of Finland. The United Nations is the forum\nto which our peoples\u2019 expectations are directed when\nchallenges that affect us all need to be addressed. We\nin this Hall must recognize our responsibilities. We all\nmust be ready to shoulder them.\nA profound change is sweeping over the globe.\nRapid economic growth in the countries of the global\nSouth has already made greater well-being a reality for\nhundreds of millions of people. More people have the\nchance to lift themselves out of poverty. More people\nhave the opportunity for political participation. These\ndevelopments will make our world more just and less\nprone to conflict. That is in Finland\u2019s interest. It is in\nthe interests of us all.\nAt the same time, the tectonic plates of economic\npower are shifting. Global instruments are needed\nto manage that shift. The United Nations and the\nvarious \u201cG Groups\u201d need to work together better. We\nrecognize that such groups have an important role to\nplay in making the United Nations a more dynamic and\nrelevant player in the world economy.\nFinland sees itself as a responsible member of the\ninternational community \u2014 a good global citizen, if\nyou will. We support the United Nations in word and\nin deed because it is in our national interest to do so.\nThe United Nations is a genuinely universal forum for\ncooperation. It has unique legitimacy. For us, it is an\nindispensable means to promote international peace\nand security, development and human rights. As a\nsmall country \u2014 there are only some 5 million of us\nFinns \u2014 a world order based on respect for the United\nNations Charter and international law is a must. It is\nnot an option.\nFinland is a candidate for non-permanent\nmembership in the Security Council for the term\n2013-2014. We wish to shoulder the responsibility that\nmembership in the Council entails. We believe that we could make a contribution. Finland would approach the\nissues on the Council\u2019s agenda as an engaged Member\nState. We would be ready to look for constructive and\neven-handed solutions to common problems. We believe\nthat as a small and militarily non-aligned Member State,\nwe have what it takes. Finland\u2019s candidacy enjoys the\nfull support of the other Nordic countries \u2014 Denmark,\nIceland, Norway and Sweden.\nThe ability to prevent conflict around the world\nremains the United Nations core mission. It is the\nyardstick by which United Nations successes or\nfailures are measured. It is the Security Council that\nshoulders the main responsibility for the maintenance\nof international peace and security.\nPeacekeeping mandated by the Council is an\nimportant means at our disposal in that regard. Finland\nhas participated in United Nations peacekeeping as\nlong as it has been a Member State. We are also ready to\nshare with other Members and regional organizations\nthe expertise that we have gained with respect to\ntraining peacekeepers. Our training centre, the Finnish\nDefence Forces International Centre, is at the service of\nthe United Nations.\nPeacekeeping is indispensable but is not enough.\nSoldiers are needed to secure the conditions for peace\nto begin to be built. However, in the end, peace is\nbuilt by civilians. That is why Finland has long paid\nspecial attention to civilian crisis management. Finnish\nexperts \u2014 police officers and experts in the rule of\nlaw, gender equality and human rights \u2014 participate\nin peacekeeping operations in many parts of the world.\nEffective mediation is also a must. Finland has\nmade a strong contribution to mediating conflicts.\nMy predecessor, President Martti Ahtisaari, won the\nNobel Peace Prize for his decades-long career as a\nsuccessful mediator. At the initiative of Finland and\nTurkey, a resolution was adopted in this Hall last year\nthat strengthened the normative basis for mediation\n(resolution 65/283). I am glad that the Secretary-\nGeneral will soon make his guidelines on mediation\navailable to all Member States, regional organizations\nand other actors. I encourage him to make full use of\nthe powers that the Charter grants him in that regard.\nRespect for the rule of law is part and parcel of\nbuilding peace in post-conflict societies. Impunity\noften leaves behind the seeds of another conflict. In the\nlong run, economic development is sustainable only if\nthe rule of law is respected. It is encouraging that the High-level Meeting on the rule of law yesterday showed\nthat there is indeed the political commitment to further\nsuch efforts.\nRespect for the rule of law instructs us to honour\nthe beliefs of others, but it also requires us to condemn\nall violence. Finland, together with the other Nordic\ncountries, will again introduce a draft resolution on\nthe protection of diplomatic missions in the General\nAssembly. Upholding diplomatic rights and immunities\nis in our common interest.\nPoverty reduction is the ultimate means to secure\npeace in many parts of the world. That requires, above\nall, economic growth and a level playing-field for all.\nDevelopment cooperation can assist, especially in the\nleast developed countries. Those countries that already\nsuffer the effects of climate change are particularly\nvulnerable and in need of our support. Finland has\na record of being a reliable partner for developing\ncountries stretching over half a century. Despite the\nwell-known budgetary pressures within the euro\nzone, Finland has increased its outlay fordevelopment\ncooperation to an annual level of about $1.5 billion in\nrecent years.\nWeapons of mass destruction remain an existential\nthreat to international peace and security. Finland\nhas been a strong supporter of the Treaty on the\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons from the very\nbeginning. The non-proliferation of nuclear weapons,\ndisarmament and the right to the peaceful use of nuclear\nenergy are all necessary parts of the whole.\nFinland is prepared to host a conference on the\nestablishment of a Middle East zone free of nuclear\nweapons and all other weapons of mass destruction this\nyear. The task has been described as difficult but, rest\nassured, we will do our utmost to complete it. Nuclear\nmaterial cannot be allowed to fall into the wrong\nhands. Finland is on track to fulfil the commitments\nthat we undertook at the Washington conference in\n2010. National measures and international cooperation\nare both needed to stop nuclear terrorism. As a user of\npeaceful nuclear energy, Finland is strongly committed\nto continuing the process.\nChemical weapons were totally banned some\nyears ago. The treaty is not yet universal, though.\nThe Finnish Institute for Verification of the Chemical\nWeapons Convention is an established and respected\ninstitution. Should the need arise in the Middle East, Finland is ready to put its expertise at the disposal of\nthe international community.\nThe conventional weapons trade clearly needs\nbetter global regulation. It is regrettable that the\nnegotiations on the arms trade treaty ended without\nthe desired outcome. The goal is in sight, however. It is\nimportant to ensure that the process continues within\nthe United Nations context. As one of the sponsors,\nFinland continues to reach out for a substantive treaty\nand one that is as universal as possible.\nIn Libya, the United Nations was instrumental in\nlaying the groundwork for a new and hopeful future for\nits people. In Syria, the tragic situation is, if anything,\ngetting worse. The Security Council has not been able to\ntake the leading role that it is expected to take under the\nCharter with respect to threats to peace such as in that\ncountry. The General Assembly has, on the other hand,\nsent a strong signal that the international community\ncannot remain indifferent. The killings of civilians\nmust stop. All members of the Security Council must\ncooperate to find a way out of the crisis. The authority\nof the United Nations will suffer if efforts to end the\ncrisis move elsewhere.\nThe Syrian conflict has overshadowed the Middle\nEast peace process. That is something that the parties\nand the international community can ill afford. A two-\nState solution, within which an independent, viable and\ncontiguous Palestinian State lives in peace and security\nwith the State of Israel, is slipping out of reach. The\nPalestinians have waited patiently. The negotiations\nmust restart. That is the only way forward. Renewed\nnegotiations need to result in a sustainable solution\nthat leads to the establishment of a Palestinian State,\nwhile respecting Israel\u2019s legitimate security concerns.\nSettlements are squarely a contravention of international\nlaw and a growing obstacle to peace.\n\nThe Security Council has powers, but with authority\ncomes responsibility. I hope that, in a few weeks, at\nan election held here in this Hall, Finland is entrusted\nby fellow Member States with such powers and the\nattendant responsibility for two years. Finland will act\nin the Council in accordance with the United Nations\nCharter and on the basis of our values. We will work\nconstructively and pragmatically in order to maintain\nand strengthen international peace and security to the\nbest of our ability.\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffOn behalf of the\nRepublic of Kazakhstan, I would like to congratulate\nyou, Mr. Jeremi\u0107, on your election to the presidency\nof the General Assembly at its sixty-seventh session, as\nwell as to wish you every success. I also wish to express our appreciation to Ambassador Nassir Abdulaziz\nAl-Nasser, President of the General Assembly at its\nsixty-sixth session, for his skillful steering of the\nAssembly\u2019s proceedings.\nIn recent years, the world has lived through\nmajor political, social, economic and environmental\nupheavals. The geopolitical turmoil in the Middle\nEast, as well as natural and man-made disasters, serve\nas compelling evidence indicating that the issues of\nsecurity, stability and sustainable development are\nbecoming increasingly relevant.\nWe believe that world politics should be based on\nnew global principles. In the twenty-first century, those\nprinciples encompass constructive multipolarity and\ntransparency, trust and political tolerance, and the clear\npre-eminence of evolutionary forms of development\nof the world. They should be enshrined in the core\ndocuments of the United Nations and in the entire\ninternational law system. In that context, we believe\nthat it is fundamentally important to ensure strict\nadherence to the principle of non-interference in the\ninternal affairs of Member States.\nThe threat of the proliferation of nuclear weapons\nand technology, along with the spectre of their\nacquisition and use by terrorist entities, has been one\nof the most daunting challenges to humankind. It is\nour strongly held view that the possession of weapons\nof mass destruction is not a guarantee of security or\ngreater independence. Kazakhstan\u2019s own record shows\nthat countries reap huge benefits from the renunciation\nof nuclear weapons. By voluntarily giving up the world\u2019s\nfourth-largest nuclear arsenal and shutting down the\nlargest test site in Semipalatinsk, on 29 August 1991,\nwe have won more friends and have become a more\nprosperous, stable and inf luential country.\nKazakhstan fully supports the proposal by\nthe Secretary-General to adopt a nuclear weapons\nconvention. Sharing its declared goals, His Excellency\nMr. Nursultan A. Nazarbayev, President of the Republic\nof Kazakhstan, suggested that, as an important step\nin that direction, the United Nations should adopt a\nuniversal declaration of a nuclear-weapon-free world.\nThat would, undoubtedly, facilitate our advancement\ntowards a nuclear-weapon-free world and an early\nadoption of a nuclear weapons convention. Kazakhstan\nwelcomes the establishment of a constructive dialogue\nwith the five nuclear Powers with a view towards signing\na protocol on negative security assurances to the State parties to the Treaty on a Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone in\nCentral Asia.\nWe also call for an early establishment of a nuclear-\nweapon-free zone in the Middle East. In that regard, we\nlook forward to the upcoming conference in Helsinki\nand its positive outcomes.\nKazakhstan is working on the practical\nimplementation of a project to host an international\nbank of low-enriched uranium, under the auspices of\nthe International Atomic Energy Agency, which would\nallow, if need be, to ensure an uninterrupted supply of\nnuclear fuel. It should be made clear that the bank will in\nno way infringe upon the inalienable right of each State\nparty to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\nWeapons to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes,\nincluding the development of nuclear technology.\nThis year, we will complete the project to enhance\nphysical security of the former Semipalatinsk test site.\nWe view this project, which is being implemented jointly\nwith the United States and Russia, as our significant\ncontribution to the global non-proliferation regime.\nKazakhstan is actively involved in the fight\nagainst international terrorism and drug trafficking,\nwithin the framework of the Collective Security\nTreaty Organization, the Shanghai Cooperation\nOrganization and the Conference on Interaction and\nConfidence-building Measures in Asia (CICA). As\nChair of the Collective Security Treaty Organization,\nKazakhstan consistently works to strengthen regional\ncooperation in this area. Special attention has been paid\nto the expansion of practical cooperation between the\nUnited Nations and regional arrangements, including,\nin particular, the Kazakhstan-based Central Asian\nRegional Information and Coordination Centre for the\nfight against the threat of drug trafficking, which is\ndesigned to enhance multilateral cooperation to counter\nthe f low of drugs from Afghanistan.\nGiven the increasing attention by the international\ncommunity to the issue of international information\nsecurity, we believe that the time has come to consider\nthe introduction of new concepts into international law,\nsuch as electronic borders and electronic sovereignty,\nas well as the establishment of a cyberpolice unit.\nAs the current Chair of the Council of Foreign\nMinisters of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation,\nKazakhstan will continue to fully support the process\nthat aims to bring stability and peace back to the region\nof the Middle East and North Africa.\nBefore I turn to regional issues, let me express our\nstrong condemnation of the Internet video and cartoons\nthat provocatively offend the religious feelings of\nMuslims. Such disgusting incitements must be\nstopped, because they lead to an escalation of violence\nby fomenting hatred between the representatives of\nreligions, and they undermine inter-civilizational\ndialogue and confidence-building. The right to freedom\nof expression must be exercised with due responsibility.\nWe were shocked by the tragic killing of United\nStates diplomats in Benghazi. We condemn attacks\non diplomats and diplomatic missions and call upon\nGovernments to adhere to their international obligations\nto protect diplomatic representatives in their countries.\nWe should support all efforts to find a peaceful\nsolution to the conflict in Syria and assist in preventing\na humanitarian disaster. We should also take measures\nto prevent any spillover of the crisis to the rest of the\nregion. To that end, both the Syrian Government and\nthe opposition should resort to diplomacy, not arms,\nand put an immediate end to the violence.\nThe principles of sovereignty and non-interference\nin internal affairs must be respected. It is the Syrians\nthemselves who should determine the future of their\ncountry. We call on all nations to unite around the\nSyrian transition process, which should be based on\ndialogue and compromise, and support the activities of\nthe Joint Special Representative of the United Nations\nand the League of Arab States for Syria, Mr. Lakhdar\nBrahimi.\nKazakhstan calls for the creation of conditions\nto settle the Palestinian issue, including through the\ncontinuation of direct Palestinian-Israeli talks. All\nobstacles to the negotiation process should be removed.\nKazakhstan has been and continues to be a supporter of\nthe legitimate rights of Palestine to establish a sovereign\nand independent State, within the 1967 borders, and its\nentry into the United Nations as a full member.\nWe have consistently advocated a peaceful,\nexclusively diplomatic, resolution of the situation\naround the Iranian nuclear programme and look forward\nto the continuation of constructive dialogue between\nIran and all interested parties with a view to developing\nmutually acceptable solutions.\nThe reconstruction of Afghanistan is an important\nobjective of the international community that meets the\naspirations of the Afghans themselves. We believe that, if our cooperation on Afghanistan is to be successful,\nits economic dimension should be a priority. Efforts to\nstabilize the situation should be bolstered by reforms\naimed at sustainable development and the improvement\nof socioeconomic indicators in the country, its level of\neducation and other human standards.\nKazakhstan is also actively involved in multilateral\ncooperation to assist Afghanistan, as demonstrated\nby its readiness to host, in 2013 in Astana, the next\nconference of the Istanbul process.\nAlmaty, the southern megalopolis of Kazakhstan,\nhas the necessary facilities to accommodate the offices\nof international organizations. Sixteen organizations\nof the United Nations family have already set up their\noffices in the city. Most of them enjoy a regional status.\nWe promote further expansion of the presence of United\nNations organizations, including its humanitarian\nagencies, and offer to establish a United Nations\ncentre in Almaty, in order to effectively coordinate\ninternational efforts and implement regional projects\nof the United Nations, including those dealing with\nassistance to Afghanistan.\nThis year, we mark the twentieth anniversary of the\ninitiative to convene the Conference on Interaction and\nConfidence-building Measures in Asia, announced by\nPresident Nursultan Nazarbayev at the forty-seventh\nsession of the General Assembly, on 5 October 1992 (see\nA/47/PV.24). The anniversary session and the fourth\nmeeting of CICA Foreign Ministers, held in Astana\non 12 September, have become important milestones\nin the evolution of that Asian forum. Currently, the\nConference brings together 24 countries that occupy\nover 90 per cent of the territory of Asia, where half of\nthe world\u2019s population now resides. As a platform for\ndialogue, CICA has an important role to play in efforts\nto ensure peace, security and stability in Asia.\nKazakhstan urges that close attention be paid to the\nexpansion of the trade, investment and transit transport\ncapacity of least developed countries, landlocked\ndeveloping countries (LLDCs) and small island\ndeveloping States. To advance the interests of these\ngroups of countries, Kazakhstan, together with the\nUnited Nations, organized, from 12 to 14 September in\nAlmaty, the fourth meeting of LLDC Trade Ministers\nand the high-level global thematic meeting on\ninternational trade, trade facilitation and aid for trade.\nToday, the whole world is facing new challenges to\nglobal energy security. Central Asia has great potential\nto become a global energy centre. The development\nof energy resources is a priority for the Republic of\nKazakhstan. In our vision, the future of the region lies\nin the development of the oil and gas pipeline system to\ndeliver our hydrocarbon resources to Europe and Asia.\nAs a follow-up to the United Nations Conference\non Sustainable Development and to draw the attention\nof the international public to the issues of renewable\nsources of energy, Kazakhstan has decided to seek\nthe nomination of its capital, Astana, as the host of\nthe international exhibition Expo 2017 on the subject\nof \u201cEnergy for the Future\u201d. We count on fellow\nMember States to support our bid. As one of the pilot\ncountries selected from among States Members of the\nUnited Nations, Kazakhstan will actively promote the\ndevelopment of draft sustainable development goals for\nthe period beyond 2015.\nKazakhstan is not only in a position to ensure its\nown food security; it is also willing to contribute to\nglobal food security.\nIntercultural dialogue is an important prerequisite\nfor peace and security. To promote such dialogue,\nKazakhstan put forward an initiative to proclaim an\nInternational Decade for the Rapprochement of Cultures\n2013-2022, which was adopted at the conclusion of the\nthirty-sixth session of the United Nations Educational,\nScientific and Cultural Organization General\nConference, in November 2011.\nKazakhstan attaches special importance to the\nprotection of human rights and has announced its\nbid for membership in the Human Rights Council\nfor the period 2012-2015. If elected, Kazakhstan will\nparticipate, with a full sense of responsibility, in the\nproceedings of that important human rights body, on\nthe basis of an open, impartial, non-politicized and\nmutually respectful dialogue between the Member\nStates of the United Nations.\nLast March, the Republic of Kazakhstan celebrated\nthe twentieth anniversary of its membership in the\nUnited Nations. All these years, we have consistently\nstood for an inclusive, transparent and effective\nOrganization. We strongly believe that it is only by\nuniting our efforts that we can make real progress in\naddressing the global issues and challenges facing\nhumanity. We therefore call for joint efforts to seek\nsolutions to common problems for the benefit of future\ngenerations and our common planet Earth."

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt is my great honour and\npleasure to participate in the general debate of the\nAssembly on behalf of the people and Government\nof Tuvalu. As Tuvalu will commemorate the thirty-\nfourth anniversary of its independence on Monday\nnext week, 1 October, let me take this opportunity to\nacknowledge with profound appreciation the continued\nassistance and support given us by the United Nations,\nthe international community and in particular our\ntraditional development partners in our pursuit of our\ndevelopment goals.\nThe overarching theme, \u201cBringing about adjustment\nor settlement of international disputes or situations by\npeaceful means\u201d, together with a myriad of core issues\nthat have been chosen for the Assembly\u2019s sixty-seventh\nsession, is fully supported by Tuvalu. In view of\ncircumstances facing the world today, there is certainly\nan urgent and critical need for the United Nations and for each Member State in particular to address those\nissues, individually or collectively.\nAs a small and peace-loving nation, Tuvalu\nwelcomes and fully supports the important services\nprovided by the United Nations and other organizations\nin the maintenance of peace and security around the\nworld, especially in conflict regions. We firmly believe\nthat the use of force through military or violent action\nas a means for settling disputes and conflicts should be\navoided at all costs. It is also important that countries\ninvolved in such disputes should be encouraged\nand supported in discussing the root causes of their\ndifferences among themselves in a non-confrontational\nmanner.\nWe concur fully with the President\u2019s vision that\nwe cannot be defeated by terrorists, extremists and the\nsponsors and supporters who back them. The world\nwe want to give our future generations is not one of\nterrorism and fanaticism, or of proliferation of weapons\nof mass destruction, maritime piracy, organized\ncrime, drugs and narcotic smuggling, child labour and\ntrafficking, slavery and religious intolerance. In the\nUnited Nations, we strive for international peace and\nsecurity; that is the world we want to give to all future\ngenerations.\nFaced with globalized agendas, the United Nations\nmust cooperate and seek engagement with other\norganizations and their memberships for partnerships\nin development activities. The United Nations should\nalso seek to ensure participatory planning in the design\nof any engagement so that we co-opt and work together\nwith the existing diverse fabric of our societies, whose\nissues we are trying to address and assist with. The\nUnited Nations should also align its programmes and\nactivities with those of the host country\u2019s needs and\naction frameworks, heeding the distinctiveness of our\nmembership.\nWhen Tuvalu became the 189th Member of the\nUnited Nations in September 2000, we were conscious\nof the complexity and breadth of the United Nations\nagenda in comparison with our relatively modest\ncapacity. Yet there was one issue that we were\nconfidently determined to bring to the fore. Does the\nUnited Nations hear the plea of small island developing\nStates (SIDS) for fair treatment by the international\ncommunity?\nToday, 12 years later, we consider this lasting\nconcern almost totally unanswered. That may sound surprising to some representatives, as we all tend to be\nunder the impression that much work, time and energy\nhas been spent over the past two decades for the benefit\nof SIDS. Without going into detail on the state of the\nSIDS agenda, I would like to make three observations\non the subject and outline Tuvalu\u2019s intentions in the\nsame vein.\nFirst, as much as we appreciate the work of\nvarious United Nations departments and programmes\non SIDS, we observe that this work has been almost\nentirely focused on stating and indefinitely reiterating\nthe challenges and problems SIDS are facing. We have\nseen nearly 20 General Assembly resolutions on SIDS\nadopted since the Global Conference on the Sustainable\nDevelopment of Small Island Developing States, held\nin Barbados, and numerous reports of the Secretary-\nGeneral on the subject. Two United Nations conferences\non SIDS have been organized, and now new momentum\nis gathering towards a third conference in 2014.\nSecondly, there is no part of the SIDS work in the\nUnited Nations that has ever generated international\nsupport measures specially reserved for SIDS. In other\nwords, in 20 years the United Nations has not been able\nto hear and answer the pleas our island States have been\nmaking for special treatment. SIDS status and SIDS-\nspecific treatment are truly what our small island States\nare in need of, just as the least developed countries\n(LDCs) need the special treatment extended to them by\nthe international community.\nThirdly, we would like to reply to those, within and\noutside the United Nations, who have been arguing that\nthe case for special treatment of SIDS is not and should\nnot be on the United Nations agenda, because special\ntreatment of SIDS would imply the existence of a SIDS\ncategory, and apparently, we are told, SIDS cannot\nbe considered and dealt with as a special category.\nTherefore, SIDS are only an abstract notion deliberately\nkept undefined, because any clarity or debate on what\nthey are and what precisely could be done for them\nwould be too challenging or disturbing.\nThat seemingly accepted sense of SIDS work in the\nUnited Nations does not match Tuvalu\u2019s vision of what\nthe United Nations ought to be doing in support of those\ncountries. We believe that the time has come for us to\nspell it out; the third decade of United Nations work on\nSIDS should not be another round of lip service. That\nwill require a number of needed special international\nmeasures for SIDS to be identified and, naturally also, that some order be put in the definition of SIDS,\nas a necessary condition for making SIDS a genuine,\ninternationally accepted special category of countries.\nTuvalu greatly appreciates the decision taken\nby the Economic and Social Council to note the\nrecommendation of the Committee for Development\nPolicy to graduate Tuvalu from the least developed\ncountry category and to consider that issue at its next\nsubstantive session in 2013. That will allow the Council\nthe opportunity for full consideration of the particular\nchallenges Tuvalu faces. In that regard, despite the\nfact that Tuvalu has met two of the three criteria for\ngraduation from LDC status, there is an urgent need for\nthe United Nations to revisit such criteria in order to\nreflect and capture the real situation of the economies\nof the countries eligible for graduation.\nWe believe that treating the case of Tuvalu the\nsame way one deals with other countries is a denial\nof what decades of United Nations advocacy have set\nin place. It would be something akin to the principle\nof equal treatment, namely, the principle of special\ntreatment, which is precisely the foundation of the\nvery existence of LDC status. If the geographical\nlimitations and extreme vulnerabilities of Tuvalu do\nnot justify special consideration, what is the purpose\nof special and differentiated treatment, the cornerstone\nof international cooperation? Obviously, countries\nare acutely uneven and unequal, and treating them on\nthe basis of a one-size-fits-all paradigm would simply\nbe wrong. Tuvalu looks forward to the continued\nunderstanding and support of members of the Economic\nand Social Council on the question of its graduation\nfrom the LDC category.\nTuvalu also accords the highest priority to the\nattainment of the Millennium Development Goals\n(MDGs). Tuvalu has passionately pursued those Goals,\nand we sincerely thank the donor community for its\ninvaluable support, be it in-kind or financial. As we\nprogress to the end of the MDGs in 2015, we continue\nto seek such partnerships so as to ensure that the MDGs\nare achieved fully and effectively as we anticipate the\ntransition to the sustainable development goals.\nWe are also fully committed to the strategic\nimplementation of the essential dictates of the Barbados\nProgramme of Action for the Sustainable Development\nof Small Island Developing States, the Mauritius\nStrategy for its further implementation, and the\nIstanbul Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries for the Decade 2011-2020, and seek the\ncooperation of development partners to provide, in a\ntimely and predictable manner, financial and technical\nsupport to ensure their successful implementation.\nWe have repeatedly called on developed and\nemerging countries and their partners to take a\nleadership role in reducing their greenhouse-gas\nemissions and to help small and poor countries like\nTuvalu in their mitigation and adaptation activities.\nTuvalu\u2019s security and nationhood are continuously being\nthreatened by the adverse impact of climate change,\nespecially by sea-level rise. Much has been said and\ndocumented on the root causes of climate change and\nits negative consequences for many countries, not just\nthe most vulnerable small island States like Tuvalu. Yet\nthe ongoing global pleas to address such consequences\nhave so far fallen on ignorant, if not deaf, ears.\nOur smallness and lack of natural endowments, as\nwell as being only four metres above sea level, leave\nus extremely vulnerable to natural shocks, particularly\nto the effects of climate change and sea-level rise. As\nis well known, sea-level rise and f looding threaten\nTuvalu\u2019s limited agricultural production, undermine\nfood security, and increase our vulnerability to supply\ndisruptions. We therefore support advances and urge\nperseverance with the United Nations Framework\nConvention on Climate Change and the Kyoto Protocol\nas the primary international, intergovernmental forum\nfor negotiating the global response to climate change\nin order to give substance to international agreements.\nAs a sea-locked country, we in the Pacific have\noffered the resources of our vast oceans to be utilized\nby developed countries. We ask the partner countries\nto be more responsible and to reward us as guardians\nwith the appropriate compensations that are conducive\nto our development needs, as well as environmentally\nrecompensing. Domestically, Tuvalu is pursuing energy\nefficiencies, development strategies and goals that are\nboth green or blue and sustainable. We have challenged\nourselves to be 100 per cent renewable in 2020 in our\nenergy sector. We could miss the mark, but we will not\nbe comforted by remaining inactive, be it in our vision\nor in our action. We have asked developed countries to\nreduce carbon emissions; we will do the same at home,\nregardless of scale contrasts.\nWith the advent of technology, Tuvalu seeks\nthe donors\u2019 assistance in realizing their pledges to\nestablish early-warning systems pertaining to tsunamis\nor tropical cyclones in order to mitigate any risk and subsequent cost to Tuvalu. Tuvalu wishes also to offer\nits established trust fund protocols to the United Nations\nand development partners\u2019 funding mechanisms for\nclimate change adaptation as innovative financing\ninstruments and architecture for channelling such\nresources to Tuvalu. Our trust funds are governed by\ninternational agreements and renowned worldwide as\ntransparent and accountable mechanisms with high\ninternational standards of accounting and governance.\nMany suggestions for enhancing the role of the\nUnited Nations have been documented. We also\ncontinue to hear from the experts and technical\nadvisers of the development of alternative energy\ndrives and technologies, be they solar, wind or wave.\nIn our region, and I believe in many other remote areas,\nwe ask how we can get those new technologies to be\nreadily available and price-effective to the membership\nof the United Nations, especially LDCs and SIDS. We\ntherefore urge the United Nations and the Secretariat to\nact as facilitators of such developments and to expedite\ntechnology transfers, where appropriate, to bring our\nmany words and resolutions to fruition.\nOur collective and global efforts to have peace\nand security as a prerequisite for the stability needed\nfor global economic growth, sustainable development\nand social progress will be meaningless if the United\nNations continues not to recognize and acknowledge\nTaiwan\u2019s significant contribution and efforts towards\nthe East China Sea peace initiative for regional\nstability and peace. Furthermore, Taiwan\u2019s continued\ncontribution to the international community as one of\nthe committed development partners and responsible\nstakeholders in achieving the Millennium Development\nGoals should be recognized and accepted by the\nUnited Nations system as a valuable contribution to\nour collective efforts. In that regard, Tuvalu calls\nupon the United Nations subsidiary bodies, especially\nthe International Civil Aviation Organization and the\nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate\nChange, to recognize and allow Taiwan to participate\nin and contribute meaningfully to their meetings and\nactivities without reservations.\nIncidentally, any legitimate claim for new\nnationhood or independence, be it in the Pacific region\nor the world over, should be supported, as colonialism\nin any form is contradictory to the United Nations\nCharter, just as any form of discrimination by race,\ngender or belief is not accepted in a civilized, modern\nand free world. I conclude by asking that the United Nations\ncontinue to cooperate in an unprecedented way.\nThe United Nations must work together more\nenterprisingly and reform our strategies to conform\nto new developments, contemporary innovations and\nissues. Holding and hosting meeting after meeting is\na good engagement strategy and directs our activities.\nHowever, delaying the implementation of resolutions is\ndetrimental, as resolution after resolution is shelved or\ndeferred until they are redundant. The United Nations\nCharter, I believe, is premised on timely actions and\nachievements to gauge whether we are effective and\nsustainable or merely validating our inactivity.\nI wish the President, the Secretary-General and\nall our membership every success in the sixty-seventh\nsession of the General Assembly."

        "file_text": "\ufeffI have the singular\nhonour of reading the statement of His Excellency\nMr. Al Hadji Yahya A.J.J. Jammeh, the President of the\nRepublic of the Gambia, who would have loved to be\nhere today but was unable to so, owing to unavoidable\ncircumstances. However, he sends his best wishes to all\npresent. I will now read his statement.\n\u201cFirst and foremost, I thank Allah, the\nAlmighty, for making another annual gathering\nof world leaders possible. I would first like to congratulate the President on his election and\nwish him success in his tenure as he manages the\naffairs of the Assembly. Let me also pay tribute to\nthe Secretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for his\ntireless leadership and sterling contribution to the\ncreation of a better world for all.\n\u201cOur world unquestionably continues to be\nplagued by numerous challenges that can be solved\nonly through our collective response. Multilateral\ndiplomacy and institutions surely offer the best\nhope yet for tackling our development conundrums,\nprotracted conflicts and man-made and natural\ndisasters.\n\u201cPeace and security will always remain a\ncornerstone of the Organization and for that reason\nmy delegation is concerned with the matter and\nwelcomes the President\u2019s choice of the theme\n\u2018Bringing about adjustment or settlement of\ninternational disputes or situations by peaceful\nmeans\u2019.\n\u201cAs we speak, many conflicts are raging around\nthe world in ways that challenge the credibility\nand clout of the Organization. The paralysis\ndisplayed by our common security mechanisms, for\nexample, is astounding. Geopolitical interests have\ntrampled the goodwill and humanitarian concerns\nthat should compel us all to address those raging\ninfernos \u2014 be they in the Middle East, Asia, Africa\nor elsewhere. Our collective security will continue\nto be undermined by geopolitical considerations,\nunless and until we find the courage to reform the\nSecurity Council. Ongoing conflicts, for example\nin Mali, Guinea-Bissau and Syria, are all recent\ncases in point. The Security Council should not be\nthe stumbling block in the way of the settlement\nof disputes by peaceful or other means. Rather, it\nshould be a more helpful institution.\n\u201cMy delegation is fully aware of the need for\nthe peaceful settlement of some of the conflicts\nin Africa, but we are equally aware of the need\nfor robust action in dealing with the spoilers and\nmerchants of death and misery in the continent.\nThe Economic Community of West African States\nis working to find solutions to all those conflicts\nbut needs, of course, the support of the international\ncommunity.\n\u201cWe see the role of the Security Council as\na partner and enabler of decisive action, but time\nis running out. The elements of doom have been emboldened by our inaction. The United Nations\nand the United Nations Office for West Africa must\nwork decisively to address the conflicts in Mali\nand Guinea-Bissau without delay. The engagement\nof the African Union (AU) will undoubtedly be\ncrucial. Terrorists, drug dealers and organized\ncriminal networks should be stopped in their tracks\nat all costs before it is too late.\n\u201cThe relevance of the Organization has at times\nbeen questioned, but one element that remains\nunchallenged is its character as the best forum\nfor confronting global challenges. As we convene\nto discuss the issues of climate change, economic\ncrises, financial turmoil, food insecurity, conflicts,\nfighting disease and poverty, or the special interests\nof Africa, the convening power of the United Nations\nconfers a legitimacy that is indeed unparalleled\nelsewhere.\n\u201cAs developing countries, we therefore believe\nin the work that this Organization of ours does, and\nit is for that reason that we will support the efforts of\nthe President of the General Assembly to revitalize\nit \u2014 as the voice for the voiceless.\n\u201cWe also use this forum to call on the\ninternational financial institutions to open up\nand embrace overdue reforms. They should be\ntransparent and inclusive and raise the profile\nof their smallest members, such as low-income\ncountries or least developed countries (LDCs). We\ncall on them to embrace the Istanbul Programme of\nAction for LDCs.\n\u201cThe Istanbul Programme of Action must not\nbecome a string of broken promises, unfulfilled\ncommitments and weak resource mobilization,\nas happened with its predecessors. As LDCs we\nare ready to hold ourselves accountable for the\nimplementation of the commitments we made in\nIstanbul. We are equally ready to meet the targets set\nout in the Programme. It is therefore our collective\nhope, expectation and belief that our partners and\nthe rest of the international community will also\nfulfil their commitments and uphold their part of\nthe bargain. Let us work together to bring about\nthe graduation of half of the LDCs by 2020, in line\nwith the target we set ourselves. It is achievable if\nwe all forge the appropriate global partnerships for\nresource mobilization. \u201cThe scorecard on the Millennium Development\nGoals (MDGs) shows that, while some achievements\nhave been made with regard to some of the Goals, a\ngreat deal still remains to be achieved. My country\nhas achieved some of the key elements of the MDGs\nand is on track to meet all of them. In view of the\nfact that 2015 is just around the corner, we need\nto do more to mobilize the remaining resources\nrequired to further improve the critical links needed\nfor success on the achievement of the MDGs.\n\u201cCritical to the achievement of the MDGs will\nbe the scaling up of resources by enhancing the\nglobal partnerships that we have forged for the\nGoals. We must mobilize the modest resources\nthat are needed so that 2015 will not be another\nunfulfilled milestone.\n\u201cThe United Nations Conference on Sustainable\nDevelopment (Rio+20) has defined the mechanisms\nthrough which sustainable development goals\nshould be negotiated and agreed upon. It is our hope\nthat the consultations on the post-Rio mechanisms\nwill be inclusive, transparent and representative.\nBeyond managing the depleting resources of the\nEarth, we must all push for ambitious and realistic\ngoals and targets on sustainable food, water and\nenergy. We must also take into account the special\nsituations of LDCs and other vulnerable groups of\ncountries.\n\u201cMy delegation is of the strong belief that, in\nthe euphoria for sustainable development goals, the\ndrive towards the achievement of the MDGs must\nnot be compromised in any way. We must hold\nourselves accountable for meeting the Goals by\n2015, and not try to shift the goalposts when the\ndeadline is close at hand. We must also lay a solid\ngroundwork for the post-2015 development agenda.\n\u201cFor developing countries to continue to benefit\nfrom the appreciable growth they are experiencing\nand in order not to compromise their capacities\nto provide education, health care and other social\nservices to their peoples, debt cancellation or\nforgiveness is still a key element. Debt servicing\nstill poses a major threat to our ability to attain\nsustainable growth. It is our belief that our partners\nand the Bretton Woods institutions should consider\nthe further extension of the Heavily Indebted Poor\nCountries Initiative. \u201cAs we strive in the Sahel to deal with drought\nand the crop failure of the past year, allow me\nto thank the Secretary-General for his laudable\nefforts, as we heard today, through his initiative\nfor the Sahel and for his plans to assist the region,\nincluding Mali. We thank him for that initiative,\nwhich we look forward to seeing realized. We also\nthank all our development partners for the support\nthey have rendered, both to my Government and to\nthe Sahel. We are grateful for their solidarity and\nhumanitarian support. In view of the perennial\nnature of food insecurity in our region, it is my\nhumble and considered view that the international\ncommunity needs to do more to render greater\nsupport to the agricultural sector of our economies.\n\u201cThe role of the small-scale farmer needs to be\nboosted, and we must, through global partnerships,\nfast-track the numerous agricultural initiatives that\nhave been announced to support African agriculture.\nAgricultural systems across Africa need to be made\nmore resilient in terms of inputs, technological\nknow-how, scientific research and the setting up\nof related training institutions. The African farmer\nneeds to benefit from modern farming techniques\nand technology. In that context, I would like to\nthank the Government and people of Australia\nfor their outstanding generosity towards boosting\nagriculture and food security in Africa.\n\u201cWith the establishment of UN-Women,\nthe United Nations took a great step forward\nin mainstreaming the gender dimension into its\nwork. As an ardent supporter of women\u2019s rights\nand participation in all sectors of society, I must\ncommend UN-Women for the way it has been\nevolving. We look forward to the establishment of\nits regional offices. We will work with all concerned\nto advance the promotion of the rights of women\nand girls, once we assume our position as a member\nof the Executive Board. Advancing the welfare of\nwomen, which starts with girls as future women,\nwill always be a priority for my Government.\n\u201cAfrica is indeed witnessing a revolution in\ninformation and communications technology,\nwhich is a critical sector for us. Our considered\nview is that, with the completion of the Africa\nCoast to Europe submarine cable network, there\nwill be an even greater transformation in that very\nimportant sector. It should further help to increase the transfer of critical technology for the economic\nadvancement of our peoples.\n\u201cIn that project we see a great opportunity for\nSouth-South and North-South cooperation in ways\nthat will revolutionize education, agriculture and\nthe provision of health care, among other areas.\nWe therefore call on our partners to support the\ngrowth of the information and communications\ntechnology sector with a view to enhancing our\nproductive capacity, while also generating youth\nemployment, since youth unemployment is one of\nthe greatest threats to humankind and to our social\nand economic advancement. We must therefore\nform partnerships across the globe to address that\ndangerous phenomenon, which is a disaster waiting\nto happen.\n\u201cAllow me to address some recent conflicts\nthat threaten the peace and stability of Africa and\nthe world at large. Our youth, for example, are\nbeing sucked into conflicts and a life of crime, with\ntheir productive talents being wasted. Our modest\ngains are being wiped out through instability, and\neven our societal cohesion is seriously threatened.\nIf we do not act fast now, we risk creating more\nupheavals, which will overwhelm our capacity to\ncontain them. The international community will\ntherefore pay a very high price if it does not wake\nup from its slumber and solve the situations in Mali\nand Guinea-Bissau that I highlighted earlier.\n\u201cIn West Africa, our ongoing security\nchallenges are being compounded by such\nsituations. ECOWAS should not be left alone to\nshoulder the burden of those conflicts. I am elated\nby the fact that, this morning, the issues of Mali, the\nentire Sahel and the Maghreb were discussed. The\nAU and ECOWAS are ready, and I hope that the\ninternational community, particularly the Security\nCouncil, is also ready. The AU is ready to act to\nsalvage the situations in Mali and Guinea-Bissau.\nThe Security Council must, as I have said, act with\na sense of greater urgency. We cannot let terrorists,\ndrug dealers and organized criminal gangs establish\na sanctuary in our backyard.\n\u201cIn line with our foreign policy, the Gambia\nstands ready, as always, to contribute meaningfully\nto the settlement of such conflicts. The level of\nsteadfastness shown in solving the conflicts in\nLiberia and Sierra Leone some years ago must now, we hope, equally be shown in Mali and\nGuinea-Bissau.\n\u201cThe situation in Darfur continues to occupy\nthe attention of my delegation, as well. We call for\nmore dialogue in finding a lasting solution to that\nmajor conflict. We are equally concerned about the\nlingering conflict between the Sudan and South\nSudan. Dialogue is essential, and is the only way\nforward to solve that conflict. The parties must\nimplement the recommendations of the African\nUnion High-level Implementation Panel and those\nof the road map.\n\u201cAs they embark on settling the outstanding\nissues, we urge our brothers and sisters to\ndemonstrate the same magnanimity and\nextraordinary statesmanship that characterized the\nestablishment of the independence of South Sudan.\nThey should remember that they will be neighbours\nforever and, as such, are mutually dependent upon\neach other for their national security.\n\u201cLet me commend the forces of the African\nUnion Mission in Somalia, the United Nations and\nthe African Union for the progress that they are\nmaking in Somalia. The pressure must be sustained\nuntil all of Somalia is liberated and is placed under\nthe sole authority of the Somali Government.\nInsecurity and piracy must be stamped out. The\nspoilers must be denied sanctuary, lest they continue\ndestabilizing the whole of the Horn of Africa.\n\u201cAs we dwell on such situations, we are equally\nconcerned about the conflicts ravaging the Middle\nEast. Afghanistan, for example, has been in a state\nof unrest for too long. It is time that Afghans be\ngiven enough space and capacity to solve their\nproblems. Home-grown and inclusive dialogue and\nnational reconciliation are the best way forward to\nlasting peace and stability in that country.\n\u201cWe all witnessed the dramatic and historic\nevents that have recently transformed parts of the\nMiddle East and Africa. It is therefore our hope that\nthose transformations will endure and will nurture\nthe ideals of peace, security, development and\ndemocracy. We must not lose sight of some of the\nnegative concomitant effects of those upheavals, as\nis currently evident in Syria.\n\u201cMy delegation believes that the Annan plan\ncould have brought about stability and could have provided the space for dialogue among the parties,\nif it had been given a chance. It seems that there\nis lack of goodwill and trust among the parties,\nas well as the invisible hand of external elements\ndetermined to achieve a particular outcome. Syria\nis now a deeply divided society. The international\ncommunity is partly to blame on account of its\ninaction.\n\u201cThe Palestinian situation is indeed deplorable.\nIt has deteriorated to the point that a one-State\nsolution may be inevitable. In defiance of\ninternational law, human decency and restraint,\nIsrael, the occupying Power, is imposing a de facto\nsituation on Palestinians through its despicable\nsettlement activity and land seizures. The sad\nreality is that it is the mechanisms of the Security\nCouncil, which are constantly invoked, that further\ndelay or stifle the action necessary to bring about\nlasting peace in Palestine. Israel\u2019s excesses,\nnamely, the land seizures, settlement activity, mass\nimprisonment of Palestinians, denial of revenue,\nmaiming and murder of Palestinians by the State\napparatus and many others, must be halted. The\ntruth is bitter when told, but it will set us all free.\n\u201cLet me also address some burning political\nissues of our time. The embargo imposed on Cuba\nby the United States 50 years ago is still in place\nfor no justifiable reason. Even if perhaps it made\nsense at the time, keeping it in place today does\nnot make any sense at all. It is shameful that, in the\ntwenty-first century, a Cold War relic remains the\nmain stumbling block between the establishment\nof good-neighbourly relations and the rejection of\nempty political cacophony in some quarters. We\ntherefore call upon the United States to lift the\nembargo and throw it into the dustbin of history,\nwhere it rightfully belongs.\n\u201cMy delegation would also like to use this\nrostrum to appeal to the collective membership of\nthe United Nations, including China, to contribute\nto opening the avenues for Taiwan\u2019s membership\nin the various funds, agencies, treaty bodies\nand programmes. That would only enhance the\neffectiveness of those bodies for our mutual benefit.\nThe world, not only Taiwan, stands to benefit. We\nall agree that Taiwan is a key player in technology,\ninternational trade, politics and many other areas. It\nhas enduring ties with China. We therefore appeal\nfor the practical extension of the rapport that Taiwan has with China to the international stage. China\nconducts trade, business and tourism with Taiwan.\nAs I speak, both are engaging in discussing a range\nof bilateral issues. The rest of the international\ncommunity, including the States Members of the\nUnited Nations, should follow suit. Avenues for\ndialogue must be opened.\n\u201cThe stalled reform of the Security Council\nis disheartening and even dangerous. Year in and\nyear out, we come to the General Assembly. We\nmeet in various forums to discuss the issues. We\nhold dialogues and exchanges and come up with\nproposals. Then we get nowhere. I will mention\nwhat Kofi Annan said at the time of launching his\nwell-known report \u201cIn larger freedom: towards\ndevelopment, security and human rights for all\u201d\n(A/59/2005), namely, that no reform of the United\nNations is complete without the reform of the\nSecurity Council. I think that is critical. It is as valid\nnow as it was when it was said seven years ago.\nThe resistance to change should come to an end.\nThe paralysis of the reform agenda must come to\nan end. We cannot afford as a group to be in a state\nof coma when larger regional interests, especially\nthose of Africa, are at stake and get shunted around\nor jettisoned. Africa needs to be at the table and we\nwill not budge on that demand, as previous speakers\nhave said and as our heads of State have reiterated\nhere. We must reform or risk delegitimizing the\nactions taken, and the decisions made, in the name\nof our collective security.\n\n\u201cAllow me, at this point, to recognize the\nappointment of His Excellency Mr. Jan Eliasson,\nthe new Deputy Secretary-General of the United\nNations. We have confidence in his abilities\nand experience as an astute statesman. We are\nalso aware of his keen interest in Africa and his\nengagement with our continent at various periods\nin his diplomatic life. We therefore look forward to\njointly advancing the special needs of Africa with\nhim under the guidance of the Secretary-General.\n\u201cOn a final note, it is my hope that the next\nPresidents of the General Assembly will consider\nother themes beyond that of peace and security,\nalthough there can be no doubt that peace and security are critical. Where possible an intermarriage\nof themes might also be considered.\u201d\nI wish all members a successful General Assembly\nsession."

        "file_text": "\ufeffI\nbring cordial greetings to the authorities of the United\nNations and to all the Heads of State and representatives\nhere with us. This session of the General Assembly,\nwhich will address the theme of the settlement of\ndisputes by peaceful means, offers us an opportunity\nto reflect on the course of the history of our countries\nand humankind, and to showcase the issues that the\nworld\u2019s peoples need to solve. The peaceful settlement\nof conflicts is an essential part of how we strengthen\nour democratic institutions and the rule of law in a\nworld that has not yet consolidated peace.\n\nFor various reasons that we need not go into,\nwe are witnessing violations of the principle of\nnon-interference \u2014 through various mechanisms\nthat are not necessarily military \u2014 of our countries\u2019\nconstitutions and our own international treaties, as well\nas various manifestations of intolerance, xenophobia\nand other attitudes that provoke violence and foment\nconflict. Hard as it is to believe, we still see political\nparties, leaders, intellectuals and representatives of the\nmedia who continue to see global realities through Cold\nWar eyes, as if the last half-century had not produced\nenormous changes in the international political map.\nSuch outdated positions hinder the progress of our\npeoples and nations in strengthening and broadening\ntheir democratic borders. My country, El Salvador, is a\nclear example of such contradictions, finding itself as\nit does stuck between a process that is strengthening\nthe rule of law and the persistence of conservative\nforces that still entertain the fantasy of communism.\nI bring these thoughts to this forum because I\nbelieve that El Salvador\u2019s young democracy is a good\nexample of how to settle disputes through dialogue. It\nis also a good example of structures that are mired in\nbackwardness, privilege and the Manichaean view that\nbelongs to the Cold War. As is well known, El Salvador\nendured a long armed conflict that lasted 12 years and\ncost more than 80,000 lives. Our emergence from\nthat conflict has been a model of the effectiveness of\ndialogue and negotiation for my country and the entire\nworld.\nWe took a giant step forward as a nation\n20 years ago when, on 16 January 1992, we signed the Chapultepec, Mexico, peace accords that brought the\narmed conflict to a definitive end. The United Nations\nitself acted as mediator; the then Secretary-General,\nMr. Javier P\u00e9rez de Cuellar, in consultation with the\nSecurity Council, appointed the Peruvian diplomat\n\u00c1lvaro de Soto as mediator. I would like, if I may, to\npay tribute to Mr. De Soto\u2019s work, as it is an example of\nhow even exceedingly difficult disputes can be settled\nthrough dialogue. In that regard, he proved to be a true\narchitect of peace. We can say that, beginning in 1992,\nSalvadorans launched a new process that has gradually\nconsolidated our democracy and created modern\ninstitutions.\nThree years ago El Salvador passed another\nmilestone signaling a step forward in the strengthening\nof our democracy. After 20 years of Governments led by\nthe same political forces, we witnessed a political change\nthat brought in the current Government to administer the\nState. This was not simply a change of political party; it\nopened the way to a movement of renewal that has been\nexpressed in various issues of enormous importance\nfor the rule of law and for reinforcing the work of\nour democratic institutions. The long-term control of\nour country\u2019s Government by a single political party\nfor two decades gave absolute power to a small group\nover the organs of State \u2014 executive, legislative and\njudicial \u2014 and over other institutions such as the Court\nof Accounts, the Office of the Prosecutor General and\nthe Public Ministry, among others.\nAs change and the break with absolute control\ntook place, they began to permit genuine independence\nin the branches of Government, which in turn began\nto lead to the genuine f lowering of democracy that\nthe people had demanded. Those changes, far from\nchanging the rules of the game, effectively guaranteed\njudicial certainty and eliminated the privileges that\nhad protected Governments in the past. On behalf\nof the State, the Government asked for forgiveness\nfor the crimes committed by State agents during the\narmed conflict, and has undertaken and continues to\nundertake concrete efforts to make moral and material\nreparations to the victims of barbaric atrocities and\ntheir families. This was a debt to the Salvadoran people\nand the international community that had not been\nsettled by previous Governments.\nNot long ago, our country experienced an\ninstitutional crisis whose nature and scope were\nvery different from those of the armed conflict, but\nnonetheless put Salvadoran democracy to the test.\nI am referring to the recent crisis that arose between\nthe constitutional chamber of the Supreme Court of\nJustice and the Legislative Assembly in my country. At\nno time did the crisis cause political instability; rather,\nit brought two State bodies in conflict and, in that\nrespect, it was an example of the independence of those\ntwo branches of Government in our country today.\nThe conflict, arising from different and conflicting\ninterpretations of the Republic\u2019s Constitution, lasted\nalmost five months. It was a protracted crisis that\ngenerated opposing positions within our country, and\nthe lack of agreement between the parties drove the\nLegislative Assembly to call for a settlement through\nthe Central American Court of Justice. The conflict and\nthat decision of the parliamentary majority set off strong\nreactions from groups on either side. Unfortunately,\nit was also exploited by foreign groups, including by\ncampaigning United States senators who blew the\nconflict out of proportion without understanding it\nfully.\nTherefore, with no agreement to resolve the crisis,\nthe President of the Republic offered to mediate and\nfacilitate the dialogue. After 17 long days of meetings\nwith representatives of the different political camps in\nthe Legislative Assembly, the longed-for agreement was\nfinally reached. In the end, that agreement led to the\nappointment of a new President of the Supreme Court\nof Justice and the normalization of the administration\nof justice in our country.\nI wished to share with the Assembly this brief\nsketch of events in order to underscore that once again\nEl Salvador was able to find a felicitous solution to an\ninstitutional crisis through dialogue and as the fruit of\nnegotiation. In short, it was a new triumph of the young\nand ever-stronger Salvadoran democracy. Of course,\nmany challenges lie ahead, such as that of promoting\na process of constitutional reform that will lead to an\nunequivocal interpretation of our Magna Carta so that\nwe do not once again suffer conflicts such as the one\nwe saw recently. We also must move to update State\ninstitutions in the light of what we have learned over\nthe past two decades.\nEl Salvador resolved on its own an institutional\nconflict that in other eras would have led to coups\nd\u2019\u00e9tat and breaches of constitutional order with serious\nhuman, economic, political and social consequences for\ncountries that suffered such situations. We found the\nsolution through dialogue, which is a fine example of\nthe theme for this session of the General Assembly. At the same time, we are aware that the strengthening of\ndemocratic processes \u2014 which, happily, is the one-way\nroad on which Latin America is now travelling \u2014 should\nbring profound changes in the economic and social\nstructures of our countries, which must clearly be based\non the rule of law.\nThe fact that there are people who are marginalized\nand excluded from the progress and goods that only a\nsmall portion of humankind is able to enjoy remains\nan open wound that we cannot and should not continue\nto tolerate. We live from crisis to crisis, ever more\nfrequent and ever deeper, which lead to a system and\nmodels based essentially on the accumulation of wealth\nin the hands of a tiny minority, leaving large majorities\nin poverty and backwardness. The phenomenon of\nmigration, which we once addressed in this forum, is\nthe child of that planet-wide inequality and an striking\nref lection of the need to change and change quickly.\nLatin America has taken important steps in that\ndirection. We are leaving behind a perverse model that\nhad impoverished our people and turned our region into\nthe most unfair of the planet \u2014 not the poorest, but\nthe most unfair. Today, we are aware that no model is\nsuccessful if it leaves out vast majorities. With all the\npeople involved we can achieve much, but without the\npeople we can achieve nothing. That is the road that we\nhave begun to travel in our region. Without a doubt, it\nwill be a difficult and long road, full of progress and\nsetbacks, but in the end, and I stress this, it is the only\nroad that will allow for certain success.\nThe unfair distribution of wealth and goods, the\nconstant aggression against the environment, and the\nlack of global control over financial f lows that leads\nto recurring crises \u2014 which are always paid for by the\npeople and never by those who are responsible \u2014 are\nrealities that do not arise from any ideology. The problem\nis not one of ideology. These are realities that we must\nchange in order to establish a climate of peace and\nsecurity in which we see the domestic changes that give\nour peoples better living conditions and access to the\nmaterial and cultural goods that produce progress in\nour global society.\nI do not wish to conclude without first alluding to\na topic that we have also addressed in this forum and\nthat is a source of ongoing concern for the international\ncommunity. I am referring to civic security and the\nfight against organized crime and all forms of violence.\nEl Salvador is today the focus of the region, multilateral\norganizations and the countries that historically have close ties to my country. That is due to a phenomenon\nthat we have been experiencing for more than half\na year and that has brought a significant drop in\nviolence and crime. El Salvador was the second most\nviolent country on the American continent until a few\nmonths ago. We had 15 murders per day on average,\nas a result of violence, crime and infighting among\ncriminal organizations, in particular among gangs. By\nSeptember, the average had fallen to 3.8 murders per\nday. We have seen drops in other crime rates that, while\nless significant, are still steady and substantial.\nFor the past three years, El Salvador has been\nundertaking a policy of civic security that has been\nbearing fruit. Recently, a truce signed between rival\ngangs, with the Catholic church as intermediary and\nfacilitated by the Government, contributed decidedly to\nthat crime reduction process. However, let me also say\nthat if violence and organized crime are to disappear\nin our countries, we must modify the conditions for\nmillions of young people who live without hope and\nwithout opportunity. These are tasks that are incumbent\nupon the Governments and societies of each of our\ncountries.\nHowever, there is more. As we have said on other\noccasions, without the strong and decided support of the\ndrug-consuming countries, and without an unequivocal\ncommitment from those large markets, we cannot wage\nthis good fight successfully. Central America, together\nwith Mexico and Colombia, have agreed upon joint\npolicies to wage that battle. We need the support of\nthe Government and people of the United States in that\nbattle. It is essential.\nEl Salvador has launched a massive campaign to\nraise awareness and mobilize our people against gender\nviolence in the understanding that violence against\nwomen is violence against all of society. If gender-based\nviolence is a problem throughout all of our societies,\nit is one that we should address and that is even more\npressing in societies where there is a strong tradition of\ntolerance of violence and chauvinism against women.\nGovernments bear the biggest responsibility, but\nsocieties should also show solidarity and commit to\nthose efforts. We are certain that the differences that\ndivide us within our countries can be overcome only\nthrough dialogue. That is the manner in which we must\nresolve conflicts. Dialogue, consensus and agreement\nare the guidelines for the road maps that will lead to\nsocieties that are more fair and prosperous.\n\nI should therefore like to conclude my remarks\nby sending along a warm greeting to the people and\nGovernment of Colombia for their efforts to attain a\ndefinitive peace in their country. For several decades,\nour sister Republic of Colombia has suffered an armed\nconflict that has limited its possiblities and clearly\nhindered its economic growth and the well-being of its\npeople. For that reason, the dialogue and negotiation that\nhave been launched by President Juan Manuel Santos\nCalder\u00f3n deserve the full support of the international\ncommunity, and in particular of the Latin American\ncountries. We congratulate the Colombian people and\nwish them the greatest success on the road that they\nhave taken towards peace and national concord.\nAlong the same lines, we hail the process of\neconomic reforms undertaken by the sister Republic\nof Cuba, which is bringing about a transformation\nthat is worthy of our support and encouragement. We\ntherefore reiterate the call we made last year in this\nHall. The blockade against Cuba must be lifted. It is\nan anachronism from a past that has been overcome in\nour America.\nPeace, unity and change are essential values when\nit comes to working for the happiness of our peoples."

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt is always a great\nhonour for me to address the General Assembly. The\nAssembly gives us a unique opportunity to debate the\nkey challenges of our world and time, and to identify\nand confront the problems that our nations are facing.\nIt is a moment of collective ref lection and it should be\na moment of truth.\nToday, 20 months after the act of despair of a\nyoung Tunisian citizen that strongly shook the world\nand generated so many hopes around the globe, many\npeople have doubts.\nSome are telling us that the images of liberation\nand joy seen around the world have been replaced by\nbroken promises, despair and chaos, that the world\nwas better off when fewer people were free, and that\nthe international system was more stable when fewer\nsocieties were open.\nI have come here today to make the opposite\nargument. I have come here today to make the case for\nopen societies.\nAfter the horrible attack on the United States\nconsulate in Benghazi and the death of Ambassador\nChris Stevens, I called the American Ambassador in\nGeorgia to convey my condolences and to speak to him,\nto share my sorrow and express my support for this\nunique nation.\nI was struck by what he told me. I was struck by\nthe fact that American diplomats, beyond their pain and\ntheir anger, still believed so clearly that the liberation of\nLibya was fundamentally a good thing. Just a few days\nago, the United States Ambassador in my country was\nproved right by the demonstrations held by the citizens\nof Benghazi, who went out to protest against extremist  militias and to show their support for the achievement\nof peace and prosperity in their own country.\nI was also struck by the visit last week to the United\nStates by Aung San Suu Kyi, the joyous reception that\nAmerica gave her, and her desire to come and tell\nher story with serenity and determination, a story of\nprogress towards freedom in the face of seemingly\nimpossible odds.\nTwenty months after the act of despair and tragic\ndeath of Mohamed Bouazizi, there are many who\ndoubt the cause to which Ambassador Stevens gave his\nlife, who doubt the vision of Aung San Suu Kyi, who\ndoubt freedom. I am totally certain that the skeptics\nare wrong. A free society has never meant a society\nwithout problems. On the contrary, an open society has\nproblems, exposes them, shows them, deals with them\nand does not neglect them, because it keeps arguments\nopen and gives Government a chance to be accountable.\nAn open society is a place where improvements\nare often reached through noisy, painful and chaotic\nprocesses. Montesquieu wrote a long time ago that if\neveryone agrees with the Government and everyone\nagrees with one another, that is not a country; that is a\ncemetery.\nI speak from personal experience. My own country\nconfronted democracy\u2019s challenges once again this past\nweek when evidence emerged of abuses in our prison\nsystem. The facts were sickening, and our responsibility\nwas clear. Our reaction was swift, and we did what\ndemocracies must do. We identified those responsible,\nand they were all arrested. Two Government Ministers\nhave resigned, and we put in charge of the prison system\nits fiercest critic: the Georgian human rights defender,\nGeorgia\u2019s ombudsman. That is how democracies learn;\nthat is how we improve.\nThat is how my own Government has overcome\npast errors and challenges to emerge stronger, more\neffective and ever more committed to building and\ninstitutionalizing an open society.\nIt is clear that there are no shortcuts to accountability,\nand no fast-track lines to freedom. Building and\nmaintaining an open society entails a painful learning\nprocess and significant risk-taking. But the conclusion\nwe must draw in this respect, from Georgia to the\nevents in Myanmar, is this: such risks are worth taking.\nI am speaking to the Assembly on the eve of crucial\nelections in my country. I realize clearly the magnitude of the challenges that face this body and this troubled\nworld, from the menace of nuclear proliferation to\nglobal warming and poverty. But today I ask for\nthe Assembly\u2019s attention with respect to the events\nunfolding in Georgia, because I believe that they are\npart of the broader, global question facing us today:\nwhether the quest for democracy and freedom can and\nwill endure.\nI came here to say that Georgia will remain an open\nsociety. That is the choice of our citizens, and there is\nno alternative to this. On 1 October, my nation will\nvote in parliamentary elections. We look forward to\nthat day and to the opportunity to renew and strengthen\nthe fundamental social contract that allows citizens to\nfreely judge and choose their leaders.\nGeorgia has conducted several elections in recent\nyears, all of which were monitored by international\nobservers and all of which were free and fair. We live in\na world in which yesterday\u2019s accomplishments are never\nenough, and I have made a commitment to the effect\nthat this year\u2019s vote will be even more free and fair\nthan the previous ones. We have taken numerous steps\nto pursue that goal. We have increased public funding\nand given free airtime on all national channels for ads\nfrom all political parties, in addition to whatever they\ncan buy with their own money. We have proposed to all\nnational television channels a \u201cmust carry/must offer\u201d\nrequirement, to ensure that all private cable networks,\nlarge and small, broadcast all news-based television,\nand they have accepted that proposal.\nWe have welcomed the first televised debate in our\ncountry\u2019s history between candidates for Prime Minister\nand heads of candidate lists. We have initiated a code\nof conduct to eradicate political intimidation, the use\nof administrative resources, vote-buying, campaign-\nrelated violence and hate speech in any shape or form,\nwhich for so many years was used to promote hatred\nagainst ethnic and religious minorities.\nRegrettably, not all actors in the Georgian political\narena share those principles, and some are purposefully\nworking to undermine the legitimacy of Georgia\u2019s\ndemocratic institutions \u2014 how they are perceived at\nhome and by the international community.\nOur response to deliberate attempts to short-\ncircuit our democracy is straightforward: democratic,\ntransparent and rule-of-law-based processes will not\nbe compromised. This is not only my demand; it is the\ndemand of the people of Georgia.\n\nGeorgia is a young democracy, and we know the\nvalue that comes from partnerships and engagement\nwith the international community. As in the past,\nwe have once again opened our doors and invited\ncredible international election monitors to visit our\ncountry, including the Organization for Security and\nCooperation in Europe, the European Parliament, the\nNATO Parliamentary Assembly, the United States\nCongress and respected international non-governmental\norganizations.\nTo date, the interim reports of almost every election\nobservation mission have consistently underscored that\nthese are the most competitive elections in Georgia\u2019s\nhistory. On 1 October, notwithstanding significant\nattempts to undermine that dynamic, the Georgian\npeople will make their decision. I am confident that\nGeorgian democracy will prevail and reject those who\nseek to close Georgia\u2019s doors.\nGeorgian democracy will prevail if, and only if,\nGeorgian elections remain a Georgian process. Today,\nin this forum, I am obliged to draw the Assembly\u2019s\nattention to externally generated security threats to\nmy country. The European Union monitoring mission\nhas just announced that Russian forces are currently\nundertaking a massive, illegal military buildup,\noccupying territory inside Georgia, on the former\nterritory of South Ossetia, which is within Georgia\u2019s\ninternationally recognized borders.\nEven as we speak, they are bringing offensive\nweapons and troops inside our internationally\nrecognized borders.\nThe Russian military has made the extraordinary\ndecision to hold large-scale military exercises in the\nNorth and the South Caucasus on the eve and around\nthe time of our elections. One cannot imagine an\napproach more provocative and irresponsible than\nthat of mobilizing military forces during this crucial\nmoment of any nation\u2019s democratic life.\nThere has been involvement by Russia for months:\nfirst, billions of dollars in Russian money came into the\nGeorgian election campaign. Lots of other resources\nwere allocated, and now Russian troops are trying to be\nsome kind of background players in this process. That\nis why I call today on all our allies and friends, and all\nmembers of goodwill in the international community,\nnot to ignore or dismiss this worrisome development.\n\nI would like to use this opportunity to ask the world\nto pay attention during the next few days, to speak in\na unified voice against these threats, in support of our\nsovereignty and democratic institutions.\nIn short, the vigilance and engagement of Member\nStates is required to ensure that history does not repeat\nitself and that 2012 does not become a repeat of 2008, or\nespecially of 1921, when Russia ended our independence\nand we became a place that was dominated by violence\nand oppression for 70-plus years.\nWe should look at what has happened in recent\nyears. We had a massive-scale invasion by Russia,\nthe successor to the Soviet Union, in 2008. We are a\ncountry of just 4.7 million people \u2014 less than 5 million\npeople \u2014 and that country is 100 times larger, and\nwell armed. If we look at history, we see that during\nthe twentieth century it invaded many countries. The\nSoviet Union invaded Baltic countries; it invaded large\nparts of Poland and ended its independence.\nIn 1956 the Soviet Union invaded Hungary, killed\nits President and ended its independence. In 1968 it\ninvaded Czechoslovakia, deposed its Government and\nended its independence. In 1979 it invaded a much\nbigger country than Georgia, Afghanistan, killed its\nPresident within one hour and ended its independence.\nIn 2008 it invaded our country, a smaller country than\nany of those I have mentioned, and occupied part of its\nterritory.\nHowever, none of the strategic goals of the Russian\ninvasion was achieved. They had three explicit goals in\ninvading Georgia. The first was to depose the Georgian\nGovernment, end Georgian democracy and physically\ndestroy Georgia\u2019s leadership. Those are not my words\nor a conspiracy theory. That is what they themselves\novertly stated in every open and closed international\nforum. The second goal was to shut off the energy supply\nfor different regions of the world and to monopolize the\nenergy supply in the part of the world where Russia\nlies. That totally failed. Georgia is developing and its\nenergy corridor is developing. The third goal was to\nstop the enlargment of NATO and to halt any kind of\ninclusion of the region into international organizations.\nRussia also failed at that goal.\nWe often say that after the Russians failed to\nphysically destroy the Georgian leadership, failed to\nsucceed in any of the purposes of their invasion and\nbasically were forced to stay where they are, within\noccupied territories \u2014 in what most of the world and most international organizations call illegally\noccupied territories, meaning that they will have to\nwithdraw \u2014 now they are trying to undermine us\nbecause they have a strong sense of unfinished business.\nIt is not just the fate of a small country of less\nthan 5 million people that is being played out in this\nscenario. The fate of the whole post-Soviet space is\nbeing played out, affecting 400 to 500 million people.\nBecause Russia failed to destroy Georgian democracy\nin 2008, countries in Central Asia such as Ukraine and\nBelarus, people in the Republic of Moldova and Eastern\nEurope, all think that freedom is the right choice after\nall and that even the smallest free country cannot be\nundermined and destroyed if it stands strong and united\nand if the international community is there to help. That\nsets a very bad example from the Russian point of view.\nOn the other hand, because of Georgia\u2019s reforms\nand because of our openness to the great nation of\nRussia, we introduced visa-free travel for tourists from\nRussia. One million tourists will travel to Georgia\nfrom Russia this year and they will take back 1 million\nstories of successful development, of a country with\nnew hospitals, with new cities, with sharply reduced\npoverty \u2014 a country moving towards universal health\ncoverage and that has enjoyed double-digit growth, and\nis this year enjoying 8 per cent growth. It is a country\nthat, even without oil and gas, is looking much better\nthan most of the Russian region. Indeed, Russia\u2019s then-\nPresident Medvedev had to acknowledge twice in one\nweek, in an open forum of journalists and his own\nparliament, that Georgian reforms were so successful\nthat Russia had no choice but to study and copy them,\neven if they hate the Georgian leadership.\nThat is the ideological issue. That is why they want\nus out. That is why they want Georgia off the map. It is\nbecause if Georgia survives and if Georgia continues,\nit sets a bad example for all the others, including the\nRussian people themselves, from the point of view of\nthe present Russian Government. The prison scandal\nwe had recently involved things that happen almost\nevery day in Russia, and are reported on social media\nin Russia as frequently, and no one there gives a damn\nabout it. In the first case that came up in Georgia, two\nministers and scores of others were arrested, which also\nsets a bad example in the eyes of people who want to\nsuppress freedom. That is why it is so important that\nGeorgian democracy is back and safe. It means that the\nwhole post-Soviet space, our whole part of the world,\nwill move in the right direction.\n\nI call on the world to pay attention and send the\nright signals. I make the call knowing what our\nresponsibilities are. In the face of the threats confronting\nus, our commitment to democracy and transparency is\nmore important than ever. We remember the words of\nthe American founding father who said that whoever\nsacrifices his freedom for security deserves neither.\nThat is not just our response; it is the best response. Our\ntransformation and the hostility it has generated among\nthose who feel threatened by freedom have continued to\nmake Georgia a test case for the entire region. What is at\nstake in Georgia today is the very idea that democracy\ncan thrive in our part of the world.\nOur common legacy from the dark time of the Soviet\nUnion is now almost gone from Georgia. Organized\ncrime \u2014 and Georgia was a hotbed of organized\ncrime \u2014 is now almost gone from Georgia. Most of\nthat legacy has migrated to other countries, including\nRussia. Corruption, coercion, intimidation, oppression,\ncynicism and despair: we condemn that way of life, that\nway of Government and of being governed. No, we can,\nwe should and we will overcome that legacy. We are\ndoing it in Georgia and it can be done everywhere else.\nWill we face strong opposition? Yes. And we are\nwell placed to say that, since our country is regularly\nthreatened with destruction and annihilation, for the\nvery reason that we choose another path \u2014 the path of\nfreedom, the path of transparency and accountability,\nthe path of meritocracy and an open society \u2014 we\nknow how difficult it is to overcome those forces. But\nwe know we can.\nSovietism and post-Sovietism is not a fate.\nOrganized crime and violence is not a fate. Slavery\nis not a fate. Limited sovereignty as Brezhnev once\ndefined it and Putin reshaped it is not a fate. Every\ncountry represented here is a free nation. We are all\nfree peoples, made up of free individuals, and our\nfuture depends on us, on what we want and what we do.\nThere is nothing easy about saying this, and I do\nnot say it lightly. The Georgian people know the price\nof freedom and still they think their freedom is worth\nit, because with freedom comes development and\nhappiness, true stability and true peace. Our region\nwill one day become a zone where free people interact\npeacefully, where respect will replace contempt.\nAll the peoples of Central Asia and Eastern Europe,\nUkraine, the Republic of Moldova and Russia, the\nSouth Caucasus and North Caucasus, should hold hands together and shout down the voices of the past. Powerful\nvoices continue to send the message that democracy,\ntransparency and accountability are not possible. They\nsay that freedom, meritocracy and respect for human\nrights are fundamentally alien. Georgia has proven them\nwrong. Our survival story has proven them wrong, just\nas many here today have in the past. As we have been\nlearning from many people in the Hall, our efforts have\nshown that corruption, intolerance, intimidation, fear\nand violence are neither cultural nor inevitable.\nAdvanced democracy is a sign of a mature society.\nIt is not easy to govern. Dissent, pluralism and vibrant\ndebate, which are threats to others, are strengths to us.\nOur view is clear. One cannot gain enduring stability\nat the expense of liberty, and one cannot ensure lasting\nprosperity by sacrificing individual rights. Those short\ncuts never succeed in the long run.\nIn every culture, in every society, in every corner\nof the world, people will ultimately demand the right\nto choose their own future. Only Governments that\nmeet that demand will achieve true stability. The\nfundamental contract is not always without difficulties.\nGovernments that commit themselves to the process\nmust be prepared for turbulence and disagreement.\nWhat is difficult for elected leaders is often beneficial\nfor citizens; what is challenging for ruling parties is\noften necessary for the State. In pursuing the goals of\nfreedom and accountability, our common efforts must\nbe governed by the rule of law and a commitment to\nrespect these fundamental principles. Violence and\nintimidation can never be legitimized, and a minority\ncan never forcibly impose its views on the will of the\nmajority. Guns, money, threats, hatred, blackmail and\nfear cannot be allowed to hijack the process.\nAt the same time, we recognize the potential threat\nof a majority trampling the rights and liberties of a\nminority. We respond to that threat by protecting the\nright to dissent, we respond by promoting pluralism,\nwe respond by allowing every voice to be heard. And\nwe respond by the law. I can testify to how difficult the\nprocess is, but I can also state unequivocally that no\nlasting alternative exists.\nI want finally to share with the Assembly my\nhope and my trust. A few days from now, Georgians\nfrom all social, religious and ethnic backgrounds will\ncollectively decide their future in an unoccupied part\nof our territory. They will express diverse opinions and\nwishes, and a new future for our nation will emerge.\n\nOpenness will be further enshrined. Transparency will\nbe strengthened, and public accountability confirmed.\nThe main thing that will be confirmed is that Georgia\nwill not go back. It will not be dragged back under\nany pressure, under any dirty money from the North,\nunder any threat of military exercise or direct military\ninvasion or mass-scale disturbances or the emergence of\nsome kind of militias emerge, as some have threatened.\nIt is not going to work.\nAccording to the European Union, we are the safest\ncountry and the least corrupt country in Europe with\nstrong Government institutions that cannot be bribed\nand cannot be undermined. By constantly renewing the\nsocial contract, which is at the heart of every democratic\nnation, we will ensure that democratic principles and\npractices are with us for good.\nI trust the Georgian people. I trust the international\ncommunity and I trust that they will not allow others\nto destroy the will of my people or destroy my small\nnation\u2019s choice. I stated earlier that democracy is\na difficult, sometimes noisy system. It presents\nchallenges to those in and outside Government, and it\nforces leaders to place their trust in society. Personally,\nI see no credible alternative, and I saw no better reason\nto take risks. Fear is the paramount weapon of autocrats,\nwhile trust is a definition of democrats.\nLet us all trust our citizens, even if autocratic\nforces much bigger than us are threatening us. The\nbest defence for my country is openness, democracy,\ntransparency and the work of institutions against all\nof those forces, against all the international mafias\nand against social and international pressures that\ncontravene international law. Let us defend the\ninstitutions that support, strengthen and preserve our\nchoice to be open and free.\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAllow me to convey to Mr. Jeremi\u0107 our warmest\ncongratulations on his election as President of the\nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-seventh session and to\nonce again extend to him our fullest cooperation. We\nwould also like to convey our gratitude to Mr. Nassir\nAbdulaziz Al-Nasser for his significant work during\nthe previous session. We also congratulate Secretary-\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon on his leadership at a time\nmarked by the immense scale of the challenges that we\nface.\nChile\u2019s foreign policy is based on principles such\nas the defence of democracy, respect for human rights and the peaceful settlement of disputes. Among others,\nthose principles form part of the Charter of the United\nNations. Their observance provides for coexistence\namong States at the international and national levels,\nand thus preserves, for nations and their peoples,\nthe most precious asset of national societies and the\ninternational community, namely, peace.\nPeace is the basic value at the root of this body.\nHowever, despite the efforts made, serious problems\npersist internationally, as well as nationally in some\nMember States. We have witnessed the Arab Spring,\nwhich, by channelling the legitimate expression\nof its peoples for greater freedom, democracy and\nrespect for human rights, resulted in some cases,\nwithout prejudice to the difficulties that remain to be\novercome, in processes that have led to democratic\nchanges. Regrettably, in other cases, it has given rise to\nrepression and violence.\nThe repression of their people by dictatorial\nregimes and the inability to peacefully forge democratic\ntransition processes are the result of a mistaken way of\nengaging in and understanding politics. Confrontation\nhas prevailed over tolerance, violence over dialogue and\nconflict over understanding, as we see now happening\nin Syria.\nFrom this rostrum, we reiterate the call to all\nparties, in particular the Government of that country,\nfor an immediate end to the violence, respect for\nhuman rights and the establishment of the foundations\nfor a dialogue that can lead to a political solution of\nthe current crisis, in which justice and the rule of\nlaw prevail. The international community bears the\nresponsibility to support that process, while respecting\nthe principles of non-intervention, territorial integrity\nand, above all, human life.\nWe must condemn the intolerance that shows a lack\nof respect for different cultures and beliefs and has\ngiven rise to outbreaks of violence. Nothing justifies\nthe criminal act committed in Libya against United\nStates diplomats. We vigorously condemn that event\nand any other act of violence, which, in that particular\ncase, negates the essence of the diplomatic function,\nwhich this forum must specifically seek to defend with\nthe utmost resolve and determination.\nIn addition, we have resolutely supported all\ninternational efforts towards a just, legitimate and\nlasting solution of the problem between Palestine\nand Israel. We recognize the Palestinian State \u2014 a country that we hope very shortly to welcome to the\nOrganization. We strongly believe that the Palestinian\npeople have the right to a free, sovereign and democratic\nState. However, we also note that the State of Israel has\nthe right to recognized, safe and respected borders.\nOnly in that way will Palestinians and Israelis be able\nto coexist and move forward in peace and harmony.\nThe leaders of the States members of the Assembly\nhave the moral obligation and enormous responsibility\nof seeking to harmonize interests in order for reason\nto prevail. The United Nations is the sole international\nforum with the necessary capacity to address the\nmaintenance of peace, security, the protection of human\nrights and international development cooperation. It is\ntherefore our responsibility to strive to find the means\nfor consensus to enable us to cooperate in resolving\ncurrent conflicts, averting future ones, preserving\npeace and launching a cycle of development for the\nbenefit of our peoples.\nChile, through a sustained effort, has enjoyed more\nthan 100 years of peaceful international coexistence\non the basis of understanding and dialogue, as well\nas legally and politically respected border agreements\nand treaties, as borne out by our peaceful vocation.\nNearly 40 years ago, however, my country experienced\na crisis that shattered its institutional order and divided\nour society, leading to a confrontation with tragic\nconsequences. Thanks to a united effort, an exemplary\npeaceful transition was possible. Despite the deep\ndivisions that were a hallmark of that time, we were\nable to move forward in building a solid foundation\nowing to the willingness to reach an understanding that\nprevailed among political forces that previously held\nirreconcilable positions.\nMoreover, despite its differences, Latin America\nhas learned to live in diversity and has progressed more\nthan other regions in the past decade. In our region,\nvarious kinds of Governments that propose different\npolitical and development models coexist. However,\nthrough dialogue, understanding and reason, we have\nreached consensus on establishing regional integration\nmechanisms that have enabled us to move forward\nwith common goals. That policy, based on respect\nfor differences and the pursuit of mutually beneficial\nintegration, is at the heart of our foreign policy.\nJust as mutual respect and human understanding are\nground rules of our national policy to achieve freedom,\nprogress and social justice, the same should occur in the international political arena. This is the best forum\nfor the leaders of nations to debate ideas, free from\nabsolute, exclusive or discriminatory positions, which\ninevitably lead to confrontation. Many of the problems\nfacing us are due to the fact that the virtue of dialogue,\nwhich is the only means for our mutual understanding\nand civilized coexistence, is increasingly undermined.\nHowever, countries alone cannot always find\nthe basis for understanding in order to achieve the\npolitical stability that makes solid institution-building\nand economic and social development possible. The\ninternational community also has a responsibility.\nWe believe that it is crucial not only to help countries\nemerge from crisis situations, but also to support them\nin peacebuilding and development in a comprehensive\nway. That means support for the rebuilding of political\ninstitutions and for internal reconciliation processes and\nsocial and economic development, which are tasks for\nwhich the Peacebuilding Commission was established.\nWe strongly support its work.\nIn that context, with regard to the United Nations\nStabilization Mission in Haiti, we believe that the\nrequired modifications to its composition and size\nmust be offset by strengthening the presence of the\ndevelopment component of the United Nations system\nthrough its agencies, funds and programmes. That\nis fundamental to helping the reconstruction and\ndevelopment of Haiti.\nIn that spirit of cooperation in peacebuilding,\nwe also welcome with satisfaction, a sense of\nresponsibility and enthusiasm the invitation of the\nColombian Government to assist in the negotiations\nprocess launched to put an end to the internal conflict\nthat has affected that brother country for more than 50\nyears, causing so much suffering. We commend the\nwillingness and readiness of the parties and the courage\nof the Government of Colombia, which, building on the\ncircumstances brought about through its efforts and\npatience in recent years, took the decision to initiate\na peace process that, we trust, will end successfully to\nthe benefit of all Colombians.\n\nWe have conveyed our vision of what we believe\nto be the most profound purpose of politics. On this\noccasion, we would also like to address the issue\nof Security Council reform. In order to strengthen\nits capacities and legitimacy, a more representative\n\nand democratic organ that is in line with the new\ninternational reality should be formed. Chile reiterates\nits support for a Security Council reform that envisages\nthe expansion of its membership in the permanent and\nnon-permanent categories, thus ensuring due regional\nrepresentation and enhanced transparency of its\nworking methods.\nWe also wish to reiterate our opposition to the veto\npower. However, given its existence, Chile supports the\ncall for the veto not to be used in situations of crimes\nagainst humanity, war crimes, genocide or ethnic\ncleansing. The countries with the veto power have a\ngreat responsibility and the obligation to use it with\nmoderation and transparency in seeking to resolve\ncrises, putting aside national or ideological positions\nthat hamper the system and render it ineffective.\nIn that context, our commitment to the main themes\non the international peace and security agenda has led\nus to submit our candidature for Security Council for\nthe period of 2014-2015. As part of that effort, we wish\nto help strengthen the effectiveness of the multilateral\nsystem based on democratic values and principles,\nnamely, equality and individual freedoms and solidarity,\nwhich are substantial aspects of our foreign policy. We\nalso wish to contribute to that from the perspective of\nLatin America and the Caribbean.\nDemocracy demands respect for, and the promotion\nof, human rights, which requires full implementation\nof the rule of law. Chile is firmly committed to that.\nOur own experience regarding a shattered democracy,\nwith tragic consequences for the rights of individuals,\nwhich I have already mentioned, underscores for us\nthe importance of developing public policies. It also\nhighlights the need to implement the instruments\nmade available to us by the international system, with\nparticular emphasis on those that support the most\nvulnerable, namely, children, women, young people,\nindigenous peoples, people with disabilities and the\nelderly. In that regard, we support strengthening the\nfunctioning of the human rights treaty body system\nand the work undertaken by the United Nations High\nCommissioner for Human Rights.\nIn addition to the issue of peace, another acute\nproblem for nations today is the international financial\ncrisis. It has wrought havoc on markets, trade, finance,\ninvestment and, worse still, employment. As in the case\nof politics, where confrontation and the lack of dialogue\nimpede solutions and compromises, in economics the improper practices of excessive spending, a lack of\nfiscal tightening and the absence of adequate regulatory\nframeworks triggered the crisis that currently affects us\nand whose end is not yet in sight.\nThe experience of our country and our region has\ntaught us harshly in recent decades that progress and\ntrue development require measures that are not populist\nor short term. Governments must act responsibly and\ncontrol public spending without turning to that as\nan easy solution to artificially promote an economic\nboom. The current crisis blatantly shows the painful\nconsequences of such policies. A rigorous fiscal policy\nand the establishment of stabilization funds, like some\ncountries have created, such as Norway on the basis\nof oil and Chile on the basis of copper, are examples\nof efficient mechanisms for economic stability and\nbalancing global cycles.\nSimilarly, in seeking solutions to the crisis, we\nmust avoid the temptation to resort to artificial and\nshort-term measures. There are voices clamouring\nfor the imposition of protectionist practices to boost\nthe economy. Such practices may benefit a specific\neconomic sector in the short term. However, they have a\nf leeting effect. Let us not fool ourselves. Protectionism\nprotects inefficient industries and provides citizens with\npoor quality and more expensive products. Worse still,\nit undermines productivity, eliminates competition and\nentrepreneurship and hampers real development.\nOur experience shows us that we must take the\nopposite path, namely, greater openness and more free\ntrade. Threats to democracy are thereby overcome\nthrough greater democracy. Economic growth is boosted\nby greater openness to markets and fewer obstacles to\nglobal trade. Years ago, our country launched trade\nliberalization by, first, unilaterally reducing its tariffs\nand, subsequently, through free trade agreements\nthat today extend to more than 60 countries and that\nrepresent more than 85 per cent of world gross domestic\nproduct. Chile has the most free trade agreements and\nhas the world\u2019s eighth-lowest tariffs, at less than 1 per\ncent on average.\nDespite external difficulties, that policy has enabled\nus to increase our growth by 6 per cent in the past two\nyears and to achieve the region\u2019s highest per capita\nincome. In turn, it has made it possible to reduce the\nlevel of unemployment, poverty and extreme poverty\nby creating new jobs and social protection programmes.  Real and effective integration goes beyond trade.\nWe are also pursuing shared projects with other nations,\nsuch as the recent Pacific Alliance initiative, launched\ntogether with Peru, Mexico and Colombia. It focuses on\nthe integration not only of goods and services, but also\nthe free movement of people and capital, thus sharing\nthe full potential of our economies. Such initiatives\nwith Pacific Rim countries are not new. In 1994,\nwe were already part of the Asia-Pacific Economic\nCooperation, seeking to accelerate trade liberalization\nin a broad region that unites the largest economies on\nboth sides of that ocean. Subsequently, in 2005, along\nwith Singapore, New Zealand and Brunei Darussalam,\nwe launched a process to forge an ambitious free\ntrade agreement. Today, that project, known as the\nTrans-Pacific Partnership, aspires to create the largest\nglobal free trade area with the accession of new\nmembers, including the United States.\nTwo years ago, only days after the Government\nthat I represent assumed its duties, a natural disaster of\nglobal proportions, namely, the fifth-largest earthquake\nregistered in the world since such disasters were\nrecorded, caused destruction and death in our country.\nChile recovered thanks to the solidarity and unity of\nits people and as a result of the generous assistance of\nfriendly nations and organizations. Recently, President\nSebastian Pi\u00f1era Eche\u00f1ique affirmed the announcement\nthat he made at that time, pointing out that, by the end\nof his term in office, all material damage would be\nfully rebuilt.\nIn recent years, we have seen an increase in the\nnumber of natural disasters \u2014 f loods, tornados,\ntyphoons, earthquakes and mudslides. There is no place\non the planet that is not either suffering or has suffered\nfrom a natural disaster. No country has the capacity\nto deal with disasters of that scale alone. There is\ntherefore a need for the assistance and solidarity among\nnations that we saw not only during the earthquake in\n2010, but also at the time of the collapse of the San\nJos\u00e9 mine, which affected 33 miners. The lives of\nthose miners were saved thanks to their courage, to the\ndetermination of the Government of Chile to rescue\nthem and to international cooperation.\nIn Chile, we have strengthened disaster\npreparedness and early-warning systems and have\nenhanced the national civil protection agency in\norder to ensure greater coordination at the national,\nregional and local levels. However, the occurrence\nof some of those natural phenomena is also linked to environmental protection. Preserving the environment\nis another topic that merits the attention of the\ninternational community and means that we should act\nresponsibly to safeguard for future generations a clean\nenvironment and sustainable development that respects\nnature. The recommendations of the United Nations\nConference on Sustainable Development, namely,\nsustainable development goals, financing mechanisms\nand a mechanism to transfer and distribute clean energy,\nshould now be implemented.\nChile assumed the position of the first pro tempore\npresidency of the Community of Latin American and\nCaribbean States (CELAC) with great satisfaction. The\n33 member States of Latin America and the Caribbean\nagreed the Community\u2019s guiding principles and\npurposes, including the promotion and protection of\ndemocracy and human rights, political coordination,\nintegration, the fight against poverty and inequality\nand stronger global engagement. Among the issues\nof interest to CELAC that I would like to underscore\nin this forum is support for the legitimate claims of\nthe Argentine Republic in the dispute for sovereignty\nover the Malvinas Islands, South Georgia Islands and\nSouth Sandwich Islands and the surrounding maritime\nareas. We call for a resumption of negotiations with the\nUnited Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland\nin order to find a peaceful and lasting solution to that\ndispute. CELAC also wishes to underscore the need to\nput an end to the economic blockade imposed by the\nUnited States of America against Cuba. The General\nAssembly has adopted important resolutions on both\nmatters.\nWe live in a world of great opportunities, but also\nsignificant challenges and global threats that require the\ncoordinated action of the international community in\norder to ensure an appropriate response. Only through\neffective, efficient and inclusive multilateralism will\nwe find the best way to respond to those great global\nchallenges.\nThe United Nations system has the capacity to\nexercise leadership in pursuing international peace and\nsecurity, in promoting sustainable development and\ncooperation and in protecting and promoting human\nrights. Also, in seeking to resolve the global economic\ncrisis, in environmental protection and in the rapid\ninternational response to prevent and provide assistance\nin the case of natural disasters, we, as Member States,\nmust demonstrate the political will to make that capacity a reality and thus ensure that the politically\ncorrect action is also morally correct.\nThe President of Bolivia mentioned, in terms that do\nnot comply with the norms of good coexistence among\nnations, that country\u2019s maritime claim (see A/67/PV.11).\nAlong with the formal note of reply that was submitted\nto the President of the General Assembly, in addressing\nthis debate I feel obliged to categorically reject the\nposition, affirmation and charges made against my\ncountry. It is timely to reiterate to the Assembly that\nthere are no outstanding border issues between our\nStates. Those matters are clearly set out in the 1904\nTreaty of Peace and Friendship, and are fully respected.\nChile has fully met its obligations under that\nTreaty, allowing the most extensive free transit through\nits territory by means of high-quality infrastructure,\nas acknowledged by the Bolivians themselves. Bolivia\nhas no right to claim access to the sea. The respect of\nborder agreements between neighbouring countries is\none of the cornerstones for coexistence among States\nand is the guarantor of international peace, as prevails\nbetween our countries.\nBefore this Organization, Chile reaffirms that\nthe Constitution of the Plurinational State of Bolivia,\nadopted in 2009, introduced provisions that contravene\nthe framework of international law, which governs the\npeaceful coexistence among nations. Those provisions\nare therefore not enforceable with regard to our country.\nAs declared by a committee of lawyers appointed by\nthe League of Nations in 1921 and as acknowledged\nat the last session of the General Assembly of the\nOrganization of American States, held in the Bolivian\ncity of Cochabamba, this is strictly a bilateral matter.\nChile has continued to convey to Bolivia its readiness\nfor brotherly dialogue, based on full respect for the\ntreaties in force, which provide significant benefits for\nboth peoples. It is in the hands of Bolivia to accept that\ninvitation."

In all settings and all circumstances, including\nwith respect to States such as Tonga, the rule of law is a core pillar and a fundamental component of the\nnational fabric.\nTongans take great pride in the enduring qualities of\nthe 1875 Constitution and the early legal codes of 1839\nand 1850 as instruments of visionary nation-building\nand, with reform over time, lasting peace and stability.\nThey also laid the foundation for setting Tonga on a\nfirm footing in the context of international relations\nwith the global powers of the time, and set us on a path\nthat ultimately has led to membership in the global body\nof our time, the United Nations. Tonga was therefore\npleased to join other Member States in adopting the\nDeclaration of the High-level Meeting (resolution 67/1).\nTo expand and improve the role and impact of the\nrule of law at the national, regional and international\nlevels requires the expertise and technical assistance\navailable from the United Nations system, the relevant\nintergovernmental agencies and interested development\npartners, so as to be coordinated, continuous and\ncoherent.\nThis week\u2019s outcome is a positive development for\nsmall jurisdictions such as Tonga in strengthening their\ncapacity to address the political, social, economic and\nenvironmental challenges of our time.\nBuilding upon the Secretary-General\u2019s historic\nattendance at last year\u2019s meeting of the Pacific Islands\nForum (PIF), a further meeting took place this week,\nfor the first time, on the margins of this year\u2019s general\ndebate. The important outcome of the meeting provides\na stronger and regular basis for high-level interaction,\nand the meeting allowed for an exchange of views\non issues of mutual import and concern between PIF\nleaders and the Secretary-General.\nThis year\u2019s PIF meeting was hosted by the Cook\nIslands, and our communiqu\u00e9 gives proper focus to\nissues important to Tonga and the region, including\nsustainable development, climate change, the oceans,\nrenewable energy and gender equality.\nTonga, like other small island developing States,\nreturned to Rio de Janeiro in June to the United Nations\nConference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20) to\nchart a new global course for sustainable development.\nFor many, if not all, small island developing States,\nthat return amounted to a reaffirmation of the special\nand particular vulnerabilities, recognized in 1992, that\nmake States such as Tonga unique.\n\nWith other small island developing States, we are\nlooking to advance, during this session of the General\nAssembly, the agreement reached in Rio on the holding\nin 2014 of a Third International Conference for the\nSustainable Development of Small Island Developing\nStates. That Conference should be hosted in the Pacific\nregion.\nAgainst the background of the recent Rio+20 and the\nongoing efforts to achieve the Millennium Development\nGoals (MDGs), such a Conference would represent an\nearly but timely moment for small island developing\nStates to take stock of implemented outcomes. In order\nto be successful, the Conference will require the strong\nand active participation of all small island developing\nStates and a strong, responsive and cohesive United\nNations system attuned to the issues facing them.\nWorking towards such a Conference will provide\na boost to ongoing national initiatives such as our\nTonga strategic development framework and its priority\nobjectives for 2011 to 2014.\nTonga joined other States members of the Alliance\nof Small Island States yesterday, under the chairmanship\nof Nauru, in adopting a declaration focused on the\ncontinuing serious threat posed by climate change to\nthe territorial integrity, viability and survival of all\nsmall island States.\nThere is an urgent need to continue to address\nthe security implications of climate change, including\nthe impact on territorial integrity, the frequency and\nseverity of climate-related disasters, the threat to water\nand food security, and the forced displacement of\npeople.\nOur challenge to the international community,\nand to developed countries in particular, is to take the\nbold measures necessary to reduce emissions of all\ngreenhouse gases to levels that will ensure a viable and\nmeaningful future for small island developing States\nsuch as Tonga. To safeguard the survival of the smallest\nand most vulnerable States among us is to safeguard\na viable future for all States. A rising tide may lift all\nboats, but it will drown us all.\nThe coming meeting of the United Nations\nFramework Convention on Climate Change in Qatar must\nadvance the efforts of last year\u2019s Durban Conference to\nbridge differences over key issues, such as those related\nto the future of the Kyoto Protocol, climate finance,\nclosing the pre-2020 mitigation ambition gap and constructively addressing loss and damage associated\nwith the impact of climate change, while bearing in\nmind the cost of adaptation in developing countries,\nsuch as Tonga.\nThis year\u2019s theme of the Pacific Islands Forum was\n\u201cLarge ocean island States \u2014 the Pacific challenge\u201d. It\nbuilt upon the positive outcomes of Rio+20 with regard\nto the conservation and sustainable use of the oceans\nand their marine environment, or what we call the\nblue economy. Like other Pacific neighbours, Tonga\u2019s\nconnection to its oceanic environment has a strong\nhistorical dimension.\nThe ocean and its resources are more than an\nancient pathway to a maritime and seafaring past among\ndisparate islands. They potentially now represent a\nliquid highway to a more sustainable future for Pacific\npeoples. An eminent Tongan scholar, the late Mr. Epeli\nHau\u2019ofa, said:\n\u201cWe should not be defined by the smallness of our\nislands but by the greatness of our oceans. We are\nthe sea. We are the ocean. Oceania is us.\u201d\nAs custodians of the ocean and its living and\nnon-living resources, we have long appreciated that\nthe health of the oceans is critical to maintaining a\nstaple source of sustenance and livelihood for island\ncommunities.\nWe welcome the focus of Rio+20 on sustainable\nfisheries and national capacity development, the\nimportance of access and the role of small-scale\nand artisanal fisheries and women, and the need for\nconcerted action to address the vulnerability of coral\nreefs and mangroves.\nAs a party to the United Nations Convention on the\nLaw of the Sea, Tonga is actively seeking to implement\nits obligations under the Convention, including\nthrough the timely negotiation of maritime boundary\ndelimitation agreements with neighbouring States;\neffective participation in the work of the International\nSeabed Authority and the Commission on the Limits\nof the Continental Shelf; implementation of related\nagreements, such as the 1995 Fish Stocks Agreement;\nand consideration of the potential development of\nfurther legal instruments, within the Convention\u2019s\nframework, to reflect the new realities.\nDuring this International Year of Sustainable\nEnergy for All, we welcome the Secretary-General\u2019s\nhigh-level event this week, which was dedicated in part to addressing the continued development of renewable\nenergy sources. With like-minded members of the\nAlliance of Small Island States, Tonga will build on the\nBarbados Declaration on Achieving Sustainable Energy\nfor All in Small Island Developing States and on Rio+20\nto implement its voluntary commitment to reducing its\ngreenhouse-gas emissions and to improving energy\nsecurity through a 50 per cent renewable energy mix\nby 2020.\nWith the requisite financial resources, ongoing\ncapacity-building, appropriate technology transfers\nand genuine partnership with dedicated development\npartners, such as New Zealand, Italy, Japan and the\nUnited Arab Emirates, national initiatives, like the\nTonga Energy Road Map, will continue to develop and\nprovide real benefit for Tongans. We are committed to a\nstrong advocacy role on the Council of the International\nRenewable Energy Agency and to the critical work\nthat it does in pursuing a more secure and sustainable\nenergy path.\nTonga joined the other States members of the\nPacific Islands Forum in adopting the Pacific Leaders\nGender Equality Declaration as an important part of\nthe Pacific Islands Forum communiqu\u00e9 this year. It\nestablishes a valuable political platform for investing in\nthe empowerment and promotion of women and young\ngirls as a vital part of Tongan society and the region\u2019s\nfuture.\nWe thank Australia for its investment in the Pacific\nWomen Shaping Pacific Development initiative. The\nsteps taken to promote and protect the interests of Tongan\nwomen and gender equality include the extension of paid\nmaternity leave, within the public service, from one to\nthree months; Government approval of a draft law on\nviolence against women and children, which is to be\ntabled during the parliamentary session; Government\napproval of holding nationwide consultations towards\nconsensus on ratification of the Convention on the\nElimination of All Forms of Discrimination against\nWomen; the launch of a national study on domestic\nviolence against women; and, most recently, last week\u2019s\nlaunch of a social welfare scheme for the elderly, that is,\nthose over 75 years of age.\nWithout genuine improvement in gender equality,\nMember States will continue to struggle to achieve real\nprogress towards meeting their commitments under the\nMDGs and beyond.\n\nIn closing, on behalf of His Majesty King Tupou VI,\nQueen Nanasipau\u2019u, the royal household, the Government\nand the people of the Kingdom of Tonga, I wish to\nconvey our profound appreciation for the overwhelming\nmessages of condolence and sympathy from Member\nStates, the Secretary-General, the Secretariat and the\nGeneral Assembly on the untimely passing earlier\nthis year of our much-beloved King George Tupou\nV. I acknowledge in particular the assistance of the\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China at that time. Though his\nreign may have been brief, it may yet prove timeless in\nenabling an environment where Tongans now exercise\ngreater electoral democracy and enjoy a fully elected\nGovernment and a more representative Parliament.\nThat may be his reign\u2019s most enduring legacy."

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt is a great\npleasure for me to address this great General Assembly\nfor the second year in a row. Last September, I tried to convey to the Assembly\na message of progress and hope. Today I bring from\nthe people of Timor-Leste a message of both joy and\nthankfulness.\nThe United Nations has been in Timor-Leste\nsince the difficult times of our emancipation, having\nled the popular consultation of 1999. Since then,\nit has been enormously challenging to build from\nscratch the foundations of a new State under the rule\nof law, based on democratic governance and respect\nfor human rights. As such, after the United Nations\nMission in East Timor, we had missions such as the\nUnited Nations Transitional Administration in East\nTimor, the United Nations Mission of Support in East\nTimor, the United Nations Office in Timor-Leste and\nthe United Nations Integrated Mission in Timor-Leste\n(UNMIT) accompanying us in this crucial journey\nof State-building, as well as in the creation of an\natmosphere of reconciliation and harmony, with a view\nto achieving peace and stability.\nIn our still-brief existence as a State, we have been\ntrying to learn from the errors of the past. Today I\ncan say that we have decisively moved away from the\ndifficult circumstances that characterize post-conflict\ncountries or, in other words, countries with recent\nhistories of conflict and violence.\nWe have come to understand \u2014 along with several\ncountries \u2014 that peace and stability are essential\nprerequisites for State-building. This year, 2012,\ntherefore marks not exactly the end of a chapter in our\nhistory of peacebuilding but, more particularly, the\nstart of a new one \u2014 a chapter of ongoing institutional\nstrengthening with the goal of boosting national\ndevelopment.\nAfter two rounds of presidential elections, in March\nand April, our people elected as the third President\nof the Republic Major-General Taur Matan Ruak, a\nhistoric figure in the struggle for liberation, who has\nbeen serving the motherland since 1975. Taur Matan\nRuak led the armed resistance and became Chief of\nDefence Forces in 1999.\nIn May, we had the pleasure of hosting five heads\nof State and many delegations from friendly countries\nto celebrate with us the tenth anniversary of the\nrestoration of our independence. That took place within\nan atmosphere of peace, stability and confidence in the\nfuture. The landmark moment of the celebrations was the\nconstitutional transfer of power from the then President\nof the Republic, Mr. Jos\u00e9 Ramos-Horta, to the new head\nof State, in a highly dignified manner for our young\ndemocracy.\nOn 7 July, the Timorese people were called to vote\nonce again, and on 30 July, the new Parliament took\noffice. As a result of those elections, three parties\nwere chosen to ensure the governance of Timor-Leste\nfrom 2012 to 2017. Consequently, on 8 August the\nFifth Constitutional Government was sworn in and\ngiven the mission of continuing to consolidate the vital\ninstitutions of a peaceful and democratic nation. In that\nway, we will also be continuing the work done by the\nprevious Government, which consisted of a five-party\ncoalition and undoubtedly sowed the seeds for national\npeace and stability, in addition to boosting our economy.\nDuring the course of this year, we have also been\nhonoured with visits by several eminent personalities,\nincluding two high-level dignitaries: in August, the\nSecretary-General, His Excellency Ban Ki-moon,\ndecided to see for himself the changes that had taken\nplace in our country since his last visit five years ago.\nHis visit was a magnificent gesture of support by a man\nwith a broad vision of peace and development, a vision\nthat is shared by the Timorese people. The Secretary-\nGeneral acknowledged the progress made and spoke\nwords of encouragement regarding the strengthening of\nthe ties of cooperation between the United Nations and\nTimor-Leste in an important undertaking, Education\nFirst, which is part of his global education initiative.\nMore recently, we also had the pleasure of hosting the\nUnited States Secretary of State, Mrs. Hillary Clinton.\nThat was the first time that a senior representative of\nthe United States Government had visited our young\ncountry. Mrs. Clinton also conveyed an important\nmessage of confidence and solidarity, praising the\nstrong commitment by Timor-Leste to the values and\nprinciples of democracy and good governance. Those\nevents are even more important given that UNMIT and\nthe International Stabilization Force will withdraw by\nthe end of 2012. That will mark the end of peacekeeping\noperations in Timor-Leste.\nAll this has instilled in the hearts of the Timorese\npeople a very special feeling of accomplishment and\nnational pride. I would like to convey that feeling of joy\nand thankfulness to all countries Members of the United\nNations and to the various international organizations that have provided us with ongoing support in terms of\nconsolidating peace, democracy and human rights.\nThe President of the Republic, Taur Matan Ruak,\nhas asked me to make public that on 20 May 2013 the\nTimorese State will be honouring, with the highest\ninsignia of Timor-Leste, all countries and parties\nthat have taken part in missions in Timor-Leste,\nstarting with the General Assembly and the Security\nCouncil. For our people, that will be an act of profound\nrecognition, expressing the wish that from now on the\nUnited Nations will pay more attention to our brothers\nand sisters in need. The success of Timor-Leste belongs\nto everyone \u2014 to the international community for their\ndedicated support and solidarity, and to the Timorese\npeople for the courage to acknowledge their mistakes\nand for their firmness and determination in correcting\nthem.\nThroughout the past four years, our people have\nclearly said no to conflict in order to fully embrace the\naspirations of their own development. The Timorese\npeople were also able to display a high degree of political\nmaturity by expressing, in a peaceful and constructive\nmanner, renewed confidence in their elected leaders\nand in State institutions. All of this is essential for\nreaffirming that, today more than ever, we are ready\nto continue leading the national development process,\nincluding the full establishment of our democratic State\nunder the rule of law and the gradual implementation of\nthe Strategic Development Plan 2011-2030.\nHowever, we want to maintain strong ties with\nthe United Nations and other partners under a new\ncooperation framework, taking as a starting point\nthe current needs of the country in both institutional\nstrengthening and in the development sector. Based on\nthe principles of the New Deal, which are advocated\nby the group of seven plus (g7+), we hope to see\nrelationships of cooperation being established in an\ninnovative, dynamic and effective manner.\nAfter overcoming the main obstacles in terms of\nState-building, Timor-Leste is now looking to the\nfuture with optimism. Consequently, the Government\u2019s\nprogramme for the 2012-2017 mandate, which has\nalready been endorsed by Parliament, establishes short-\nterm \u2014 five years \u2014 activities, lists sectors where\nactivities can be started in order to have impacts in the\nmedium term of 5 to 10 years, and includes objectives\nfor the long term of 10 to 20 years , to be implemented\naccording to priorities and execution time.\n\nWe will continue to invest in social capital with the\naim of building capacity and of dignifying Timorese\ncitizens by maximizing the quality of and access to\nhealth, education, professional training, information,\nsocial justice and culture. We will invest in basic\ninfrastructures, which will be the driving force of the\ncountry\u2019s development. We will develop the economic\nsector to make better use of our potential and to create\nemployment. We will encourage the growth of the\nprivate sector, both local and foreign. We will continue\nour efforts to consolidate the institutional framework\nso as to improve the functioning, management and\nimplementation of programmes. That includes a strong\npublic sector, good governance and a credible system\nof justice.\nMeanwhile, we will improve the social programmes\nthat cater to our most vulnerable citizens, including the\ndisabled, the elderly, and women and children at risk, in\norder to ensure that no Timorese citizen is marginalized\nor socially excluded. We will also continue to dignify\nour veterans.\nToday we have a plan, a vision and a goal: to\ntransform Timor-Leste from a low-income country to\na medium-high-income one by 2030. We want to be a\nprosperous and safe nation with a healthy and educated\npopulation, a country that provides skilled employment\nfor all.\nHowever, in the short term, by 2015, Timor-Leste\nwill not meet the Millennium Development Goals.\nThe current major challenge for Timor-Leste is the\nfight against poverty \u2014 a challenge that we share\nwith over one billion people in our planet. Regrettably,\naround 20 per cent of the world\u2019s population live in\nconditions of extreme poverty. Hunger and the lack of\naccess to water sources will remain insurmountable\nchallenges. Mothers and children throughout the world\nwill continue to die tragically due to lack of access to\nservices to meet the most basic needs.\nUnfortunately, those are the current projections for\n2015. For that reason, it was very timely of the Secretary-\nGeneral to create a high-level panel to help establish\nnew guidelines for beyond 2015. Here, I must confess\nthat we were proud to see a Timorese woman \u2014 our\nMinister of Finance, Emilia Pires \u2014 deservingly chosen\nas a panel member. Timor-Leste wants to contribute\nto the debate on that issue in a clear and constructive\nmanner. It is urgent to address the structural factors that have hindered the efforts that so many people of\ngoodwill have made without obtaining tangible results.\nWe have a historical opportunity to change things.\nWe can learn from the lessons of the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals process, analysing what worked\nand what did not, in order to do better in the future.\nStrengthening the role of the United Nations is essential.\nHowever, it will require the courage to break with\nthe old way of handling things. We need new action\nparadigms and new coordination mechanisms so that\nprogrammes may truly benefit the people of the more\naffected countries.\nThe g7+ was created in April 2010 in Dili, during\nthe preparation for the International Dialogue on\nPeacebuilding and Statebuilding, which took place in\nTimor-Leste. Prior to the creation of the g7+, there was\nno mechanism whereby fragile States with common\nconcerns about peace and development could discuss\nsuch matters in a less subservient way than in their\nrelationships with donors and development agencies.\nIt is quite common for recipient countries to\nconsider that the international assistance they receive\nis not the most appropriate to meet their real needs.\nCountries complain of the lack of an accountability\nsystem in relation to the money that is actually spent\non the poor, compared to the amounts spent to improve\nthe well-being of those who manage the projects and\nthose who manage the reports on the projects, long\ndocuments that are irrelevant because they are out of\ntouch with the reality on the ground. For those reasons,\nin a true spirit of openness and sharing, with a common\ndesire to improve the living conditions of their people\nand to contribute to sustainable peace and development,\nfragile countries created the g7+ as an international\ngroup through which they could speak with one voice.\nYes, we say one voice. Speaking as one, we will be able\nto demand responsibility from the leaders of beneficiary\ncountries and also accountability to the taxpayers of the\ndonor countries.\nThose are the same reasons why we are advocating\nthe New Deal, which seeks to ensure better coordination\nand ownership of international assistance by recipient\ncountries. We want assistance to have genuine impacts\non the people and to correspond better to the true needs\nof the beneficiary populations.\nTimor-Leste is fully committed to leading the g7+,\nbringing the same commitment it showed when moving\nfrom a situation of conflict and fragility to a situation of social and political peace and stability. We want to\ncontribute in a way that is sound and based on actual\nexperiences in the g7+ itself. We are a small country\nthat is still fragile in some aspects, but we share the\nsame huge concerns of the 17 nations that make up our\ngroup, with a total population of more than 300 million\npeople.\nWe have seen how intolerance causes irreparable\ndestruction in several parts of the world, particularly\nin the daily lives of innocent people. The brunt of the\nimpact is borne by women, mothers, children and the\nelderly, making them even more vulnerable. Intolerance\nbreeds hatred and the desire for vengeance. The world\nis not changing so much as it is destroying itself.\nConsolidating the gains of the Arab Spring is\nproving to be difficult. Syria is a terrible example of\ninternal conflict. Iraq and Afghanistan do not present\nbetter perspectives of being able to solve their internal\ndifferences, which are becoming deeper.\nMy good friend Mr. Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono,\nthe President of the Republic of Indonesia, has been\nhosting the Bali Democracy Forum, which has been\nattracting greater interest each year, along with an\nincreasing number of participating countries. We\nhave always maintained in that Forum that democracy\ncannot be imposed upon people, for the same reasons\nthat solar panels cannot be imposed on homes without\nfood, which therefore have no prospect of sustainability.\nDemocracy must be an internal process. The process is\nsometimes long, but it is vital for a lasting solution.\nThe most recent, dynamic and inspirational example\ncomes from Myanmar. I commend Aung San Suu Kyi, a\nwoman with an unshakeable character, a born leader, a\nresolute democrat and a defender of peaceful solutions,\nwho is today an advocate for internal reconciliation.\nI also commend the leaders of Myanmar for their\ncourage in making changes in the country. On behalf\nof the people of Timor-Leste, I also salute the people\nof Myanmar and wish them prosperity, and I appeal for\ndialogue, reconciliation and tolerance.\nToday\u2019s world faces very serious problems and\nis sliding towards an increasingly dangerous lack of\ncontrol. In addition to a recent atmosphere of regional\ninstability, environmental threats continue to grow,\nhindering the legitimate aspirations of emerging and\ndeveloping countries to benefit from their natural\nresources. In the Pacific region, some island States see\ntheir very survival at risk.\n\nFood security concerns are also coming to the\nforeground as a further result of climate changes,\nrequiring careful thought and an immediate and broad\nstrategy. In several parts of the world we see an immoral\nincrease in inequality, with a rich and powerful elite\ndominating the globe with impunity while the poor\nbecome even poorer and eternally dependent on\nwasteful assistance. What is more, it is difficult to\nknow from where that assistance will come.\nIn order to meet these challenges, we need a strong\nand efficient United Nations that cooperates more\neffectively with international and regional organizations\nand that operates with great respect for the sovereignty\nof each State. The United Nations, which consists of\nall of us here today, has a duty to humanity. We should\nall acknowledge that we are the privileged agents of\nthe necessary collective change to a better and safer\nworld. Our collective efforts to preserve peace, security\nand human dignity must be translated from altruistic\nidealism to a more interventionist plan. That in turn\nmeans replacing a reactive agenda with a proactive one.\nIt also means reducing the dominance of political and\neconomic interests in favour of social and humanitarian\ninterests. That requires the mobilization of public\nopinion around the world through dialogue about the\nvalues of peace and harmony among civilizations and\ncultures, mutual respect among societies, and tolerance\namong groups.\nWe can also start with the reform of the Security\nCouncil, which should be more representative. There\nis an imperative need to renew mindsets by the\nincorporation of new members, so as to energize new\n\ncommitments and responsibilities reflecting the current\nsituations in today\u2019s world.\nTimor-Leste has been walking the corridors of\nthe United Nations for 38 years. In the beginning, we\nwanted to mobilize public opinion in favour of our\ncause and to warn the world that our fundamental\nrights were being violated. Today, we are informing\nthe international community of our setbacks and\nachievements in the construction of a sovereign State.\nWhen we were guerrilla fighters in the mountains, we\nheard about a new world order. Today, many people\nare still oppressed because they suffer in one way or\nanother. We are here to speak in favour of dialogue and\nfair decision-making. Human dignity must be at the\ncore of decisions on problems affecting our planet. We\nmust have an overall sense of the existence, the fears,\nthe suffering, the despair and the fight for survival of\nmen and women around the world.\nToday we are here to ask for honest, constructive\nand unceasing dialogue to solve the problems that\ntrouble the world \u2014 a dialogue encompassing problems\nlarge and small, conflicts large and small and nations\nlarge and small."

        "file_text": "\ufeffTwo years ago, during my first address before the\nAssembly as President of Colombia (see A/65/PV.15), I\nexpressed my country\u2019s aspiration to become a member\nof the Security Council for the period 2011-2012.\nWe assumed the responsibility of participating in\nmaking decisions about critical situations that threaten\nworld peace in a spirit of absolute independence and\nwell aware of the enormous commitment required to\nwork for international peace and security. It has been\na particularly turbulent time, but one during which the\naspirations of many peoples who had suffered long conflicts and armed confrontation have been furthered.\nCountries like Liberia, Sierra Leone and C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire\nare now making strides towards peacebuilding and the\nrule of law.\nIn Libya, a ruthless tyranny in place for more than 40\nyears was dismantled in a process in which the Security\nCouncil played a decisive role. My Government did\nnot hesitate to condemn the violent repression of the\ncivilian population justly clamouring for the exercise\nof their fundamental rights. That is why we joined the\nCouncil\u2019s decisions furthering a transition towards\na democracy that, although still fragile, enjoys the\nsupport of the international community as it seeks to\nentrench itself. There are still violent groups that want\nto sabotage that process by terrorist methods. I take\nthis opportunity to condemn in the strongest terms the\ndespicable attack perpetrated against the United States\nconsulate in Benghazi. Extremism, terrorism and\ndisregard for human life cannot be allowed to persist.\nToday, the Arab world is experiencing a\nfundamental political transformation, opening the\nway towards democracy. If the process is to last, it\nwill require respect for people\u2019s rights and the creation\nof conditions conducive to sustainable economic\ndevelopment. We hope that participation by citizens,\nespecially women, will continue to increase and foster\ndemocratic systems and opportunities for development\nand welfare.\nWith regard to the dire situation in Syria for more\nthan a year and half, I must express our deep frustration\nwith the inability of the international community to put an end to the tragedy that every day takes more and more\nSyrian lives. From this rostrum, we reiterate our call\nfor an end to the attacks and for a political negotiation\nthat will meet the legitimate aspirations of all sectors\nof Syrian society. Implementing Kofi Annan\u2019s six-point\nplan would greatly contribute to facilitating a Syrian-\nled political transition. We strongly support the new\nJoint Special Representative of the United Nations\nand the League of Arab States, Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi,\nand wish him much success in his very complex and\ndifficult task.\nAs a representative of a country that is currently\na member of the Security Council, I would like to\nbrief ly turn to the matter of its reform, which has\nbeen under discussion for 20 years. Colombia believes\nthat consensus should be our guide in developing a\ncomprehensive approach that includes change in both\nthe Council\u2019s composition and its working methods so\nas to promote more effectively the United Nations goals\nof peace, well-being and humanity.\nIn our hemisphere, one country that requires\ncomprehensive peacebuilding is Haiti. We continue to\nwork for Haiti. Its recovery will require our continuous\nsupport in strengthening its capacities, institutions\nand productivity so as to generate employment, reduce\nextreme poverty and promote the United Nations work\nfor development in the country. I urge everyone to\npersevere in that cause.\nA key event for the world this year was the United\nNations Conference on Sustainable Development\n(Rio+20). Inspired by the Millennium Development\nGoals model, Colombia led the proposal to establish\nthe sustainable development goals, which was the\nmost important outcome of the Rio+20 process. Today,\nthe sustainable development goals promise to be a\nfundamental component of the planet\u2019s development\nagenda, and the Secretary-General himself has\nidentified them as one of the five priorities of his\nlegacy. We are therefore especially pleased that our\nForeign Minister has been invited to be a member of the\nhigh-level panel on the post-2015 development agenda,\nwhich held its first meeting yesterday.\nThis year, the sixth Summit of the Americas gathered\nin Colombia, with 30 Heads of State and Government\nfrom the western hemisphere in attendance. It was a\nfruitful gathering, which for the first time we organized\nsimultaneously with a business summit attended by the\nleaders of the premier companies of the Americas. We\nalso held a social forum that brought together people\nfrom diverse social organizations on the continents.\nThe Summit of the Americas in Cartagena was\ncharacterized by frank and open dialogue about the\nmost crucial issues for the region and the world. The\nGovernments of the Americas agreed to undertake\nan analysis and discussion of the track record,\neffectiveness and future prospects of the so-called war\non drugs, as well as possible alternatives to it. It is our\nduty to question with scientific objectivity whether we\nare doing the best we can or if there are better options\nto more effectively combating the scourge. To that end,\nwe mandated the Organization of American States\nto begin an analysis and discussion, inviting other\nentities \u2014 the first of which would be, of course, the\nUnited Nations \u2014 to participate.\nThat is only a first step, but it is of great importance\nbecause it is the beginning of a discussion that the\nworld has avoided for many years. We hope that it will\nultimately yield concrete results. The debate about\ndrugs that have caused so much harm throughout the\nworld and to my country must be frank and, most\ncertainly, global.\nSimilarly, in my statement before the General\nAssembly two years ago, I expressed my conviction\nthat the dawning decade should be the decade of\nLatin America and the Caribbean \u2014 a decade that\nwould consolidate that region of the world as a region\nof peace, progress and solutions for the rest of the\nplanet. Today, we are pleased to note that our region\nis indeed experiencing a favourable moment with solid\neconomies, functional democracies and no current\nconflict among the nations of which it is formed.\nRegional coordination mechanisms of relatively\nrecent establishment, such as the Union of South\nAmerican Nations and the Community of Latin\nAmerican and Caribbean States, are evidence of the\nresolve of our countries and peoples to cooperate. I\nwould like to highlight the enormous potential of the\nPacific Alliance that was formalized this year among\nMexico, Peru, Colombia and Chile. The Alliance is\nopen to the participation of other States with which we\nseek to strengthen not only trade but also political and\nhuman ties, as well as to the nations of the immense\nPacific basin.\nI cannot conclude without referring to the special\nmoment that our country is currently experiencing.\nAgainst the backdrop of international turbulence, we have been successful in maintaining a healthy economy\nthat has generated over 2 million new jobs over the\ncourse of two years, attesting to the major progress\nwe have made in reducing poverty. We have put in\nplace initiatives of great social impact, such as a law\nfor victims, which is the only legislation in the world\nthat seeks to return lands to displaced peasants and\nto compensate the victims of a conflict that remains\nongoing; or major hydrocarbon and mining royalties\nreform to more fairly distribute the revenues generated\nby such activities, and thereby promote more effective\nsocial development.\nNevertheless, our progress, which has been\nremarkable, has been curtailed by an absurd conflict\nthat has now lasted half a century. Today, Colombia\nis suffering through the most prolonged internal\narmed conflict in its hemisphere, indeed perhaps one\nof the longest-lasting in the world \u2014 an ever-more\nanachronistic and inexplicable conflict. Above all, it\nis inexplicable in the light of the development of our\ndemocracy and of our social progress.\nAware of that, and without neglecting the\nprotection and security of the Colombian people and\nwithout ceding an inch in the fight against terrorism\nand crime, my Government is resolved to move forward\nprudently, seriously and firmly, and without repeating\nthe mistakes of the past, by entering into conversations\nwith the guerrilla forces in order to achieve an end to\nthe armed conflict.\nAfter two years of exploratory contacts, we have\nannounced to the country and to the world that a\nphase of talks will be initiated on a short and concrete\nagenda, which we hope will allow us to achieve the\ndesired outcome. The talks will begin in Oslo during\nthe first half of October and will continue in Havana,\nthanks to the goodwill of the Governments of Norway\nand Cuba, which will serve as guarantors. We will also\nhave the backing of the Government of Venezuela, to\nwhich we are grateful for its valuable support, and of\nthe Government of Chile, which will be working with\nus during the second phase.\nToday, before the General Assembly, I wish to\nthank the international community for the support it has\nexpressed at outset of the talks and for its willingness\nto cooperate and help in any way that is necessary. We\nembark upon the talks with moderate optimism and in\nthe absolute conviction that it is an opportunity that\nwe cannot squander to achieve a peace that is good not\nonly for Colombia but for the entire region. With regard to my statement today, a few days ago I\nasked the Colombian people through social media what\nmessage they wanted me to bring here to the General\nAssembly. Among the many messages I received, I\nwant to share one from my compatriot Henry Rodr\u00edguez\nChac\u00f3n: \u201cAn entire generation wants to wake up one\nday to the news of a peace agreement.\u201d That is the most\nheartfelt wish of the Colombian people.\nAware that the process must have brief deadlines\nand precise terms if it is to be successful, I trust that\nI will be able to deliver to the Assembly next year a\npositive outcome of the effort, which we undertake\nenthusiastically with a view to ending our 50-year\nconflict.\nWe do not want to talk just about peace; we want\nto build conditions for peace. That is what we are doing\non a daily basis with the actions of our Government and\nnow with the talks that we are initiating. Today, with\ngreat hope, we present the world with this new special\nmoment for my country, Colombia."

        "file_text": "\ufeffFreedom,\ndignity, self-determination and the hope of a better\nlife were the driving forces behind the movement for\nchange in the Arab world.\nAs Germans, we know from our own bitter\nexperience that freedom is not a gift. It has to be won\nand constantly defended. Freedom is more than just\nfreedom of thought. It is freedom to express one\u2019s own\nopinion and to voice public criticism. For that reason\nalone, freedom is not always comfortable. The first\narticle of the Basic Law, Germany\u2019s Constitution,\nstates that human dignity shall be inviolable. That\napplies to every single individual, regardless of their\norigin, culture, creed or sex. As Germans, we have\nexperienced what it is to lack freedom in the course of\nour own history. We will always stand by those who,\nwherever they are in the world, call for freedom of\nopinion, religion, the press and artistic freedom.\n\nFreedom has a daughter; it is tolerance. And\nfreedom has a son; it is respect, respect for other people,\nrespect for what is important to others, respect for what\nis sacred to others. Freedom therefore does not mean\nfreedom from responsibility. Freedom always means\nfreedom to shoulder responsibility.\nWe understand the many devout people who feel\nwounded by the recent shameful anti-Islam video.\nHowever, legitimate criticism and sincere indignation\ncannot be used to justify acts of violence or destruction.\nSome would have us believe that the burning of embassy\nbuildings are proof of a clash of civilizations. We must\nnot allow ourselves to be deluded by such arguments.\nThe vast majority of people oppose violence. The\npeople who have taken to the streets, as well as their\npolitical representatives gathered here in New York\nthis week, have expressed that forcefully. It is not a\nclash of civilizations. It is a clash within societies and\ncivilizations. It is also a struggle for the soul of the\nmovement for change in the Arab world.\nIt is a struggle between open and closed minds,\nbetween moderates and radicals, between understanding\nand hate. It is a clash between those seeking peace and\nthose prepared to resort to violence. The extremists\nwant to prevent the emergence of freedom by inciting\nviolence. They must not be allowed to succeed.\nGermany has taken a stand in that struggle. We will\ncontinue to expand our support for people in the Arab\nworld. We are not going to turn our backs on them, but\nwe will be open to them. Our values and our interests\ncompel us to take the side of those around the world who\nare fighting peacefully for freedom, dignity and self-\ndetermination. Education and work, investment and\ngrowth \u2014 our offer of a transformational partnership\nstill stands.\nI will never forget the Syrian father who held out\nhis emaciated son to me during my visit to the Zaatari\nrefugee camp in Jordan. Such suffering renders us\nspeechless, but it also impels us to act. To this very\nday, the Security Council has failed to live up to its\nresponsibility for the people in Syria. I express that\ncriticism with great sadness. The deadlock in the\nSecurity Council must not continue. Every day, the\nviolence perpetrated by the Bashar Al-Assad regime\nis escalating. The risk of a conf lagration engulfing the\nentire region is growing. Together with our partners and\nthe United Nations, we are helping the many refugees\nin Syria itself and in neighbouring countries.\n\nAll Syrians who want their country to have a\ndemocratic and pluralistic future based on the rule\nof law must work together. We support the efforts of\nMr. Lakhdar Brahimi, Joint Special Representative of\nthe United Nations and the League of Arab States, to\nfind a political approach. Despite the escalating violence\nand despite the deadlock in the Security Council, we\nmust not stop working on a political solution.\nDuring the past 20 months, the Arab League\nhas demonstrated ever more clearly its adherence\nto the values enshrined in the Charter of the United\nNations. We welcome that and we want to build on\nit. At Germany\u2019s initiative, during the last week in\nSeptember, the Security Council welcomed intensifying\ncooperation between the United Nations and the\nLeague of Arab States (see S/PRST/2012/20). That is\nan acknowledgement of the Arab League\u2019s constructive\nand positive role.\nWe also pay tribute to the efforts to gain freedom in\nother parts of the world. As a result of the remarkable\nopening-up process under way in Myanmar, the country\nis emerging from isolation and gradually leaving\nrepression behind.\nWe criticize and strongly condemn the ongoing\nrepression in our own neighbourhood, in Belarus.\nIn many other Asian and African countries, which\nhave struck out in a new direction, we are supporting\npolitical transformation by providing assistance for\neconomic and social development. That is in the\ncommon interest of the international community. For\nthere is one thing that becomes ever more apparent, and\nthat is that without development, there can be no security\nand without security there can be no development. That\napplies to our engagement in Afghanistan, which we\nwill continue after the withdrawal of combat troops in\n2014. It also applies to the efforts to bring stability to\nSomalia and Yemen, to the Great Lakes region and to\nthe countries of the Sahel.\nWe are very concerned by the still-unresolved\ndispute about Iran\u2019s nuclear programme. Iran has still\nnot produced evidence of the exclusively peaceful\nnature of its nuclear programme. It has also failed to\ndate to provide the transparency that the International\nAtomic Energy Agency has long demanded. So far, the\ntalks during the last few months have not made enough\nprogress towards reaching a solution. The European\nUnion\u2019s three plus three group has put forward\nproposals for a substantive negotiation process. We still\nawait a serious response from Iran. We want a political\nand diplomatic solution. Time is short. Israel\u2019s security\nis at stake. Indeed, stability in the entire region is at\nstake. However, that is also about averting the risk of\na nuclear arms race with unforeseeable consequences\nfor international security. I call on Iran to stop playing\nfor time. The situation is serious indeed, and time is\nrunning out. We want a political solution, and we are\nputting all our efforts into achieving that goal.\nThose challenges must not lead us to lose sight of\nthe necessity of a negotiated peace settlement between\nIsrael and the Palestinians. There is a danger that the\ngoal of a two-State solution, the only solution that can\nreconcile the legitimate interests of the two sides, will\nslip away. The two sides must build new trust. At the\nsame time, they must refrain from doing anything that\nmight jeopardize a two-State solution.\nGermany\u2019s foreign policy is a policy for peace.\nGermany\u2019s foreign policy is anchored in Europe. Many\nhave been wondering whether Europe can successfully\nmanage its sovereign debt crisis and whether it will\ncontinue to play a leading role in the world. The answer\nis an emphatic yes. Europe has a great responsibility in\nthe world. And Germany is aware of its responsibility\nfor Europe. The way out of the debt crisis is difficult. It\nrequires spending discipline, solidarity and growth. We\nwill continue down that road. Europe is growing closer\ntogether. Europe is consolidating. Europe will emerge\nfrom the crisis stronger than ever before. Europe will\nremain a force to be reckoned with as the world\u2019s largest\ndonor of development assistance, as an inspiration for\npeaceful regional cooperation, as a pioneer in climate\naction and disarmament, as a champion of rules-based\nglobalization and as a driving force for United Nations\nreform.\nMy country\u2019s peaceful unification more than 20\nyears ago also signified the reunification of Europe.\nSince then, the world has changed dramatically. Today,\nwe find ourselves on the threshold of a multipolar\nworld. The world with its interdependencies needs a\ncooperative order. It needs strong and representative\ninstitutions. We will weaken the Security Council if\nwe fail to adapt it to today\u2019s world. Together with our\npartners in the G-4 group, India, Brazil and Japan,\nGermany is prepared to assume greater responsibility.\nIt cannot be that Latin America and Africa have\nno permanent seats on the Security Council or that\ndynamic Asia has only one. That does not reflect the realities of today\u2019s world, and it definitely does not\nreflect the realities of tomorrow.\nThe challenges are too great for us to simply\naccept the status quo. The world is not only growing\ntogether; the pace of change is increasing. We are\nliving in an age of breathtaking change. That change\nbrings with it risks and new dangers, as well as new\nuncertainties. Above all, however, that change brings\nwith it great opportunities, especially for young people.\nIn this changing world we need a clear compass, and\nour compass is freedom. The yearning for freedom is\nrooted in people\u2019s hearts all over the world. They are\nour partners in building a better future."

        "file_text": "\ufeffAt the outset, on behalf of President Ollanta\nHumala Tasso and the Government and people of Peru,\nI wish to congratulate the President of the General\nAssembly on his election to lead this session, during\nwhich we are very honoured to support him as one of\nthe Vice-Presidents. I would also like to congratulate\nhim on his initiative to make the pacific settlement of\ndisputes the central topic of our debate. The pacific\nsettlement of disputes is the fundamental way to\neradicate the scourge of war, which, in turn, is the\nmain objective of the Organization and its Charter. The\ncommitment not to resort to the threat or use of force\nis the cornerstone of international peace and security.\nPeru reaffi rms its ongoing and resolute commitment\nto the principles that inspired the birth of the United Nations: multilateralism, the pursuit of international\npeace and security, solidarity and cooperation. In\nthat context, Peru solemnly affirms its continuing\ncommitment to the pacific settlement of disputes.\nIn that task, the International Court of Justice, as\nthe main judicial organ of the United Nations system,\nplays a fundamental and, fortunately, increasing role,\nin particular in Latin America. Peru reaffirms its full\nrespect for the work of the Court and calls on States to\nturn to it to resolve their differences and to respect and\ncomply with its decisions, pursuant to Chapter XIV of\nthe United Nations Charter.\nThe 123 disputes that had been submitted to the\nCourt as at December 2011 are proof of the fact that\nthe international community is actively committed to\nthe pacific settlement of disputes, to diplomacy and\nnot to war. Recourse to the Court, far from being an\nunfriendly act, is an eloquent testimony to our desire\nfor peace.\nWe reiterate our faith in multilateralism and\ndeplore the existence of situations to which, to date, our\nOrganization has not been able to find solutions. The\nlatest and most painful one of these, due to the high toll\nit is taking in human lives, is the crisis in Syria. Peru\ncondemns the use of force and violence in that country,\nand calls once again on all parties to the conflict to\nimmediately cease hostilities and to initiate a genuine\nprocess of dialogue and peacemaking, in the framework\nof respect for the independence and sovereignty of that\ncountry and for the fundamental rights and freedoms\nof its citizens.\nWe support the efforts undertaken by the Secretary-\nGeneral and the Arab League to find a negotiated and\npeaceful solution to the conflict. We would encourage\nthe mission of the Joint Special Representative, Lakhdar\nBrahimi, to continue its efforts.\nHowever, that is not the only outstanding issue. Peru\ndeems regrettable the fact that in more than 60 years\nour Organization has not been able to find a solution\nto the legitimate demand of the Palestinian people to\nestablish an independent State and to live in peace\nwithin secure and internationally recognized borders.\nPeru recognizes the Palestinian State, has established\ndiplomatic relations with it and, based on Peru\u2019s\nhistorical position since 1947 and on international law,\nsupports its admission as a full Member of the United\nNations, without detriment to Israel\u2019s right to its own\nsecurity. Peru also condemns once again the unfair,\nillegitimate and illegal economic, financial and\ncommercial blockade imposed against Cuba, to which\nthe Organization has been unable to put an end despite\nthe countless condemnations from the Assembly.\nWe also regret that it has not yet been possible\nto find a solution to the nearly 200-year-old dispute\nbetween Argentina and the United Kingdom regarding\nthe Malvinas Islands. We call upon the parties once\nagain to initiate a dialogue leading to a negotiated\nsolution.\nTo overcome these and other shortcomings and\ndeficiencies of the current international order, it is\nurgent to adopt measures within our own Organization,\nthe most urgent one probably being a reform of the\nSecurity Council aimed at making it a more efficient,\ntransparent, democratic and representative forum. The\nUnited Nations must reflect the realities of the twenty-\nfirst century and update the current architecture, which\nremains best suited to the post-war world of 1945. The\ncurrent scenario requires that developing countries take\ngreater responsibility for preserving peace and security.\nWe deplore the limited progress made in negotiations on\nthis issue. We consider that the time is ripe to relaunch\nthe reform process, and we call upon Member States\nto spare no effort in bringing this process to a speedy\nconclusion.\nAs a concrete sign of Peru\u2019s contribution to\nstrengthening the rule of law, it was my pleasure to\ndeposit yesterday the instruments of ratification of\nthe Convention for the Protection of All Persons from\nEnforced Disappearance and the Convention on Cluster\nMunitions, as well as the amendments to the Montreal\nProtocol regarding ozone-depleting substances. We call\non all countries to accede to these instruments, which\nare aimed at protecting the environment, ensuring\nrespect for human rights and fighting against all\nforms of impunity. It is a moral duty to ensure that the\nperpetrators of serious crimes against humanity are\nduly tried and punished.\nThe rule of law also requires more inclusive\nsocieties. Civil, political and social citizenship must\nencompass everyone equally. Accordingly, Peru has\nincorporated into its national legislation the provisions\nof Convention 169 of the International Labour\nOrganization. Since Peru is the first country to adopt\nthese measures, its indigenous peoples will be able to\nfully exercise their rights and ensure that all investors have obtained the requisite social licence, within the\nframework of State powers.\nIn spite of all of those efforts, new and diverse\nthreats to the rule of law have emerged. Transnational\norganized crime, funded mainly by drug trafficking,\ntoday constitutes the main threat to democratic societies.\nThe magnitude of this problem requires, more than ever\nbefore, combined efforts with an integrated vision of\nshared responsibility at the global level.\nIt is for that reason that this past June Peru hosted\nthe International Conference of Ministers of Foreign\nAffairs and Heads of Specialized National Agencies\nagainst the World Drug Problem, in an attempt to resume\na political dialogue that had been interrupted for nearly\n20 years. That valuable opportunity proved to us that\namid our diversity there are many more convergences\nthan discrepancies, and that the will exists to intensify\ncooperation in this area.\nWe are confident that this first step will be further\ncomplemented by new initiatives that will guarantee\ngreater exchange of information, a better allocation\nof resources, and better results in reducing the supply\nand demand of narcotic drugs as well as in the field of\nalternative development, a topic that will be addressed\nnext November at an international conference to be\nhosted by Peru.\nThat Peruvian initiative on the fight against\ndrugs is not the only ref lection of our commitment\nto multilateralism and integration. Since June, Peru\nhas held the presidency pro tempore of the Union of\nSouth American Nations (UNASUR). We want to see\ndemocracy consolidated throughout South America.\nMany lives have been lost during the long journey\ntowards consolidating democracy in our region. For that\nreason, we will not be deterred by any circumstance\nthat may threaten that undertaking.\nIn our capacity as President Pro Tempore of\nUNASUR, we reiterate that democracy will remain an\nessential requirement for integration and cooperation\nin South America. We also hope that South America\nwill become a zone of peace, without exclusions. It\nis already a nuclear-weapon-free zone, and we will\nwork tirelessly so that it can soon be a zone free of\nanti-personnel mines. The money currently spent on\narms must be redirected towards development and\novercoming poverty and inequality.\nPeru is peace-loving country and a staunch defender\nof disarmament. At the international level, we are party to the main disarmament and non-proliferation\ntreaties. Furthermore, Peru hosts the headquarters\nof the Regional Centre for Peace, Disarmament and\nDevelopment in Latin America and the Caribbean.\nWe promote confidence-building measures with\nneighbouring countries, especially measures aimed at\nconventional disarmament to favour the development\nof our peoples. In that context, we cannot but welcome\nwith enthusiasm and high expectations the efforts made\nby the Government of President Santos Calder\u00f3n of\nColombia to open the path of dialogue in order to end\nlong years of violence, as justly claimed by the people\nof Colombia. Peru expresses its best wishes for the\nsuccess of that initiative.\nFrom the South American perspective, we also\naspire to build bridges with all the regions of the world.\nIn such a spirit, Peru will in a few days welcome heads\nof State and Government of South American and Arab\ncountries to the third Summit of South American and\nArab Countries. The Summit has become an important\ninstrument in bringing the two regions closer together\nand, through it, its member countries have opened a\nchannel for dialogue and political understanding at\nthe highest level. That will afford us the opportunity\nto develop common interests in areas such as trade,\ninvestment and culture, all for the benefit of our peoples.\nThanks to appropriate macroeconomic policies,\nPeru has continued to grow, reaching a growth rate in\n2011 of 6.92 per cent and a 5.7 per cent average rate\nover the past 10 years. Despite those good results, wide\nsectors of the population do not fully participate in the\nbenefits of economic growth. Hence, it is time to ensure\ngrowth with social inclusion, as President Ollanta\nHumala Tasso has pointed out since the beginning of\nhis Administration. The new vision that Peru promotes\nis oriented towards further economic growth and\ndemocratic stability as it expands and maximizes\nsocial well-being and harmonizes productive activities\nwith environmental preservation. In Peru\u2019s view,\nstarting with the Rio+20 Conference on Sustainable\nDevelopment, the establishment of the post-2015\ndevelopment agenda must achieve a convergence of the\nprocesses of the Millennium Development Goals with\nthe processes of the sustainable development goals.\nPeru\u2019s commitment to the United Nations is\nlong-standing and deep. Allow me to conclude by\nhonouring here to three prominent Peruvian diplomats\nwho have held the highest responsibilities within the\nOrganization \u2014 Ambassador Javier P\u00e9rez de Cuellar, Secretary-General from 1982 to 1991; Ambassador\nVictor Andr\u00e9s Bela\u00fande, President of the General\nAssembly at its fourteenth session, from 1959 to 1960;\nand Ambassador Jos\u00e9 Luis Bustamante y Rivero,\nPresident of the International Court of Justice from\n1967 to 1969. The recognition and responsibilities\nthat those individuals received from the international\ncommunity show that Peru has always been committed\nto peace and to the observance of international law. I\nam pleased to see the Permanent Representative of Peru\npresiding over the debate this evening.\nAs a co-founder of some of the main regional\nforums, such as the Andean Community, the Union\nof South American Nations and the Community of\nLatin American and Caribbean States, Peru has always\nbeen a standard-bearer for integration and for positive,\nrespectful relations with all countries of the world\nand, in particular, with the countries of our region and\nneighbouring countries. As a basis of that policy, Peru\nhas always trusted \u2014 and will continue to place its\ntrust \u2014 in the strength and primacy of international\nlaw and in the peaceful settlement of disputes. It is\nwith that conviction that the Government of President\nOllanta Humala Tasso reiterates its staunch adherence\nto the purposes and principles of the United Nations."

        "file_text": "\ufeffI wish to\nbegin by extending my appreciation to the heads of all\nthe delegations who in their statements to the Assembly\nstressed the urgency of progress towards the realization\nof a just peace in our region, one which would allow the\nPalestinian people to enjoy their inalienable national\nrights.\nDevelopments over the past year have confirmed\nwhat we have persistently drawn attention to and warned of: the catastrophic danger of racist settlers moving into\nour country. During the past months, attacks by terrorist\nmilitias of Israeli settlers have become a daily reality,\nwith at least 535 attacks since the beginning of the year.\nWe are facing relentless waves of attacks against our\npeople, our mosques, our churches and monasteries,\nand our homes and schools. They are unleashing their\nvenom against our trees, fields, crops and properties,\nand our people have become fixed targets for acts of\nkilling and torture, with the complete collusion of the\noccupying forces and the Israeli Government.\nThe escalation of settler attacks should not\nsurprise anyone, for it is the inherent byproduct of\nthe continuation of the occupation and a Government\npolicy that deliberately fosters the settlements and\nsettlers and deems their satisfaction to be an absolute\npriority. And it is the inherent byproduct of the racist\nclimate fuelled by a culture of incitement in Israeli\ncurriculums and extremist declarations and fatwas,\nwhich are rife with hatred and are rooted in a series\nof discriminatory laws created and enacted over the\nyears against the Palestinian people by the Israeli\nsecurity apparatus and courts. Those entities provide\nexcuse after excuse for the settlers\u2019 crimes and for\ntheir accelerated release should one of them happen\nto be arrested. Official and military commissions of\ninquiry fabricate justifications for soldiers who have\ncommitted what are clearly considered war crimes and\nhave perpetrated acts of murder, torture and abuse of\npeaceful Palestinian civilians.\nOver the past year, since the convening of the\nGeneral Assembly\u2019s previous session, the occupying\nPower has persisted with its settlement campaign,\nfocusing on Jerusalem and its environs. It is a campaign\nclearly and deliberately aimed at altering the city\u2019s\nhistoric character and the glorious image of the Holy\nCity as etched in the minds of humankind. It is a\ncampaign of ethnic cleansing against the Palestinian\npeople of Jerusalem via the demolition of their homes\nand prevention of their reconstruction, the revocation\nof residency rights, the denial of basic services,\nespecially with regard to the construction of schools,\nthe closure of institutions and the impoverishment of\nJerusalem\u2019s community via a siege behind walls and\ncheckpoints. That chokes the City and prevents millions\nof Palestinians from freely accessing its mosques,\nchurches, schools, hospitals and markets.\nThe occupying Power has also continued its\nconstruction and expansion of settlements in different areas throughout the West Bank and has continued\nits suffocating blockade, as well as raids and attacks\nagainst our people in the Gaza Strip, who to this day\nsuffer from the disastrous impact of the destructive war\nof aggression committed against them a few years ago.\nNearly 5,000 Palestinians remain captive as prisoners\nand detainees of conscious in Israel\u2019s jails. In that\nregard, we call upon the international community to\ncompel the Government of Israel to respect the Geneva\nConventions of 1949 and to investigate the conditions\nof detention of Palestinian prisoners and detainees, and\nwe stress the need for their release. They are soldiers in\ntheir people\u2019s struggle for freedom, independence and\npeace.\nAt the same time, the occupying Power continues\nto tighten the siege and impose severe restrictions on\nmovement, preventing the Palestinian Authority from\nimplementing vital infrastructure projects and providing\nservices to its citizens, who are also being prevented\nfrom cultivating their land and deprived of water for\nirrigation. The occupying Power is also obstructing the\nestablishment of agricultural, industrial, tourism and\nhousing projects by the Palestinian private sector in\nvast areas of the occupied Palestinian territory, which\nare classified as areas subject to the absolute control of\nthe occupation, areas that encompasses approximately\n60 per cent of the West Bank.\nThe occupying Power continues to deliberately\ndemolish what the Palestinian Authority is\nbuilding \u2014 projects funded by donor brethren and\nfriends \u2014 and is destroying the Authority\u2019s building\nprojects involving roads, simple homes for its citizens\nand agricultural facilities. In fact, over the past 12\nmonths, the Israeli occupying forces demolished 510\nPalestinian structures in those areas and displaced 770\nPalestinians from their homes. Those measures have\ncaused great damage to our economy and impeded our\ndevelopment programmes and private-sector activity.\nThey compound the socioeconomic difficulties of\nour people under occupation, a fact confirmed by\ninternational financial institutions. Israel\u2019s overall\npolicy is ultimately leading to the weakening of the\nPalestinian Authority, undermining its ability to\ncarry out its functions and projects and to implement\nits obligations. This threatens to undermine its very\nexistence or cause its collapse.\nAll of that is taking place in the context of an Israeli\npolitical discourse that does not hesitate to brandish\naggressive, extremist positions. In many aspects and in their practical application on the ground, they incite\nreligious conflict. That is something we firmly reject,\nbased on our principles and convictions and due to our\nunderstanding of what it means to fuel such fires in this\nsensitive area, which is full of explosive f lashpoints,\nand how that can fuel the action of extremists from\nvarious quarters, especially those trying to use tolerant,\nmonotheistic religions as an ideological justification\nfor their terrorism.\nFor our part, as proof of our seriousness and our\nsincere intention to create an opening in this impasse,\nwe conducted exploratory talks with the Israeli\nGovernment at the beginning of the year, at the initiative\nof the brotherly Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. We\nhave also encouraged the expressed desires of several\ncountries to contribute to efforts to break the cycle of\ndeadlock and have ourselves undertaken initiatives\nto create favourable conditions for the resumption of\nnegotiations. Unfortunately, however, the result of all\nthose initiatives has been very negative.\nThere can be only one reading of the Israeli\nGovernment\u2019s actions and practices in our homeland\nand of the positions it has presented to us regarding the\nsubstance of a final status agreement to end the conflict\nand achieve peace: that the Israeli Government rejects\nthe two-State solution.\nThe two-State solution \u2014 namely, the State\nof Palestine coexisting alongside the State of\nIsrael \u2014 represents the spirit and essence of the historic\ncompromise embodied in the Declaration of Principles,\nwhich was agreed to in Oslo and was signed, 19 years\nago, by the Palestine Liberation Organization and the\nGovernment of Israel under the auspices of the United\nStates of America and on the White House lawn. It is\na compromise by which, for the sake of making peace,\nthe Palestinian people accepted to establish their State\non only 22 per cent of the territory of historic Palestine.\nRecent years have actually witnessed a systematic\nacceleration and intensification of Israeli measures\naimed at gutting the Oslo Accords of their meaning,\nwhile simultaneously building facts on the ground in\nthe occupied Palestinian territory that are making the\nimplementation of the Accords extremely difficult, if\nnot completely impossible.\nThe Israeli Government aims to continue its\noccupation of East Jerusalem, to de facto annex large\nareas of the rest of the occupied Palestinian territory\nand to continue occupying a large portion of the territory under different designations. It refuses to\nengage in any serious discussion of the issue of the\nPalestinian refugees. It wants to continue its occupation\nof Palestinian aquafers and its control over the most\nfertile agricultural areas in our land, as well as over our\nair, skies,water, borders and our life in its entirety.\nThe final map and borders that can be drawn in\naccordance with Israel\u2019s official positions reveal to us\nsmall Palestinian enclaves surrounded by large Israeli\nsettlement blocs and walls and checkpoints, and vast\nsecurity zones and roads reserved for settlers. The\nenclaves would therefore remain subject to the full\ndominance of military and settler occupation, only\npackaged under new names, such as the unilateral\nplan for a so-called State with provisional borders. I\nrepeat \u2014 a State with provisional borders. That is a\nproject that we categorically reject from A to Z because\nit will not bring about peace.\nIsrael refuses to end the occupation and refuses to\nallow the Palestinian people to attain their freedom and\nindependence. It rejects the establishment of the State\nof Palestine. Israel is promising the Palestinian people\na new catastrophe \u2014 a new Naqba \u2014 a new setback.\nI speak on behalf of an angry people who feel\nthat while they demand their right to freedom, adopt a\nculture of peace and adhere to the principles and rules\nof international law and resolutions of international\nlegitimacy, rewards continue to be illogically bestowed\nupon Israel, whose Government pursues a policy of\nwar, occupation and settler occupation. Israel continues\nto be permitted to enjoy impunity, and some continue\nto obstruct the adoption of a decisive position regarding\nits violations of international law and covenants. That\nrepresents a licence for the occupation to continue\nits policy of dispossession and ethnic cleansing and\nencourages it to entrench its system of apartheid against\nthe Palestinian people.\nDespite our genuine feelings of anger, we \u2014 in\nthe name of the Palestine Liberation Organization, the\nsole legitimate representative of the Palestinian\npeople \u2014 will not allow our country to be divided in\ntwo.\nWe are the sole legitimate representative of the\nPalestinian people. I reaffirm without hesitation that\nwe are as committed \u2014 equally and by the same\nmeasures \u2014 to peace and international legitimacy and\nits covenants and resolutions as we are to upholding\nour inalienable national rights and aspirations. And we reaffirm that we are committed to non-violence\nand reject terrorism in all its forms, particularly State\nterrorism.\nDespite our disappointment, we continue to sincerely\nextend a hand to the Israeli people to make peace. We\nrealize that ultimately the two peoples must live and\ncoexist, each in their respective State, in the Holy Land.\nFurthermore, we realize that progress towards making\npeace can be achieved through negotiations between\nthe Palestine Liberation Organization and Israel.\nDespite all the complexities of the prevailing\nreality and all the frustrations that abound, we say\nbefore the international community that there is still\na chance \u2014 maybe the last \u2014 to save the two-State\nsolution and to salvage peace. However, this urgent task\nmust be pursued via a new approach.\nWhoever rushes to advise us to repeat an experience\nthat has proven to be futile, such as negotiations with\nthe Israeli Government without clear terms of reference,\nmust understand that this will result in the reproduction\nof failure and again provide cover for consecrating the\noccupation and will deal the final blow to an already\ndying peace process. Whoever advises us to wait must\nrealize that the hotbeds of tension and the festering\nsituation in our country and our region have their own\ntiming and cannot withstand further procrastination\nand delay, nor are they amenable to being relegated to\nthe bottom of the global agenda.\nThe approach required for salvaging the chance for\npeace must, first and foremost, be predicated on the\nunderstanding that the racist settler occupation must\nbe condemned, punished and boycotted so that it is\ncompletely halted and eliminated. That approach also\nrequires a reaffirmation of, and adherence to, the terms\nof reference and the foundations of the solution to the\nconflict, which have been endorsed by all here.\nWe do not need to belabour the core components\nof a just solution to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.\nRather, what is needed is the will to implement those\ncomponents. Marathon negotiations are not required to\ndefine them, rather it is the genuine and sincere intention\nto reach peace that is needed. Those components are\nby no means a mysterious puzzle or intractable riddle;\nthey are the clearest and best-known secrets in the\nworld. They include, in brief, the establishment of an\nindependent State of Palestine, with East Jerusalem as\nits capital, over the entire territory occupied by Israel\nsince 1967, and the realization of a just, agreed solution to the Palestine refugee issue, in accordance with\nresolution 194 (III), as prescribed in the Arab Peace\nInitiative.\nThe fundamental components of the solution to\nthe conflict exist in the documents and resolutions of\nthe United Nations. Member States already have them.\nThe components of the solution are also endorsed in\nresolutions of regional organizations, beginning with\nthe League of Arab States, the Organization of Islamic\nCooperation, the Non-Aligned Movement and the\nAfrican Union. They can also be found in the statements\nof the European Union and the international Quartet.\nHowever, what is the use of all those terms of reference\nif Israel continues to refuse, and is encouraged by\nothers to continue to oppose the terms of reference?\nThe international community, embodied in the\nUnited Nations, is required now more than ever to uphold\nits responsibilities. The Security Council is called upon\nto urgently adopt a resolution comprising the pillars\nand foundations for a solution to the Palestinian-Israeli\nconflict that would serve as a binding term of reference\nand guide for all if the vision of two States, Israel and\nPalestine, is to survive and if peace is to prevail in the\nland of peace \u2014 the birthplace of Jesus, peace be upon\nhim, the ascension of the Prophet Muhammad, peace\nbe upon him, and the final resting place of Abraham,\npeace be upon him \u2014 Palestine, the land of the three\nmonotheistic religions.\nAll things considered, the establishment of a free\nand independent State of Palestine is a sacred right of\nthe Palestinian people and an entitlement that must be\nrealized, for it has been overdue for too many decades.\nIt is not a grant to be bestowed upon us by anyone. It is\na right, and the Palestinian people are entitled to that\nright.\nAt the same time, the Palestinian Authority has\naffirmed, through the implementation of its State\ninstitution-building programmes, the ability to create\nan advanced model for an effective, modern State\nthrough the development of the performance of its\ninstitutions and public finance management and\nthrough the adoption of standards for transparency,\nstrict accountability and rules of good governance.\nThose achievements have been deemed by the Ad\nHoc Liaison Committee for the Coordination of\nthe International Assistance to Palestinians, the\nWorld Bank and the International Monetary Fund to\nconstitute an impressive undertaking and success story. Those achievements were again commended in the\nlatest report just a few days ago, which confirmed the\nPalestinian Authority\u2019s total readiness for the transition\nto an independent State while at the same time stressing\nthat the Israeli occupation remained the only obstacle\nto the realization of the State of Palestine.\nDuring the previous session of the General\nAssembly, we submitted our application for\nconsideration by the Security Council to allow the\nState of Palestine to assume its rightful place among\nthe community of nations as a full Member of the\nUnited Nations. A major and hostile uproar was raised\nby some against that political, diplomatic, peaceful\nstep par excellence aimed at saving the peace process\nby asserting its principles and foundation. Despite the\nfact that the overwhelming majority of the countries\nof the world supported, and continues to support, our\napplication, our endeavour was aborted. I do not see\neven a single reason for opposing that request.\nYet when the countries of the world had the\nopportunity to declare their stance without any\nrestrictions or veto during the previous autumn, they\nvoted, despite enormous pressure, in strong support of the\nacceptance of Palestine as a member State of UNESCO.\nA year has passed, and Palestine, the homeland of\nMahmoud Darwish and Edward Said, is playing its\nrole in UNESCO with a high level of responsibility and\nprofessionalism. Palestine is committed to international\nconventions and is cooperating with all member States\nin order to advance the objectives of the organization\nand providing a model of what its positive, constructive\ncontribution in international organizations would be.\nIn order to enhance the chances for peace, we will\ncontinue our efforts to obtain full membership for\nPalestine at the United Nations. For the same reason,\nwe have begun intensive consultations with various\nregional organizations and Member States aimed at\nthe General Assembly\u2019s adoption during this session\nof a draft resolution considering the State of Palestine\nas a non-member State of the United Nations. We are\nconfident that the vast majority of the countries of the\nworld support our efforts to bolster the chances for a\njust peace. In our efforts we do not seek to delegitimize\nan existing State, that is, Israel; but rather to establish\nthe State that must be realized, that is, Palestine. We\nare not trying to delegitimize them; they are trying to\ndelegitimize us.\nMore than 64 years have passed since Al-Nakba\nand a large number of those who were its immediate victims and witnessed its horrors have died. They died\nwith memories, preserved in their minds and hearts, of\ntheir beautiful world that was devastated, their warm\nhomes that were demolished and their peaceful villages\nthat were erased from existence, and of the renaissance\nthat was undermined, and their loved ones, dear\nmen, women and children, who were killed in wars,\nmassacres, attacks, raids and incursions, and of their\nbeautiful country that was a beacon of coexistence,\ntolerance, progress and a crossroads of civilization.\nThey died displaced and in refugee camps to which\nthey were expelled following their uprooting from their\nhomeland, as they awaited the moment in which they\nwould resume their suspended lives, complete their\ninterrupted journey and repair their shattered dreams.\nThey died while they clung to their legitimate human\nright to justice, freedom and redress for the historically\nunprecedented injustice inf licted upon them. Has the\ntime not come to undo that injustice?\nAt present, 77 per cent of the Palestinian people are\nunder the age of 35. Although they did not experience\nthe horrors of Al-Nakba, they know very well all its\nhorrendous details from the accounts of their parents\nand grandparents who endured it. They continue to\nsuffer from its ongoing effects today and every day\nas a result of the practices of the occupation and of\nthe settlers on a land that is diminishing in size. The\nhorizon before them is closed to their simple, ordinary\ndreams. They see their homeland and their present and\nfuture vulnerable to continued usurpation and they say\nfirmly: we shall not allow a new Al-Nakba to happen.\nI say to the Assembly that the brave Palestinian\npeople will not allow themselves to be the victims\nof a new Al-Nakba. We will not allow that. We will\nstay on our land. My people will continue their epic\nsteadfastness and eternal survival journey in their\nbeloved land, every inch of which carries evidence and\nlandmarks affirming their roots and unique connection\nto the land throughout ancient history. There is no\nhomeland for us except Palestine and there is no land\nfor us but Palestine. We shall not accept an alternative\nhomeland, nor an alternative land. Palestine is our\nhomeland and shall remain our homeland.\nOur people will continue to build the institutions of\ntheir State and strive to achieve national reconciliation\nto restore the unity of our nation, people and institutions\nvia resorting to the ballot box, which will confirm our\npeople\u2019s pluralistic democratic choice. Our people\nare also determined to continue peaceful popular resistance, consistent with international humanitarian\nlaw, against the occupation, against the settlements and\nfor the sake of freedom, independence and peace.\nLet us prevent the occurrence of a new Al-Nakba\nin the Holy Land. Let us support the realization of a\nfree, independent State of Palestine now. Let peace be\nvictorious before it is too late."

        "file_text": "\ufeffAt the outset, let me\ncongratulate His Excellency Mr. Vuk Jeremi\u0107, President\nof the General Assembly at its sixty-seventh session, on\nhis election and wish him success in discharging his\nduties. It is my honour to pay tribute to the Secretary-\nGeneral, His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for his able\nleadership and tireless efforts in guiding the United\nNations in these demanding times.\nThe theme of this session of the General Assembly\nis \u201cBringing about adjustment or settlement of\ninternational disputes or situations by peaceful means\u201d.\nWe had an opportunity to listen to the speakers at the\nopening of the session, who stressed the importance of\npreventing violence and the responsibility of all Member\nStates, their leaders and international organizations to take any action they can to prevent and raise awareness\nof such horrible events.\nAmong other issues of global concern, I would like\nto draw the Assembly\u2019s attention to the horrific scenes\nin Syria. A civil war has been dragging on there for\nmany months. Efforts at mediation unfortunately have\nfailed. It shocks our conscience that we have been unable\nto stop the bloodshed. Sadly, we have not succeeded in\nprotecting civilians. In my view, the situation is critical.\nIt speaks to the urgent need to consider strengthening\nthe preventive capacities of the United Nations, its\nStates Members and regional organizations.\nConcerted efforts to avert mass atrocities are\nneeded. Last year we celebrated the sixtieth anniversary\nof the entry into force of the Convention on the\nPrevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide.\nThe Convention was the result of the tireless efforts of\nMr. Raphael Lemkin, a Polish lawyer. He stalked the\nhalls of the United Nations every day until December\n1948, when the General Assembly finally adopted the\nConvention. Afterwards he continued his work, and his\nendeavours paid off in 1951, when the Convention came\ninto force.\nWe then waited half a century to see the first\nconviction of an individual for the crime of genocide.\nThe establishment of the International Tribunals for\nthe Former Yugoslavia and Rwanda in the 1990s was\nfollowed by the historic creation of the permanent\nInternational Criminal Court. That was another\nmilestone in the humanization of international relations.\nA further encouraging development is that the United\nNations system has improved its internal coordination\nof activities related to the prevention of genocide. The\nOffices of the Special Adviser on the Prevention of\nGenocide and Mass Atrocities and the Special Adviser\non the Responsibility to Protect were established at that\ntime. The Human Rights Council has helped to promote\nthe culture of prevention.\nOver the past months, the Syrian tragedy has\nincreased awareness of our responsibility to prevent\nand stop mass atrocities. United States President\nBarack Obama has established a promising atrocities\nprevention board and, in his remarks at the United\nStates Holocaust Memorial Museum in April, made the\npoint that national sovereignty was never a licence to\nslaughter your people. I hope we all share his belief that\npreventing genocide is an achievable goal. Secretary-\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon urged in his speech at the opening of this session that we should give the responsibility to\nprotect concept a tangible meaning.\nTo my regret, however, we have not yet achieved\na common understanding on the modalities involved.\nWe should therefore focus and strengthen our dialogue\nto that end. There is room for improving the modes\nof collaboration between the national, regional and\ninternational levels.\nIt will be recalled that after the Second World War\nmore than 80 countries witnessed mass atrocities. At\nleast 53 million innocent lives were lost. Behind those\nnumbers were real men and women made of f lesh and\nblood, and also children. They had futures but were\nnot allowed to live. Behind those numbers there are\nstill traumatized families and the distorted creative\npotential of the affected societies. Bearing that in mind,\nwe should be able to set at least basic limits on human\nbehaviour and stop mass atrocities.\nI therefore urge the States Members of the United\nNations, the members of the regional and subregional\norganizations and the United Nations system to develop\na new strategy to prevent genocide and other mass\natrocities. Moreover, an intergovernmental forum of\nlike-minded countries should be formed to propose a\nUnited Nations resolution that would set a clear mandate\nfor the preparation and adoption of an appropriate legal\nmechanism \u2014 a legal mechanism that would provide\nthe responsibility to protect concept with new tools, a\nlegal mechanism that would enforce crime prevention,\na mechanism to facilitate a more rapid and effective\nresponse to acts of genocide and other mass atrocities.\nSlovenia stands ready to start a dialogue to that\nend. We are going to convene the first meeting in\nthe following months. I am glad that we have already\nenlisted substantial support for the initiative during\nthis Assembly session. The initiative originates from\ninternational civil society. The Institute for Cultural\nDiplomacy in Berlin has collected many thousands\nof supporters among international non-governmental\norganizations, lawyers, students, journalists and other\nindividuals. Support is on the increase, and this is\nnot just one isolated initiative. There are many others\nacross the globe.\nWe should, of course, also enhance our\ncollaboration with a view to the prosecution of alleged\nperpetrators of genocide and mass atrocities, including\nindividual States. Effective prosecution undoubtedly\nhas a deterrent effect and contributes substantially to a culture of prevention. Moreover, a genuine culture of\nprevention needs to be developed globally. We should\nimprove our understanding of the warning signs, which\nshould trigger early action.\nThese days we witness numerous acts of violence\nagainst diplomatic and consular missions in one part\nof our world. I strongly condemn such violent acts.\nThey can never be justified. Freedom of speech is\nfundamental in a democracy, and a violent response\nhas never been able to silence it. Only by strengthening\nintercultural dialogue can we diminish the potential\nfor conflict. Only mutual respect can contribute to\nmaintaining peace and security.\nMr. Prosor (Israel), Vice-President, took the Chair.\nIt was in 1946 that Raphael Lemkin asserted that\nour whole heritage is a product of the contributions\nof all nations. Each and every nation and the United\nNations as a whole have an enormous responsibility,\nand also an opportunity, to prevent future atrocities.\nWe cannot escape our history but let us learn from it.\nI fully believe that we do not want the mistakes of\nyesterday to be repeated tomorrow. We took over the\nresponsibility for the world from our fathers and have\nan enormous responsibility to make it a better place\nfor our children. I therefore invite all here to do so by\njoining in our efforts for a world free from genocide."

        "file_text": "\ufeffIn the past few years, the\nnumber of conflicts in the world has again been on the\nincrease. That causes the deaths and injuries of, and\na loss of shelter for, thousands of people. It leads to\na delay in the development of our countries and the\nstagnation of regional and global economies.\nOur common goal is to find ways to reduce tension,\ndisagreement and conflict worldwide. The most\nimportant challenge in that respect is understanding\nthe root causes of conflicts and concentrating efforts\non prevention, not only on doing away with the\nconsequences.\nI want to draw the attention of Member States\nto one specific area that is very narrow but very\nimportant \u2014 energy. Since ancient times, the\ncompetition for natural resources has been the reason for very many conflicts. Energy resources are not equally\ndistributed, so there is inequality in accessibility to\nenergy. The existing dependency on energy remains a\nreason for abuse, not cooperation. A lack of clear and\nglobally accepted rules and norms in the energy sector\ncontributes to continuing tensions.\nRecurring gas and oil supply crises every year\nremind us that, in a global environment, friction and\ndisagreements over energy still lead to conflicts and\ntensions of all sorts. Being a small country, without its\nown resources, especially sources of energy, Lithuania\nis well aware of the negative consequences of energy\ndependency in an environment that has no universal\nagreement on or compliance with clear rules of the\ngame. What can we do?\nFirst, we need to increase global energy\nsustainability. I would like to congratulate Secretary-\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon for his Sustainable Energy for\nAll initiative, which is really relevant and timely. The\nimprovement of energy efficiency, the diversification\nof the energy supply and global accessibility to energy\nare certainly the goals for which we should strive.\nSecondly, we need to make existing inequalities in\naccess to energy a source of cooperation, not tension.\nThe use of energy dependency as an instrument for\npolitical or economic blackmail must be eliminated,\nnot only to ensure equality but also to increase global\ncompetiveness and effectiveness. With the ongoing\npractices of price-fixing and abuse of monopolistic\npositions, which both distort competition, there can be\nno development, security or effectiveness.\nThirdly, our answer to energy-related conflict\nprevention should be international agreements that\nmake clear that the use of energy to gain political goals is\nunacceptable. Responsibility for violations should also\nbe clear and unavoidable. We must grant international\ninstitutions greater discretion to launch investigations\nand to impose sanctions on activities that hinder the\nfree f low of energy resources, impede diversification\nor set unfair prices for customers.\nI have one final point. There is no energy-\nrelated issue as dangerous as unsafe nuclear energy\ndevelopment. It is obvious that each country can decide\non its own energy mix. However, each national decision\nto develop nuclear energy can have a devastating and\ntransboundary impact, and should be extremely well\ngrounded and researched. There can be no sustainability,\ndevelopment or peaceful cooperation without nuclear safety. Mistakes in nuclear energy are too costly to be\nallowed.\nIn that respect, we welcome the actions taken by\nthe International Atomic Energy Agency to improve\nthe existing system of international nuclear safety\nregulations. Lithuania supports the position that nuclear\nsafety standards should be strengthened and, if needed,\nlegal international imperatives should be adopted. The\n2012 Seoul Nuclear Security Summit clearly indicated\nthat nuclear security and nuclear safety measures\nshould be drawn up, implemented and managed in a\ncoherent manner, as they both have a common aim to\nprotect the people and their environment. Keeping the\ncommitment that it assumed at the Summit, my country\nhas contributed to international efforts to increase\nglobal awareness of existing energy insecurities and\nways to prevent them by establishing the Nuclear\nSecurity Centre of Excellence in Lithuania.\nIn order to tackle the causes of conflicts, not just\nthe consequences, we have to be honest players. We\nmust honestly define the problems; speak openly about\ntheir reasons; be clear and precise in naming the rules\nof the game; and, last but not least, find in ourselves\nthe political will to play according to the rules globally,\nespecially once agreed upon."

        "file_text": "\ufeffIn the modern world, the\npace of change, whether political, social or economic,\nchallenges our ability to react in a constructive,\nsustainable and just manner. And in the face of change,\nthe role of the General Assembly becomes even more\nimportant, as the President of the General Assembly\nhas reminded us. We look to the United Nations \u2014 our\nUnited Nations and our General Assembly \u2014 to help\nus find the common ground needed for the resolution\nof the big questions of our time. We can truly be a\n\u201cG-193\u201d, as our President has previously remarked.\nAs an oceanic island nation, Seychelles understands\nintrinsically that the development of our region depends\nupon being able to defuse conflict and tension through\ndiplomacy and on defining a framework to properly\nshare all the opportunities that our ocean offers us. In\nthe Indian Ocean, we are particularly concerned with\ntwo issues that challenge the proper application of\nthe rule of law in a sustainable manner: the continued\nproblem of maritime piracy and the resolution of the\npolitical crisis in Madagascar.\nPiracy fundamentally alters our relationship with\nour ocean. Piracy instils fear and uncertainty. We have\ntwo compatriots still being held captive in Somalia, and,\nas long as they remain separated from their families,\nour ocean represents risk for our nation, rather than\nthe opportunity that it should. Establishing the rule of\nlaw in Somalia is obviously the only true long-term and\nsustainable solution to piracy. We welcome the moves\nin Somalia and by the international community to\nstrengthen those efforts.\nSeychelles is already working with the central\nGovernment of Somalia, as well as the regions of\nSomaliland and Puntland, to be able to transfer\nprosecuted prisoners to serve their sentences in their\ncountry of origin. This is a key part of building the rule of law in Somalia. More resources are needed, however,\nto accelerate the building of appropriate infrastructure\nin those parts of Somalia where stability has been\nestablished. We must transform fear and uncertainty\ninto hope and optimism in Somalia itself, as well as in\nthe Indian Ocean.\nSeychelles has committed itself to ending the\nimpunity associated with piracy. Piracy has become a\nglobal business, operated by a transnational criminal\nnetwork. Seychelles, in partnership with the Government\nof the United Kingdom and other international parties,\nis in the process of setting up a regional anti-piracy\nprosecution and intelligence centre. The success of\nthis initiative will depend on strong international\ncooperation. We count on all our partners to work with\nus to ensure a true long-term solution for this issue.\n\nThe Indian Ocean Commission, which Seychelles\nis currently chairing, recognizes the work of the\nUnited Nations in favour of peace, democracy and\nhuman rights, in the interests of the people of its five\nmember States. The crisis facing Madagascar is truly\ntesting the country. It is plunging the population into\ngreat economic and social difficulties, and is affecting\nthe entire region. The Seychelles presidency of the\nCommission continues supporting the implementation\nof the road map developed by the Southern African\nDevelopment Community (SADC). In that context, it\norganized two meetings between Marc Ravalomanana,\nthe former President, and Andry Nirina Rajoelina,\nPresident of the Transition, in Seychelles, with the\ndual mediation of Presidents James Michel and Jacob\nZuma, head of the SADC troika. Those talks, convened\nat the recommendation of the most recent SADC\nSummit, enable us today to look forward to useful and\nrelevant actions for a return to constitutional order in\nMadagascar, in keeping with the electoral timetable\ndrawn up by the United Nations and Madagascar\u2019s\nIndependent National Electoral Commission.\nIn that regard, we should like to express our thanks\nto the transitional Government, which has confirmed\nits contribution to the financing of the elections, in\naccordance with the recommendations of the United\nNations. This is also the time to call on all international\npartners to help ensure fair, transparent and equitable\nelections in that country, which is anxious to regain\nits place on the international stage. Through elections\nMadagascar will return to the rule of law, and it is through the rule of law in Madagascar that we will\nbe able to depend on sustainable development in the\nIndian Ocean.\n\nRespect for the rule of law is also about ensuring\nthat conditions are in place for equity and fairness in the\ninternational system as a whole. Small island developing\nStates (SIDS) are too often on the periphery of most\ninternational decision-making bodies. Seychelles is\nproposing that SIDS be considered as offering unique\nopportunities for testing innovative policies and\ntechnologies that can benefit all humankind. In the\nfight against climate change, SIDS could be at the\nforefront of groundbreaking solutions.\nFor example, the Global Island Partnership,\nco-chaired by Seychelles, Palau and Grenada, has\nproposed considering debt cancellation for SIDS\nto enable them to better prepare for climate change\nadaptation. A large number of SIDS have debt-togross-\ndomestic-product ratios in excess of 100 per\ncent, and such debt forgiveness would give them more\nflexibility within their own budgets to prepare to face\nclimate change, and thus protect some of the most\nenvironmentally sensitive zones on the planet.\nWith regard to the high volatility of international\nfuel prices, SIDS can strengthen their resilience through\ninvestment in renewable energy. We warmly welcome\nthe Sustainable Energy for All initiative championed\nby the Secretary-General, and we commit our support\nto making it a success. While the latest technology in\nrenewable energy often represents a significant capital\noutlay, by developing pilot projects in SIDS we can\npotentially create economies based on 100 per cent\nrenewable energy that can then be replicated on a larger\nscale.\nFinally, it is very important that consideration\nbe given to how to better support SIDS within the\ninternational trading system. Trade-based support for\nSIDS could easily be established without disruption\nor distortion of the global f low of goods and services.\nIslands are particularly reliant on open access to trade\nwith as many countries as possible. In the context of\nthe current challenges to food security, we urge that\nall barriers affecting trade with islands, including the\neconomic embargo on Cuba, be lifted, since they serve\nonly to increase the inherent challenges associated with\ntrading from a position of insularity. As an island State,\nwe are aware that the ocean must connect us, not divide us. The United Nations Conference on Sustainable\nDevelopment has given new momentum to the concept\nof the blue economy.\nWe are also very aware that the ocean will always\nbe a shared space. As an archipelago, we are privileged\nto be custodians of that space. This year, for the first\ntime in the history of the United Nations, Seychelles\nand Mauritius, two neighbouring SIDS, have agreed on\njoint management of an area of extended continental\nshelf of 3,000 square kilometres. That means that we\nare sharing the space for the benefit of our two peoples\u2019\ndevelopment. We are sharing the responsibility and the\nopportunity. We believe that all nations, large or small,\nmust contribute to making this planet a better world to\nlive in.\nSeychelles recently announced its intention to stand\nfor a non-permanent seat on the Security Council in the\nyear 2017, subject to endorsement by the African Union.\nWe are doing so because we believe that the voices of\nall nations matter, whether they are large or small, rich\nor poor. As the smallest African nation, we keenly\nunderstand that we need to fight for Africa\u2019s economic\nindependence. We are committed to the ideals of the\nAfrican Union, on the basis of which we attained our\npolitical freedom. Now more than ever we must invest\nin Africa\u2019s economic freedom. We must create the\nmeans by which Africa\u2019s share of trade and financial\npower can increase at a faster rate. We must empower\nAfrican institutions. Seychelles adds its voice to the call\nfor more investment in the African Development Bank,\nincluding by African nations themselves, by investing\ntheir reserves in it.\nWe must also foster peace on our continent by\nleading efforts to find solutions to our problems,\nsuch as in Somalia, Madagascar and elsewhere in\nAfrica. As a small island developing State, we have a\ngreater understanding than ever of the ways in which\nour planet is under threat from climate change, and\nof the need to act now for the sake of all humankind.\nMost of all, as citizens of planet Earth, we understand\nthat as individuals and as a nation our decisions\nhave consequences beyond our borders. They have\nconsequences for our future and for our children. These\nare all issues that must be weighed carefully, and it is\nimportant that all voices be considered in the debate.\nWe thank the Assembly for giving due consideration to\nthe voice of Seychelles."

        "file_text": "\ufeffI come here\nto the sixty-seventh session of the General Assembly to\nbring, on behalf of the Haitian people, my contribution\nto the debate that today brings together representatives\nof all peoples of the world.\nThe election of Mr. Jeremi\u0107 to the Assembly\npresidency is for me a clear message that the small\nStates Members of the United Nations can play a major\nrole and make their contribution to peace, even in the\nglobal context of a sluggish economy. On behalf of the\nHaitian delegation, I would like to congratulate him\nfor having raised and encouraged the theme for today\u2019s debate, which, unfortunately, is a concern of many\nMembers of the great family of the United Nations.\nAlso permit me to pay a well-deserved tribute to\nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon for the dynamism,\nwisdom, good judgement, vision and courage he has\nshown more than once in managing extremely sensitive\ninternational situations. I also would like to especially\nthank him for the particular attention he has bestowed\non my country, Haiti.\nSince my accession to power, the Haiti I love\nhas attempted, in intent and in deeds \u2014 with many\nups and downs, no doubt with successes and some\nmistakes \u2014 to emerge from its difficulties. I have been\nstrongly dedicated to that effort. I can imagine that, with\nthe impetus provided, results will be forthcoming in a\nmatter of months or years. How could it be otherwise?\nHaiti today, the Haiti that I have the mission of serving,\nhas understood that as long as there are quarrels,\nfrustrations, poverty, underdevelopment and inequality,\nthe world in general and Haiti in particular will never\nbe protected from problems and controversies. As long\nas things are bad within nations, they will be tempted to\nturn to their neighbours and seek quarrels. Throughout\nlong centuries of world history examples have not been\nlacking. That is why we say today that, while it is good\nto seek peaceful solutions to international disputes, it\nwould perhaps be wiser to try to prevent them.\nAs long as access to water and to major markets,\nor just compensation for raw materials and sound\neconomic competitiveness are not available to us, we\nwill continue to have conflicts. As long as we at the\nUnited Nations do not pool our efforts so that access to\nhealth and to jobs and respect for differences become a\nreality, we will continue to face conflicts, and we will\nbe reduced to painfully seeking peaceful solutions.\nWe champion gender equality and we promote\ndemocracy. We daily attempt to apply equal treatment\nfor all under the law. Respect for the environment\nis inscribed in our programme of Government. In\nmy view, those are the parameters that prevent\nuncontrolled migrations, climate change, useless\nwars, religion-related massacres, ethnic conflicts and\nterrorism.\nIn our common quest for harmony in a world with\ndifferent cultures and diverse religions, we must allow\nour national dreams to emerge. Those dreams can be\nsummed up as offering the possibility to every man and\nevery woman, regardless of color, religion or political preference, to live in peace and to rear their children in\ndignity.\nThe Haiti of Toussaint Louverture, over two\ncenturies ago, already understood that. Those national\ndreams, however, will not see the light of day if the\ncommitments made to help the development of\ncountries like ours are not implemented, if prejudice\nand suspicions of all kinds regarding the have-nots still\nprevail. In order to prevent those differences, we must\nregard others in a different way, with eyes purified,\nI would say, at the Pool of Siloam. Haiti continues to\nsuffer from being regarded in the old way.\nOn the eve of Haiti\u2019s presidency of the Caribbean\nCommunity, I repeat that with good faith and goodwill,\nthings can change, because our destinies, whatever\nside we may be on, are intimately intertwined. In a\nworld where the global trend is towards the forming of\neconomic and social blocs, the great can remain great\nonly if they know how to transform the multiplicity\nof children of the planet into a single great social and\neconomic family, respectful of the cultural and religious\ntraditions of all, without exclusion.\nTherefore the necessary dialogue must prevail\namong us, not the dialogue of the deaf in which we have\nbeen powerlessly enmeshed for decades. We must have\nreal exchanges and negotiations that alone can put an\nend to the interminable conflicts, which have brought\nfamilies grief and disrupted the peace of the world.\nHistory has taught us that there is no justice or\nequality in international relations. History has also\ntaught us that every nation looks after its own interests.\nThe establishment of the United Nations kindled hope\namong peoples that things could be different. We cannot\nlet that flame die. Within any family in general and\nwithin the family of the United Nations in particular,\nthere cannot be great and small, giants and dwarfs, but\nequal beings with interests to defend and opinions to\nexpress on the basis of forward-looking relationships,\nrelationships marked by liberty, equality, fraternity and\nthe pursuit of happiness for all.\nBut let us not be misled: the best foundation for\npeace in the world, for prosperity and for defeating\npoverty will always be democracy. Under my\nleadership, Haiti has understood that and is making\nactive use of democracy to strengthen previously weak\nor ineffectual local institutions. Haiti has understood\nthat only veritable democracy can bring stability: it is the indispensable precondition for any development\npolicy.\nI wish to sincerely reiterate from this rostrum the\nurgent need we all must face to stop fighting and to\nwork instead to protect the assets we share on this\nplanet \u2014 to work together to reduce and manage the\nrisks and disasters besetting the world, ruining our\neconomies and hindering development.\nTo my colleagues, the leaders of the world, I wish\nto recall that our respective peoples have chosen us and\nentrusted to us the mandate of building a better world\nwhere no one will be left alone, where our children will\nfinally be able to grow up in peace.\nThe words of Victor Hugo come to mind,\npronounced at the Peace Congress in 1847: \u201cThe day\nwill come when there will be no battlefields other than\nmarkets open to trade and minds open to ideas.\u201d\nThose are my wishes for the assembly of nations.\nMay the good Lord give us His blessings and enlighten\nus. May He bless the city of New York, which is\nreceiving us so warmly, and grant us the wisdom and\ncapacity to work towards a more beautiful and more\njust world."

        "file_text": "\ufeffI am pleased and honoured at the outset to express our\nheartfelt congratulations on the election of Mr. Vuk\nJeremi\u0107 as President of the General Assembly at its\nsixty-seventh session. We have every confidence in his\nefforts and in everything that he will undertake in order\nto maintain the gains made in preserving international\npeace and security and to promote an international\norder that will ensure peace, prosperity and progress\nfor all humankind. I am firmly convinced that the\nproficiency, political skills and spirit of responsibility\nthat he demonstrated when he twice served as Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Serbia will give\nhim the ability to do so.\nI would also like to underscore the continual\nefforts of Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser, President\nof the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth session, and\nhis determination to promote dialogue as an effective\ntool for cooperation and to formulate the best possible\nsolutions to international issues.\nWe would like, too, to congratulate and thank\nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his steadfast\nactivities to preserve international peace and security\nand to promote the Millennium Development Goals, as\nwell as to mobilize the international community to deal\nwith climate change, which now has a negative impact\non the future of humankind.\nThe sixty-seventh session of the General Assembly\nis taking place at a time when many regions of the\nworld are facing particularly difficult political and\neconomic conditions. Aware of the importance of the\nrole and responsibility of our citizens in steering the\ndestiny of the country, we in the Islamic Republic of\nMauritania have been able to carry out a peaceful,\nsmooth transition from a repressive totalitarian regime\nand the mismanagement of public wealth to democratic\nrule based on credible constitutional institutions,\nthereby restoring the rule of law.\nWe are also pleased to see that the peaceful\nsettlement of national and international disputes is the\ntheme selected for this session of the General Assembly,\nand we appreciate the results of the high-level dialogue\non that important subject.\nFrom that standpoint, my country has enacted a\nseries of laws and reforms enshrining individual and\ncollective political freedoms, guaranteeing the people\nas a whole the full exercise of those basic rights, subject\nto the rule of law, and ensuring the independence of\nthe judiciary. In that context, the Islamic Republic\nof Mauritania has sought to fulfil all the obligations\nand commitments it undertook under the tripartite\nagreement with the Office of the United Nations High\nCommissioner for Refugees, on the one hand, and the\nGovernment of the host State, the sister Republic of\nSenegal, on the other. The agreement concerned the\norganized return of Mauritanians who had been living\nin Senegal since the end of the 1980s. The operation\nwas completed in perfect accord with all the parties\ninvolved and consisted of the organized return of 106 contingents, totalling 24,536 refugees, between\n29 January 2008 and 25 March 2012.\nMr. Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz, President of the\nIslamic Republic of Mauritania, personally presided\nover an official ceremony on 25 March in the city\nof Rosso, which is the capital of the state of Traza.\nThat was an opportunity for the High Commissioner\nfor Refugees, Mr. Antonio Guterres, to solemnly\nproclaim that the issue of the Mauritanian refugees\nin Senegal was finally closed. Along the same lines,\nthe Government undertook to resolve the issue of the\nso-called humanitarian debt by paying those victims\nwho were entitled to compensation and by settling the\nsituation of members of the armed and security forces,\nGovernment workers and contract civil servants, whose\nrights were also restored.\nThere has been a genuine and transparent political\ndialogue between the parties of the President\u2019s majority\nand certain democratic opposition parties, which led to\nan agreement late last year. The agreement included the\ncreation of a national independent electoral commission\nthat is completely autonomous and that will fully\noversee the upcoming elections, beginning with the\nlegislative and municipal elections. In addition, there\nhave been many important constitutional reforms, as\ncalled for by the democratic opposition.\nMauritania has worked to strengthen good\ngovernance by ensuring transparency in the\nmanagement of public funds and by enhancing the\nindependent judicial system, particularly by improving\nthe conditions of judges and guaranteeing their\nindependence. The economy has seen sustained growth,\nincluding the implementation of ambitious programmes\naimed at improving the living conditions of the people,\nespecially those with low incomes.\nSince the accession to the presidency of Mr. Ould\nAbdel Aziz, the Islamic Republic of Mauritania has been\nreactivating its presence in regional and international\norganizations, first and foremost in the United Nations\nand its specialized agencies. We adhere fully to its\nnoble ideals, and we comply with the resolutions, as a\nstrategic choice for our foreign policy. In this regard, we\nreaffirm our support for reform of the United Nations\nsystem, particularly the Security Council.\nWe reiterate our desire to see the African continent\nreceive a permanent seat on the Council, since it\nis the only continent that does not have permanent\nrepresentation in the body that addresses international peace and security. That is true despite the fact that one\nbillion people inhabit the continent of Africa and two\nthirds of peacekeeping operations take place there. In\naddition, we call for a permanent seat on the Council\nfor the Arab Group because of its demographic weight\nvis-\u00e0-vis the global population and its considerable\neconomic potential, in particular in the area of energy.\nMy country provides effective support to\nintergovernmental efforts that have been taking place\nfor a number of years to find a solution that enjoys\nthe consensus of Member States on the reform of\nthe United Nations in general, the working methods\nand mechanisms of its decision-making bodies, and\nabove all, membership in the Security Council and\nthe issue of defining its authority and codifying its\nworking relationship with the General Assembly in\norder to ensure the effectiveness of our Organization\nin faithfully reflecting the will of the international\ncommunity.\nWe note with great satisfaction the tireless efforts\nto achieve consensus during the sixty-seventh session,\nincluding with regard to the conclusions of the United\nNations Conference on Sustainable Development,\nwhich will undoubtedly contribute \u2014 if they are\nimplemented, obviously \u2014 to limiting the major risks\nfacing our planet, in particular the phenomena of global\nwarming and climate change, which are now the clear\nconcern and danger facing humankind.\nWe welcome the outcomes of the Second Conference\nto Review Progress Made in the Implementation of\nthe United Nations Programme of Action to Prevent,\nCombat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms\nand Light Weapons in All Its Aspects, which led to a\nconsensus agreement on a programme of action to\nprevent the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons.\nDespite the efforts made and results achieved\nduring the Assembly\u2019s sixty-sixth and earlier sessions,\nincluding the Millennium Summit, despite the\nestablishment of goals and the adoption of an agenda to\nachieve them, most developing countries, particularly\nthe least developed, are falling short of achieving their\nobjectives. This is due to a range of factors, including,\nfor example, endemic unemployment, particularly\namong young people; the prevalence of extreme poverty\namong the most vulnerable segments of society; and the\nslowing of growth and stagnation of the global economy.\nForeign direct investment is declining in Africa. The\nprices of basic goods on international markets are rising, which has a direct impact on purchasing power in many\npoor countries, where a large part of the population lives\non less than $1 per day. Rates of net financial transfers\nto developing countries are falling, and revenue from\ntourism is falling acutely. Infant mortality is rising.\nThe heavy debt burden seriously slows the economies\nof developing countries, especially least developed, and\ndirectly affects the already modest financial resources\nof the countries, thereby hampering their ability to\nmeet their basic needs in terms of infrastructure and\npublic services.\nAgainst this worrying backdrop, we call on rich\ncountries and donors to honour their commitment to\ncontribute to the economies of developing countries,\ngiving priority to least developed, so that they can have\nacceptable access to public services, thus ensuring\npeaceful civil order, security, stability and social\ncohesion in those countries, and thereby safeguard\npeace around the world.\nAt the initiative, and with the support, of President\nMohamed Ould Abdel Aziz, our Government has\nendeavoured to provide citizens decent living\nconditions and to help them in times of crises. In this\nconnection, an emergency intervention plan, known as\nthe 2012 Hope Plan, supported by some $170 million\nof State budgetary resources, was launched to deal\nwith declining agricultural production and pastures\ndeclining owing to a lack of rain last year, as our\ncountry is greatly dependent on farming and livestock-\nraising. This ambitious plan is providing food and\ndrinking water for both people and livestock, and at\naffordable prices with a view to mitigate the impact of\nthe crisis, in particular for the poorest segments of the\npopulation. This plan has been unanimously received\nas a clear success on all levels. It has allowed us to avert\nfamine, epidemics and serious malnutrition in children,\npregnant women and nursing mothers. Even livestock\nepidemics have been averted, with losses being kept\nwithin reasonable limits.\nOur Government is also working tirelessly to\nbroaden access to education and to improve both the\nquality and quantity of teaching and to broaden health\ncoverage throughout the nation. We have built a modern\ncancer hospital, which is among the best equipped in\nthe region, and a cardiology hospital and a diabetes\ncentre, not to mention the establishment of 50 dialysis\ncentres. All of this was achieved in a record time of\njust over three years since the accession to power of President Ould Abdel Aziz following the elections of\n18 July 2009.\nOur subregion, the Sahel, has been for some years\na haven for organized crime networks of many types,\nfrom smuggling drugs, weapons and munitions to\nhuman trafficking, illegal immigration, hostage-taking\nand especially terrorism. Together they have led to the\nextremely serious situation currently unfolding in our\nfriendly neighbour, Mali, whose northern regions in\nparticular represent a serious threat to the security of\nthe entire subregion.\nGiven those conditions, we are following\ndevelopments in Mali with great concern. Reaffirming\nour deep commitment to the unity and territorial\nintegrity of Mali, we hope that the international\ncommunity, through the Security Council, will fully\nshoulder its responsibilities and take the necessary\ndecisions, in consultation with the Government of Mali\nand neighbouring countries, with a view to achieving\na swift solution that would ensure the re-establishment\nof State authority throughout the territory, a return\nto peaceful civil order for all of Mali\u2019s people and\nthe complete and lasting eradication of terrorism and\norganized crime in northern Mali and the Sahel as a\nwhole.\nThe Islamic Republic of Mauritania has steadfastly\ntaken principled positions with regard to that tragic\ncrisis. We swiftly condemned the military coup d\u2019\u00e9tat\nthat ousted the elected President and interrupted\nthe electoral process. We have strenuously rejected\nseparatist claims and unequivocally condemned the\noccupation of northern Mali by armed terrorist groups.\nWe have continuously reaffirmed our commitment to\nthe unity, territorial integrity and social cohesion of\nsisterly Mali.\nMy country swiftly and early took all appropriate\nmeasures to accept refugees from Mali. Today there\nare more than 110,000 in a camp that has become\nthe second largest city in Mauritania in terms of\npopulation, after the capital Nouakchott. Despite the\nsevere constraints linked to drought and the scarcity of\nfinancial resources, Mauritania is providing shelter to\nthose refugees in satisfactory conditions that meet with\nthe approval of international humanitarian agencies,\nincluding the United Nations High Commissioner\nfor Refugees, with whom we work very closely and\nmaintain constant contact. My country is perfectly aware of the close\nrelationship between security, development and\ndemocracy and of the fact that security is a necessary\ncondition for development, for the establishment of\ndemocracy and for strengthening the institutions of\nthe rule of law. We have therefore made the adoption\nof the necessary array of legislation a top priority and\nhas committed to adopting measures to guarantee\nthe security and safety of our citizens and of foreign\nnationals residing in our country among our hospitable,\nwarm people. Our armed and security forces have\nresolutely and courageously faced criminal terrorist\narmed groups that have threatened our security and that\nof our guests. We have therefore been able to secure our\nborders and restore our sovereignty in each area of our\ncountry, and we now control all access points, despite\nthe great length of our borders.\nThe Islamic Republic of Mauritania is most\nseriously following the dramatic developments of the\nsituation in the sisterly Syrian Arab Republic. We call\non all parties involved to put an end to the escalating\nviolence and to focus on dialogue in order to find\na peaceful solution to the crisis so that the brotherly\nSyrian people can avoid further horror, desolation and\ndestruction, as well as to ensure the unity and territorial\nintegrity of Syria and the cohesion of its social fabric.\nWe have every hope that the mission of the Special Joint\nRepresentative of the United Nations and the League of\nArab States, Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi, whom my country\nfully supports, will be able to open the path to a positive\nsolution to that crisis, which poses a serious threat to\nthe peace and security of the entire Middle East and\nthe entire world, with extremely negative effects on the\nSyrian economy.\nWe enthusiastically welcome the democratic\nchanges that took place in Tunisia, Yemen, Egypt\nand Libya. We are convinced they will contribute to\nconsolidating civil peace and security and will bring\nabout a shining future for those fraternal countries and\npeoples.\nWe have the firm hope that the agreements recently\nreached between the Sudan and the Republic of South\nSudan will lead to the peaceful settlement of all\npending issues between those two States. My country\nis also wholly satisfied with the recent legislative and\npresidential elections in Somalia. We hope they will\nstrengthen peace and security in that brotherly country,\nwhich has been devastated for two decades by the\ncollapse of central power and by a number of other difficulties, including the destruction of infrastructure\nand the displacement of its people, armed conflicts\nbetween warlords, and the activities of armed terrorist\ngroups that have sown terror among innocent civilians.\nMy country is closely following the issue of\nWestern Sahara. We reiterate our full support for the\nefforts of the Secretary-General and of his Special\nEnvoy aimed at bringing about a lasting, comprehensive\nand fair solution that would have the consent of both\nparties and would serve to uphold peace and security\nin the region and thereby promote the establishment\nof a progressive, prosperous Arab Maghreb, which our\npeople legitimately hope for.\nThe Israeli-Arab conflict is a permanent source\nof hatred and hostility and a serious threat to peace\nand security in a vital region of the world. The legal\nframework and the general conditions to address that\nsituation have been defined and reiterated for a long\ntime now, in a spate of resolutions in the Security\nCouncil and the General Assembly. That has all been\nformally confirmed via the Arab Peace Initiative,\nwhich is based on the principle of land for peace\nand which aims at resolving the ongoing conflict,\nTherefore we urge the international community to\ngrant the request that Mahmoud Abbas, President of\nthe Palestinian Authority, made in the last Assembly\nsession, seeking the recognition of the Palestinian State\nby the international community, within the borders of\n4 June 1967.\nThat is the only way to end the suffering of the\nPalestinian people, which has gone on for almost as\nlong as this Organization has existed. It is also the way\nfor the international community to shoulder its historic\nresponsibility with respect to Palestine and the desire\nto achieve justice and to ensure credibility and equity\nbetween the two parties to the conflict, in compliance\nwith the relevant resolutions of international legality.\nWe also reiterate our condemnation of the standing\nembargo of the Gaza Strip and the crimes perpetrated\nby the Israeli war machine against Palestinian civilians,\nalong with the massive destruction of their properties\nand infrastructure.\nIt is no longer acceptable that all those paths\ncontinue to be firmly closed off to an unarmed\nPalestinian people, who have been assigned to fictitious\nnegotiations that are themselves an insurmountable\nobstacle to their achieving their most basic right, which\nis the establishment of their national independent State on the borders of 4 June 1967, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif\nas its capital.\nPromoting a culture of peace and the values\nand spirit of tolerance among different peoples and\ncivilizations and establishing equity and justice among\nand between peoples at a global level are the right ways\nto safeguard peace and security in our world. There are\noutstanding issues without any prospects for solution.\nThere is a huge gap between rich and poor. There are\nimbalances in the global economic infrastructure and\nan absence of genuine justice, equity, and equality. All\nof those issues have contributed to the escalation of\nareas of tension and the expansion of the phenomenon\nof terrorism.\nThe Islamic Republic of Mauritania rejects\nterrorism in all its forms and manifestations. We are\ncommitted to our Islamic values, which require that we\nrespect tolerance and fraternity and reject any form of\nextremism and violence. The international community\nurgently needs to study the reasons for extremism and\nthe best ways to uproot and eradicate that problem.\nThe noble ideals by which the international\ncommunity was guided during the creation of this\nOrganization will be respected only if the States and\npeoples of the world can benefit from the potential\nof development to provide the conditions for a decent\nlife for all human beings, especially in developing\ncountries, while respecting the values of freedom and\nequity. That is how we will be able to achieve the values\nthat are at the very basis of the United Nations."

        "file_text": "\ufeffAllow\nme to begin by congratulating Mr. Vuk Jeremi\u0107 on\nhis election as President of the General Assembly at\nits sixty-seventh session. I am convinced that with\nhis leadership and drive, this lofty institution will be\ncapable of facing the numerous challenges that will\narise in the next 12 months.\nI also wish to express my gratitude to his\npredecessor, Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser. I join\nothers in congratulating him on his work and wish him\nall the best in his new endeavours.\nSpain believes that the United Nations has a\nfundamental role to play. That is why I wished to\nparticipate in this general debate, the first since I took\nthe oath of office as President of the Government of\nSpain. It is always an honour for a Head of Government\nto address the General Assembly. I do so today on behalf\nof a country that is committed to the international\ncommunity and to the pursuit of joint solutions to the\nproblems we face.\nThe result of that commitment is our desire to serve\nonce again in the Security Council for the period 2015-\n2016. In my statement, I shall refer to the reasons for Spain\u2019s resolve to work in the Council with an open and\nconstructive spirit, committed to peace and international\nsecurity, the promotion and protection of human rights,\nand the search for sustainable development for all.\nIn addition to the serious economic and financial\nsituation, the international community is facing today\nmore numerous and more complicated challenges\nthan ever before. The Organization and its General\nAssembly are key if we are to confront them. Year after\nyear, we discuss those problems here and their possible\nsolutions. For that reason, I believe that we should ask\nourselves today if we have improved since last year.\nWhile it might seem otherwise, I believe we have.\nIn one year, we have witnessed the unbreakable\nwill of the Arab citizens to consolidate democratic\nsystems in their countries. In Spain, we went through a\ndifficult but successful transition to democracy. Hence,\nwe know that the road is not and will not be easy. Our\nexperience can be useful for all Arab countries that\nare going through transition processes. I reaffirm our\ncommitment to building open, inclusive and democratic\nsocieties whose institutions satisfy the yearnings for\ndignity and for the development of its citizens. In those\nprocesses, there is no room for movements that promote\nviolence, whatever its justification. Any attack or\naggression against people or institutions is unacceptable\nand deserves our most full-throated condemnation.\nLast year, we also dedicated our efforts to finding\nsolutions to the crisis in the Horn of Africa, and\nespecially to the situation in Somalia. The difficulties\npersist, but Somalia is advancing towards normality.\nCooperation in the fight against piracy in the Indian\nOcean is stronger than ever, and during our recent\npresidency of the Contact Group on Piracy off the\nCoast of Somalia, we moved forward in the search of\nan international response to that criminal phenomenon.\nSimilarly, humanitarian efforts in that region have\nallowed for an improvement of the situation. Four\nmonths ago, Spain and the World Food Programme\n(WFP) signed an agreement to locate the largest food\nstorage facility in the world in the Canary Islands.\nThe WFP facility will allow faster and more efficient\nresponses to food emergencies on the African continent.\nAfghanistan continues moving forward in the\ndirection of stability \u2014 a road that Spain has pursued\ntogether with the Afghan people for more than a\ndecade. In that effort, we have bequeathed resources,\ninfrastructures and, unfortunately, the life of many of our fellow citizens. My country will continue to\ncontribute to the development of Afghanistan and its\nsearch for much-needed stability and security.\nThis year, in Rio de Janeiro, we reaffirmed\nour common vision in favour of an economically,\nsocially and environmentally sustainable future.\nSince their conception, Spain has been committed to\nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) with\nthe largest cooperation programme in its history,\nvalued at almost $1 billion, implemented through the\nSpain-United Nations Development Programme MDG\nAchievement Fund. Negotiations are under way to set\nnew goals for sustainable development and to bring the\ninstitutional structure in step with that commitment.\nSpain will maintain an active and constructive presence\nin the process.\nThe fight against international impunity has also\nseen important advances this year. The International\nCriminal Court initiated its first case against a Head of\nState, demonstrating that the international community\nis closer than ever to ending impunity for serious\ncrimes. I would like to reiterate today the call for the\nuniversal ratification of the Rome Statute.\nI would like to make special mention of the valuable\nand increasing role that Latin America has played\nin the development of the multilateral system. The\nachievements and progress that the region has attained\nin the consolidation of democracy, economic growth\nand regional integration are reflected in its greater\ninternational presence.\nLatin America has shown its potential by\nstrengthening the multilateralism promoted by the\nOrganization. Spain is proud to share in that spirit at\nthe Ibero-American summits and will be hosting this\nyear\u2019s summit in C\u00e1diz, Spain. That forum reflects the\nIbero-American community\u2019s wager on the promise of\ndialogue, equality and mutual respect, with our eyes\nfirmly set on the future.\nI believe that those steps forward, among others,\nattest to an encouraging year, despite its difficulties. It\nis proof that the multilateral system is responding to the\npresent crisis and promoting respect for and the active\nprotection of human rights, as well as the presence and\nparticipation of women in all areas regions. But, of\ncourse, there are problems on which there has been little\nor no progress at all or that have emerged throughout\nthe present year. Those problems deserve as much if not\nmore of our attention in the 12 months that lie ahead. First of all, I would like to mention the crisis in\nSyria. A year ago, in the General Assembly, an urgent\nappeal was made to the Syrian regime to halt the abuses\nand crimes against its people. Despite the international\ncommunity\u2019s efforts, the situation has not ceased\nto deteriorate. Thousands of innocent victims, the\nunbearable suffering of the civilian population and the\nserious risk of the conflict expanding to neighbouring\ncountries compel us to act. Today, I reiterate the call to\nend all violence in Syria and urge President Al-Assad\nto accept his responsibility and make way for a political\nprocess that will allow a peaceful resolution to the\nconflict. We support the efforts of the Joint Special\nRepresentative, Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi, to reach this\ngoal. The international community, the United Nations,\nthe League of Arab States and the European Union\ncontinue to be prepared, through different mechanisms,\nto come to Syria\u2019s aid.\nIn this uncertain regional scenario, Lebanon has so\nfar managed to keep itself on the margin of the spiral of\nviolence, an achievement that has been reached in good\nmeasure thanks to the contingent of United Nations\nInterim Force in Lebanon, in which Spain is an active\nparticipant.\nAnother year has passed without progress in the\nMiddle East peace process. We defend the idea that\nthe solution to the conflict in the Middle East lies\nin the existence of two States, the Israeli State and\nthe Palestinian State, living in peace and security.\nAny delay in achieving that goal leads to growing\nfrustration that will affect the rest of the world. The\ninternational community, and, above all, the actors\ninvolved must have the courage to adopt the measures\nand decisions needed to achieve that comprehensive,\njust and durable peace that responds to the legitimate\nyearnings of both peoples. My Government, committed\nto the goal of peace, is convinced that the creation of a\nviable Palestinian State is a key element in the solution\nof the conflict. It will bring beneficial effects for the\nsecurity and welfare of Israel, for the normalization\nof regional relations and, finally, for the international\ncommunity as a whole. Until then, the parties must\navoid endangering the viability of a two-State solution.\nThe situation in Mali and the entire Sahel region\nis particularly serious. The humanitarian crisis has\nbeen aggravated by political instability and an armed\nrevolt, which has deteriorated into terrorist movements\nthat have caused considerable harm to the population\nin northern Mali. Spain unreservedly condemns violence and supports the efforts of the United Nations,\nthe African Union, and the Economic Community of\nWest African States to reach a solution to the crisis.\nThose efforts must count on the decisive support of\nthe countries of the region, whose people also endure\ninsecurity caused by the situation. And above all, the\nprocess must be led by the people of Mali themselves,\nwho need to overcome their institutional crisis and\nre-establish the territorial integrity of their country.\nOn other matters, I would like to highlight the\nefforts of the international community in general and of\nthe E3+3 Group in particular to relaunch conversations\nwith Iran with the goal of eliminating all doubts raised\nby the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)\nregarding its nuclear enrichment programme. Those\nconversations are sustained by the desire to reach a\npolitical and diplomatic solution and are an opportunity\nthat we hope all actors involved will take advantage\nof. We reiterate our appeal to Iran to comply with\nthe relevant resolutions without delay and to ratify\nand observe the additional protocol of the IAEA\u2019s\ncomprehensive safeguards agreement.\nI would also like to express our support for the Six-\nParty Talks as a framework for finding a diplomatic\nsolution to the crisis raised by the nuclear programme of\nthe Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea. We consider\nthat the country must put a stop to its nuclear activities\nwith military aims in a complete and verifiable manner,\nand it must comply with all Security Council resolutions\non the matter and respect its commitments to the Treaty\non the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.\nThis year we have moved towards a more peaceful,\njust and sustainable world. However, as reflected in\nthe cases I have just mentioned, much remains to be\ndone. To achieve this, Spain will continue to work with\nthe United Nations, for we believe that only through\na concerted effort of the international community can\nwe find solutions. My country\u2019s wish to serve on the\nSecurity Council in 2015 and 2016 responds precisely\nto the conviction that in the Council Spain can continue\nplaying an active role in the search for joint solutions\nto common problems. That conviction is supported by\nSpain\u2019s accomplishments to date, by our demonstrated\ncommitment to multilateralism and by the initiatives\nled by our country in the search for international\nunderstanding and sustainable development.\nSpain will continue to contribute, to the best of\nits ability, to peacekeeping operations by providing troops and through the United Nations operational\nfield support base at Quart de Poblet, in Spain. Our\ncommitment to the United Nations will remain firm,\nas we actively participate in those initiatives that we\nhave been supporting in the past few years because we\nbelieve that they are key to achieving the future we\ndesire.\nDisarmament and non-proliferation must be shared\nobjectives for the entire international community. We\nbelieve that it is necessary to reactivate the Conference\non Disarmament with an ambitious programme of\nwork. Spain also supports renewing the General\nAssembly mandate to proceed with the negotiations\nof an arms trade treaty. We will continue to work for\na solid, effective and legally binding document that\nreflects the defence of human rights and international\nhumanitarian rights.\nAs a member of the Human Rights Council, we will\ncontinue to defend the undeniable link between respect\nfor human rights and peace and security in the world.\nWe will also continue to work towards a universal\nmoratorium on the death penalty.\nMy country will continue to support negotiations\nwithin the United Nations of a comprehensive\nconvention on international terrorism. Terrorism is a\nvicious trait that unfortunately Spain knows very well.\nI would like to take a moment today to remember and\npay tribute to all the victims of terrorism. In July, a\nHigh-Level Conference on Victims of Terrorism\nwas held in Madrid in the framework of the Global\nCounterterrorism Forum. There we reiterated that\nvictims can plan an important role in the complete\ndelegitimization, in both social and moral terms, of\nterrorism. I wish to acknowledge the support of the\nSecretary-General and of the President of the General\nAssembly in this task.\nWe will continue to promote the goals of\nUN-Women, after a first year full of work and results.\nIn that regard, Spain, which has been the biggest\ndonor to this entity during its first year, maintains its\ncommitment to equality between men and women and\nto the efforts to put an end to violence against women\nand girls.\nMy country is a firm defender of dialogue and\nthe use of peaceful means to resolve controversies.\nFor that reason, next Friday, together with Morocco,\nwe will present an initiative to promote mediation\nand to develop national and local capacities in the Mediterranean basin. The initiative will be the first\nembodiment in that region of resolution 65/283 and of\nthe work of the Secretary-General and the Group of\nFriends of Mediation.\nSpain maintains its active commitment to a just,\nenduring and mutually acceptable political solution to\nthe dispute in Western Sahara, a solution that provides\nfor the self-determination of the Saharan people in\naccordance with the principles and objectives of the\nCharter of the United Nations. As a member of the\nGroup of Friends, Spain firmly supports the work of the\nSecretary-General, his Personal Envoy and the United\nNations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara.\nBetween countries that are friends and allies, as\nis the case between Spain and the United Kingdom,\na direct and sincere dialogue should make it possible\nto overcome any differences. Therefore, I would\nlike to call upon the United Kingdom to renew the\nbilateral dialogue on the decolonization of Gibraltar in\naccordance with the parameters indicated by the United\nNations and enshrined in the Brussels Declaration of\n1984. We have already lost too many years.\nThe efforts of the Member States of the United\nNations will not be sufficient if they are not accompanied\nby the necessary adaptation of the United Nations to the\ncurrent world. The Secretary-General has launched a\nprocess aimed at reforming the Organization, which my\ncountry is following closely. I would like to reiterate\nthat Spain supports his efforts, and we call upon the rest\nof the Member States to continue their open dialogue on\nhis proposals, analysing them without any prejudices\nand showing sufficient courage to break with the status\nquo when necessary.\nIn that regard, I should like to reiterate our support\nfor the reforms of the Secretary-General in the area of\npeacekeeping operations. Likewise, Spain is a strong\ndriving force behind the Delivering as One initiative,\nwhich is an essential undertaking aimed at modernizing\nthe United Nations system, improving its effectiveness\nand efficiency in the fight against poverty and\ninequality, and thereby making it possible to do more\nwith less. Proof of Spain\u2019s commitment to that initiative\nis the fact that my country has been the largest donor\nthereto, providing more than half of the total funding.\nLastly, the Security Council must also adapt,\nas quickly as possible, to the realities of the twenty-\nfirst century, which are very different from those that\nexisted when it was created. In the coming months, we will continue to be open to dialogue on this issue,\nand we hope that, under the leadership of President\nJeremi\u0107, we will be able to find common ground among\nthe different positions on the issue on which we can\nbuild a new Security Council that is more effective,\ninclusive, representative and responsible to the General\nAssembly.\nWe are facing many challenges. Spain is strongly\ndetermined to contribute to those efforts so that in 12\nmonths, when we meet here again, the list of problems\nbefore us is shorter and we can have a United Nations\nthat is more effective and efficient than it was a year\npreviously. The United Nations will continue to be a\nguarantor of international peace and security, and a\ndriving force for the protection of human rights and the\npromotion of sustainable development for our future\nand that of our children. The General Assembly can\ncount on Spain to participate in that endeavour with the\nsame determination as always."

        "file_text": "\ufeffI would like to congratulate\nPresident Jeremi\u0107 on his election to serve as the highest\nrepresentative of the General Assembly at its sixty-\nseventh session. In recent decades, his country has gone\nthrough a difficult period. I am sure his experience as\nthe Serbian Minister for Foreign Affairs who saw the\nconsequences of one kind of peacefully negotiated\nsettlement and armed international intervention will\nbenefit this year\u2019s General Assembly and contribute\nto making our deliberations less formal and more\npractical.\nMr. Tanin (Afghanistan), Vice-President, took the\nChair.\nThe Czech Republic firmly believes that\ninternational disputes and conflicts can and should\nbe settled by peaceful, not military, means. We have\nbeen systematically demonstrating that for a long time.\nWhen the division of Czechoslovakia was taking place\n20 years ago and the situation was emotionally strained\nand painful for us, it never crossed the mind of any of our\npoliticians that the problem should be addressed by any\nother than peaceful means. The difficult negotiations,\nundertaken solely by our own representatives, resulted\nin achieving a settlement that political representatives\nand, especially, citizens in both the newly established\nStates considered then and still consider to be a positive\nsolution.\nOur experience affirms that it is the domestic\npoliticians, in particular, who should be the driving force of negotiations rather than international teams\nor former political figures from abroad. The mandate\nof the negotiating parties must be rooted as firmly as\npossible in domestic conditions and local traditions.\nExternal observers must not succumb to the temptation\nof imposing the settlement that they themselves regard\nas the right one, but which is not in line with long-\nterm natural developments in the country or region\nin question. For a number of reasons, those inevitable\npreconditions are often not met in attempts at peaceful\nconflict resolution. It is therefore no wonder that we\noften see the opposite results to those that the architects\nof a particular settlement would have wished.\nWe must ask ourselves what successful peace\ntalks and international missions are. Do external\ninterventions improve the situation or do they make it\nworse by hindering spontaneous processes that could\nreintroduce stability in the region, possibly with smaller\nsacrifices compared to the price paid through external\nintervention? For instance, are the developments in\nIraq, the unresolved Cyprus issue or the independence\nof Kosovo a success of the United Nations or not?\nLet me say a few words about Syria. As a country\nthat has recent historical experience of a transition\nto democracy, the Czech Republic wishes Syria to be\nable to take the same path. However, we do not see\na feasible solution now. Our immediate effort must\nfocus on helping the people affected by the current\ntragic situation in the country. The Czech Republic has\nalready sent humanitarian aid to Syria and to Syrians\nf leeing into neighbouring countries. We have set up a\nmedical evacuation programme for wounded Syrian\nrefugees. Czech experts took part in the United Nations\nobserver mission in Syria. Our Embassy in Damascus\nis also providing assistance. Two months ago, the Czech\nRepublic accepted the request of the United States for\nrepresentation in diplomatic and consular matters in\nSyria.\nThere is no doubt that we must look at the situation\nin Syria from a broader and longer-term perspective.\nWe should know what needs to be done tomorrow and\nthe day after tomorrow. I am afraid that that is the most\nimportant lesson learned from other similar issues,\nsuch as the recent military intervention in Libya.\nAllow me to affirm that the Czech Republic will\ncontinue to be an active United Nations Member. The\nCzech Republic observes and applies the principles\nand standards of international law in its foreign policy and promotes their international application. We\nwill support United Nations activities in the fields\nof disarmament and the non-proliferation of nuclear\nweapons. Those issues are among our security policy\npriorities. The Czech Republic will continue to take\npart in United Nations peacekeeping operations, as\nwell as in humanitarian and development programmes.\nIt also supports efforts to reform the United Nations,\nincluding the Security Council, which in 2005 began to\nwork towards responding to our changed international\nenvironment and promoting a more balanced\nrepresentation of individual regions and States."

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt is an\nhonour to address the opening of the sixty-seventh\nregular session of the General Assembly.\nFirst of all, allow me to begin with a moment of\nsilence in tribute to all the diplomats, from so many\ncountries, who have lost their lives in the service of\nour common humanity and in the pursuit of deeper\nunderstanding among countries.\n\nWith the opening of this session, the General\nAssembly has passed an important milestone. Since the\nfirst session was convened in Central Hall Westminster\nin London in January 1946 until the calling to order of\nthis new session, precisely 66 years and eight months\nhave elapsed. The General Assembly is now two thirds\nof a century old \u2014 two thirds of a century during which\nthe Assembly and the planet have been witness to both\ngreat achievements and grave injustices and have seen\nboth human triumphs and human tragedies.\nIt has been two thirds of a century during which\nthe peoples of the world made powerful progress. We\nhave launched humans into orbit. We have mapped the\nhuman genome and unlocked various mysteries of life\nand science. We have pulled hundreds of millions of\npeople out of abject poverty. And yet it has also been\ntwo thirds of a century during which we suffered deep\ndisappointment \u2014 the worst incidents of terrorism\nin the world\u2019s history, including the largest terror\nattack ever, here in New York on 11 September 2001;\nthe failure to anticipate and prevent genocide in\nCambodia and Rwanda; and the stubborn persistence\nof totalitarianism and despotism. Some developments\nwere predictable. Others no one foresaw, and nobody\ncould have scripted.\nAs we stand on the threshold of the next third of a\ncentury, we are reminded of that old adage, \u201cthe only analogy. At one time, sailors would navigate by the\nNorth Star. Winds and currents would shift, storms\nwould blow, ships might even veer off course, but the\nNorth Star remained fixed \u2014 as a guide and as a goal.\nIn the same way, the only way for us to navigate the\nseas of change is to follow fixed principles and chart a\ncourse for immutable goals. In our opinion, those goals\nare the well-being, prosperity, security and dignity of\nhumankind, objectives that are reflected in the purposes\ninscribed in Article 1 of the United Nations Charter.\nWe owe it to those we serve \u2014 to the people of this\nplanet \u2014 to maintain consistent effort in that direction.\nThey will judge our success by how well we further\nthe ends of prosperity, security, and human dignity. One\nmeasures results by measuring the results themselves,\nnot by weighing best efforts, not by counting good\nintentions, and not by calculating inputs. I do not\npropose, therefore, to dwell extensively on reform of\nthe United Nations. This Organization is not a goal; it\nis merely the means to accomplish goals. However, the\nUnited Nations must spend less time looking at itself,\nand more time focused on the problems that demand its\nattention. I make that observation in a constructive and\npositive spirit.\nCanada was an original signatory to the Charter,\nand is today the seventh-largest contributor to the\nbudget of this important Organization. Our commitment\nto the United Nations has been tested and is proven.\nOur commitment to the United Nations is important.\nNevertheless, because of our commitment to this body,\nwe cannot and will not participate in endless, fruitless\ninward-looking exercises.\nCanada\u2019s Permanent Mission to the United Nations\nwill henceforth devote primary attention to what the\nUnited Nations is achieving, not to how the United\nNations arranges its affairs. The United Nations spends\ntoo much time on itself. It must now look outward. The\npreoccupation with procedure and process must yield\nto substance and results. If the United Nations focuses\non the achievement of goals \u2014 such as prosperity,\nsecurity and human dignity \u2014 then reform will take\ncare of itself. As the international community sets its\nsights on a post-2015 development framework, it should\nnot forget the work that remains to be done and the\ncommitments it has made.\nThe United Nations Commission on Information\nand Accountability for Women\u2019s and Children\u2019s Health,\nco-chaired by Canada\u2019s Prime Minister, Stephen\nHarper, and President Jakaya Kikwete of the United\nRepublic of Tanzania, is the type of initiative that\nCanada would like to see more of in the future, and its\nrecommendations need to be integrated into a post-2015\nframework.\nThe Preamble to the Charter of the United Nations\nreflects our collective determination to achieve \u201cbetter\nstandards of life\u201d for all humankind. It sets as a goal\n\u201cthe economic and social advancement of all peoples\u201d.\nThat is no mean ambition. Those of us who recognize\na Creator accept the responsibility to use the Creator\u2019s\ngifts to improve the well-being of all. Openness and\nengagement are vital to progress and prosperity. Since\nbefore recorded history, societies have reached out to\ntheir neighbours and beyond. As soon as human beings\ninvented transport, we invented trade, exchanging not\njust the fruits of the Earth, but also goods, practices and\nideas. Informed by our successes and failures \u2014 that\nis, having benefited from engagement and having paid\nthe price of isolation \u2014 humankind has learned several\nlessons. We cannot develop understanding by building\nwalls between cultures. We cannot achieve prosperity\nby erecting walls between economies. And we cannot\nadvance a people by putting walls between them and\nthe State.\nIt is no longer necessary for humankind to endlessly\ndebate how to make people better off. There is no\nspecial alchemy required. Blessed with the benefit of\nhuman experience, we know what produces prosperity:\nfree trade among open societies operating under\ntransparent, consistent and fair rules. As Secretary-\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon recently wrote, \u201cengaging in the\nworld is the best path to a better future\u201d.\nThe fight for the economic and social advancement\nof all peoples is manifested in the struggle for open\nmarkets, open society and open-mindedness. It is a\nstruggle in which Canada is decidedly not neutral. We\nrecognize that the well-being of Canadians depends\nboth on openness at home and on openness to the world.\nCanadians know, from experience, the connection\nbetween trade and prosperity. After all, in order to\nsupport the world\u2019s tenth-largest economy with only\nthe world\u2019s thirty-sixth-largest population, we must be\na trading nation. We are expanding trade at a rate of\nunparalleled ambition, and consequently we are looking\nfor partners. But we fully recognize that sustained trade\nrequires stability and security.\nThe United Nations will also be judged by how\nwell it advances the security of humankind. The goal of\nsecurity is not separate from the objective of well-being. Security is, after all, a vital part of people\u2019s well-being.\nOnce again, openness and engagement are important\nmeans of achieving that goal. While there may at times\nbe tension in the means of execution, there exists no\nfundamental conflict between national security and the\nopen society; both seek to protect the same values, the\nsame rights and the same freedoms.\nIt is not enough for a society to protect its own\nsecurity. Global security affects all of us as members\nof the global community. Or, as Nelson Mandela\neloquently put it, \u201cfreedom would be meaningless\nwithout security in the home and in the streets\u201d. Thus,\nour freedom is strengthened when others are free, and\nour liberty is diminished so long as any of our brothers\nor sisters are imprisoned by fear. Because a threat to\none is a threat to all, our security is enhanced when we\ncooperate to protect fragile democracies or to block the\nforces of instability.\nThe crisis in Syria is a test of this Organization\u2019s\nability to achieve results. While the brutal and repressive\nregime of Bashar Al-Assad continues the slaughter of\nits own people, the United Nations continues to fail to\nimpose binding sanctions that would stem the crimson\ntide of that bloody assault. Until the last moment of\nrecorded time, the world will remember and history will\njudge Member States that are allowing the atrocities to\ncontinue.\nMany people of the planet, including many of the\ncitizens whom we represent, cannot understand why\nthis Organization \u2014 despite the sound and fury of\ndebate in this great Assembly \u2014 has been unable to\ntake concrete steps. Some ask, \u201cWhat business is it\nof ours?\u201d Our citizens would argue that the business\nis our common humanity, and our mandate is the\nstrengthening of humanity\u2019s bonds. It is difficult\nto fault their logic. The late Martin Luther King Jr.\nonce said: \u201cHe who passively accepts evil is as much\ninvolved in it as he who helps to perpetrate it. He who\naccepts evil without protesting against it is really\ncooperating with it\u201d. And if the collective interest in\nour shared humanity does not motivate us to act, then\nthe self-interest of our own security should. After all,\na stockpile of chemical and biological weapons does\nnot respect national sovereignty or recognize territorial\nintegrity. Who among us would be secure if the\nchemical and biological weapons of another Member\nState fell into the wrong hands? That is why Canada\ncalls on the Syrian regime to ensure that its stockpile of chemical weapons remains secure against possible use\nor proliferation by those who would do evil.\nWhen the post-Al-Qadhafi Libya declared its\nwillingness to destroy previously unknown stockpiles,\nCanada stepped in and provided $6 million to the\nOrganization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons\nin order to achieve that vital objective. Until such an\nopportunity arises in Syria, Canada stands ready\nto assist neighbouring States in taking measures to\nreduce the threat of the proliferation of those terrible\nweapons. Until that time, Canada continues to call for\nan immediate end to the violence. Al-Assad must be\nreplaced by a new order that protects Syria\u2019s territorial\nintegrity and all the rights of each and every citizen.\nI have seen the despair of the Syrian people first\nhand on the Jordanian border, where a little girl heart-\nwrenchingly told me that all she wanted to do was to go\nhome. That experience will no doubt leave a lasting scar\non the children caught in the middle of the tragedy. We\nmust ensure that they have the opportunity for a better\nlife \u2014 for a life free of fear and full of opportunity.\nI pledge that Canada will work to address the urgent\nhumanitarian crises wrought by the violence of the past\n18 months. It behoves all Member States in a position\nto do so to improve conditions for the Syrian civilians\naffected by their great struggle against tyranny in\npursuit of dignity.\nToday, the most significant threat to global peace\nand security remains the regime in Iran. It refuses to\ncomply with Security Council resolutions. It routinely\nthreatens the very existence of the State of Israel. It\nfoments hatred against the Jewish people and incites\ngenocide. It provides aid, comfort and support to\nterrorist groups. It is guilty of the widespread and\nmassive repression of the human rights of its own people,\nincluding gays, lesbians and religious minorities.\nA nuclear Iran would embolden an already reckless\nregime and would perpetuate a very destabilizing\nfactor not just for an already fragile region, but also\nfor the entire planet. The Government of Canada has\nnot only formally listed the Iranian regime as a State\nsponsor of terrorism under Canadian law, but we have\nalso suspended diplomatic relations. Some may ask\nwhy a country committed to openness and engagement\nwould suspend relations. We do not take such decisions\nlightly.\nOn a practical level, the regime\u2019s blatant disregard\nfor the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations created real and legitimate concern for the safety and\nsecurity of our civilian diplomats. But there is also a great\nprinciple at stake. While Canada prizes engagement\nand open relations, there can be no open engagement\nwith a regime that dishonours its word, repudiates\nits commitments and threatens to perpetuate crimes\nagainst humanity. Canada\u2019s philosophy is captured in\nthe wisdom of Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld, the second United\nNations Secretary-General, killed 51 years ago while\nfighting for peace and justice. He advised: \u201cNever, for\nthe sake of peace and quiet, deny your own experience\nor convictions\u201d. That is why Canada has imposed some\nof the toughest economic sanctions against the Iranian\nregime.\nHowever, let me be absolutely clear. Our quarrel\nis not with the people of Iran, but with the regime,\nwhich aims to silence their voices. Canada urges Iran\nto comply with its international nuclear obligations and\nto cease sensitive enrichment activities. We support\nthe process of the five plus one group of countries.\nIran needs to seize the opportunity provided by the\ninternational community and negotiate in good faith\nby showing demonstrable progress and by meeting its\nnuclear obligations.\nThe Iranian regime still has the chance to redeem\nitself. In fact, I encourage Iran to follow the example\nof some of its neighbours, some of whom Canada has\nsupported in building nuclear energy programmes for\npeaceful purposes. We will continue to work closely\nwith the United States, the European Union and\nother allies to put pressure on Iran to comply with its\nimportant international nuclear obligations. Rather than\naccept as inevitable the conflict that Iran seems intent\non provoking, Canada seeks a peaceful alternative. Iran\nmust act immediately to stop all enrichment and must\nabandon technology that could be used for weapons.\nIran is testing the will of the international community\nto its utmost. That, too, must end.\nThe world\u2019s security is closely linked to the third\ngoal that should animate this Organization, namely,\nprotecting the dignity and worth of every person by\nupholding and protecting fundamental freedoms. The\ngreat poet Kahlil Gibran inspired us to remember that\nsafeguarding the rights of others is the most noble and\nbeautiful goal of a human being.\nThat principle is not simply a question of beliefs and\nvalues. It includes a requirement for action. Protecting\nhuman rights and human dignity is an obligation that\neach State owes its citizens. It is a mutual obligation that all members of the international community must\nshare. History teaches us that an open society that is\ntolerant, pluralistic and free is the best guarantor of\nhuman rights and dignity.\nA threat to the security of humankind is often\ncoupled with the crushing of human rights. Yet human\nrights abuses that do not threaten security still concern\nus. The enslavement of others is a vicious human rights\nabuse. It takes many forms, such as the notorious\npolitical prisoner camps of North Korea, the forcible\nrecruitment by the Mouvement du 23 mars group\nin the Democratic Republic of Congo, and the early\nand forced marriage of young girls, which is a truly\nbarbaric form of slavery. Another despicable type of\nenslavement is the criminalization of sexuality: jailing,\ntorturing and killing people for who they are and whom\nthey love. Other abuses enslave the soul by suppressing,\nsometimes with brutal force, the right to worship\nfreely, to practise a faith and to hold religious beliefs.\nAssaults on human dignity, wherever they occur, are\nunacceptable.\nAt the start of my address, I observed that results\nmatter. This Organization was created to achieve\ncertain goals, and it will be measured by its success\nin doing so. No one ever said that it would be easy to\nmake real progress in advancing the prosperity, well-\nbeing, security and dignity of humankind. It is not easy\nbut it is essential. Despite the challenges, the frequent\nsetbacks and the cost, which is often heavy, we know\nthat the nations and peoples of the world are up to the\nchallenge. As we celebrate Mohandas Gandhi\u2019s birthday\ntomorrow, let us be inspired by his words: \u201cYou must\nnot lose faith in humanity. Humanity is an ocean; if a\nfew drops of the ocean are dirty, the ocean does not\nbecome dirty.\u201d\nEmboldened and bolstered by our faith in humanity,\nlet us move forward together to secure the results that\nthis Organization was established to achieve.\nconstant is change\u201d.\n\nThe only constant is change. Indeed, our world\ncontinues to change and at a rapid pace in all domains.\nAt the geopolitical level, change means a rebalancing\nof power and new opportunities. Not since the Cold\nWar has so much change occurred so quickly. In\nthese turbulent times, when change can be swift and\nunexpected, it is all the more important that we focus\nwith precision on the constants that remain true.\n\nCanada is a maritime nation bordered by three\noceans. Please allow me, then, to use a nautical"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI bring the Assembly the warm\ngreeting of \u201cYokwe\u201d from the Marshall Islands.\nThe Republic of the Marshall Islands was born first\nin the hearts and minds of the Marshallese people, but\nwe also forged our nationhood under the auspices of the\nUnited Nations f lag. The United Nations is truly our\nsecond home. Our unique story, from United Nations\nTrust Territory to Member State, deserves ref lection\nby the international community, two decades after we\nwere welcomed as a United Nations Member.\nThe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) will\nbe reviewed in three years\u2019 time. The Marshall Islands\nis now firmly committed to making stronger progress,\nespecially with regard to achieving full access to\nadequate education and decent employment and to\nensuring a sustainable environment. The MDGs are\nnot distant figures or statistics. The MDGs are in the\nfaces of our Marshallese children; the MDGs are in our\nclassrooms and hospitals. One of the most immediate\nand necessary steps is to better integrate our bilateral\nand regional development pathways with the MDGs, to\nensure that all efforts move in the same direction and\ntowards the same common goals.\nAs the Asia-Pacific region rises in the global\nspotlight, so also must the Marshall Islands. Our\nnational future is still within our grasp, and our future\nneed not be so difficult if we and our partners undertake\nthe hard actions needed to change it.\nToday, the Marshall Islands commits to being a key\nsuccess story in the Pacific. We will move with specific\nactions to make firm and measurable progress towards\nthe MDGs and towards economic independence resting\non an expanded private sector, especially in regard to\nour primary drivers of fisheries and tourism. We simply\nhave no other alternative but to rewrite our future.\nWe look to the future with targets in mind instead of\ngeneralities. I have asked my Government for specific,\nquantifiable development goals. I have also asked my\nGovernment to list the necessary actions, to be taken by\nourselves and by our partners, needed to achieve them.\nToday I am encouraging bilateral partners, especially\nour closest partners, as well as the Secretary-General and the Pacific Islands Forum and its regional agencies,\nto respond. Next year I hope to present the Assembly\nwith a report not about our plight but about our progress.\nIt is easy, and indeed rightful, to place blame on\nthe international community, especially concerning\nclimate change and fisheries, spheres where the open\npolitical assurances of our partners too often fall victim\nto their own self-interest once the negotiating doors\nclose. Yet the ultimate burden for achieving greater\nnational success must be on the Marshall Islands\nGovernment and the Marshallese people. However\nunfair multilateral outcomes may be to the smallest\nnations, we must and will do whatever is in our national\npower to assure a viable future. Nothing will stand in\nour way.\nThe Marshall Islands is far from alone. Many\nnations in the Pacific islands region share similar\nchallenges. Our collective Pacific progress must be a\nkey pillar of the 2014 global conference on small island\ndeveloping States, to be held in the Pacific. The next\nsummit of the Pacific Islands Forum will be held next\nyear in the Marshall Islands, and this meeting will\nreveal firm and dramatic progress not only towards\nbasic social and environment goals, but also how a very\nreal expansion of public-private partnership will be\njump-started in the Pacific.\nSince 1954, Marshallese leaders have visited the\nUnited Nations to address the ongoing impact of the 67\nnuclear tests conducted on our lands during our status\nas a United Nations Trust Territory. That is our first\nforeign policy issue, and it is more than a historical\nlegacy. It is a contemporary reality for our local\ncommunities. The United Nations authorized many of\nthose tests through two resolutions, in 1954 and 1956,\nwhich also made assurances of our basic human rights\nand our full and safe return to our land, while today too\nmany Marshallese remain nuclear nomads, still unable\nto safely resettle. While I acknowledge the important\nefforts taken to date, the half-life of radioactive material\nremains for generations, and much more needs to be\ndone.\nBut today, for the first time since the trusteeship\nresolution of 1956, the United Nations has finally spoken.\nEarlier this month, Mr. Calin Georgescu, Special\nRapporteur on human rights and toxic wastes, presented\nhis report regarding the nuclear testing programme\nin the Marshall Islands (A/HRC/21/48/Add.1) to\nthe Human Rights Council in Geneva. The Special Rapporteur has presented significant findings that\nindicate that the pain, mistrust, progress and failures\nof the Marshallese people over decades have a human\nrights dimension and that the international community\nmust respond with more than silence. The Marshallese\npeople have paid too heavy a price for the only instance\nin which the United Nations explicitly authorized the\nuse of nuclear weapons.\nI urge all relevant actors \u2014 the United States and\nthe wider international community and its agencies \u2014 to\njoin with the Marshall Islands and the Pacific Islands\nForum members in welcoming the Special Rapporteur\u2019s\nspecific recommendations as a way forward to ensure\nprogress on regaining the very human rights that\nshould never have been lost. The Special Rapporteur\u2019s\nreport must not be allowed to only collect dust on the\nshelf; it should instead be a foundation for new efforts,\nparticularly with key international agencies. We have\nno more time for well-worn accusations. The Marshall\nIslands must not fail to advance the human rights of its\nown citizens. Where old solutions have not worked, we\nmust not fail to find new ones.\nWe are not only a small island State, but truly a\nlarge-ocean nation. Our sustainable fisheries represent\na primary pathway to the very economic strength\nand social development I have just called for today.\nYet our aspirations are too often undermined by the\nnarrow commercial self-interests of those nations at the\nWestern and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission that\nmight otherwise seek to embrace us as close political\npartners. For us, our collective Pacific development is\nnot an isolated issue bound in technical jargon. It is the\nvery hope and economic survival of our entire nation,\nand indeed the whole Pacific region. We realize only a\npenny of true benefit for every dollar of fishing activity,\nand despite scientific warnings, pressure on key fish\nstocks has only increased, not diminished. Decades of\nglobal lip service at the United Nations to sustainable\ndevelopment seems to be lost on some of our fishing\npartners.\nThe parties to the Nauru Agreement have become\na watershed political movement, recently achieving\ncertification of a sustainable fishery by the Marine\nStewardship Council, which is perhaps the largest such\nfishery in the world. In the Pacific, we are already\ndeep into advancing the very sustainable development\nmeasures agreed to at the United Nations Conference on\nSustainable Development (Rio+20), and we are growing\nour own Pacific-driven commercial brand. It remains to be seen if key distant-water fishing nations will\ncontinue to join us in forging a landmark sustainable\nfishery or if they will choose to be left on the sidelines.\nThe Republic of the Marshall Islands is among\nthe low-lying nations in the world, and sea-level-rise\nprojections of more than a metre pose complex risks to\nour future statehood, risks that we are only beginning\nto unpack and address. Last year\u2019s watershed agreement\non the Durban Platform, prepared at the 2011 United\nNations Climate Change Conference, has moved the\nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate\nChange (UNFCCC) into a new chapter of a single,\nlegally binding protocol applying to all nations by 2020.\nIt has also redoubled urgent efforts needed to close the\nglobal mitigation gap. The time for endless North-\nSouth division is now over, and the all-too-predictable\nfinger-pointing must end.\nBut the world can no longer wait for negotiators.\nWe must do more than pat ourselves on the back if\nwe are serious about reducing the risks to our future.\nMore action is needed by all nations and all actors in\nall possible settings and negotiation forums. As the\nMarshall Islands, we have a national energy plan and\nUNFCCC target to cut our own emissions, boost our\nefficiency and pursue new technology, such as ocean\nthermal energy conversion, which can make us a\ncarbon-negative nation. I ask the rest of the world, will\nit also meet us in increasing that ambition? Will it come\nsoon enough?\nClimate adaptation poses perhaps the most complex\nchallenges for a low-lying nation, but we must overcome\nthem nonetheless. We cannot rely only on an uncertain\narchitecture of global climate finance to address the\nvery critical adaptation efforts that will be necessary\nfor our continued survival. In the large scale \u2014 up to\n$100 billion a year \u2014 of the future Green Climate Fund\nand other efforts, our relatively modest needs can easily\nbe overlooked. Our increasingly urgent needs on the\nground can no longer be met with paper studies and\ndisconnected pilot projects. Yet the Marshall Islands is\nat present heavily reliant on international assistance. We\nhave little other means to provide for adaptation. The\ngrowing belief, however wrong, that we must finance\nsome of our own adaptation efforts is perhaps the most\ncompelling reason to rapidly expand our private sector.\nWe must also create financial security through the debt\nfor adaptation swap being pursued by the Marshall\nIslands and other small island nations. The United Nations cannot fail the needs of the most\nvulnerable nations and must better harness the efforts\nof all necessary actors. The Marshall Islands urges\nother nations to facilitate the meaningful participation\nof Taiwan within the United Nations system and the\ninternational community. Taiwan should be able to\nparticipate as an observer in the UNFCCC and the\nInternational Civil Aviation Organization, as it does\nin the World Health Assembly, and its potential for\nmeeting the MDGs should be recognized.\nThe international community must not fail to act,\nnot only to address long-term threats, but also to ease\nthe most immediate security concerns. Recent tension\nin the broader Pacific Rim is an important matter for\nthe Pacific Islands region, which can grow only when\nthere is security and stability. I urge that those issues,\nincluding that of the East China Sea, be peacefully\naddressed through an inclusive dialogue involving all\nkey actors.\nThe smallest nations in the world, many of which\nare in the Pacific, are beginning to play important and\nunique roles on the international stage. But nations\nsuch as the Marshall Islands also depend greatly on\nfirm multilateral action. Accordingly, they must be able\nto rely on the United Nations and its Members for more\nthan symbolism. It is decisive and bold leadership that\nare so urgently needed in this international hour."

        "file_text": "\ufeffHis Majesty King Mohammed VI asked me to\nconvey his appreciation and respect, and I am pleased\nto read my speech at the sixty-seventh session of the\nGeneral Assembly.\nFirst, I would like to warmly congratulate Mr. Vuk\nJeremi\u0107, President of the General Assembly at its sixty-\nseventh session, on his election. That election is a mark\nof esteem for the friendly country of Serbia as much as\nit is a recognition of the vast diplomatic experience he\nbrings to the presidency.\nI also would like to commend Mr. Jeremi\u0107\u2019s\npredecessor, Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser, President\nof the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth session, on\nhis efforts and achievements during the past year.\nSimilarly, I would like to commend Secretary-\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon for his untiring action and his\nkeen desire to tackle crises. I applaud his initiatives\naimed at enabling the United Nations to rise to the\ngrowing challenges facing our world.\nSweeping changes are affecting today\u2019s\ninternational arena. They include, in particular, a\nprotracted global economic crisis that has various\nimplications and consequences. There are also a growing\nnumber of hotbeds of tension, political disputes and\narmed conflicts, as well as complex global challenges\nthat exceed the capabilities of individual States, such\nas achieving sustainable development, protecting the\nenvironment, ensuring respect for human rights and\nfighting against the growing scourge of international\nterrorism and all forms of organized crime.\nGiven the current changes in the world, we, the\nStates Members of the United Nations, ought to provide\nthe Organization with the means it needs to tackle those\nchallenges. To that end, we must expand the scope of\nthe Organization\u2019s actions and revitalize its approach,\nwhile preserving its principles and purposes, so as to\nmake it an active player in ensuring effective political\ngovernance and an instrument for equitable economic\ngovernance.\nThe Kingdom of Morocco fully backs the decision\nto give special importance to resolving disputes by\npeaceful means. My country applauds the General\nAssembly\u2019s decision to make the strengtheing of the\nforemost principle in the Charter of the United Nations\nthe key objective of the current session.\nAchieving international peace and security remains\nthe core historic mission entrusted to the United Nations.\nThe tens of thousands of United Nations peacekeepers\nserving throughout the world to protect civilians and\nworking to bring about the right conditions for political\ndialogue between the concerned parties clearly attest to\nthe vital role played by our Organization in that regard.\nThe Kingdom of Morocco takes pride in being one\nof the first States to have contributed to peacekeeping\noperations under the United Nations banner. So far,\nmy country has sent more than 50,000 members of\nthe Royal Armed Forces to places around the world to\nserve in promoting the lofty objectives of the United\nNations. Morocco will remain committed to managing\ncrises and will support efforts to promote preventive\ndiplomacy.\nThe experience gained by the United Nations in\nconflict-affected countries points to the importance\nof securing smooth, systematic transition from peace\nrestoration to peace consolidation. That requires, above\nall, a prompt response to the pressing needs raised by\ncurrent developments and threats. Otherwise, the threat\nof a return to violence and partition will continue to\nhang over the countries and regions concerned.\nDuring the past year, the African continent has seen\na serious deterioration in the situation on the continent,\nparticularly in the Sahel and the Sahara regions, owing\nto criminal, terrorist and separatist activities, which\nnow threaten the stability of the countries concerned.\nOur sister nation, the Republic of Mali, is\nconfronted with a situation that threatens the country\nand its national unity and territorial integrity. Despite\nthe sincere efforts exerted by countries in the region,\nincluding Morocco and the Economic Community of\nWest African States, the contribution of the United\nNations is also needed in order to achieve national\nconsensus, overcome the political crisis and confront\nseparatist activities in the north. Only an independent,\nfocused effort on the part of the United Nations can\nhelp achieve those objectives. I should like, in that\nrespect, to reiterate to our brothers in Mali Morocco\u2019s\ncommitment to continue to provide them with aid and  active support for the success of the political process\nand the preservation of their country\u2019s national unity\nand territorial integrity.\nAt the same time, the Kingdom of Morocco lauds\nthe notable progress made in several parts of Africa,\nespecially in the sister nations of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire and\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo, towards the\npromotion of national reconciliation and a return to\npolitical normalcy. Moreover, Morocco reiterates\nits firm commitment to pursuing cooperation and\nsolidarity programmes with various African sister\nnations, using efficient, dy!\u0430mic approaches to South-\nSouth cooperation for the benefit of African citizens.\nThe changes witnessed in the Arab region reflect\nthe will of the peoples involved to build democratic\nsocieties where human rights are respected and where\ncitizens enjoy equal opportunities and a dignified life.\nThe peoples in the sister nations of Tunisia, Libya, Egypt\nand Yemen have ushered in a new era and have made\ngreat headway towards a democratic transition, despite\na complex and tumultuous political environment, a\nfact that makes it incumbent upon the international\ncommunity to provide support and assistance to those\ncountries to deal with the constraints and difficulties\nthat they face.\nIt is, on the other hand, most regrettable that the\nSyrian people are each day paying a daily price in\nblood for their freedom. They yearn for the kind of\ndemocratic change that would enable each component\nof the Syrian population to contribute to achieving the\ndesired change. Morocco, as the only Arab country\nsitting on the Security Council, has significantly\ncontributed to mobilizing international support for the\nLeague of Arab States\u2019 initiatives and resolutions. We\ncall for concerted efforts and decisive action to compel\nthe Syrian regime to put an end to the violence. We\nalso call for a political transition process that would\nallow for the full spectrum of opinions to be heard,\nthe aspirations of the Syrian people to be fulfilled, and\nSyria\u2019s national unity and territorial integrity, as well\nas for stability in the entire region, to be ensured.\nAt the same time, it is necessary to raise the financial\nresources required to meet the needs of refugees\nin neighbouring countries and those of internally\ndisplaced persons, as well as to ease the suffering of\nour Syrian brothers and put an end to their tragedy. In\nthat regard, Morocco continues to show its solidarity by providing medical services on a daily basis to Syrian\nrefugees in the sisterly Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan.\nThe rapid developments in the Arab region must\nnot distract us from the fundamental, longstanding\nchallenge of resolving the Palestinian issue. In\nthat regard, the Kingdom of Morocco calls for the\nmobilization of international support to back the steps\ntaken by the Palestinian National Authority to secure\nnon-member State status. At the same time, my country\nis of the view that negotiations are the best way for the\nPalestinian people to regain their legitimate national\nrights and to set up an independent, fully viable and\ngeographically contiguous Palestinian State, living side\nby side with Israel, in peace and security. I therefore look\nforward to seeing the international community change\nits approach to resolving that crisis by reconsidering\nits intervention mechanisms and work methods in order\nto ensure that direct negotiations are resumed very\nsoon and in the best possible circumstances, under the\nauspices and with the commitment of the inf luential\nPowers.\nThat cannot be achieved if the fait accompli\npolicy is allowed to continue. In that regard and in my\ncapacity as Chair of the Al-Quds Committee, I have\nstrongly condemned the Israeli plan for the Judaization\nof occupied East Jerusalem, as well as the Israeli plans\nto wipe out the city\u2019s spiritual and cultural identity\nand change its demographic and urban features. Let\nme reaffirm, in that regard, that there can be no peace\nwithout East Jerusalem as the capital of an independent\nPalestinian state.\nSteadfast in its belief in the importance and\neffectiveness of joint regional action, the Kingdom\nof Morocco has undertaken initiatives and bilateral\ncontacts to inject fresh momentum into the Arab\nMaghreb Union. Indeed, my country believes that such\na strategic, inclusive regional bloc is urgently needed;\nnot only does it meet the legitimate aspirations of our\npeoples, but it is also necessitated by the security and\ndevelopment challenges facing the five Maghreb States.\nIn a bid to overcome obstacles that might hinder the\nrealization of that Maghreb ambition, the Kingdom of\nMorocco has contributed in a sincere, dedicated manner\nto negotiations aimed at finding a realistic, mutually\nacceptable political solution to the artificial regional\ndispute over the Moroccan Sahara \u2014 a solution that\nwould guarantee the Kingdom\u2019s national unity and\nterritorial integrity, allow for reunification to take place, and respect the characteristics of the region\u2019s\npopulations.\nMorocco remains committed and willing to\nnegotiate on the basis of the principles established and\nrepeatedly reaffirmed by the Security Council, as well\nas the autonomy initiative, which the international\ncommunity has deemed serious, realistic and credible.\nMorocco will also continue to cooperate constructively\nwith the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in\nWestern Sahara, on the basis of the mandate entrusted\nto it by the Security Council \u2014 a mandate that will not\nchange in any way; neither in form nor substance.\nI cannot conclude without referring to the need for\ncollective, effective and concerted action against all\nforms of extremism, hatred, xenophobia, provocation\nand rejection of those different from us and the\nundermining of their beliefs, for whatever reason and\nin whichever form. Given the increase in appalling\nacts of that kind, often with tragic consequences, I\nbelieve national efforts to tackle them must be part of\na concerted international strategy that should take into\naccount existing constructive initiatives, build on the\nmobilization of all United Nations bodies, be based on\nclear commitments, and encourage law-making and the\ndissemination of national and regional best practices in\nthat area.\nIt is up to us as Member States to provide the\nnecessary means and to reiterate our political will to\nsupport the Organization and reform its structures and\nintervention mechanisms. The aim is to enhance its\neffectiveness in terms of achieving peace and security\nand promoting cooperation, while enabling it to fulfil\nits indispensable mission of furthering tolerance and\ncoexistence, for the benefit of all mankind."

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt is a great\nhonour to address the General Assembly. I would like\nto join other speakers in congratulating His Excellency\nMr. Vuk Jeremi\u0107 on his election to preside over the\nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-seventh session. I am\nsure that his diplomatic experience will contribute to\nthe success of the work of this session. I assure him\nof the full commitment of the Mozambican delegation\nto contributing to the success of this session. I\nequally congratulate his predecessor, His Excellency\nAmbassador Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser of Qatar, for\nhis commitment and dedication in leading the Assembly\nat its most recent session.\nI would also like to share with the Assembly our\nsatisfaction at the progress made during the most recent\nsession\u2019s debate, held under the theme \u201cThe role of\nmediation in the peaceful resolution of disputes\u201d. That\ntheme merited special attention by the international\ncommunity in various forums and was highlighted by\nthe adoption, last May, of the Helsinki final document,\nwhich defines the principles regarding the role of\nthe States in the mediation of disputes. The Helsinki document and the Manila Declaration on the Peaceful\nSettlement of International Disputes, adopted in 1982,\nwhich set a precedent for the peaceful resolution of\ninternational disputes, represent a strengthening of the\nprinciples that guide States\u2019 actions in the search for\nsolutions to disputes through peaceful means.\nWe salute the timely choice of the theme \u201cBringing\nabout adjustment or settlement of international disputes\nor situations by peaceful means\u201d for this session, at a\ntime when various factors are hastening the advent of\nconflict. Those factors, both internal and external in\nnature, are due to political and/or economic factors.\nThey include the quest for self-determination, socio-\npolitical exclusion, the use of natural resources, wealth\ndistribution, border disputes and cultural and religious\nintolerance.\nTherefore, we believe that conflict resolution\nprocesses should prioritize a holistic approach to\nresolving conflict, through a free and ongoing dialogue\namong the parties to a conflict, thereby following\nuniversally accepted principles such as dialogue based\non truth and the responsibility of the major stakeholders\nat the national, regional and international levels;\nparticipation aimed at reaching real solutions and\nsustainable development based on an understanding\nof the need to strengthen the synergies between peace,\ndevelopment and democracy; and the fight against\npoverty and promotion of sustainable development.\nThe importance we attribute to these principles\nstems from our experience in a process of reconciliation\nand peacekeeping, in which a constant and interactive\ndialogue within Mozambican society has allowed for the\nconsolidation of national unity, peace, development and\nthe fight against poverty so as to further participatory\ndemocracy.\nIt is therefore with pride that, on October 4,\nMozambique will celebrate 20 years of peace in\nan atmosphere of stability and economic growth,\naccomplishments that are the result of an inclusive\ndialogue, a process of national reconciliation and our\nobservance of the principles of democracy, freedom\nand justice.\nThe failure of preventive measures leads us to\nresort to mechanisms for conflict management and\nresolution. For those mechanisms to be successful, we\nneed to re-evaluate the mandates of, and conventional\napproaches to, peacekeeping operations, given the\nunderlying changes that have come about in the actual nature of conflict itself since the establishment of the\nUnited Nations. Given the multidimensional nature\nof current conflicts, efforts aimed at their prevention,\nmanagement and resolution require the cooperation\nof various stakeholders at the national, regional and\ninternational levels under Chapter VIII of the United\nNations Charter.\nWe believe that success in the prevention,\nmanagement and resolution of conflicts is directly\nlinked to an understanding of their nature. The scope\nand facilitation of mediation should be extensively\ninformed by the nature and dynamic of the particular\nconflict, so as to allow for a better analysis and effective\naction and to ensure that all parties to the conflict take\nan integral role in its resolution. In order to pursue\nthese objectives, focus should be placed on cooperation\nwith regional and subregional organizations.\nWe note with concern the persistence of an\nenvironment of tension and instability in Africa,\nin particular in Madagascar, the eastern part of the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, Guinea-Bissau,\nSomalia, the Sudan, South Sudan and Mali.\nIn the Southern African Development Community\n(SADC) region, the various conflict resolution processes\nare based on a regional architecture for the prevention,\nmanagement and resolution of conflicts. This is\nsubstantiated within the SADC organ for cooperation in\nthe political, defence and security areas by instruments\nthat create the conditions for dialogue. To facilitate\nits intervention in this area, the SADC organ created\na mediation unit that is based on the participation of\na group of elders who, through their deep knowledge\nof the internal dynamics of the countries referred,\nhave been contributing to peacebuilding, security and\nstability in the SADC region.\nThe SADC Summit of Heads of State and of\nGovernment recently held in Maputo in August\nthoroughly examined ways to improve the organization\u2019s\nintervention in the prevention, management and\nresolution of conflicts. SADC thus reiterated its\ncommitment to working with the parties to the conflicts\nin the Republic of Madagascar, the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo and the Republic of Zimbabwe\nwhile at the same time reinforcing its partnership with\nthe international community.\nThe mediation efforts of SADC for the resolution\nof the political deadlock in Madagascar and the SADC\nfacilitation of the implementation of the comprehensive political agreement in Zimbabwe, continue to make\nprogress towards the establishment of conditions for\nfree, fair and credible elections to take place in both\nSADC countries.\nWith regard to Madagascar, the efforts of the\nmediation team led by the former President of the\nRepublic of Mozambique, Joaquim Chissano, resulted\nin the signing by 10 of the 11 political groups in\nMadagascar of the SADC road map to end the political\ncrisis in that country.\nIn Zimbabwe, the political situation is generally\nstable, as the inclusive Government has made\ntremendous progress in the socioeconomic and political\nareas. The process for the establishment of a new\nconstitution, which will guide future elections, is at an\nadvanced stage.\nSADC reiterates its appeal for the complete lifting\nof the economic sanctions imposed on Zimbabwe in\norder to contribute to the country\u2019s economic recovery\nand that of other countries in the region, with which\nZimbabwe maintains close economic ties.\nHowever, SADC and the international community\ncontinue to be concerned with the prevailing climate\nof instability and the subsequent humanitarian crises\nin the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the\nCongo. Cooperation mechanisms among SADC, the\nInternational Conference on the Great Lakes Region,\nthe African Union and the United Nations and, above\nall, extensive comprehensive internal dialogue among\nthe Congolese are needed in seeking lasting solutions\nto the instability in eastern Democratic Republic of the\nCongo.\nWith regard to Guinea-Bissau, Mozambique, as\nChair of the Community of Portuguese-speaking\nCountries, continues to be committed to seeking a viable\nsolution in order to restore constitutional order to that\ncountry through internal dialogue and the coordinated\nintervention of the international community. The\npeople of Guinea-Bissau yearn for peace, stability and\ndevelopment. They want to be the masters of their own\ndestiny, which was why they fought for liberation. That\nculminated in the country\u2019s independence, whose thirty-\nninth anniversary was celebrated on 24 September.\nRegarding Somalia, the Sudan and South Sudan,\nMozambique is delighted by the progress in the\nrespective political processes. We are confident that such achievements will contribute to lasting peace and\nstability in those countries.\nWe follow with concern the lack of progress in\nseeking viable solutions to the political process in\nthe Middle East. That process is a challenge not only\nfor the countries involved and for the region, but also\nfor the world at large, owing to its implications for\ninternational peace and security. We therefore appeal to\nall relevant actors to engage in a constructive dialogue\nand to work towards a peaceful solution that guarantees\npeace, security and stability.\nWe reiterate our belief in the importance of the\nongoing commitment of the United Nations towards\nthe prompt implementation of the relevant resolutions\nof the Organization. We further reiterate that internal\ndialogue, regional cooperation and the realistic\nintervention of the United Nations must be the priorities.\nWe reaffirm our unequivocal support for the\ncause of the Palestinian people, who have been denied\ntheir inalienable right to self-determination. We fully\nsupport the principle of establishing the two States of\nPalestine and Israel living side by side in peace.\nSimilarly, we reaffirm our support for the\ninternational community\u2019s engagement in seeking a\nsustainable solution to the issue of the Western Sahara\u2019s\nself-determination. We cannot understand or accept the\ndelays in conducting the referendum already agreed on\nby all parties under the auspices of the United Nations.\nMozambique continues to follow with concern\nthe maintenance of the unjust economic embargo\nagainst Cuba, which impedes the economic and social\ndevelopment of that sisterly country. Mozambique\ntherefore reiterates the call of the majority of Member\nStates for the immediate lifting of the embargo.\nThe nature of the challenges that we face in the\narea of international peace and security lead us to\naffirm before the Assembly the increasing relevance\nof multilateral mechanisms for the peaceful resolution\nof disputes or situations of conflict. We note with\nsatisfaction that, throughout more than a half a century\nof its existence, the United Nations has made undeniable\nachievements in the maintenance of peace and in the\nprevention and resolution of conflicts.\nIn order to more effectively respond to the growing\nchallenges to resolving conflicts, we must pursue more\nresolutely the reform agenda of the United Nations\nsystem, in particular Security Council reform and the revitalization of the General Assembly. In that task, we\nbelieve that those two organs must adopt the following\napproach. The steps should include a comprehensive\nstrategic plan of action and a detailed programme to\naddress conflict situations; strengthening the capacity\nof resource mobilization for peacekeeping missions; the\nnegotiation and implementation of sustainable political\nsolutions; and engaging in a long-term perspective. The\nSecurity Council must play a more proactive role in the\nsolution of conflicts by, inter alia, fully implementing\nthe resolutions that it adopts.\nWe therefore reiterate the validity and relevance of\nthe principles enshrined in the United Nations Charter\nand of other international instruments. Such values must\nremain the main source of inspiration in the pursuit of\npolitical and lasting solutions to conflicts. Mozambique\nthus believes that multilateral organizations, such\nas the United Nations, the African Union and other\nsubregional organizations, play a fundamental role in\nthe pursuit of peace and development.\nThe resolution of conflicts is a crucial condition for\nthe achievement of internationally agreed development\ngoals, including the Millennium Development Goals,\nin particular by African countries and least developed\ncountries. In that context, as part of the ongoing\ndiscussions on establishing a post-2015 development\nagenda, Member States must act jointly in seeking\npoints of convergence that will make it possible to\nadopt consensus and sustainable solutions for the well-\nbeing of our people.\nIn that connection, we would like to express our\noptimism over the consensus understanding reached\nat the United Nations Conference on Sustainable\nDevelopment. We are aware of the fact that the\nsuccess of such an agreement depends on an integrated\napproach towards the economic, social, cultural and\nenvironmental components, as well as on defining a\ncomprehensive framework for resource mobilization\nunder the terms of the common vision of resolution\n66/288, entitled \u201cThe future we want\u201d.\nIn conclusion, I would like to reiterate Mozambique\u2019s\ncommitment to continuing to cooperate with the United\nNations in seeking peaceful solutions to conflicts and\nto peace, stability and sustainable development."

        "file_text": "\ufeffAt the outset,\nallow me to express our warm congratulations to\nMr. Vuk Jeremi\u010d on his election to the presidency of\nthe General Assembly at its sixty-seventh session.\nI am confident that his experience will ensure the\nsuccess of our meetings. I should like to commend his\npredecessor, Ambassador Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser,\nand to express my appreciation and gratitude to\nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his efforts to\nstrengthen the role of the United Nations. It is my hope\nthat deliberations at this session will be successful,\nwhich would contribute to fulfilling the hopes and\naspirations of the peoples of the world to a life of\nsecurity, peace and stability, on the basis of the values and principles enshrined in the Charter of the United\nNations.\nWe were pleased to see that the main theme for this\nsession of the General Assembly relates to the peaceful\nsettlement of disputes. That principle is a fundamental\none, as the Charter of the United Nations stresses the\nneed to maintain international peace and security by\npacific means or through effective collective measures\naimed at eliminating threats to international peace\nand security, in accordance with the Charter and\ninternational law.\nThe peaceful settlement of disputes requires joint\nefforts on the part of the international community\nin order to tackle the root causes of conflicts. We\nbelieve that the absence of sustainable and balanced\ndevelopment is one of the main reasons why a small\nminority of people have been able to appropriate the\ngreatest wealth in the world while the vast majority of\nhumankind lives in abject poverty, lacking all basic\nservices. Greater efforts must therefore be made to\nachieve the Millennium Development Goals.\nDisseminating a culture of peace, tolerance,\nrespect for others and the prevention of any violence\nor incitement to cultural, religious, sectarian or ethnic\nstrife must be among the fundamental priorities and\nconcerns of the United Nations. The Organization must\nensure that no offensive statements about prophets\nare made under the pretext of freedom of expression.\nPerhaps the latest video insulting Prophet Muhammad\nand the reactions thereto are the best evidence of the\nseriousness of this issue and its effect on international\npeace and security.\nMy country suffered through a long conflict \u2014 more\nthan six decades \u2014 that hampered the achievement\nof peace, development and stability, and had strong\nnegative repercussions on the region. Proceeding\nfrom the conviction of my Government as to the need\nto put an end to that conflict, on the basis of United\nNations instruments for the pacific settlement of\ndisputes, difficult and thorny negotiations began that\ntook over a decade and culminated in the signing of\nthe Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) under\nthe auspices of the Intergovernmental Authority on\nDevelopment (IGAD). Many regional and international\npartners helped in reaching that Agreement.\nThe Government of the Sudan was committed to\nimplementing the Agreement during the prescribed time frame, which led to the known referendum in\nwhich the people of South Sudan decided to secede.\nThe Government of the Sudan immediately\nrecognized the Government of South Sudan and fully\ncommitted itself to assisting that nascent State, as was\nstated by the President of my country \u2014 Mr. Omer\nHassan Al-Bashir \u2014 personally when the new State\nwas born in the south. Despite all of the assistance\nprovided by my country to facilitate the birth of the\nRepublic of South Sudan, many obstacles have cropped\nup on the road to the normalization of relations between\nthe two neighbourly countries. The delay in the drafting\nof important agreements provided for in the CPA\nfollowing the referendum has led to many tensions,\nresulting in the adoption by the African Union Peace\nand Security Council of a road map in April 2012 and in\nSecurity Council resolution 2046 (2012), which stresses\nthe spirit of the African Union decision.\nWe have begun a new phase of serious negotiations\nunder the African Union High-level Implementation\nPanel, headed by President Thabo Mbeki, which led\nto the signing on 27 September in Addis Ababa of\nvery important agreements on the economy, security\nand citizenship status in both States and a framework\nagreement for cooperation between the two countries in\nall fields. None of that would have taken place without\nthe firm determination, wisdom and patience of my\nPresident, Omer Al-Bashir, who insisted on the need to\nresolve disputes by peaceful means, beginning with the\nsigning of the CPA, the Abuja Agreement on Darfur,\nthe agreement on Eastern Darfur and the Darfur\nDocument. That has shown the world that Sudan\u2019s\nleadership acts on the basis of firm principles that prize\nsecurity and stability and are aimed at achieving peace\nand development. We want everyone to know that the\ngoal of attempts to distort Sudan\u2019s image and impugn\nits leadership is merely to defame us and that they are\ndevoid of any substance.\nWe in the Sudan have been determined to address\nthe reasons underlying war and strife despite the strong\neconomic and political pressures brought to bear\nagainst my country and the unfair sanctions imposed\nby the United States of America. The Sudan requires\nassistance in order to traverse this very sensitive stage\ntowards better horizons, and to that end we believe that\nthe sanctions must be lifted, our debt cancelled and our\neconomy supported. The Sudan has repeatedly stressed its commitment\nto a policy of good-neighbourliness and is determined\nto strengthen its brotherly relations with South Sudan.\nThe great achievements registered have brought an end\nto the longest war on the Africa continent. With the same\ndetermination, we have attempted to tackle the few\nremaining issues. In order to ensure continuing sincere\ncooperation with the Republic of South Sudan, on\nThursday, 27 September 2012, an agreement was signed\nin the Ethiopian capital between the two Governments\non security, the economy, borders, oil, trade, rates\nof exchange, pensions, debts and other economic\nissues. That is an important step that shows Sudan\u2019s\ncommitment to a policy of good-neighbourliness and its\ndetermination to improve brotherly relations with South\nSudan and to reach a comprehensive understanding on\nall issues.\nDespite the fact that no agreement has been reached\non the final status of Abyei, and no terms of reference\nhave been found for its resolution, the Sudan stresses\nits full support for the Abyei protocol and agreement\nof June 2011, as well as the referendum law on Abyei\nsigned by both parties in the Sudanese Parliament in\n2010.\nWe must stress here the important role played by\nthe two parties, with the mediation of the late Ethiopian\nPrime Minister, Mr. Meles Zenawi, and his successor,\nMr. Hailemariam Desalegn, in the context of the\npresidency of IGAD, as well as by other international\npartners. Without those efforts, no agreement could have\nbeen reached or signed with South Sudan. We would\ntherefore like to stress the importance of mediation and\nserious negotiations in resolving disputes by peaceful\nmeans.\nAllow me also to stress the role of the international\ncommunity in fulfilling its responsibility to help both\nparties and to keep all promises made following the\nsigning of the CPA by providing assistance in funds\nand in kind for the development and growth of the\nSudan and South Sudan.\nIn his statement, the Vice-President of South\nSudan asserted that his country lays claim to Heglig\nand sympathizes with those bearing arms against us in\nSouth Kordofan and Blue Nile states (see A/67/PV.13).\nThat is regrettable and goes outside the spirit of the\nagreement of Addis Ababa, taking us back to square one\nas far as conflicts are concerned. As I have said before,\nI sincerely hope that those words of the Vice-President were intended to be delivered to the General Assembly\nbefore the agreement was reached in Addis Ababa.\nThe Government of the Sudan calls on the\ninternational community to put further pressure on\nthe rebels to stop attacks on South Kordofan and Blue\nNile states. Let me also say that the Government of the\nSudan will continue to live up to its responsibilities\nwith respect to the protection of civilians and the\ncompletion of development projects. Blue Nile state\nis now home to the largest development project in the\nSudan \u2014 the building of a dam \u2014 together with many\nother development projects.\nThe Government has a green-land policy designed\nto expand agricultural projects in South Kordofan\nand a policy to improve water quality and education\nand health services there. Moreover, proceeding from\nour belief that it is the fundamental responsibility of\nthe Government to protect its citizens, we renew our\ncommitment to the joint tripartite initiative between\nthe United Nations, the African Union and the League\nof Arab States to bring humanitarian assistance to\ncivilians in the regions controlled by rebels in South\nKordofan and Blue Nile states.\nDespite the efforts made by the Sudan to tackle the\nnegative effects following the secession of the south,\nthe burden of foreign debt weighs very heavily on\nthe Sudanese economy. Let me take this opportunity\nto recall the pledges of the international community,\nfollowing the signing of the CPA, to cancel the Sudan\u2019s\ndebts. Those promises have gone unmet. I am sure the\nAssembly knows that the issue of debts was among the\nfundamental questions that were discussed with the\nGovernment of South Sudan. Based on the zero-option\napproach, we are determined to work with our brothers\nin the Government of South Sudan to take the steps\nagreed upon with the international community and our\ncreditors so that we both may enjoy the fruits of peace\nand ensure the viability of the two States.\nAt the same time, we stress the need to lift the\ncoercive unilateral sanctions imposed on the Sudan,\nwhich run counter to General Assembly resolutions\nand international norms and laws. At this point, we\ncannot fail to mention the progress made in sustainable\ndevelopment in Africa or the fact that such progress\nhas not risen to the ambitious level of the objectives\nset forth in the Millennium Development Goals.\nInternational cooperation and effective partnerships are\nthus required, in the form of the complete cancellation\nof debts, in accordance with the Debt Initiative for Heavily Indebted Poor Countries, if we are to fulfil our\ncommitments and build national capacities.\nMy country is also witnessing another important\ndevelopment \u2014 the signing of the Doha Document for\nPeace in Darfur, following the peace negotiations that\ntook place under the auspices of the State of Qatar. I\nshould like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to\nQatar and His Highness Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa\nAl-Thani for their much-appreciated efforts on behalf of\npeace and stability in Darfur. The Doha Document has\nbeen widely accepted and supported by the people of\nDarfur and the regional and international communities.\nWith that instrument, we have turned a new page in\nthe book on Darfur \u2014 towards stability, development,\npeace and the return of displaced persons \u2014 after\nclosing the chapter on fighting.\nWe call on the international community to protect\nand secure the peace by countering the armed rebel\ngroups that have refused to join the peace process. We\nfurther call on the Security Council to put pressure on\nthose movements in order to compel them to subscribe\nto the Doha Document. I would also appeal to the\ninternational community to effectively participate in\nthe donors\u2019 conference for the rebuilding of Darfur to\nbe held in December in Doha.\nThe Government of the Sudan will continue\nto implement its five-point strategy for Darfur\u2019s\ndevelopment. We shall give the utmost priority to the\nreturn of displaced persons and refugees, in coordination\nwith the regional body that was set up pursuant to the\nDoha agreement. The parties have begun to fulfil their\nduties in implementing the Doha peace agreement, and\nnow the five provinces of Darfur are enjoying security,\nstability and a return to normality.\nThat, in turn, has led the Security Council to\nreduce the number of military contingents in the\nAfrican Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in\nDarfur, because, as expected, there has been a general\nimprovement in both the security and the humanitarian\nsituations. That improvement crowned with success the\nmany efforts made by the Government of the Sudan,\npaved the way for launching development projects in\nDarfur and facilitated the return of displaced persons\nand refugees to their homes and villages to resettle and\nre-engage in production and development.\nThe current session is being held while the world\nis witnessing many varied and intertwined changes\nand developments. Those require cooperation and coordination between members of the international\ncommunity for the good of humankind. We must make\nsure that the reform of the United Nations and its\nprincipal and subsidiary bodies is given the importance\nit deserves. It has now become necessary to accelerate\nthe reform of the Organization so that it can undertake\nits role in a just, transparent and effective manner and\nconfront the challenges that the world faces. Indeed, the\nreform will not be genuine unless the General Assembly\ncan play its full role in a balanced and transparent\nmanner.\nThe reform of the Security Council is a fundamental\npart of the reform of the United Nations. The Council\nno longer reflects the realities of today\u2019s world. Unless\nits membership is enlarged, unless working methods\nand procedures are reformed, and unless its decisions\nare taken in a more democratic and transparent way,\nreform will not be comprehensive but will merely\nbe partial or transitional. We call today for a more\nbalanced, multilateral and just international system.\nWhat is needed is a system able to tackle the challenges\nthat we face, one in which respect for international law\nprevails, in which the primary rules are the purposes\nand principles of the United Nations, including respect\nfor the sovereignty of States, non-intervention in\ntheir internal affairs for any ostensible reason and the\nnon-use or threat of force.\nThe Sudan is greatly concerned about new\nconcepts and agendas that are not internationally\nagreed, controversial concepts such as humanitarian\nintervention, preventive wars, the responsibility to\nprotect, political and economic sanctions and new\nmechanisms to bring pressure to bear on States,\npoliticizing international justice. In this context, the\nSudan refuses and rejects the approach taken by the\nso-called International Criminal Court. That body has\ngone beyond the boundaries set for it at its founding\nRome Conference. Regrettably, it is now a political tool\nthat criminalizes entire States, while fully ignoring\nheinous crimes being perpetrated by other States in\nthe name of humanity and the fight against terrorism.\nRejection of the request of the Palestinian Authority by\nthe Court is clear evidence of injustice in the name of\nlaw and a good example of the politicization of justice.\nThe phenomenon of climate change corroborates\nwhat we have already said. The problems associated\nwith it have grown ever greater and States cannot tackle\nthem on their own. That is the case too for many other\nissues, such as energy, food security, immigration and terrorism. We therefore believe in the need to strengthen\ninternational cooperation on climate change, based on\nthe United Nations Framework Convention on Climate\nChange and its Kyoto Protocol.\nWe commend the State of Brazil for hosting the\nConference on Sustainable Development in July and for\nthe effective role it played in reaching agreement on its\nfinal document (resolution 66/288, annex). That outcome\nreflects the fundamental concerns of Member States,\nstresses the promotion of international cooperation for\nsustainable development through a green economy and\nstrengthens the institutional framework for sustainable\ndevelopment. We hope that the implementation of the\nconcept of the green economy will take into account\nthe differences between developed and developing\ncountries, so that all may implement their own green\npolicies, and will ensure the f low of financial, technical\nand technological assistance to developing countries\nwithout discrimination.\nMy delegation condemns all forms and\nmanifestations of terrorism, whether perpetrated by\nindividuals, groups or States. Terrorism is a phenomenon\nthat is not linked to any one religion, culture or State.\nWe also renew the call for an internationally agreed\ndefinition of terrorism, since terrorism is a grave threat\nto all our societies. We must not confuse the concept\nof terrorism with that of legitimate struggle against\nforeign occupation, invasion or colonialism. We also\nreject the stigma of terrorism currently being attached\nto particular cultures, groups, religions or ethnicities.\nMeasures taken to fight terrorism must not infringe on\npublic freedoms, human rights or a State\u2019s sovereignty\nover its territory.\nThe current session of the General Assembly\ncoincides with some important indicators in the\ninternational economy. First and foremost are the\nconsequences of the world financial crisis and the\nescalation in the price of staples, particularly food\nstaples, and their effect on sustainable development.\nDespite that, the Government of the Sudan is making\nmajor efforts to realize economic and social development\nin the country, in the belief that that can only come\nabout through realizing peace and security and growth.\nThat was reflected in the Sudan\u2019s commitment to\nimplementing the objectives of the long-term national\nstrategy for 2007-2013 and our Poverty Reduction\nStrategy.\nThe question of Palestine has been on the agenda\nof the United Nations for more than six decades. Our Organization has adopted countless resolutions that\nwere rejected or remained unimplemented by Israel.\nIsrael continues to defy the will of the international\ncommunity. The Sudan expresses its full support\nfor the decision by the Palestinian Authority to seek\nmembership in the United Nations. It is their legal\nright, based on the right to self-determination, one of\nthe fundamental principles of international law.\nThe situation in the Middle East continues to be\na threat to international peace and security, despite\ncontinuing declarations by the Arab side of their wish\nto reach a just, comprehensive and lasting peace in the\nregion, based on the relevant United Nations resolutions\nand the Arab Peace Initiative. However, Israel, the\noccupying Power, continues to reject the option of\npeace. It continues its inhuman, unjust siege, which is\nin contravention of international law. It also continues\nits plans for colonialist settlement. It continues to try to\nchange the demographic character of Al-Quds Al-Sharif\nby demolishing homes, uprooting trees and engaging in\nethnic cleansing and coercive displacement, as well as\ndetaining thousands of Palestinians.\nWe renew our call on the United Nations, and\nthe Security Council in particular, to shoulder their\nresponsibility for maintaining international peace\nand security and to take the requisite measures to end\nIsraeli occupation of Arab and Palestinian land. From\nthis rostrum, we renew our call for the establishment\nof a Middle East zone free of nuclear weapons and all\nother weapons of mass destruction. Meanwhile, we also\nunderline the right of States to obtain nuclear technology\nfor peaceful uses, and we call for the resolution of\ndisputes through negotiations and dialogue, free from\nattempts to spread fear and tension in the region.\nAlso with regard to the Middle East, my delegation\nexpresses its deep sadness and regret at the current\ndevelopments in Syria. There has been an escalation of\nviolence and an excessive use of force. That is not the\nright way to resolve the disputes. From this rostrum, we\ncall on all parties to heed the voice of reason, to enter\ninto negotiations and to cease hostilities and military\nconfrontation. We believe that the appointment of the\nnew Joint Special Representative, Lakhdar Brahimi, to\nthe region is a good opportunity to continue to seek a\npeaceful settlement to the dispute, and we hope that all\nparties will cooperate with him, to protect Syria and its\nsocial fabric.\nThe Sudan welcomes the latest political\ndevelopments in Somalia, notably its recent successful presidential elections. We congratulate the new\nPresident, Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, and we wish\nhim every success in promoting peace and security\nin Somalia. In this context, the Sudan commends the\nAfrican Union for its efforts in Somalia. We call on the\ninternational community to support those efforts and\nto stand shoulder to shoulder with the fraternal Somali\npeople at this critical juncture in the country\u2019s history.\nWe want Somalia to resume its natural role within the\ninternational community.\nIn conclusion, let me express our sincere good\nwishes for a successful session under the wise leadership\nof President Vuk Jeremi\u0107."

        "file_text": "\ufeffAt the\noutset, allow me to greet Mr. Vuk Jeremi\u0107, President of\nthe General Assembly at its sixty-seventh session. At\nthe same time, I would like to express my appreciation\nto Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser for his stewardship\nduring the previous session.\nI have the honour to represent Guatemala for\nthe first time before this highest organ of the United\nNations. Guatemala, and my Government in particular,\nwill always support any initiative that furthers the\nnoble objectives and principles of the United Nations,\nsummarized in the words \u201cpeace\u201d, \u201cdevelopment\u201d and\n\u201chuman rights\u201d.\nMy country is committed to the peaceful settlement\nof conflicts, which is the central theme of our debate.\nIn that spirit, in late 2008 we agreed to sign a special\nagreement with our neighbour, Belize, seeking a\nresolution of a long-standing territorial dispute through\nthe International Court of Justice. Our Congress\nunanimously approved the agreement, and on October\n6, 2013, simultaneous plebiscites will be held in both\ncountries to democratically ratify our commitment to\nresorting to the International Court of Justice.\nFurthermore, we Guatemalans lived through an\narmed conflict that lasted 36 years. I was a soldier who\nparticipated in that conflict. And because I know war, I\nhighly value dialogue. That is why in 1996 I was one of\nthe signatories of the peace accords in my country. That\nmotivates me to reaffirm my support for the President\u2019s\nwise decision to convene this session to discuss the\npeaceful settlement of conflicts.\nMy Government has set three overarching objectives\nin order to advance firmly and sustainably towards a\nGuatemala that fully enjoys the benefits of peace. First,\nwe have proposed the Hambre Zero initiative, which\nseeks to reduce the chronic malnutrition that affects\nover 40 per cent of our children below five years of age.\nThat reduction will be sustainable only if we are able to\nbetter develop our rural areas in order to permanently\nreduce the poverty of families living off the land,\nparticularly indigenous families.\nSecondly, my Government is promoting a pact\nfor security, justice and peace, which seeks to reduce\nthe social violence that afflicts our country. In taking\noffice, I found a country with high levels of violence;\nas a result, reducing those levels has become a priority of my Government. We are certain that we can attain\nprogress in that area, since the indicators over the past\nnine months alone already show a notable decrease of\n13 per cent in the number of homicides compared to the\nsame period last year. I can therefore state that, without\nbeing satisfied with those indices, we are nonetheless\nmoving in the right direction in fulfilling our promise\nof reducing the levels of violence and increasing\nsecurity in Guatemala in an environment of full respect\nfor human rights. In this endeavour, we work closely\nwith neighbouring countries, and especially with our\nCentral American brothers.\nThirdly, we are campaigning on the economic\nfront through the Fiscal and Competitiveness Pact.\nFiscal affairs have been one of the weaknesses of our\ninstitutional arrangement, and for this reason, during\nthe very first days of my Government we successfully\npromoted a fiscal reform, approved by Congress, that\nincreased our fiscal receipts by 15 per cent, allowing\nus to maintain a stable macroeconomic environment\nby reducing the fiscal deficit without having to reduce\npublic expenditures. At the same time, fiscal stability\nis allowing us to stimulate private investments that\ngenerate employment opportunities; that is, dependable\njobs, as demanded by our citizens.\nUnfortunately, our efforts in relation to the three\nchallenges previously mentioned \u2014 lowering chronic\nmalnutrition among children, reducing violence, and\npromoting employment \u2014 are nullified in part by the\nscourge of drug trafficking. At least 40 per cent of the\nhomicides in our country are linked to the illicit drug\ntraffic, and my Government is obligated to allocate\nscarce fiscal resources to combat transnational gangs\nthat operate between the producing countries in the\nSouth and the consuming countries in the North.\nMoreover, my country has gradually been transformed\ninto a producer and a consumer of drugs, thereby\ncompounding an already difficult situation.\nThe existing framework, born out of the\ninternational conventions adopted during the past\nfive decades and currently in force, has not achieved\nthe desired results. The consumption markets expand\ninstead of decreasing; the number of producer countries\nand the type of drugs available tend to multiply; and the\nroutes chosen for marketing and trafficking are trending\ntowards diversification. The drug problem is growing in\nsize and complexity. It involves an increasing number\nof countries and persons. Clearly, it is a transnational\nphenomenon, and it is for that reason that I raise it in\nthis universal forum.\nIt seems that the basic premise of our war against\ndrugs has serious shortcomings since, unfortunately, it\nhas not been possible to eradicate drug consumption. I\nbelieve that the time has come to accept this fact and to\nadapt our fight against the scourge in such a way as to\ntake into account the new realities.\nOur youth, the group most affected by drug\nconsumption, demands more effective responses from\nus. Let us realize that the problem is more a public\nhealth issue than a matter for criminal justice and\ndeal with it accordingly. We must offer treatment,\nprevention, social protection, economic opportunities\nand development for the communities involved in the\ndrug market. Let us not fill our jails with thousands of\nyoung people, who would have a different kind of life\nif we were to approach the problem in a different way. I\ninvite the Member States assembled here to jointly seek\navenues that will enable us to offer our young people a\nmore promising future, improving their opportunities\nfor a better life and at the same time reducing violence\nand poverty.\nFifty years provides sufficient time for us to\nevaluate results, to gauge what we have achieved and to\nconclude why we do not have the results we had hoped\nfor. In that regard, I also call on Member States to review\nthe international regulations that currently govern our\nglobal policies regarding drugs. The Single Convention\non Narcotic Drugs of 1961, as amended by the 1972\nProtocol, the Convention on Psychotropic Substances\nof 1971 and the United Nations Convention against\nIllicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic\nSubstances of 1988 must be evaluated on the basis of its\nresults and brought up to date to allow us to achieve the\ndesired outcomes. That is a serious challenge that must\nbe addressed in all earnestness so that we can have a\nrespectful and frank multilateral dialogue, informed by\nclear scientific evidence regarding the best strategies\navailable to ensure that our young people are protected\nfrom the scourge of drugs.\nIn that regard, last April the Heads of State and\nGovernment of the Western Hemisphere met for the\nSummit of the Americas in Cartagena de Indias. Our\nhost, Mr. Santos Calder\u00f3n, President of Colombia,\ninvited us to discuss new avenues to combat drug\ntrafficking. The agreement reached was that we should\nundertake studies to assess new alternatives, which we would discuss next year, in June, at a meeting of the\nOrganization of American States in Guatemala. That\nis a step in the right direction and one that we believe\nshould be emulated at the global level.\nIn the same spirit, Guatemala would like to propose\nthe establishment of a group of countries that are well\ndisposed to reforming global policies on drugs. The\ngroup would bring together Governments that are\ninterested in promoting in appropriate international\nforums an objective and rigorous assessment of\nprevailing policies and inconsidering new, creative\nand innovative alternatives. We must seek such new\navenues responsibly and tenaciously, and I am sure that\nwith the cooperation of all producing, consuming and\ntransit countries, we will succeed.\nAllow me to stress that it is not a matter of\nabandoning the fight against the scourge of drugs.\nRather, it is a matter of arming ourselves better and\nresponding with greater effectiveness and clarity,\nbecause our children and grandchildren deserve a more\nintegrated and effective response from the international\ncommunity.\nI would like to conclude my thoughts by reaffirming\nthat Guatemala will not renege on any international\ncommitments to which it is party. We have no desire\nfor unilateral action, which would only sow chaos and\nconflict when the response should be a global one. We\nwill wait patiently to change our policies in Guatemala\nuntil the international community moves forward\nand arrives at a new consensus. At the same time,\nhowever, I commit my leadership to moving forward\non evaluating the global policy on drugs, so as to make\nit more effective and based on current international\nstandards that reflect the challenges and realities of the\ntwenty-first century.\nBefore concluding, I would like to brief ly raise three\npoints that I believe to be important to this meeting of\nthe General Assembly. First, as a demonstration of our\ncommitment to defending and promoting human rights\non all fronts, on 14 January I said that Guatemala would\nseek to ratify the Rome Statute of the International\nCriminal Court and thus become a party to the Statute.\nI am pleased to report that, on 2 April, we deposited our\ninstrument of ratification.\nSecondly, in that same speech, I indicated that\nwe would make it a priority of our foreign policy to\ncontribute to the ideals of democracy, justice and peace,\nwithin a framework of absolute respect for international law. In that regard, I indicated that Guatemala would\nfulfil its duties on the Security Council responsibly and\nin a constructive spirit. I believe that so far we have\nkept that promise, and we are pleased that in six days\nGuatemala will assume the presidency of the Council\nfor the month of October, and we will continue to act\nresponsibly.\nThirdly, regarding the events of recent weeks, we\nreject all acts that defame religions. At the same time,\nwe condemn violence in any form, including assaults\non diplomatic missions. Such expressions of intolerance\noffend us all.\nFinally, I would like to recall that, on 21 December,\nGuatemala will celebrate the beginning of a new era\naccording to the Mayan calendar. That era, 13 Baktun,\nmarks the start of a very positive new age that will\nenable and invite us to renew physical and spiritual\nenergies in an atmosphere of peace, cooperation and\ndialogue. All heads of State and Government are invited\nto join us in Tikal National Park to share in the dawn of\nthis new era. The Mayans of yesterday and today, and\nall Guatemalans, await them with open arms."

        "file_name": "USA_67_2012.txt",
        "file_text": "\ufeffI would like to begin today by\ntelling the Assembly about an American named Chris\nStevens. Chris was born in a town called Grass Valley,\nCalifornia, the son of a lawyer and a musician. As a\nyoung man, Chris joined the Peace Corps and taught English in Morocco, and he came to love and respect\nthe people of North Africa and the Middle East. He\nwould carry that commitment throughout his life.\nAs a diplomat, he worked from Egypt to Syria, from\nSaudi Arabia to Libya. He was known for walking the\nstreets of the cities where he worked, tasting the local\nfood, meeting as many people as he could, speaking\nArabic, listening with a broad smile. Chris went to\nBenghazi, arriving on a cargo ship, in the early days\nof the Libyan revolution. As America\u2019s representative,\nhe helped the Libyan people as they coped with violent\nconflict, cared for the wounded and crafted a vision\nfor the future in which the rights of all Libyans would\nbe respected. After the revolution, he supported the\nbirth of a new democracy as Libyans held elections and\nbuilt new institutions and began to move forward after\ndecades of dictatorship.\nChris Stevens loved his work. He took pride in the\ncountry he served, and he saw dignity in the people that\nhe met.\nTwo weeks ago, he travelled to Benghazi to review\nplans to establish a new cultural center and modernize\na hospital. That is when America\u2019s compound came\nunder attack. Along with three of his colleagues, Chris\nwas killed in the city that he had helped to save. He was\n52 years old.\nI tell this story because Chris Stevens embodied\nthe best of America. Like his fellow Foreign Service\nofficers, he built bridges across oceans and cultures and\nwas deeply invested in the international cooperation\nthat the United Nations represents. He acted with\nhumility, but he also stood up for a set of principles, a\nbelief that individuals should be free to determine their\nown destiny and live with liberty, dignity, justice and\nopportunity.\nThe attacks on the American civilians in Benghazi\nwere attacks on America. We are grateful for the\nassistance we received from the Libyan Government\nand from the Libyan people. There should be no doubt\nthat we will be relentless in tracking down the killers\nand bringing them to justice. I also appreciate that,\nin recent days, the leaders of other countries in the\nregion \u2014 including Egypt, Tunisia and Yemen \u2014 have\ntaken steps to secure our diplomatic facilities and called\nfor calm. So have religious authorities around the globe.\nBut it should be understood that the attacks of the\nlast two weeks are not simply an assault on America.\n\nThey are also an assault on the very ideals upon which\nthe United Nations was founded \u2014 the notion that people\ncan resolve their differences peacefully; that diplomacy\ncan take the place of war, and that, in an interdependent\nworld, all of us have a stake in working towards greater\nopportunity and security for our citizens.\nIf we are serious about upholding those ideals, it\nwill not be enough to put more guards in front of an\nEmbassy or to put out statements of regret and wait for\nthe outrage to pass. If we are serious about those ideals,\nwe must speak honestly about the deeper causes of the\ncrisis, because we face a choice between the forces that\nwould drive us apart and the hopes we hold in common.\nToday, we must affirm that our future will be\ndetermined by people like Chris Stevens, and not by\nhis killers. Today, we must declare that such violence\nand intolerance has no place among our United Nations.\nIt has been less than two years since a vendor in\nTunisia set himself on fire to protest the oppressive\ncorruption in his country and sparked what became\nknown as the Arab Spring. Since then, the world has\nbeen captivated by the transformation that has taken\nplace, and the United States has supported the forces\nof change.\nWe were inspired by the Tunisian protests that\ntoppled a dictator, because we recognized our own\nbeliefs in the aspirations of the men and women who\ntook to the streets.\nWe supported change in Egypt, because our\nsupport for democracy ultimately put us on the side of\nthe people.\nWe welcomed a transition of leadership in Yemen,\nbecause the interests of the people were no longer being\nserved by a corrupt status quo.\nWe intervened in Libya alongside a broad coalition\nand with the mandate of the United Nations Security\nCouncil, because we had the ability to stop the\nslaughter of innocents and because we believed that the\naspirations of the people were more powerful than a\ntyrant.\nAnd as we meet here, we again declare that the\nregime of Bashar Al-Assad must come to an end, so\nthat the suffering of the Syrian people can stop and a\nnew dawn can begin.\nWe have taken those positions because we believe\nthat freedom and self-determination are not unique to one culture. Those values are not simply American\nvalues or Western values \u2014 they are universal values.\nAnd even as there will be huge challenges that come\nwith a transition to democracy, I am convinced that,\nultimately, Government of the people, by the people and\nfor the people is more likely to bring about the stability,\nprosperity and individual opportunity that serve as the\nbasis for peace in our world.\nSo, let us remember that this is a season of progress.\nFor the first time in decades, Tunisians, Egyptians and\nLibyans voted for new leaders in elections that were\ncredible, competitive and fair. That democratic spirit\nhas not been restricted to the Arab world. Over the past\nyear, we have seen peaceful transitions of power in\nMalawi and Senegal and a new President in Somalia.\nIn Burma, a President has freed political prisoners and\nopened a closed society, a courageous dissident has\nbeen elected to Parliament, and people look forward to\nfurther reform. Around the globe, people are making\ntheir voices heard, insisting on their innate dignity and\nthe right to determine their future.\nAnd yet the turmoil of recent weeks reminds us that\nthe path to democracy does not end with the casting\nof a ballot. Nelson Mandela once said, \u201cTo be free is\nnot merely to cast off one\u2019s chains, but to live in a way\nthat respects and enhances the freedom of others\u201d. True\ndemocracy demands that citizens cannot be thrown in\njail because of what they believe and that businesses\ncan be opened without paying a bribe. It depends on the\nfreedom of citizens to speak their minds and assemble\nwithout fear and on the rule of law and due process,\nwhich guarantee the rights of all people.\nIn other words, true democracy \u2014 real freedom \u2014 is\nhard work. Those in power have to resist the temptation\nto crack down on dissidents. In hard economic times,\ncountries may be tempted to rally the people around\nperceived enemies at home and abroad, rather than\nfocusing on the painstaking work of reform.\nMoreover, there will always be those who reject\nhuman progress \u2014 dictators who cling to power, corrupt\ninterests that depend upon the status quo, and extremists\nwho fan the flames of hate and division. From Northern\nIreland to South Asia, from Africa to the Americas,\nfrom the Balkans to the Pacific Rim, we have witnessed\nconvulsions that can accompany transitions to a new\npolitical order. At times, the conflicts arise along the\nfault lines of race or tribe, and often they arise from the difficulties of reconciling tradition and faith with\nthe diversity and interdependence of the modern world.\nIn every country, there are those who find different\nreligious beliefs threatening; in every culture, those\nwho love freedom for themselves must ask themselves\nhow much they are willing to tolerate freedom for\nothers. That is what we saw play out in the last two\nweeks, as a crude and disgusting video sparked outrage\nthroughout the Muslim world. Now, I have made it\nclear that the United States Government had nothing\nto do with that video, and I believe its message must\nbe rejected by all who respect our common humanity.\nIt is an insult not only to Muslims, but to America as\nwell, for as the city outside these walls makes clear, we\nare a country that has welcomed people of every race\nand every faith. We are home to Muslims, who worship\nacross our country. We not only respect the freedom\nof religion, we have laws that protect individuals from\nbeing harmed because of how they look or what they\nbelieve. We understand why people take offence at that\nvideo, because millions of our citizens are among those\npeople.\nI know there are some who ask why we do not just\nban such a video. And the answer is enshrined in our\nlaws; our Constitution protects the right to practice free\nspeech. Here in the United States, countless publications\nprovoke offence. Like me, the majority of Americans\nare Christian, and yet we do not ban blasphemy against\nour most sacred beliefs. As President of our country\nand Commander-in-Chief of our military, I accept that\npeople are going to call me awful things every day, and\nI will always defend their right to do so.\nAmericans have fought and died around the globe\nto protect the right of all people to express their views,\neven views that we profoundly disagree with. We do not\ndo so because we support hateful speech, but because\nour founders understood that without such protections,\nthe capacity of individuals to express their own views\nand practise their own faith may be threatened. We do\nso because in a diverse society, efforts to restrict speech\ncan quickly become a tool to silence critics and oppress\nminorities. We do so because, given the power of faith in\nour lives and the passion that religious differences can\ninflame, the strongest weapon against hateful speech\nis not repression; it is more speech \u2014 the voices of\ntolerance that rally against bigotry and blasphemy, and\nlift up the values of understanding and mutual respect.\n\nI know that not all countries in this body share\nthat particular understanding of the protection of free\nspeech. We recognize that. But in 2012, at a time\nwhen anyone with a cell phone can spread offensive\nviews around the world with the click of a button, the\nnotion that we can control the f low of information is\nobsolete. The question then is how do we respond? And\non this we must agree: there is no speech that justifies\nmindless violence. There are no words that excuse the\nkilling of innocents. There is no video that justifies\nan attack on an embassy. There is no slander that\nprovides an excuse for people to burn a restaurant in\nLebanon, or destroy a school in Tunis, or cause death\nand destruction in Pakistan. In our modern world with\nmodern technologies, for us to respond in that way to\nhateful speech empowers any individual who engages\nin such speech to create chaos around the world. We\nempower the worst of us if that is how we respond.\nMore broadly, the events of the past two weeks also\nspeak to the need for all of us to honestly address the\ntensions between the West and the Arab world, which\nis moving towards democracy. Now, let me be clear:\njust as we cannot solve every problem in the world, the\nUnited States has not and will not seek to dictate the\noutcome of democratic transitions abroad. We do not\nexpect other nations to agree with us on every issue,\nnor do we assume that the violence of the past weeks or\nthe hateful speech of some individuals represents the\nviews of the overwhelming majority of Muslims, any\nmore than the views of the people who produced that\nvideo represent those of Americans.\nHowever, I do believe that it is the obligation of all\nleaders in all countries to speak out forcefully against\nviolence and extremism. It is time to marginalize those\nwho, even when not directly resorting to violence, use\nhatred of America, or the West, or Israel, as the central\norganizing principle of politics. For that only gives\ncover, and sometimes provides an excuse, for those who\ndo resort to violence.\nThat brand of politics, one that pits East against\nWest, and South against North, Muslims against\nChristians and Hindus and Jews, cannot deliver on the\npromise of freedom. To young people, it offers only\nfalse hope. Burning an American f lag does nothing to\nprovide a child with an education. Smashing apart a\nrestaurant does not fill an empty stomach. Attacking\nan embassy will not create a single job. That brand of\npolitics only makes it harder to achieve what we must\ndo together, namely, to educate our children and create the opportunities that they deserve; protect human\nrights and extend democracy\u2019s promise.\nIt should be understood that America will never\nretreat from the world. We will bring to justice those\nwho harm our citizens and our friends, and we will\nstand with our allies. We are willing to partner with\ncountries around the world to deepen ties of trade\nand investment, science and technology, energy and\ndevelopment \u2014 all efforts that can spark economic\ngrowth for all our peoples and stabilize democratic\nchange.\nBut such efforts depend on a spirit of mutual\ninterest and mutual respect. No Government or\ncompany, no school or non-governmental organization\nwill be confident working in a country where its people\nare endangered. For partnerships to be effective,\nour citizens must be secure and our efforts must be\nwelcomed. A politics based only on anger \u2014 one based\non dividing the world between us and them \u2014 not\nonly sets back international cooperation, it ultimately\nundermines those who tolerate it. All of us have an\ninterest in standing up to those forces.\nLet us remember that Muslims have suffered the\nmost at the hands of extremism. On the same day that\nour civilians were killed in Benghazi, a Turkish police\nofficer was murdered in Istanbul only days before his\nwedding; more than 10 Yemenis were killed in a car\nbomb in Sana\u2019a; several Afghan children were mourned\nby their parents just days after they were killed by\na suicide bomber in Kabul. The impulse towards\nintolerance and violence may initially be focused on the\nWest, but over time it cannot be contained. The same\nimpulses towards extremism are used to justify war\nbetween Sunni and Shia, between tribes and clans. It\nleads not to strength and prosperity but to chaos. In less\nthan two years, we have seen largely peaceful protests\nbring more change to Muslim-majority countries than\na decade of violence. And extremists understand this.\nBecause they have nothing to offer to improve the lives\nof people, violence is their only way to stay relevant.\nThey do not build; they only destroy.\nIt is time to leave the call to violence and the politics\nof division behind. On so many issues, we face a choice\nbetween the promise of the future or the prisons of the\npast. And we cannot afford to get it wrong. We must\nseize this moment. And America stands ready to work\nwith all who are willing to embrace a better future.\nThe future must not belong to those who target Coptic Christians in Egypt; it must be claimed by those in\nTahrir Square who chanted, \u201cMuslims, Christians, we\nare one.\u201d The future must not belong to those who bully\nwomen; it must be shaped by girls who go to school,\nand those who stand for a world where our daughters\ncan live their dreams just like our sons.\nThe future must not belong to those corrupt few\nwho steal a country\u2019s resources; it must be won by the\nstudents and entrepreneurs, the workers and business\nowners who seek a broader prosperity for all people.\nThose are the women and men that America stands\nwith; theirs is the vision we will support.\nThe future must not belong to those who slander\nthe Prophet of Islam. But to be credible, those who\ncondemn that slander must also condemn the hate we\nsee in the images of Jesus Christ that are desecrated,\nor churches that are destroyed, or the Holocaust that is\ndenied.\nLet us condemn incitement against Sufi Muslims\nand Shia pilgrims. It is time to heed the words of\nGandhi: \u201cIntolerance is itself a form of violence and\nan obstacle to the growth of a true democratic spirit\u201d.\nTogether we must work towards a world where we are\nstrengthened by our differences, not defined by them.\nThat is what America embodies; that is the vision that\nwe will support.\nAmong Israelis and Palestinians, the future must\nnot belong to those who turn their backs on the prospect\nof peace. Let us leave behind those who thrive on\nconflict, those who reject the right of Israel to exist.\nThe road is hard, but the destination is clear: a secure,\nJewish State of Israel and an independent, prosperous\nPalestine. Understanding that such a peace must come\nthrough a just agreement between the parties, America\nwill walk alongside all who are prepared to make that\njourney.\nIn Syria, the future must not belong to a dictator\nwho massacres his people. If there is a cause that cries\nout for protest in the world today, peaceful protest, it\nis a regime that tortures children and shoots rockets\nat apartment buildings. We must remain engaged to\nensure that what began with citizens demanding their\nrights does not end in a cycle of sectarian violence.\nTogether, we must stand with those Syrians who\nbelieve in a different vision: a Syria that is united and\ninclusive, where children do not need to fear their own\nGovernment and all Syrians have a say in how they are governed, Sunnis and Alawites, Kurds and Christians.\nThat is what America stands for. That is the outcome\nthat we will work for, with sanctions and consequences\nfor those who persecute, and assistance and support\nfor those who work for this common good, because we\nbelieve that the Syrians who embrace this vision will\nhave the strength and the legitimacy to lead.\nIn Iran, we see where the path of a violent and\nunaccountable ideology leads. The Iranian people\nhave a remarkable and ancient history, and many\nIranians wish to enjoy peace and prosperity alongside\ntheir neighbours. But just as it restricts the rights of\nits own people, the Iranian Government continues to\nprop up a dictator in Damascus and supports terrorist\ngroups abroad. Time and again, it has failed to take the\nopportunity to demonstrate that its nuclear programme\nis peaceful and to meet its obligations to the United\nNations.\nSo let me be clear. America wants to resolve this\nissue through diplomacy, and we believe that there\nis still time and space to do so. But that time is not\nunlimited. We respect the right of nations to access\npeaceful nuclear power, but one of the purposes of the\nUnited Nations is to see that we harness that power for\npeace. Make no mistake: a nuclear-armed Iran is not a\nchallenge that can be contained. It would threaten the\nelimination of Israel, the security of Gulf nations and\nthe stability of the global economy. It risks triggering\na nuclear-arms race in the region and the unravelling\nof the Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear\nWeapons. That is why a coalition of countries is holding\nthe Iranian Government accountable, and that is why\nthe United States will do what we must to prevent Iran\nfrom obtaining a nuclear weapon.\nWe know from painful experience that the path\nto security and prosperity does not lie outside the\nboundaries of international law and respect for human\nrights. That is why this institution was established, from\nthe rubble of conflict. That is why liberty triumphed\nover tyranny in the cold war, and that is the lesson of\nthe last two decades as well.\nHistory shows that peace and progress come to\nthose who make the right choices. Nations in every part\nof the world have travelled this difficult path. Europe,\nthe bloodiest battlefield of the twentieth century, is\nunited, free and at peace. From Brazil to South Africa,\nfrom Turkey to South Korea, from India to Indonesia,\npeople of different races, religions and traditions have lifted millions out of poverty, while respecting the\nrights of their citizens and meeting their responsibilities\nas nations.\nIt is because of the progress that I have witnessed\nin my own lifetime, the progress that I have witnessed\nafter nearly four years as President, that I remain ever\nhopeful about the world that we live in. The war in\nIraq is over. American troops have come home. We\nhave begun a transition in Afghanistan, and America\nand our allies will end our war on schedule in 2014.\nAl-Qaida has been weakened, and Osama bin Laden\nis no more. Nations have come together to lock down\nnuclear materials, and America and Russia are reducing\nour arsenals. We have seen hard choices made, from\nNaypyidaw to Cairo to Abidjan, to put more power in\nthe hands of citizens.\nAt a time of economic challenge, the world\nhas come together to broaden prosperity. Through\nthe Group of 20, we have partnered with emerging\ncountries to keep the world on the path of recovery.\nAmerica has pursued a development agenda that fuels\ngrowth and breaks dependency, and has worked with\nAfrican leaders to help them feed their nations. New\npartnerships have been forged to combat corruption and\npromote government that is open and transparent, and\nnew commitments have been made through the Equal\nFutures Partnership to ensure that women and girls can\nfully participate in politics and pursue opportunity.\nLater today, I will discuss our efforts to combat the\nscourge of human trafficking.\nAll those things give me hope. But what gives\nme the most hope is not the actions taken by us, not\nthe actions of leaders; it is the people that I have\nseen \u2014 the American troops who have risked their lives\nand sacrificed their limbs for strangers half a world\naway, the students in Jakarta or Seoul who are eager\nto use their knowledge to benefit mankind, the faces in\na square in Prague or a parliament in Ghana who see\ndemocracy giving voice to their aspirations, the young\npeople in the favelas of Rio and the schools of Mumbai\nwhose eyes shine with promise. Those men, women,\nand children of every race and every faith remind me\nthat for every angry mob that gets shown on television,\nthere are billions around the world who share similar\nhopes and dreams. They tell us that there is a common\nheartbeat to humanity.\nSo much attention in our world turns to what\ndivides us. That is what we see on the news. That is what consumes our political debates. But when you strip\nit all away, people everywhere long for the freedom to\ndetermine their destiny; the dignity that comes with\nwork; the comfort that comes with faith; and the justice\nthat exists when Governments serve their people and\nnot the other way around.\nThe United States of America will always stand up\nfor these aspirations, for our own people and for people\nall across the world. That was our founding purpose.\nThat is what our history shows. That is what Chris\nStevens worked for throughout his life.\nI promise you this: long after the killers are brought\nto justice, Chris Stevens\u2019s legacy will live on in the lives\nthat he touched, in the tens of thousands who marched\nagainst violence through the streets of Benghazi; in the\nLibyans who changed their Facebook photo to one of\nChris; in the signs that read simply, \u201cChris Stevens was\na friend to all Libyans\u201d. They should give us hope. They\nshould remind us that so long as we work for it justice\nwill be done, that history is on our side and that a rising\ntide of liberty will never be reversed.\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI thank you, sir, for the opportunity\nto address the General Assembly at its sixty-seventh\ngeneral debate. Let me start by congratulating Mr. Vuk\nJeremi\u0107 and the Republic of Serbia on his election to\npreside over the sixty-seventh session of the General\nAssembly. We also acknowledge the contribution of\nthe President of the Assembly at its sixty-sixth session,\nMr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser.\nSouth Africa fundamentally believes in the\nprinciples and purposes contained in the Charter of\nthe United Nations, and correctly so, given our nation\u2019s\nhistory. This year, we are proudly celebrating 100 years\nof our people\u2019s self less struggle for freedom, led by the\nAfrican National Congress movement. We recall with\ngreat appreciation the immense contribution of the United Nations to the creation of a free and democratic\nSouth Africa.\nIn 1966, the General Assembly labelled apartheid\na crime against humanity in resolution 2202 A (XXI),\nwhich ultimately led to the International Convention\non the Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of\nApartheid, later known as the Apartheid Convention.\nThe United Nations defined the crime of apartheid\nas \u201cinhuman acts committed for the purpose of\nestablishing and maintaining domination by one racial\ngroup of persons over any other racial group of persons\nand systematically oppressing them\u201d (resolution 3068\n(XXVIII), annex, article II). The Apartheid Convention\nwas adopted by the General Assembly on 30 November\n1973 and set the tone for vociferous action against\napartheid around the world.\nLet me repeat the words our leader and international\nicon, President Nelson Mandela, uttered in his very\nfirst address to the General Assembly, in 1994, the first\nby a democratically elected leader and Head of State of\nour country. He said,\n\u201cThe millions of our people say \u2018Thank you\u2019\nand \u2018Thank you again, because the respect for your\nown dignity as human beings inspired you to act\nto ensure the restoration of our dignity as well.\u2019\u201d\n(A/49/PV.14, p.7)\nThe theme of this session is most appropriate as it\ntakes us back to the basics \u2014 to the founding principles\nof the United Nations. The founders intended the\nUnited Nations to be the foremost multilateral forum\nentrusted with bringing hope, peace and order to the\nworld. Indeed, the United Nations enjoys universal\nmembership and is at the centre of global governance\nand multilateralism. The theme reminds us that peace is\na choice. We can either choose peace as Member States\nor choose the path of conflict.\nThe founders of the United Nations made that choice\n67 years ago. They decided that the United Nations must\nlead the world to peace. It is important for the United\nNations and its organs, especially the Security Council,\nto execute the Organization\u2019s mandate of working for\npeace without fear or favour. We must not steer away\nfrom the founding objectives of the Organization.\nThe United Nations faces immense pressure when\nthe world sees the unprecedented loss of lives, as it now\ndoes in Africa and the Middle East. It is of concern\nwhen it appears as if the United Nations were unable to act and assist, and when it comes across as paralysed in\ncertain instances, due to the actions of some Member\nStates. We have seen a divided Security Council unable\nto muster the collective courage to say \u201cno more\u201d to\nwarring parties in the interest of peace. That brings\nto the fore the need to continue and deepen the reform\nof the United Nations and its organs to make it agile\nand nimble in addressing the contemporary challenges\nfacing humanity.\nThe debate on the reform of the United Nations\nand its organs, in particular the Security Council, has\nbeen going on for the past 18 years. However, there\nhas been no significant movement forward. I would\nlike to focus in particular on the Security Council.\nGiven its mandate, the Council has to be legitimate,\ndemocratic and transparent. Its current composition has\na propensity for deadlock and paralysis even in the face\nof crisis. It remains unrepresentative and undemocratic\nin both its composition and decision-making.\nWe would like to see a more meaningful\nrepresentation of Africa in the Security Council. About\n70 per cent of the Council\u2019s agenda is taken up by issues\nfrom the African continent. The Security Council has\nto be expanded in both categories, with at least two\nseats for Africa in the permanent category and five in\nthe non-permanent category. In addition to seats for the\ncontinent in the composition of the Council, the United\nNations should also fully recognize and appreciate the\nrole of regional organizations working with the United\nNations in conflict management and resolution.\nIn that regard, we urge closer collaboration with the\nAfrican Union (AU) peace and security mechanisms,\nespecially given the progress being made by the AU\nin conflict resolution and peacebuilding in some parts\nof the continent since its formation 10 years ago.\nTherefore, cognizance should be taken of Chapter VIII\nof the Charter, in particular when dealing with African\nissues.That is why South Africa piloted resolution 2033\n(2012) during our rotating presidency of the Security\nCouncil in January.\nCurrently, the AU continues to address one of the\nlongest outstanding conflicts on the continent through\none of its mechanisms, the African Union High-level\nImplementation Panel on the Sudan. Together, as the\ninternational community, we recently celebrated\nthe creation of the State of South Sudan. We wish\nto congratulate the Somalis and their leadership on\nchoosing the path of peace, democracy and prosperity.\n\nThe international community and the United Nations\nmust continue to give the people of Somalia all the\nnecessary support.\nAfrica is indeed making progress and, with United\nNations support, that could go further. To promote\nthe peaceful settlement of disputes, we also wish to\nemphasize that the Security Council should carry out\nits Charter mandate within the confines of international\nlaw.\nAny Member State or international body that\nimplements Council resolutions should be accountable\nto the Council, so as to ensure that we avoid the\nabuse of internationally agreed principles such as the\nresponsibility to protect and the protection of civilians.\nThose principles must not be used, amongst other\nthings, to justify the notion of regime change. They\nexist to prevent mass atrocities, war crimes, genocide\nand ethnic cleansing.We should continue the debate\non them in order to develop norms and standards for\naccountability when actions are taken.\nIt is also of critical importance for the United\nNations to closely guard its impartiality, independence\nand objectivity and not allow itself to be dragged into a\nconflict to take sides with any party under the guise of\nprotecting civilians.\nThe situation in the Middle East, in particular the\nPalestine-Israeli question, continues to be of concern\nto us. The United Nations should play a central and\ndecisive role in efforts to resolve the long-standing\nconflict in that region. Any act of aggression or\nviolations of international law should be condemned\nunequivocally by the United Nations at all times. As\nthe United Nations, we cannot be seen to be strong in\ncondemning some acts while being soft on others. As\nSouth Africa, we remain committed to the two-State\nsolution based on the 1967 borders, with Palestine and\nIsrael coexisting side by side in peace.\nLet me also emphasize that South Africa fully\nsupports the application by Palestine for full membership\nof the United Nations. It is unacceptable that, even\ntoday, Palestine remains outside the membership of the\nUnited Nations. We trust that that matter will soon be\npositively concluded.\nIn further promotion of the peaceful resolution of\ndisputes, we believe that the sovereign right of States\nto nuclear energy for peaceful and civilian use should\nbe respected in accordance with international law.\n\nWe have taken note that the Director General of the\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency has been able to\ndraw the conclusion that all declared nuclear material\nin Iran is used for peaceful activities. Clarification\nof the nature of undeclared materials will enable the\ninternational community to have full confidence\nin the exclusively peaceful nature of Iran\u2019s nuclear\nprogramme. South Africa therefore encourages Iran to\ncontinue its cooperation with the Agency.\nWe should also remember that so long as some\nStates are allowed to operate outside internationally\nagreed norms, such as those of the Treaty on the\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, it will be\ndifficult to expect others to operate within them. South\nAfrica supports the long-standing call for a nuclear-free\nzone in the Middle East. In that regard, the peaceful\nresolution of the Iranian nuclear issue is very important.\nLet me use this opportunity to reiterate our support\nfor the ongoing struggle for self-determination by the\npeople of Western Sahara. We urge the international\ncommunity to support their quest for freedom, human\nrights and dignity.\nWe also reiterate our call for the lifting of the\neconomic and financial embargo against the people of\nCuba in order to help the Cuban people to gain their\neconomic freedom.\nPoverty, underdevelopment, lack of opportunities\nand competition for scarce resources contribute to\nsome of the conflicts in the developing world, including\nAfrica. Therefore, the promotion of sustainable\ndevelopment and the fight against poverty cannot be\ndivorced from the quest for peace.\nIn 2015, the United Nations will be 70 years old\nand will also reach the target year for the achievement\nof the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). World\nleaders committed themselves to eradicating extreme\npoverty, facilitating universal primary education,\nattaining gender equality, improving maternal and\nchild health, reducing the burden of disease primarily\nby combating HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis,\nprotecting the environment, and mobilizing global\npartnerships for development by 2015. The Heads of\nState also committed themselves to promoting gender\nequality and the empowerment of women as effective\nways to combat poverty, hunger and disease and to\nstimulate truly sustainable development. We urge the\nUnited Nations to continue promoting the achievement of the MDGs and other instruments whose tenets\nadvance the human rights of women.\nWe are concerned that sub-Saharan Africa is\nunlikely to meet the targets for the MDGs. Awareness\nof that possibility should not make us give up; in the\nnext three years, we must accelerate the implementation\nof the MDGs. We appeal to all who have made financial\ncommitments to Africa for the achievement of the\nMDGs not to renege on those commitments. We would\nlike to express our appreciation to those development\npartners that continue to stick to their 0.7 per cent\nofficial development assistance commitment despite\ntheir financial difficulties at the domestic level.\nWe support the Secretary-General\u2019s High-level\nPanel of Eminent Persons to focus on the acceleration\nof the implementation of the MDGs, and would urge\nthat much of its focus be on assisting Africa in meeting\nall its targets. However, we wish to caution against\nprejudging the review outcome and prematurely setting\nin motion processes that would undermine the ideals of\nthe MDGs.\nThe protection and promotion of human rights\nand fundamental freedoms should be at the centre of\nour collective desire to resolve international disputes\nby peaceful means. Racism and racial discrimination\ncontinue to be an affront to the very basic founding\nprinciples of the United Nations and must be fought\nrelentlessly. We should shun any idea in any part of the\nworld that seems to suggest that there is a superior race\nor human being on the basis of skin colour. The danger\nof such ideas is still fresh in our collective memory.\nWe have learned from the evils of colonialism, two\nWorld Wars and the system of apartheid. We should all\nrenew our commitment to continue to build on the solid\nfoundation laid by the Durban Declaration and the Plan\nof Action that we adopted more than a decade ago at\nthe end of the World Conference against Racism, Racial\nDiscrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance.\nIn Durban last December, South Africa had\nthe honour of hosting the seventeenth session of\nthe Conference of the Parties to the United Nations\nFramework Convention on Climate Change and the\nseventh session of the Conference of the Parties\nserving as the Meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto\nProtocol. Member States must ensure that agreements\nare implemented. In that regard, the Durban Platform\noffers an opportunity for progress that we must utilize\nto move forward.\n\nToday\u2019s timely debate is a reminder that, ultimately,\npeace is a choice. Peace is achievable. The wise and brave\nchoices we have the power to make can deliver lasting\npeace to every corner of the world. We are called upon\nat this sixty-seventh session of the General Assembly to\nchoose peace by reforming and strengthening the United\nNations so that it can play its rightful role and deliver\npeace, security, sustainable development and respect\nfor human rights and fundamental freedoms throughout\nthe world. As the foremost multilateral forum bringing\ntogether all nations of the world, the United Nations is\nbest placed to play this role. It requires our support as\nMember States at all times, both for our sake and for\nthat of future generations."

I would also like to seize this opportunity to thank\nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his continued work\nin support of the role of the United Nations.\nThese days, the Arab world is experiencing a\ndifficult and risky period that is, at the same time, full\nof hope. As a matter of fact, it is an impressive attempt\nto correct prevailing conditions in a region with a\nspecial history, at a time when the world order is rapidly\nchanging. The current period represents a special, new\nand unprecedented experience that forms part of human\nhistory. Today\u2019s experiences differ from the previous\nexperiences of nations and peoples who participated\nin changing times. They accepted the necessary\nconsequences and bore the costs with the knowledge\nthat the costs were consistent with moving forward at\nthe appropriate time in response to ambitions towards\nfreedom, enlightenment, respect for the dignity of man\nand development. But the Arab experience of transition\nis unique in its pace and process.\nConditions in the Arab world, seen from afar,\nmay show disturbances and problems in many places\nwith images of smoke and flames. However, I would\nlike, from this rostrum, to reassure all those who are\nfollowing the events in the region and may sometimes\nfeel uncomfortable about what they see and hear. Those\nevents represent the movement of a nation struggling to\ncope with the times and continue its forward march, as\nit has many times before. Yet now that march has been\ninterrupted by obstacles, both external and internal and\nregional and international.\nThose obstacles have frustrated its will and derailed\nits march. But it has recently taken matters into its own\nhands after having suffered dictatorship, dependence\nand corruption.\nWe remember that the American political and social\nexperience was born of a civil war that the country\nhad to undergo to affirm its unity. Today\u2019s Europe\nexperienced terrible world wars until it achieved a\ndegree of unity that could not be achieved by arms or\nhegemony. And Asia has seen highly successful cases\nof nations advancing and achieving their aspirations,\nafter long periods of painful new birth.\nI say this to assure whoever cares about our part\nof the world and its future that what is going on in our\nregion is natural and historic.\nIt is not reasonable to expect that people can attain\ntheir freedom as soon as they ask for it. Human history shows that peoples have sacrificed their lives and wealth\nto gain freedom. In the same way, dictatorships do not\nchange at the first signs of revolution but require real\nresistance to depose them. The desire for advancement\nwill not eliminate backwardness except through hard\nwork. Occupied territories will never be restored by a\nmere rejection of the occupation, but by persistence in\ndemanding rights and by resistance using all legitimate\nmeans.\nWhat adds to the difficulties of the transition in\nour Arab world is that it takes place in a time of great\naspirations and a climate subject to all sorts of changes\nand complications. Our peoples have had to fight to\nchange their lives under circumstances that differ\ngreatly from those faced by others in similar situations.\nIn America, Europe, Asia and other places, historical\ntransitions have taken place within certain limits. In the\nArab world, however, that birth has had to take place\nunder spotlights, before the eyes of the entire world,\nunder the watchful eye of satellites crisscrossing space\nand shaped by electronic media, without any shield or\nbarrier of any sort.\nIn order to achieve their objectives, those who\nundertake internal and external interventions to peoples\nfrom attaining their legitimate rights do not hesitate\nto use all means at their disposal, from exploitation\nof the past and its complex legacy to other means of\nprovocation. They can even use arms, shedding seas of\nblood, if other means fail or take too long. All of that\nhas made our transition from past to future and from\nbackwardness to development a risky process, under\nfire from all corners.\nTogether with others, we realized the risks inherent\nin the current phase of the evolution of our nation and of\nthe Arab world. If we could ask for one thing during this\nsession, it would be an encouraging reconfirmation of\nthe right of our Arab world to continue its advancement\nand achieve its aspirations in a new world, a world\nshaped by science and technology, a world that the\npioneers who wrote the well-known conventions on\nrights and freedom could not have imagined.\nOn the other hand, I hope that this world gathering\nwill take a stand that reflects sympathy with the\nhistoric transformations under way in the Arab world.\nThat would reassure the people who are working\nhard and with determination to carve out a place for\nthemselves in history and who struggle to achieve\nfreedom and dignity, hoping for a better tomorrow for\nfuture generations.\n\nThe situation in Syria has reached an unacceptable\nphase. Hundreds of innocent Syrians are killed every\nday, under the fire of a regime that does not hesitate\nto use all sorts of weapons against its own people. We\nhave used all available means to help Syria extricate\nitself from the cycle of killing, but in vain. The Security\nCouncil has failed to reach an effective position.\nIn view of that, I believe that the Arab countries\nthemselves should intervene, in order to fulfil their\nnational humanitarian, political and military duties, and\ndo what is necessary to stop the bloodshed in Syria, the\nkilling of innocent people and their displacement and\nguarantee a peaceful transition of power. We do have\na precedent in that respect. Arab forces intervened in\nLebanon in the mid-1970s to stop the internal fighting\nthere, and their efforts proved effective and useful. We\nurge all countries that believe in the cause of the Syrian\npeople to provide every type of support to that people\nuntil they are able to secure their legitimate rights.\nDespite all the suffering in the Middle East, the\ncore problem remains the Palestinian question: the\ncontinued Israeli occupation of the Arab territories\nin the West Bank, the Golan and Shaba\u2019a farms in\nsouthern Lebanon, the stif ling blockade imposed on the\nGaza Strip and the continued arrest and imprisonment\nof thousands of Palestinians in Israeli prisons. The\npeace process has stalled because of the current\nIsraeli position that insists on continuing the policy of\nsettlements in the Palestinian territories and Jerusalem\nand refusing to cede them.\nSometimes I would like to ask why the international\ncommunity does nothing to implement the relevant\nresolutions on the Middle East. Why does the Security\nCouncil not adopt a resolution under Chapter VII that\nwould force Israel to lift the blockade of Gaza and stop\nits settlement activity, a resolution that would return\nthe peace process to the comprehensive track instead of\nthe piecemeal approach, which does not lead to results?\nI find no answer to my questions.\nWe firmly believe in the importance of the freedom\nof expression and the right of people to express their\nopinion based on our belief in the sanctity of humanity\nand the dignity of man, who was created by God as\nfree and dignified. At the same time, we believe that\nfreedom should not exceed reasonable limits and\nbecome a tool to hurt and insult the dignity of others or\nther dignity of religions, faiths and sacred beliefs. This is a phenomenon that we have seen lately and which has\nregrettably led to the killing of innocent people.\nWe have called and we continue to call for dialogue\nin order to exchange information and experience. We\nhave called and continue to call for dialogue among\ncivilizations and religions. We have established the\nDoha International Centre for Interfaith Dialogue.\nWe have called and still call for dialogue aimed at\nacquainting ourselves with ideas and experiences from\nall over the globe and to learn about different faiths in\norder to ensure that human culture is interconnected and\neveryone has a say in its creation. Everyone should reap\nits dividends, based on understanding, appreciation,\nknowledge and the full exercise of rights.\nI have on previous occasions reiterated the\nimportance of that question and the need to strike a\nbalance between respect for sacred faiths and religions\nand freedom of expression in order for tolerance to\nreplace intolerance and acceptance of the other to\nreplace rejection and stereotyping, which is neither fair\nnor right. Today, I would like to take this opportunity to\ncall on the United Nations, those who exercise wisdom\nand reason and those who have decision-making power\nat the international level to drsft internationally agreed\nlaws, procedures and controls aimed at preventing\nreligions and faiths from being insulted under any\npretext and, at the same time, upholding the right of\nmankind to know and express its opinions.\nMs. Flores (Honduras), Vice-President, took the\nChair.\nOne of the great challenges that we must face is\nthe question of climate change and its terrible and\ndestructive consequences for all countries. This\nrequires us to cooperate and work together to reach\nthe best solutions to that challenge and overcome our\ndifferences.\nI would like to note that the State of Qatar will host\nthe eighteenth session of the Conference of the Parties to\nthe United Nations Framework Convention on Climate\nChange. The importance of this conference is that it\ncould produce a road map that could help us deal with\nthe negative effects of this phenomenon. I would like\ntake the opportunity of speaking in this international\nforum to invite all countries of the world to participate\nin the conference so that we may reach an international\nconsensus on the matter.\n\nBefore concluding, I would like to welcome the\nelection of our brother Hassan Sheikh Mohamud as\nPresident of the Somali Republic, and to wish him\nevery success in achieving security and stability in that\ncountry, whose people have suffered so much. I call\non the international community to exert greater effort\nto help Somalia to reach a solution to its crisis that is\nacceptable to all the Somali parties, one that will pave\nthe way for the return of peace to the country and will\nhelp rebuild the State after the long years of war and\ndestruction."

        "file_text": "\ufeffHer\nExcellency Mrs. Kamla Persad-Bissessar, MP, Prime\nMinister of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago, on\nwhose behalf I speak, extends her congratulations to\nMr. Vuk Jeremi\u0107 on his election as President of the\nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-seventh session. The\nhonourable Prime Minister has also asked me to convey\nto the Secretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, Trinidad\nand Tobago\u2019s appreciation for his untiring efforts in\nworking towards peace and security in today\u2019s world.\nI am privileged to address this Hall at a time\nwhen the world is faced with turmoil and uncertainty.\nToday, the world is radically different from what it was\na year ago. The redistribution of wealth and the very\nnature of global power are shifting. New dynamics\nare emerging as we witness the growing economies in\nLatin America, Asia and Africa. The global pattern of\ndistribution of resources is being transformed by new\ndiscoveries and by changes in technological processes\nand in information. The world map of financial f lows\nhas changed, forcing us to look with more scrutiny on\nthe economic forces surrounding us and the threat they\npose to financial sustainability.\nIt is in this context that Trinidad and Tobago\nendorses the President\u2019s statement at the opening of the\nAssembly\u2019s sixty-seventh session on 25 September: \u201cA growing number of States are determined to\nenhance their external engagement, aspiring to\nplay greater roles in their respective regions and\nbeyond. As a result, power and influence in the\ninternational arena are becoming more diffuse\u201d.\n(A/67/PV.6, p. 4)\nWhen Trinidad and Tobago mounted this rostrum\nfor the first time 50 years ago, our Permanent\nRepresentative Sir Ellis Clarke, an illustrious legal\nscholar, remarked:\n\u201cWe recognize the responsibility which we have\nassumed with membership in this Organization.\nThat responsibility we can neither shirk nor\ndelegate.\u201d (A/PV.1122, para. 126)\nToday, I stand in reconfirmation of that responsibility.\nIn these decades of engagement, we are always\nanchored by the three main pillars on which the United\nNations was founded: peace and security, human rights\nand development.\nAt the core of our commitment has been the rule of\nlaw both within and beyond our borders, which is the\nbasis of the theme set for this year\u2019s debate: \u201cBringing\nabout adjustment or settlement of international disputes\nor situations by peaceful means\u201d, which reaffirms a\ncore principle enshrined in the Charter of the United\nNations.\nToo often we have witnessed the severity of the\nconsequences when States act unilaterally to solve\ndisputes through the illegal use of force. Trinidad\nand Tobago calls on all nation States to ratify the\namendments to the Rome Statute of the International\nCriminal Court on the crime of aggression. We expect\nto ratify those amendments by the next Assembly of\nStates Parties. The entry into force of those amendments\nwill fill a crucial gap by making it possible to bring to\njustice those criminally responsible for the commission\nof the crime of aggression.\nIn the light of recent troubling developments,\nTrinidad and Tobago is compelled to reaffirm the\nprovisions of the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic\nRelations. The Convention requires States to protect the\npremises of diplomatic missions and ensure the safety\nof diplomatic personnel. Those sacred principles must\nbe upheld even in times of armed conflict and armed\nviolence.\nThe United Nations is the principal vehicle for\nfacilitating the settlement of disputes or situations among States by peaceful means. The architecture is in\nplace to achieve that objective. However, it needs to be\nstrengthened. To achieve that noble goal, the political\ncommitment of Member States, whether large or small,\ndeveloped or developing, is absolutely necessary.\nMember States must move swiftly to restructure the\nSecurity Council. For Trinidad and Tobago, the status\nquo is unacceptable. The Council must be reformed\nto reflect the geopolitical realities of the twenty-first\ncentury. The legitimacy of that body can be reaffirmed\nonly if the new dynamics of global power are reflected\nin its composition and operation.\nIt is a matter of grave concern to Trinidad and\nTobago that the Security Council has not been able to\neffectively address the situation in Syria. We appeal to\nthe Council to fully support the work of Mr. Lakhdar\nBrahimi, the Joint Special Representative for Syria\nof the United Nations and the League of Arab States.\nThe Council must uphold its sacred Charter mandate\nand ensure that all sides involved in that conflict are\nmade to account for their actions, which have caused\ntremendous human suffering and continue to threaten\ninternational peace and security.\nAt the same time, we also call for more principled\nleadership by the permanent members of the Council\nto bring an end to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\nDespite the adoption of numerous resolutions by\nthe General Assembly and the Council, and several\npeace initiatives, including that of the League of Arab\nStates, we continue to witness, almost on a daily basis,\nwanton violence and tremendous loss of life, resulting\nin further escalation of tensions. A resolution of the\nconflict remains elusive, and the conflict is a catalyst\nfor regional insecurity and instability. That makes even\nmore urgent the need to find a formula for enduring\npeace. The United Nations must commit all available\nresources to mediating a two-State agreement in order\nto begin to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian situation, in\nfull accordance with resolutions reaffirming borders\nexisting before 1967.\nI will now address other issues relating to the global\ndevelopment agenda.\nThe completion of Cuba\u2019s reintegration as a full\nand equal partner in the international system is an\nissue close to the Caribbean. Over the years, that\npolicy objective has been given practical content\nthrough the establishment of a wide-ranging dialogue\nand in specific cooperation agreements in a variety of development sectors of interest to the Caribbean, as part\nof the Caribbean convergence initiative. In the view of\nTrinidad and Tobago, the imperative of the initiative\ncompels us to regard the economic blockade of Cuba\nas an anachronism. We therefore call yet again for its\nremoval.\nWe are only three years away from the deadline\nset by world leaders for the achievement of the\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs). While\nTrinidad and Tobago would have preferred a more\nequitable geographical distribution on the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s panel on the acceleration of efforts to achieve\ntargets set by the MDGs, we nevertheless welcome its\nestablishment. We also call for fresh and bold changes\nand a paradigm shift in thinking in the design of the\npost-2015 development agenda.\nWe must safeguard the environment for future\ngenerations and in that regard move decisively to fully\nimplement our obligations under the United Nations\nFramework Convention on Climate Change and its\nKyoto Protocol. That would guarantee the survival of\nthose of us who are most vulnerable to climate change,\nclimate variability and sea-level rise. Every moment of\ndelay takes us closer to our own demise.\nThe health and well-being of our people is central to\nour development. The prevalence of non-communicable\ndiseases, in particular, poses a serious threat to\nCaribbean development. Trinidad and Tobago laments\nthe lack of action on the Political Declaration on the\nPrevention and Control of Non-communicable Diseases\nadopted one year ago (resolution 66/2, annex). We\ncannot risk further inaction on the matter. The adverse\nconsequences are significant. We therefore urge that\nthe matter be given high priority on the international\ndevelopment agenda.\nThe stability of many regions is being undermined\nby the illicit trade in conventional weapons, which has\nfuelled armed conflict and armed violence. Trinidad and\nTobago is encouraged by the support of many countries\nfor the conclusion of a robust and legally binding arms\ntrade treaty. However, we deeply regret the failure of the\nUnited Nations Conference on the Arms Trade Treaty,\ndespite the support of an overwhelming majority.\nThat reflects the refusal of a few States to agree to an\ninstrument that would prevent the diversion of arms\nto the illegal market. Illegal weapons, including small\narms and light weapons, in the hands of terrorists,\ndrug dealers, gang leaders and other actors involved\nin transnational organized crimes, are an affront to the efforts undertaken to resolve disputes by peaceful\nmeans. In the Caribbean, and I daresay elsewhere, the\nhigh incidence of gun-related crimes is intolerable.\nWe join with our Caribbean Community partners and\nothers in the call for the resumption of negotiations on\nthe arms trade treaty by the first quarter of 2013.\nWe also recognize the important role of women\nas agents of change \u2014 not as mere victims \u2014 in all\ninitiatives related to the resolution of disputes and\nconflicts. Trinidad and Tobago was privileged to host\na high-level discussion with representatives of other\nMember States, the United Nations Office for\nDisarmament Affairs and the non-governmental\norganization community at the margins of the General\nAssembly last week on the topic of women, disarmament,\nnon-proliferation and arms control. The high point of\nthe discussion was the signing of a joint statement by\nGovernment representatives to promote the equitable\nrepresentation of women in all decision-making on\nthe matter. Trinidad and Tobago requests all Member\nStates to support this draft resolution when it comes\nbefore the General Assembly later in the session.\nThe majority of States settle disputes by peaceful\nmeans. We take this opportunity to applaud the special\nagreement signed by the Governments of Belize and\nGuatemala to submit their long-standing border dispute\nto the International Court of Justice for adjudication.\nWe in Trinidad and Tobago have delimited our\nmaritime boundaries through bilateral negotiations and\narbitration, in keeping with the provisions of the 1982\nUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. This\nconduct has not only promoted good-neighbourliness\namong States in the region, but also provided an\nenvironment conducive to the exploration and\nexploitation of living and non-living marine resources\nso vital to the social and economic development of our\npeople.\nIn this increasingly multipolar world, where\ninterconnectivity is crucial, small States are faced with\nmounting challenges to find a space and a place in the\nnew world order. Trinidad and Tobago has promoted in\nevery forum the need for constructive dialogue between\nsmall States, the Group of 20, Brazil, Russia, India,\nChina and South Africa, and the international financial\ninstitutions.\nTrinidad and Tobago recognizes this call for a\nnew diplomacy, and we therefore join with Mrs. Portia\nSimpson-Miller, Prime Minister of Jamaica, in calling on the major international lending agencies to recognize\nthe special circumstances of middle-income countries\nand not push them to the margins of the development\nagenda.\nWe must advance the global economic governance\nagenda. To this end, middle-income and small nations\nmust not be excluded from development cooperation\nand financing on the basis of per capita income alone.\nAs we look forward to the next 50 years of\nmembership of the United Nations, Trinidad and\nTobago has a renewed optimism. In spite of the hurdles\nof the past, we are witnessing a new vitality in the\nUnited Nations today, and we reiterate our advocacy for\na new dialogue and a new diplomacy. The international\ncommunity is once again embracing multilateralism\nwith higher expectations. The ongoing development of\nnew rules and new norms in human rights; trade and\ndevelopment; protection of the environment; and peace\nand security gives hope that the human tragedies which\nbedevilled the twentieth century can be avoided. A\nnew leadership with a global mindset must engage the\nvarious communities of interests to find more durable\nsolutions in a volatile global environment. This new\ninternational leadership must find the right mix of\npower, politics and economics to achieve the necessary\nperformance level for sustainable regional and global\neconomic growth, and ultimately development, that\nwill benefit the citizens of all nations.\nTrinidad and Tobago will engage regional,\nhemispheric and global partners to assist the United\nNations in making the world a safer and better place\nfor all humankind. But let me conclude by reminding\nus all that we do not have the luxury of time. The eyes\nof the world are upon us. Our actions today must allow\ntomorrow\u2019s generations to experience a better and more\nsecure future."

        "file_text": "\ufeffAllow me, on behalf of\nmy delegation, to join preceding speakers in expressing\nour felicitations to Mr. Vuk Jeremi\u0107 on his assumption\nof the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-\nseventh session. Let me also seize the opportunity to\nsincerely commend his predecessor, Ambassador\nNassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser, of the State of Qatar, for his skilful stewardship of the sixty-sixth session.\nMy delegation is confident that under the President\u2019s\nguidance and wise leadership, the General Assembly\nwill achieve a successful and fruitful outcome. I\ntherefore pledge the full support and cooperation of\nmy delegation to him, in the discharge of his onerous\nresponsibilities.\nBotswana is among the developing countries\nthat have been adversely affected by the 2008 global\neconomic and financial crisis. Consequently, we\nwere compelled to reorder our priorities and also\ndefer implementation of various approved projects in\nour National Development Plan, some of which were\nof strategic national importance. In that regard, we\ncontinue to be concerned that many of our traditional\ndonors who helped us to progress to where we are today,\nhave virtually abandoned us following Botswana\u2019s\ngraduation to higher middle-income developing country\nstatus. Contrary to the perception that Botswana is an\neconomically well-off country, we now, more than ever\nbefore, need development assistance, on account of the\nvaried nature and gravity of the challenges we continue\nto face.\nWith respect to the African continent, Botswana\nhas followed with concern some recent peculiar\ndevelopments. The military coups in Mali and Guinea-\nBissau early this year are a sad reminder of what we\nthought was a closed chapter of the dark days of African\npolitics driven by self-interest. Those developments\nseriously undermine the significant progress which\nAfrica has made to date in embracing and consolidating\ndemocracy, good governance, respect for human rights\nand the rule of law. We therefore call on the African\nUnion to remain firm and resolute in its rejection of\nunconstitutional changes of Government on the African\ncontinent, and we implore the international community\nto give full importance and full support to the African\nUnion in that regard.\nElsewhere on the continent, we particularly\nwelcome the recent agreement between the Sudan and\nSouth Sudan on the implementation of the African\nUnion road map, aimed at resolving outstanding issues\nin the relations between the two countries. However, we\nremain concerned about the fragile security situation,\nand we therefore appeal to both parties to exercise\nmaximum restraint and to commit to honouring the\nterms of the road map. Although the appeal is made to\nboth sides, we are very much aware that the Sudan is the\nmain cause of the instability between the two countries. The catalogue of incidents of provocation and blatant\nacts of aggression against the Republic of South Sudan\nby the North that has led to instability in that region has\nbeen typical of the Sudanese regime for many years.\nWe live in times when our common well-being\nis seriously compromised by such threats as nuclear\nproliferation, terrorism, climate change, environmental\ndegradation, underdevelopment and pandemic diseases,\ncoupled with the effects of the global economic and\nfinancial crisis and internal conflicts. The resolution\nof the myriad of challenges and threats confronting\nmankind requires urgent and concerted action by the\ninternational community. Because of its universality,\nthe United Nations commands the requisite legitimacy\nand moral authority to provide guidance and leadership\nin addressing those threats and challenges. It is therefore\nimperative that the United Nations of the twenty-first\ncentury respond effectively to present realities and\neffectively handle future challenges.\nWe believe that the international community\nshould act and speak out strongly and forthrightly\nagainst human rights abuses and atrocities wherever\nand whenever they occur. In that regard, my delegation\nobserves with deep regret that, over the past few months,\nthe world community has watched helplessly and\nfailed hopelessly to intervene as Syria descended into\nprotracted anarchy. In the process, the Syrian people\nhave been subjected to a cycle of violent repression and\nsome of the worst human rights abuses and atrocities\nknown to mankind.\nEven as we speak, the violent crackdown and\nbloodshed in that country continue unabated. Al-Assad\nhas displaced more than a million Syrians to satisfy\nhis lust for power. He has caused around 300,000\nSyrians to f lee into neighbouring countries because\nof his criminal acts. He has slaughtered 20,000 of his\ncitizens in order to remain President. He has killed\nmen, women, children and babies to achieve that. The\ninternational community has, regrettably, failed to\nrespond collectively. And Syria remains a Member of\nthe United Nations, a body with the expressed objective\nof defending humankind. That surely cannot be right.\nSyria\u2019s allies in the Security Council and in the region\nneed to be equally condemned.\nThe uprisings in the Middle East, commonly\nreferred to as the Arab Spring, have demonstrated that\nno amount of force can suppress the will of the people\nforever. The situation in Libya, Tunisia and Egypt,\nwhere the popular will of the people has ushered in\ndemocratic dispensations, attests to that.\nConcerning Libya, which had to engage in an\ninternal conflict to rid itself of a brutal dictator, we\ncommend the Libyan people and their allies in the\nmilitary coalition that imposed a no-f ly zone in order\nto remove Colonel Al-Qadhafi and his regime.\nMy delegation is of the view that given its\nmandate to maintain international peace and security,\nthe Security Council should assume the high moral\nground in defending the victims of war crimes and\ncrimes against humanity, such as those currently being\ncommitted in Syria. The principle of the responsibility\nto protect, as expressed in Security Council resolution\n1674 (2006), should be forcefully applied wherever\ncrimes against humanity occur. In that connection, my\ndelegation condemns in the strongest possible terms\nthe persistent vetoes by China and Russia of successive\nSecurity Council resolutions aimed at putting pressure\non the Syrian leadership to cease its heinous crimes\nagainst its citizens. We therefore call on those members\nof the Council to live up to their responsibilities, in\naccordance with the provisions of the United Nations\nCharter. We urge the international community to\nact swiftly to save the people of Syria from further\nunwarranted bloodshed.\nBotswana will continue to sponsor and support\nthe various General Assembly and Human Rights\nCouncil resolutions aimed at addressing the situation in\nSyria, as a practical demonstration of our unwavering\ncommitment towards a resolution of the Syrian\ncrisis. It is for that reason that we join forces with\nlike-minded countries in calling for the situation in\nSyria to be referred to the International Criminal Court\nfor investigation, so that those responsible for crimes\nagainst humanity can be held accountable. Al-Assad\nand his regime should be removed as soon as possible.\nWe must encourage the opposition to unite and to form\na transition administration that we can all recognize.\nWe wish to commend Turkey and the other countries\nthat have taken on the burden of accommodating Syrian\nrefugees, have spoken out against the deteriorating\nsecurity and humanitarian situation in Syria and\nhave responded, with others, to the plea of the\nOffice of the United Nations High Commissioner for\nRefugees (UNHCR) for contributions. For its part,\nBotswana has made a modest contribution to UNHCR to\nhelp the humanitarian relief efforts for Syrian refugees. We also wish to commend responsible human-rights\norganizations, such as Amnesty International and\nHuman Rights Watch, for the work they do in seeking\nto safeguard the principles that protect humankind.\nTheir mission \u2014 to act as watchdogs in matters of\nsafeguarding human rights \u2014 is a very necessary\none. Similarly, we commend those humanitarian\nnon-governmental organizations that work tirelessly,\nwith meagre resources and under very difficult\ncircumstances, to bring relief to refugees affected by\nnatural and man-made disasters.\nHuman rights abuses and atrocities are not limited\nto Syria. It is in that context that we affirm our support\nfor the International Criminal Court and urge it to\ncontinue to fulfil its mandate, including prosecuting\nthose indicted for human rights abuses and crimes\nagainst humanity. We therefore appeal to States parties\nto fully cooperate with the Court in its efforts to bring\nthe suspected perpetrators of such crimes to justice.\nWe wish to add our voice in condemning the violence\nthat occurred following the release of a publication that\noffended people of the Islamic faith. There can be no\njustification for such a violent response. The violence\nitself caused offence to its victims. Retaliation against\noffensive expressions therefore cannot take the form\nof other offensive actions aimed at innocent parties.\nHowever, where democracy is defined as Government\nof the people, by the people, for the people \u2014 in\nother words, doing what is in the best interests of the\npeople \u2014 how can it be in the people\u2019s best interests if\nfreedom of speech results in insults?\nOther freedoms, in a democratic dispensation,\ninclude freedom of association \u2014 but we cannot\nassociate with terrorist or criminal groups without\nconsequences, since it is not in the people\u2019s best interests\nto live among terrorists and criminals. Freedom of\nexpression allows for protests \u2014 but only peaceful\nprotests \u2014 in democracies, because it is also not in\npeople\u2019s best interests to have violent protests; and in\ndemocracies consequences do follow if protests become\nviolent. The same goes for freedom of the press, if it is\nabused, as it often is. There must be consequences, in\norder to protect people\u2019s interests from misinformation\nand attempts to discredit or defame them. With all such\nfreedoms there must be limits. Democracy is supposed\nto be responsible. Causing offence and insult cannot by\nany stretch of the imagination be passed off as what\nwe want in a democracy. Trying to justify irresponsible actions as permitted under any of these freedoms,\nincluding freedom of speech, is itself irresponsible.\nTurning to environmental issues, we note the limited\nand disappointing progress made at the United Nations\nConference on Sustainable Development in addressing\nsustainable development issues, as has been the case at\nsimilar summits in the past. As we all know, the world\nis facing the twin challenges of scarcity of resources\nand climate change. Those problems are particularly\nacute in Africa, owing to the high incidence of poverty\nthere.\nTo respond to those big problems, which clearly\nneed visionary solutions and strong partnerships for\nsustainability on a scale and with an impact that are\nunprecedented, my country took the important initiative\nof hosting in May the Summit for Sustainability in\nAfrica. Participation was at the Head of State level,\nand included representatives of some of the most\ninf luential and significant private-sector stakeholders\nin the world. The Summit adopted the Gaborone\nDeclaration, which, among other things, provides for\npolicy improvements at both the Government and the\nprivate-sector levels, aimed at integrating the value of\nnatural capital development. The Declaration also calls\nfor increased private-sector investment in Africa to\nhelp reduce food insecurity, improve livelihoods and\nincrease sustainability. We therefore call on the United\nNations system and the international community in\ngeneral to commit to implementing the Declaration.\nThere are many important and urgent issues\naffecting developing countries that must be addressed.\nThey include technology transfer, funding and capacity-\nbuilding in other areas, aimed at enabling such countries\nto adapt to the requirements of a green economy in the\ncontext of sustainable development. In that regard, we\nurge the developed world to help developing countries\nto address these critical issues and take accelerated\naction in order to deal with climate change and its\ncauses in their economies.\nHowever, we welcome the agreement to launch an\nintergovernmental negotiation process that will lead\nto the adoption of sustainable development goals as\npart of the post-2015 development agenda, when the\nimplementation process of the Millennium Development\nGoals will have run its course. My delegation believes\nthat the process for developing sustainable development\ngoals should be synchronized with the 2013 review of the\nimplementation of the Millennium Development Goals. We would like to take this opportunity to commend the\nwork done by environmental organizations worldwide\nin their efforts to save the planet from climate change\nand its negative effects.\nBotswana participated in the ill-fated United Nations\nConference on the Arms Trade Treaty in July, whose\npurpose was for Member States to agree on common\ninternational standards for regulating the international\ntrade in conventional weapons. We believe that, when\nadopted, an arms trade treaty will complement the\nUnited Nations programme of action for combating the\nproliferation of arms and ammunition, which continue\nto cause untold suffering.\nBefore concluding, I wish to state that Botswana\nfully supports the call for implementing the Assembly\u2019s\nsuccessive resolutions on lifting sanctions against Cuba,\nsomething we believe is logical and long overdue."

        "file_text": "\ufeffI am pleased to address\nthe Assembly for the first time since assuming the\noffice of Prime Minister of the Republic of Croatia.\nWe live in times of rapid changes, some of which\nare positive, others deeply troubling. The world is\nbecoming more interconnected, which strengthens\neconomic opportunities and accelerates development.\nAdvances in science and technology are bringing\nmeasurable progress for humankind. The profound\ntransformations in North Africa have raised the hopes\nof people for real democracy and freedom. However, there is also much that is disturbing.\nConflicts in many parts of the world are wreaking\nhavoc on innocent civilians. Our planet is experiencing\ngrowing environmental damage. The global financial\nand economic crisis is still negatively affecting the\nmajority of countries in both the developing and the\ndeveloped world. International peace and security\nare under strain from terrorism, extremism, poverty,\ninequality, human rights abuses and persecution.\nIn confronting such challenges, Croatia acts in the\nglobal arena on the basis of two fundamental tenets.\nWe stand ready to assume our responsibility towards\nour own citizens and our neighbours in the region\nand to be a constructive actor in Europe and a reliable\npartner to all peace-loving countries in the world. We\nactively promote solidarity with vulnerable groups\nand communities and with the poor, the needy, the\ndefenceless and the underprivileged. Responsibility\nand solidarity are two central principles of our\nengagement in the United Nations in the pursuit of\npeace and security and in advancing freedom and\ndemocracy, protecting human rights, enhancing\nsustainable development, respecting international law,\nensuring equality and social justice and promoting the\nrule of law.\nThis year, Croatia marks the twentieth anniversary\nof its membership of our global Organization. We are\ngrateful to the United Nations for playing an important\nrole in our country\u2019s struggle for political independence,\ninternational recognition and full territorial integrity.\nWe have great expectations of the United Nations.\nAs a beacon of multilateralism, it provides the only universal framework for finding common solutions to\ninternational crises and current challenges. However,\nwe must ask ourselves whether the United Nations does\nenough and what we can do collectively to improve its\nperformance.\nWe support the United Nations reform process,\nwhich seeks to enhance its accountability, efficiency,\neffectiveness and transparency. United, we are stronger\nthan alone. But let me stress something. If each of our\ncountries becomes more democratic, more developed,\nbetter run, more stable and more responsible, our\ncombined strength will rise exponentially.\nThe topic of the general debate, namely, resolving\ninternational disputes by peaceful means, is at the very\nheart of the United Nations. The Organization was built\nto prevent war and to keep the peace. We highly value\nthe instruments of preventive diplomacy and mediation\nand other peaceful means of resolving disputes. In\nparticular, we see merit in resorting to the International\nCourt of Justice, the Permanent Court of Arbitration\nand other existing institutions. We ourselves have\ndone so. We agreed to settle the border issue with our\nneighbour, Slovenia, through arbitration.\nHowever, we must understand that, in the long run,\npeace cannot be imposed on parties to a dispute. Each\nsituation has its own pace and dynamics. However,\nthere should be no excuse for a lack of genuine effort.\nMoreover, without a thorough resolution of issues,\nthere can be no room for a true reconciliation process\nto take place. In that vein, it is reassuring to note that\nsupport for the peaceful resolution of disputes comes\nfrom many parts of the world, including countries that\nhave opted to use military means to settle disputes with\ntheir immediate neighbours in the recent past.\nNot everyone, however, shares equal respect\nfor peace and international law. This year has been\nparticularly unfortunate in terms of the efficiency of\nthe United Nations in the area of conflict prevention,\nmediation and the protection of civilians. We have\nwitnessed appalling events, and thousands of civilian\nvictims have been exposed to heavy arms and the\nbrutality of armed forces and paramilitary groups.\nThe lack of univocal action against the most severe\nviolations of the United Nations Charter is deeply\ntroubling. We must resolutely counter such an obsession\nwith violence and repression. We should not shy away\nfrom our responsibilities.\nAt this juncture, I must strongly condemn the recent\nkilling of the United States Ambassador to Libya. People\ncome from different cultures, legal traditions, historical\nbackgrounds and forms of Government. Violence can\nnever be an acceptable response to freedom of speech.\nLike many previous speakers, I stress the\nimportance of keeping strong international attention\non Syria. We align ourselves with the position of the\nEuropean Union on the situation in Syria. We see the\nneed for prompt action on two fronts. The immediate\npriority is to stop the loss of life on both sides in the\nconflict, to provide humanitarian aid and assistance to\nthe Syrian people and to support plans for the country\u2019s\neconomic and political stabilization. Further fighting\nand militarization will only exacerbate the suffering and\nmake a peaceful resolution of the crisis more difficult.\nIn addition, we have to remain committed to pursuing\na Syrian-led political transition that will meet the\ndemocratic aspirations of the Syrian people. Resolving\nthe crisis is our common responsibility. We therefore\ncall unceasingly for the full respect of international\nlaw, especially international humanitarian law, human\nrights and refugee law.\nThere is no peace without justice and there is no\njustice without the rule of law and without the fight\nagainst impunity. We support concepts of human\nsecurity and the responsibility to protect, as well as\ntheir implementation and improvement through an\nopen and constructive dialogue within the framework\nof the United Nations. We also support the work of\nthe International Criminal Court. Undoubtedly, there\nare sufficient conflict prevention tools at our disposal.\nThe question remains whether we can muster enough\nresolve to use them.\nSyria is the most recent and most striking example\nof the need for a greater role for preventive diplomacy\nand mediation in the early phases of a conflict. The later\nwe engage, the more divided we are. Timely prevention\nis crucial for successful conflict resolution. Prevention\nis also indispensable for countering other threats that\ndestabilize countries and societies. Let me cite an\nexample. If a country is forced to fight corruption\nthrough its law enforcement bodies and the judiciary,\nthat is usually a sign that it is too late, that corruption has\nalready left its corrosive imprint on society. Our goal is\nto invest efforts aimed at building a society in which\ncorruption is not an endemic phenomenon, in which\nelected officials in Government structures demonstrate\nresponsibility towards their public office. That in turn encourages citizens to foster a corruption-free culture\nthrough their daily behaviour. When leaders lead by\npositive example, people tend to follow. That is because\nculture f lows from structure. That is also the reason\nwhy, at the level of the United Nations, we provide our\nfull support to the implementation, wider acceptance\nand universalization of international legal instruments\non non-proliferation, arms control and disarmament,\ncountering terrorism and preventing corruption.\nThe global economic crisis combined with the\neffects of globalization has contributed to the rise\nof popular distrust in the capability of political\nleaders to deliver needed solutions. That calls for\ngreater responsibility, better governance and stronger\ncooperation among States, civil society and the private\nsector. The Croatian Government has made notable\nprogress in making its work more transparent and\nmore available to its citizens. As a member of the\nOpen Government Partnership initiative, we have\nbecome active in the fields of fiscal transparency,\naccess to information, information technology and\ncivil society participation. We are pleased to host the\nSecond European Outreach and Support Meeting of the\nInitiative on 4 and 5 October in Dubrovnik, where we\nexpect to see the sharing of best practices and further\npromotion of cooperation between Governments and\ncivil society organizations.\nCroatia has undergone an extensive but successful\npolitical, economic and social transition in a fairly\nshort period of time. For that reason, we have a\nspecial understanding and first-hand experience of the\ninterwoven nature of peace, security, development and\nthe promotion and protection of human rights. Today\nwe are sharing our knowledge and experiences with\ncountries in the region of South-Eastern Europe and with\ncountries emerging from crises, where our post-conflict\nunderstanding in nation- and institution-building is\nparticularly relevant.\nCroatia is currently a Vice-Chair of the\nPeacebuilding Commission. My country stands ready\nto assume its responsibility for creating more relevant,\nbetter-performing and more empowered peacebuilding\nstructures. Croatia has already joined the Civilian\nCapacity Project\u2019s CAPMATCH initiative designed to\naddress the State-building needs of fragile and conflict-\naffected countries by offering our help in various fields\nof expertise gained through our own political transition,\npost-conflict rehabilitation and unique European\nUnion accession process. Promotion and protection of human rights at the universal level remains one of\nthe cornerstones of the role of the United Nations in\nthe world. Further development of the capacity of the\nHuman Rights Council is of the utmost importance\nif we are to address seriously and efficiently urgent\nhuman rights situations and crises.\nWe give special attention to continually improving\nthe degree of respect accorded the fundamental human\nrights of women and girls in different post-conflict\nsocieties. Women and children do not have armies to\nprotect them or trade unions to negotiate on their behalf.\nYet, more and more women are becoming the primary\nbreadwinners in their families. The empowerment of\nwomen and their full and equal participation in societies\nare prerequisites for security, economic opportunity,\neffective governance and social development. Croatia\nwill also continue with its active contribution to the\nwork of the United Nations human rights forums,\nin particular safeguarding the rights of vulnerable\nmembers of society, such as lesbian, bisexual, gay and\ntransgendered persons, promoting the moratorium\non the use of death penalty and ensuring the right to\nconscientious objection to military service.\nIn times of economic uncertainty, be it due to\nfinancial crisis or long-term poverty, some tend\nto downplay the importance of human rights or of\nconsolidating democracy. Every day we witness the sad\nrealities of starving children, deaths from preventable\ncommunicable diseases, inadequate education and\nhealth systems, and the continuous degradation of the\necosystem. Challenges we are facing require integrated\nsolutions across interconnected issues and the\nfurther strengthening of the multilateral architecture.\nWe welcome the outcome of the United Nations\nConference on Sustainable Development and encourage\nits follow-up process. We look forward to more\nenergetic work on the implementation of sustainable\ndevelopment goals, which should complement existing\ncommitments and encompass all three dimensions\nof sustainable development \u2014 economic, social and\nenvironmental \u2014 in a balanced and synergistic way.\nCroatia sees the Economic and Social Council and its\nsubsidiary bodies as a cornerstone for the achievement\nof balanced integration of sustainable development.\nCroatia is firmly devoted to participation in those\nprocesses, in particular in the fields of education and\ngender equality. Education is a sector which builds\na firm foundation for responding to the challenges\nof pursuing a post-2015 development framework. of human rights at the universal level remains one of\nthe cornerstones of the role of the United Nations in\nthe world. Further development of the capacity of the\nHuman Rights Council is of the utmost importance\nif we are to address seriously and efficiently urgent\nhuman rights situations and crises.\nWe give special attention to continually improving\nthe degree of respect accorded the fundamental human\nrights of women and girls in different post-conflict\nsocieties.

In addition to having joined NATO\nsince 2009, Croatia will become the twenty-eighth\nmember of the European Union (EU) next year. Our\ninternational engagement is visible and strong. Croatia\nhas been an active participant in United Nations\npeacekeeping missions, and I praise our women and\nmen who have risked their lives for the common good.\nWe have been providing substantial contributions\nto international efforts to stabilize Afghanistan and\nimprove the living conditions of its people, highlighting\nthe need for the protection of human rights, in particular\nthe rights of women and children. Croatia is also actively\nparticipating in EU meetings at a time when the Union\nis intensively trying to find ways of overcoming the\ncrisis and assuming its rightful place in the world.\nLet me emphasize that Croatia greatly appreciates\nthe role that the EU has been playing in the United\nNations as a significant and positive force behind a\nnumber of initiatives. At the same time, for Croatia,\nthe process of EU accession was primarily an exercise\nin institution-building and State transition. We built a\nstronger State so we can play a more substantive role in\nworld affairs.\nThe perspective of EU membership has proved\nto be the main motivator and catalyst for social and\npolitical reforms. We want our neighbours in South-\nEastern Europe to undertake the same demanding\nbut rewarding road. We do not intend to assume a\nmentoring role in the region, but we stand ready to share\nour experiences and contribute constructively to the\nreforms in neighbouring countries based on democracy\nand European values.\nA peaceful and prosperous South-Eastern Europe\nis in Croatia\u2019s strategic interest. Our vision is not just\na region devoid of war. We strive to achieve genuine\npolitical, societal and economic development. We want\npeople, especially young women and men, to have\nbetter standards of living and better prospects, to live\nin a clean environment and in a well-organized State\nwith fully functioning institutions, to speak less about\nwhat was and much more about what could be. \n\nThat reminds me of a quotation by Croatian public\nhealth expert Dr. Andrija \u0160tampar, a man who founded\nthe World Health Organization decades ago, who once\nsaid that, \u201cAll people, regardless of whether they are\nrich or poor, have the right to be healthy!\u201d I agree. Only\nhealthy and self-confident people can shape a healthy\nand progressive society. It is our primary responsibility,\nindividual and collective, to build such a world and\nbequeath it to our children."

        "file_text": "\ufeffOn behalf of the\ndelegation of the Kingdom of Thailand, allow me to\ncongratulate the President of the General Assembly\nupon his election to preside over the Assembly at its\nsixty-seventh session.\nI would also like to convey our appreciation to the\noutgoing President, Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser,\nfor his outstanding leadership of the General Assembly\nduring the previous session.\nWe continue to live in challenging times. Much still\nneeds to be done to restore stability and confidence in\nthe global financial and economic system, and to find\nlong-term solutions to the eurozone crisis. The Arab\nSpring has taught us that it is very important to listen to\nthe voice of the people. The risk of conflict in various\nregions around the globe may affect our efforts to\npromote peace, prosperity and democracy.\nWe have also seen how religious insensitivity and\nhate can lead to violence. In the light of this, we need\nto promote a culture of tolerance, mutual respect and\nunderstanding, both in and among societies. These are\nessential factors to prevent conflict and promote lasting\npeace.\nIn our efforts to promote lasting peace and security,\nwe are confronted with a wide range of threats, both\nold and new. It is therefore necessary for us to seek\ninnovative solutions and new thinking. We need strong\nleadership, political will and good global governance.\nIt is imperative that we settle international disputes\nby peaceful means. But even beyond that, we need to\nthink in terms of preventive and preemptive actions to\nprevent such disputes from arising in the first place.\nMost important, we have to think in terms of promoting\ninclusive and comprehensive peace and development,\nboth within and among countries. Peace, security and\ndevelopment are all interconnected.\nEconomic development must go hand in hand\nwith political advancement. Here, I would like to\nemphasize three points. First, an inclusive national\ndevelopment strategy is vital. During this period of\neconomic uncertainty, we must not consider economic\ngrowth alone. It is important to put people front and\ncentre in the development agenda. Sustainable growth\nand development, job creation, promoting poverty\nreduction and equality and addressing climate change\nmust go hand in hand. That is what every Government\nshould do \u2014 put people at the heart of the country\u2019s\neconomic development strategy \u2014 because we believe\nthat the greatest asset of any country is the people, and\nhow much a country can excel depends on how much its\npeople can fully realize their potential. Secondly, an inclusive regional development is the\nway forward and would help strengthen the fabric of\nregional peace and security. Thailand strongly believes\nthat we and our neighbours in the region have a shared\nobjective. We have a shared interest in fostering common\npeace and prosperity. We need to therefore strive to\nprosper together because only by working together can\nwe create a much-needed synergy that would support\nour common development. That will also help limit the\nchance of conflict.\nIn South-East Asia, that is the spirit that drives the\n10 States members of the Association of Southeast Asian\nNations (ASEAN) to establish an ASEAN Community\nby the year 2015. As ASEAN moves towards greater\nintegration, great efforts are being made to close\ndevelopment gaps and expand connectivity across\nSouth-East Asia and beyond to the wider East Asia\nand South Asia. That would help spread development\nand growth more broadly across the continent. And as\neconomic activities become more concentrated in East\nAsia, that closer integration and expanded connectivity,\ntogether with an expanding region-wide network of free\ntrade agreements, will further strengthen the resilience\nof East Asia, create greater opportunities and unleash\nthe full potential of this promising region.\nThirdly, an inclusive process at the global level\nis crucial as the international community considers\nthe post-2015 development agenda. The Millennium\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) have been an important\ntool that resulted in better livelihoods for millions of\npeople. With 2015 fast approaching, the international\ncommunity should mobilize an all-out effort to make\nthe final push in realizing those MDGs.\nAt the same time, it is important to prepare beyond\n2015. The successes and failures of the implementation\nof the MDGs should be taken into account as the\ninternational community starts to frame the post-2015\ndevelopment agenda or the sustainable development\ngoals. The process towards that end should be as\ninclusive as possible to ensure that the post-2015\ndevelopment agenda will enjoy the broadest possible\nsupport and ownership of the international community.\nThailand will play an active and constructive role in\nthat process because development is an issue close to\nour heart.\nIn this age of globalization, the concept of absolute\nsecurity has become obsolete. Peace can never be\nachieved in isolation. We can only seek peace through common security and stability. We must work closely\nwith our friends in each region to strengthen their\ncapacities in meeting their development goals. We\nbelieve that the peace and prosperity of our neighbours\nis that of our own. That is particularly relevant in the\ncurrent case of Myanmar during the critical period of\ntransition towards greater democracy, which Thailand\nfully supports. We must all work together as partners\nto help Myanmar continue in its process of change. We\nwill all benefit from that economic cooperation and\nintegration.\nWe live in a world of increasing interconnectivity,\nbut our peoples continue to face insecurity from cross-\nborder challenges. In this age of globalization, the\nconcept of security must be people-centred. Therefore,\ntransnational challenges \u2014 from people smuggling to\nhuman trafficking, from narcotics to pandemics, from\nnatural disasters to illegal trade in arms and materials\nfor weapons of mass destruction \u2014 must rank high\non our national agenda. The international community\nshould redouble its collective effort to act forcefully\nagainst transnational crimes that exist in a world of\nincreased interconnectivity.\nOne of the worst forms of human indignity is\nhuman trafficking. I consider that inhumane form of\nexploitation to be a matter of national priority and am\nfully committed to eliminating it.. Whether it is human\ntrafficking or other transnational crimes, the key is\nto ensure that the rule of law prevails and the basic\nrights of peoples are guaranteed. Vulnerable groups,\nsuch as women, children, the elderly and people with\ndisabilities, in particular deserve our attention.\nSolutions to those challenges cannot be achieved\nby Governments alone. We need to work with all\nstakeholders, especially in strengthening international\nnorms and standards. Through the United Nations, we\nneed to promote the rule of law as a solid foundation to\nachieve peace, international security, human rights and\nsustainable development.\nWe are committed to promoting peace and\nprosperity within countries and internationally, but,\nultimately, the process must begin at home. It can best\nbe accomplished by providing space for all within\na democratic framework and promoting national\nreconciliation. Above all else, we must think in terms of\npartnership and work together as responsible members\nof the international community.\n\nWorking through the United Nations, we need\nto reach out to people who have been denied their\nlegitimate rights and aspirations. It is in that spirit that\nthe Royal Thai Government established diplomatic\nrelations with the State of Palestine on 1 August 2012,\nin the hope that both Israel and Palestine can achieve\ntrue and lasting peace based on a two-State solution.\nElsewhere in the Middle East, the situation in Syria\ncontinues to worsen. Thailand is deeply concerned\nabout the humanitarian impact of violence against\ncivilians and strongly condemns such violence. We\ncall for an immediate end to the use of force against\ncivilians. We call for all sides to engage in dialogue\ntowards a political solution, which can be achieved only\nby the efforts of the Syrian people themselves.\nIn the quest for peace and security, we believe it\nis necessary to continually look beyond our borders.\nThailand wishes to reaffirm our commitment to\npeacekeeping in difficult times as necessary. From\nTimor-Leste to Haiti to Darfur and in the Gulf of Aden,\nThailand\u2019s peacekeeping operations also assist in local\nand community development, sharing our best practices\nin agriculture, health and water resource management.\nIn sum, Thailand has continued to engage with the\ninternational community across all three pillars of the\nUnited Nations: peace and security, development and\nhuman rights. The management of those interconnected\nissues will provide us with long-term solutions, not only\nfor conflict resolution via peaceful means, but also for\nways to prevent conflicts from arising altogether.\nI assure the Assembly that Thailand will continue\nto be a strong partner of the United Nations in helping\nto address those shared challenges of humankind.\nIt is with that conviction that we have submitted our\ncandidature as a non-permanent member of the Security\nCouncil for the term 2017-2018."

        "file_text": "\ufeffAt\nthe opening of my statement in today\u2019s general debate,\nallow me to express to Mr. Vuk Jeremi\u0107, President\nof the General Assembly, the satisfaction felt by the\nRepublic of Paraguay at seeing him preside over the\nwork of the General Assembly at its sixty-seventh\nsession. He can be assured of my delegation\u2019s constant\nsupport during his time in office. Allow me also to\ncongratulate Ambassador Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser\nfor his important and effective work as President of\nthe General Assembly at its previous session. I also\nextend my congratulations to Secretary-General Ban\nKi-moon for his commendable work during the past six\nyears at the head of the Organization, during which he\ndemonstrated his firm commitment to global peace and\ninternational security.\nIn relation to the theme of the general debate,\n\u201cBringing about adjustment or settlement of\ninternational disputes or situations by peaceful means\u201d,\nthe Government of Paraguay once again asserts and\nconfirms the importance of settling disputes by peaceful\nmeans while respecting the principles of international\nlaw. Relations between States would be fairer, more\nsupportive and more equitable were they governed by\nfull compliance with international law, the principles\nof which guide and direct the peaceful settlement of\ndisputes. In my country\u2019s view, favouring political\nexpediency over treaty commitments is unacceptable,\nbecause political considerations can never take\nprecedence over formal international agreements.\nOn this first and last time that I will address\nthe General Assembly, I believe it is necessary and\nunavoidable to elucidate to the international community\nthe political process that my country is currently\nundergoing. The history of Paraguay changed on the\nnight of 22 June. The National Congress, exercising its\nconstitutional powers \u2014 and I would like to publicly\nexpress my appreciation for the presence here today of\nthe Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Paraguay,\nsenators and members of Parliament, the President of the\nChamber of Deputies, and persons of various political\nstripes \u2014 decided by near-unanimity to remove the\nthen-President from office by means of an impeachment\nprocess established under the Constitution.\nThe Paraguayan Congress sought in that manner to\nput an end to a very serious political crisis that threatened\nthe country, in which 17 fellow countrymen had already\nlost their lives, and to avoid further bloodshed and grief\non Paraguayan soil. As mandated by the Constitution and\nowing to my duty as Vice-President, I assumed office\nas President of the Republic. Since then, in accordance\nwith my oath of office, I have been governing Paraguay\npeacefully and democratically, fully respecting public\nfreedoms. The Government of Paraguay, along with the\noverwhelming majority of Paraguayans, takes pride\nin the fact that there are no political prisoners in the\ncountry, that nobody has been exiled, that freedom\nof the press and freedom of expression are fully\nguaranteed, and that each and every right enshrined in\nhuman rights agreements signed within the framework\nof the United Nations, as well as in the Organization of\nAmerican States, is ensured.\nParaguay has normal diplomatic relations with the\ngreat majority of the States Members of the United\nNations. We guarantee to all of them that Paraguay\nwill continue to work tirelessly in favour of peace and\nsecurity, the basic pillars of our Organization.\nNonetheless, Paraguay finds itself in a difficult\ninternational situation, one created by its neighbours,\nthe members of the Southern Common Market and the\nUnion of South American Nations. Both entities have\nadopted sanctions against the Republic of Paraguay\nwithout allowing it to exercise its right to defend itself,\na right that is clearly set forth in the international\nagreements that are invoked for the application of\nsanctions. In violation of international treaties, those\ncountries have attempted to become the custodians of\nParaguayan democracy, putting aside the principle of\nnon-intervention enshrined in the Charter of the United\nNations.\nThroughout its history, Paraguay has repeatedly\nsuffered from arrogant interventions in its internal\naffairs.\n\nThe holocaust brought on by the War of the Triple\nAlliance, stemming from an unjustifiable coalition,\nhas still not faded from the memory of my people. It\ndecimated my country\u2019s population and destroyed its\neconomy.\nIn the short period that my Government has served,\nour critics have been unable to find a single violation of\nthe agreements that I have mentioned. The great Justo\nPastor Ben\u00edtez, a famous Paraguayan politician, rightly\nmaintained that it is dangerous to be right where there\nis no justice.\nBefore humankind\u2019s highest Assembly, I clearly\nstate that Paraguay will never accept interference in\nits internal affairs by foreign Powers. We will continue\nto build our democracy in accordance with the will of\nthe Paraguayan people, and fully implement it through\nour freely elected institutions. We are certain that\nwe know how to get through this crucial period with\ndignity and integrity. We will not be subjugated. We\ncall on members to reflect and work together to find the\npath towards rebuilding South American integration,\nwhich is currently compromised. Peace is built through\ndialogue, to which we are open.\nThose who today wish to become leading actors in\nthe international community will have to acknowledge\nthat that is not possible without regional unity.\nLeadership is built through respect for international\nlaw. That is the only way that we will have a common\nposition on Security Council reform, which is a long-\nstanding wish of the universal institution that embraces\nus.\nIn such difficult times for the international\ncommunity, we will find solutions to our current\npolitical and economic difficulties only by putting\ninternational institutions on the path for which they\nwere established, namely, to serve the women and men\nthat build humankind\u2019s future day by day. Paraguay,\na founding member of the Organization, remains\ncommitted to that.\nThe various events in different parts of our planet\nthis past year demonstrate the relevance and true\nvalidity of a forum such as the United Nations in the\ninternational arena. That is why there is an urgent need\nfor the courageous, innovative and profound reform of\nits organs, structure and functions. Changes are needed\nto adapt the Organization so that it can respond with\ngreater effectiveness and agility to an international\nagenda that is very different from that which existed\nwhen the United Nations was conceived. Moreover, it\nfaces a shifting dynamic in the international picture\nthat was impossible to envision at its inception.\nThat is why Paraguay calls on the international\ncommunity to strive towards the wonderful international\nutopia of a universal Organization governed by the\nstrong and the weak, the large and the small, and the\nrich and the poor, all equal in a great world Assembly.\nParaguay believes that it is necessary to insist that the\nreform process include the gradual elimination of the\nveto power.\nThis year, on the twentieth anniversary of the\nhistoric United Nations Conference on Environment and\nDevelopment, held in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 and known\nas the Earth Summit, we believe that it is necessary\nto reaffirm the belief that sustainable development\nand its economic, social and environmental aspects\nmust be the linchpin of the United Nations focus. The\nRepublic of Paraguay therefore reaffirms its belief\nin that goal and in the need to maintain the balance\nbetween economic development, social development\nand environmental protection as interdependent pillars\nof human development.\nAs the world\u2019s largest producer per capita of clean\nrenewable hydroelectric energy, which drives our\neconomy and its industrialization, we will use that\nenergy for the country\u2019s development for the benefit of\nthe Paraguayans and foreigners who inhabit our land\nand shape its future. That energy, which we will use\nlittle by little, will be another driver of our well-being.\nThe issue of landlocked developing countries\n(LLDCs) is an important aspect of Paraguay\u2019s foreign\npolicy. The asymmetry and disadvantages of our\ngeographical position have caused and continue to\ncause a huge problem that can be offset only through\ninternational recognition and special and differentiated\ntreatment on the part of the developed economies that\nseeks to include Paraguay in the globalized world.\nIn that regard, on 12 September, during the recent\nfourth Meeting of Trade Ministers of Landlocked\nDeveloping Countries, a group that Paraguay had the\nhonour of chairing during the biennium 2010-2011,\nthe need for transit States, in the first place, and the\ninternational community, as a whole, to duly recognize\nthe comparative disadvantages of our countries in\nrelation to the conditions needed for their development\nwas underscored.\n\nParaguay wishes to reiterate here its commitment to\ninternational peace and security. In the specific context\nof United Nations peacekeeping operations, it affirms\nits political willingness to continue contributing\nhuman resources to such operations. Regionally, we\nhighlight the progress achieved by the United Nations\nStabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH). Paraguay\nincreased its deployment to MINUSTAH by more\nthan 100 troops to show its firm commitment to the\nreconstruction of a brother country devastated by the\nscourges of nature.\nI would also like to underscore the effort and\ncommitment of the Paraguayan military observers in\nthe increasingly difficult situation in the Syrian Arab\nRepublic, where they have remained, even in the most\ndifficult circumstances. I take this opportunity to pay\ntribute to those soldiers who perform their duties, in\nmany parts of the world, with dedication, hard work and\nsacrifice in the service of the United Nations. Today,\nwe must all also remember the obligation of Member\nStates to protect and defend the security of diplomatic\nand consular premises in all countries.\nParaguay is increasingly concerned about the\ngrowth in transnational organized crime in its worst\nmanifestations, namely, drug trafficking on a large and a\nsmall scale, arms trafficking and trafficking in migrants\nand in persons, among others. Those transnational\ncrimes stem mainly the social and economic inequality\nof our peoples. Joint international efforts are needed,\ntherefore, in order to fight such scourges head on. The\nGovernment of Paraguay reaffirms its unequivocal\ncommitment to the fight against all activities of\ncriminal organizations and calls for a stronger position\non the part of developed countries, where most of the\ndemand associated with those crimes originates.\nParaguay also reaffirms its strong condemnation\nof terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. For\nthat reason, Paraguay, through its Secretariat for the\nPrevention of the Laundering of Money and Goods and\nin close cooperation with other national institutions,\nhas made a coordinated effort to bring its legal and\nnormative framework in line with its commitments and\nwith the recommendations made by the international\norganizations charged with preventing and prosecuting\ncrimes related to money laundering and the financing\nof terrorism. Laws and resolutions have been passed\npursuant to the recommendations of the Financial\nAction Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF). In\nFebruary 2012, Paraguay was removed from the FATF grey list and is now, as a result of our efforts, included\non the white list, a fact that we are proud of, as a\nmember of our region and in line with our commitment\nto the fight against money-laundering and the financing\nof terrorism.\nPromoting and building awareness of, and full\nrespect for, human rights worldwide must continue\nto be one of the unchanging and incontrovertible\ncommitments on our Organization\u2019s international\nagenda. Human rights violations are a scourge that\nmust forever be eradicated from our civilization.\nThe Government of Paraguay reiterates that the\ngrowth of nations can be achieved only through social\nequality, by prioritizing basic needs such as education,\nhealth and land reform. Growth without social\ndevelopment will only result in a world that is more\nunequal and unjust.\nThe Paraguayan Government is actively working to\nbuild a development model that gives priority to decent\nwork. In that regard we are promoting mechanisms\nwithin the framework of a State policy aimed at\nimproving working conditions. They include, first,\nthe creation of a Ministry of Labour, Employment\nand Social Security; secondly, the ratification of\nthe Domestic Workers Convention No.189 of the\nInternational Labour Organization, adopted in 2011 by\nthe International Labour Conference in order to improve\nthe working conditions of thousands of domestic\nworkers in Paraguay; and thirdly, the implementation\nof an employment policy for young people through\na bill aimed at enabling young people to enter the\nworkforce, which has been partially approved by the\nNational Congress.\nSince its beginning, my Government has maintained\nits belief in and commitment to making inexorable\nprogress towards equal opportunities and rights for\nall of Paraguay\u2019s inhabitants. In that regard, we have\nnever faltered in the constant struggle for full social,\neconomic, political and cultural rights for women. As\nevidence of those firm beliefs, soon after assuming\nits duties, my Government decided to upgrade the\nSecretariat for Women\u2019s Issues to an executive ministry,\nin accordance with United Nations recommendations.\nFinally, in that respect, I must mention our satisfaction\nwith, and full commitment to, Paraguay\u2019s election for a\nnew term as member of the Commission on the Status\nof Women for 2013-2017.\n\nThe Government of Paraguay, which I have\nproudly led since the end of June, now has a historic\ndemocratic obligation to organize the general elections\nscheduled for 21 April 2013 and to guarantee that they\nare peaceful, transparent and exemplary. When the next\nPresident takes office, on 15 August 2013, the soundness\nof Paraguayan democracy will be confirmed. At that\ntime I will look into the eyes of my countrymen and\nthose of foreigners who live in our country and shape\nour future alongside us and will be able to say: mission\naccomplished. I ask God and the Virgin to help us and\nto bless us so that all Paraguayans together can move\ntowards the future that we want."

        "file_text": "\ufeffThe\nSecretary-General has shared with us the priorities that\nhe plans to implement during the sixty-seventh session\nof the General Assembly. His warning concerning\nthe multiplicity of new threats and his clear-sighted\nrecognition of their interconnections should inspire and\nguide our work.\nThe maintenance of international peace and\nsecurity \u2014 need it be said again \u2014 are the very\nessence of the mission of our Organization. What\ndo we see before us? Crises and threats to peace and\nsecurity are multiplying and are often even mutually\nreinforcing, along with the endangerment of human\nrights. What global vision do we share of the challenges\nthat confront our planet, its States and its peoples? By\nbearing in mind that it is our mission and urgent need\nto uphold our vision, which calls on us to support the\nfive priorities of the programme of action that have\nbeen drawn up for the next five years and submitted\nto us by the Secretary-General. Since he has invited\nus to so, we wish to underline the need to prioritize\nthe strengthening of the United Nations system as well\nas the development of partnerships in all areas of its\nactivity.\nThe President rightly sought to focus the general\ndebate of this session on the subject of the peaceful\nsettlement of international situations and disputes. This\nhistoric debate, launched at the beginning of the week\nby the General Assembly, has shown that respect for the\nrule of law, at both the national and the international\nlevels, is indispensable for the establishment of\nresponsible societies that are able to promote  cooperation and ensure the well-being of their citizens.\nRecent history leads us to take a serious look at the\ncurrent difficulties confronting the world. While last\nyear we welcomed the magnificent spark of democracy\nthat was kindled in the Arab world, it is intolerable now\nthat minority factions and extremists are threatening\nthe hopes and dampening the expectations of people\nwho aspire to live in liberty.\nThe Government of the Principality of Monaco\nechoes those who have condemned the acts of violence\nperpetrated both by the authorities and by opposition\ngroups in the Syrian Arab Republic, where the\nsituation only continues to deteriorate. I would also\nlike to convey my full support for the efforts made by\nthe International Committee of the Red Cross and its\nresolve in seeking to ensure that humanitarian needs\nare met. Clearly, that is involves ensuring that each and\nevery one respect the rule of international humanitarian\nlaw as the minimum requirement for meeting the basic,\nelementary moral standards of our peoples, standards\nthat do not, unfortunately, seem to be shared by all.\nWe are equally concerned by the recent events in\nthe Sahel region, including in Mali, which are growing\nworse. The Principality of Monaco, which is involved in\nvarious humanitarian efforts in the region, supports all\nsuch actions by the international community, given the\nurgency and gravity of the situation. We will support\na strategy established by the United Nations that can\naddress the issues of security, governance, development,\nhuman rights and humanitarian aspects. The values that\nwe are committed to uphold in adopting the Charter of\nthe United Nations are based on our common humanity\nand on the recognition of our differences, which are at\nthe very core of our humanity.\nAllow me, in that regard, to pay tribute to all those\nwho have been committed to serving those values on\nthe ground, often paying with their lives. They seek to\nuphold the aims and principles that bring us together\nhere in this forum. Our authorities have resolutely\ncondemned all attacks perpetrated against diplomatic\nand consular missions and personnel. We must all\nensure the obligation of guaranteeing their protection\nin all circumstances.\nAt a time when the world is facing worrying\ndevelopments, the theme that the President has selected\nfor this session of the General Assembly merits the\nunanimous support of all in our community. Aware of\nthe challenges, I would like to take the opportunity to\ncommend Mr. Vuk Jeremi\u0107, President of the General\nAssembly at its sixty-seventh session, on his election\nand to assure the Assembly of my delegation\u2019s full\nsupport.\nMore than ever before, we need to resort to the\npeaceful settlement of our disputes and seek to prevent\nrather than react to events. In the 1950s, Secretary-\nGeneral Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld urged us to be mindful of\nthe need to respond at an early stage to crises in order\nto avoid the outbreak of disputes between parties or the\nconf lagration of a dispute into an open conflict, or in\nthe event that a conflict does break out, to ensure that\nit can be contained.\nWe have been caught unaware and so many ongoing\nproblems in the year 2012 have gone unsolved. We have\nbeen largely successful in ensuring that international\nlaw prevails over the right to wage war. However, the\ninvolvement of our Organization in conflict prevention\nstill falls quite short, as avowals and statements of intent\non their own are insufficient. It is therefore our common\nduty to strengthen understanding, tolerance and mutual\nrespect. As was recalled by the Secretary-General here\non 13 September, as well as by his predecessor, one of\nthe strongest factors for conflict prevention, and thus\nfor the inculcation of an authentic culture of peace, is\neducation. That kind of prevention is aimed at enrolling\nthe young generations to whom we owe a future.\nThe challenges are manifold. Among them, I would\nsingle out the economic and financial crisis, which has\naffected the overwhelming majority of our States since\n2008. We can overcome the crisis, creating employment\nwhile protecting our environmental heritage. But\nin order to do so, we need an ambitious long-term\nvision, and that is why, in spite of the budget cuts,\nthe crisis has compelled us to realize that we cannot\nafford to lose sight of the Millennium Development\nGoals \u2014 elimination of poverty and hunger; education;\nchild and maternal health; and combatting pandemics,\nincluding HIV/AIDS and malaria, which sap humankind\nof its strength \u2014 which must remain uppermost on our\nagenda.\nThe upcoming deadline must encourage us to do\nstill more to intensify our efforts in order to ensure their\nachievement. In 2015, we will adopt a new programme\nof action, based on the results achieved and on the new\nchallenges to be met.\nIn his address to the United Nations Conference on\nSustainable Development, His Serene Highness Prince Albert II of the Principality of Monaco welcomed the\nfact that we are progressing towards a shared definition\nof sustainable development goals. Those goals will\nframe our actions at the international, national and local\nlevels, and in turn, that will make the implementation of\nour commitments more effective and more transparent.\nOne of those objectives should emphasize\nthe sustainable development of oceans and on the\nimportance of the blue economy.\nThat objective should concern all sectors that\ndepend on ocean resources and maritime areas. It\nis urgent that that objective be comprehensive and\nsustainable so that those sectors can continue to benefit\nfrom economic, social and environmental services.\nAccordingly, our delegation will support all initiatives\nseeking to improve the coordination and effectiveness\nof the United Nations work in the oceans. Indeed, we\nbelieve that that is the right path to follow in order to\nultimately ensure the sustainable use and management\nof the oceans and thereby their conservation.\nThe fate of future generations lies in our hands.\nFor that reason, we are obliged to ensure that the Doha\nClimate Change Conference is a success. It is therefore\ncrucial that we reach agreement on the establishment\nof a second period of commitments under the Kyoto\nProtocol. We therefore commit ourselves to working\npositively and effectively in the negotiations on reaching\na new global post-2020 climate agreement, taking into\naccount the needs of the most vulnerable.\nHis Serene Highness Prince Albert II welcomes\nthe celebration next year of the twentieth anniversary\nof Monaco\u2019s joining the United Nations as a Member\nState. In that connection, Monaco wishes to express\nits resolve to contribute to the further strengthening of\nour Organization to the extent that a small State can\ndo so. Members may rest assured that the Principality\nwelcomes the Assembly\u2019s two-fold intention of\nfurther involving itself in the field of development\nand establishing an advisory framework that seeks to\nenhance the cooperation between the General Assembly\nand international financial institutions.\nOn the occasion of the twentieth anniversary of the\nForum of Small States, of which Monaco is a member,\nand also in its capacity as a member of the Global\nGovernance Group, the Principality intends to play its\nfull role in the work of those bodies. The magnitude of\nthe challenges and crises that we all face have shown\nthat the size of a State is not the deciding factor when\nit comes to resolving such problems. Rather, it is solely\nour ability to work together and cooperate that enables\nus to respond to everyday needs and that will lead us on\nthe path towards international peace and security.\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI would first\nlike to extend hearty congratulations to the President\nof the General Assembly at its sixty-seventh session,\nMr. Jeremi\u0107, to whom I wish the greatest success in his\nwork.\nJust one year ago, I ended my statement\n(see A/66/PV.27) by reasserting the notion of commitment as a fundamental value and linchpin\nof our political action, understood as a deep belief\nin the values of democracy, respect for human rights\nand the rule of law; as the assumption of individual\nresponsibilities for a common project; and ultimately\nas a desire for dialogue and understanding. It is in the\npursuit of that commitment and that balance \u2014 what\nwe might call the right balance \u2014 that the difficulty of\nGovernment resides. That is the case at home, in every\none of our States, and also in our shared home of the\nUnited Nations.\nA year ago in this Assembly, we echoed a phrase of\nthe then French President, who stated: \u201cLet us choose\nthe path of compromise, which is neither renunciation\nnor repudiation, but which allows us to move forward,\nstep by step\u201d (A/66/PV.11, p. 23). Indeed, on the path of\ncompromise and the right balance, we cannot and must\nnot abandon the defence of human rights, the rule of\nlaw and the most essential democratic values such as\nfreedom of expression. We cannot and should not deny\nrespect to others.\nHowever, establishing a fair balance does not mean\nconducting a balancing act. Indeed, that balance must\nbe based on strong principles. There can be no excuse\nfor violence, intolerance or impunity. President Obama\nwas right when he mentioned in this Hall that the\nrecent attacks on diplomatic missions were not solely\nan attack on the United States, but also an assault on the\nfoundations of the United Nations itself. There can be\nno excuse or impunity for such acts.\n\nWe are all Chris Stevens. But what defines us is not\nhow we fall but how we rise again. We will stand by all\nChris Stevens as they rise to defend the ideals of the\nUnited Nations.\n\nAllow me today to echo the words of the new\nPresident of the French Republic, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande,\nCo-Prince of Andorra, who stated before this Assembly\nthat \u201cThe mission of the United Nations is to tackle\nthese challenges and to find strong and just responses to\nthem together.\u201d (A/67/PV.6, p. 43) For over 65 years, the\nUnited Nations has been a reference for peace, justice\nand respect for human rights. Remarkable progress has\nindeed been observed in recent years. It is no less true,\nhowever, that the countries represented here cannot afford the luxury of falling into complacency. The\ndemand for just and strong responses is very real.\nThe change of regime in Libya and the ongoing\ngrievous conflict in Syria have presented the\ninternational community with the awkward dilemma of\nhaving to find a fair balance between resolving conflicts\npeacefully and the rule of law \u2014 in short, between\npeace and justice. It would appear that, in order to attain\na peaceful solution to a conflict or to end hostilities,\njustice must be sacrificed while those who have violated\nhuman rights go unpunished; or that, due to inf lexible\napplication of international law, conflicts will continue\nforever. A fair balance must not allow either those who\nviolate human rights to go unpunished, or conflicts to\ncontinue endlessly. With regard to Syria, it is time to\nsupport open societies and political transitions that can\nguarantee a framework for democratic development. I\nwish to praise the commitment of the Secretary-General\nand Joint Special Representative Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi\nto finding a solution to the conflict in Syria.\nThe Secretary-General has said that people\nwant progress and solutions today. They want ideas,\nleadership and concrete hope for the future. The\nSecretary-General\u2019s words accurately reflect what the\nworld expects from all Member States. We also need\nto maintain perspective, because if complacency is\ndangerous, so too are harsh criticism and pessimism.\nWhile the working methods of the United Nations\nsystem are far from optimal, we should not forget that\nthe reality of today seemed an unattainable dream a\ncentury ago. We should move on from talk of dreams\nto talk of ambition. We should move on from dreaming\nabout change to exerting the ambition to change. We\nshould move on from \u201cI have a dream\u201d, as stated by\nMartin Luther King, Jr., to speaking about the ambition\nthat we all share.\nIn his statement at the opening of the general debate\n(see A/67/PV.6), Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon rightly\nmentioned raising our levels of ambition. The step\nfrom dream to ambition needs perspective; dreaming\nrequires knowing only how we would like things to be,\nbut having and realizing ambition requires us to know\nhow far we are prepared to go, while bearing very\nmuch in mind the path travelled and everything to be\nexperienced along the way.\nIn that respect the United Nations and its system\nallow us to face the future with cautious optimism, as\nthe world has been better and more just with the presence of the United Nations than without it. However, when\nwe look at its evolution, we realize that something is not\nquite right, as the evolution process has been fraught\nwith limitations, shortcomings and obstacles that the\ninternational community must address in its efforts to\nresolve conflicts peacefully and in accordance with\nthe law. The Secretary-General rightly emphasized\nhis new Education First initiative, which encourages\ndemocratic values, human rights and the rule of law.\nAnd those values can guarantee equal opportunity and\nsocial cohesion.\nDuring its forthcoming presidency of the Council of\nEurope, Andorra will prioritize education as a tool for\nencouraging democratic values, respect for human rights\nand the rule of law. Andorra is particularly sensitive\nto education, not only in the sphere of international\ncooperation, but also domestically, as it is aware that\nits unique, multicultural and multilingual educational\napproach, featuring three public systems \u2014 Andorran,\nFrench and Spanish \u2014 in a small society with its own\nidentity, has not been a problem, but rather an asset and\nan essential element of social cohesion.\n\nWe see that commitment to multiculturalism and\nmultilingualism within the francophone community.\nThe commitment to openness and exchange among\nindividuals is good and is far from self-absorption in\none\u2019s own language or culture. Now is not the time\nfor self-absorption but rather for openness; it is time\nfor ambition and not protectionism. The work of the\nfrancophone community is deeply aligned with our\nvalues, and we will convene in Africa at the forthcoming\nSummit of the Francophonie to defend the spirit of\nopenness to democratic values and human rights.\n\nThat commitment to multiculturalism also belies\nthe strong bonds we feel with our Latin American\nfriends. Our involvement within the General Assembly\nin the preparatory work for the forthcoming Cadiz\nsummit, to be hosted by our dear neighbour Spain,\nshould also be viewed through the prism of openness\nand the defence of democratic values, human rights and\nthe rule of law.\n\nThe Principality of Andorra today reasserts its\ncommitment to the founding principles of the United\nNations: the promotion of peace, liberty, justice, democracy and human rights. Those are not utopian\nvalues and principles; quite the contrary, it would be\nunrealistic and unthinkable to seek to establish stability\nin the world with any other values. What is important\nis to come here today to proclaim not that Andorra\nhas one of the oldest and most stable parliaments and\npolitical systems on the planet, but that at the end of the\nthirteenth century its political system was consolidated\nin a very short period of time and in circumstances that\nwere far from ideal. In a very brief time span, the same\nsystem was again able to adapt to modern reality at the\nend of the twentieth century. In our country, indeed, it\nwas not until 1971 that women were entitled to vote.\nYet only 40 years later, in 2011 the people of Andorra\nelected a Parliament with the second-highest number of\nfemale representatives in the world. This is why I spoke\nearlier of viewing things from a perspective of process\nand evolution.\nHistory shows us that what appeared utopian\nnot long ago has become reality today. We should\nnot assume that things cannot change and cannot get\nbetter. The limits that the United Nations seems to have\nencountered after almost seven decades of existence\nwill be overcome one day, and today\u2019s challenges will\nbe viewed as things of the past. The numerous countries\nthat form the international community have shown how\nrapidly things can change when there is a will to act.\nOne only has to take a look at the determination with\nwhich many of the members of this Assembly have\njoined forces and coordinated their policies to find\nsolutions to the grave financial and economic crisis that\nhas rocked the world over the last few years.\nThe need for rapid and profound change has also\narrived in Andorra. A year ago, we stated in our speech\nthat our country had one of the most closed economies\non the planet and that it posed significant barriers to\nforeign investment, as foreigners had to meet costly\nrequirements to attain full economic rights. Today,\nonly 12 months later, the Andorran economy is 100 per\ncent open to foreign capital, and every foreign resident\nis granted full economic rights from the first day of his\nor her residency.\n\nEarlier, I referred to openness in a broad sense,\nbut today economic openness should enable us to\nrediscover the path of inclusive growth that has defined\nus, albeit now within an open and diversified economy\ngeared to the pursuit of competitiveness, innovation\n\n\nand general progress. This entire process has been\naccompanied by an updating of the Andorran model,\nwith an appropriate tax framework and a commitment\nto transparency towards the international community.\nThe whole process is based on the belief that recovery\nmeans not faint-hearted withdrawal, but rather the\nambition to open up to the world and a willingness to\ncompete. That conviction is the driving force behind\nthe implementation by the Principality of Andorra of\nsome of the most significant socioeconomic changes in\nits entire history.\nTwenty years ago, the United Nations pioneered\nthe promotion of sustainable development. When the\ninternational community met in Rio de Janeiro in\n1992, at what was called the Earth Summit, the need\nto consider sustainable growth became manifest and\nthe subject was tackled from a threefold economic,\nenvironmental and social perspective. The conclusions\nof that Rio Summit, to which scant or no attention has\nbeen paid, are today so topical that the United Nations\nConference on Sustainable Development, held in Rio\nin June, stressed the very same policies. However,\nalthough 20 years ago sustainability might have seemed\nsolely an environmental issue, experience has shown\nus that public finance, economic growth and our\nmodel of social protections must also be sustainable.\nThe challenge of sustainability is now, more than ever,\nshared and interdisciplinary.\nMany years ago, the United Nations was created\nin the belief that maintaining peace and security in\nthe world was unrealistic without advances in human\nrights, in international law and in democracy. There\ncan be no lasting peace or security without liberty or\njustice. More recently, we have all learned not only\nthat separating democracy from economic progress\nmakes no sense, but also that it is foolish to believe\nin unrestrained, unlimited growth at any cost, the\nconsequences of which we are still feeling.\nA few days ago, at the reception for the diplomatic\ncorps, our Episcopal Co-Prince, Joan Enric Vives\nSicilia, noted the dangerous tendency to prioritize\nhaving rather than being. We must learn the lessons of\nrecent years, in which the desire to have everything we\nwanted too often led us to forget to pursue everything\nwe needed. We must build a more sustainable, more\ninterrelated and more co-responsible world in order to\nlay the foundations for more secure economic growth.\nA pledge to progress and prosperity also means support\nfor democracy, for security and for peace."

I\nam confident that he will successfully manage the\nsession thanks to his competence and his rich and long\nexperience in diplomacy in the service of his friendly\ncountry, the Republic of Serbia. I also express our great\nappreciation for the President of the Assembly at its last\nsession, Ambassador Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser of\nthe fraternal State of Qatar, and thank him for the vital\nrole he played, the constructive issues he advanced and\nhis excellent management of the work of the sixty-sixth\nsession. We are proud of him as a seasoned diplomat\nfrom a State member of the Gulf Cooperation Council,\nand wish him every success in his future endeavours.\nLet me also express our great appreciation for\nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon and thank him for\nthe strenuous efforts he has made to enhance the\neffective role of the Organization in various fields. We\nlook forward to a renewed role for the United Nations\ncompatible with the Secretary-General\u2019s new vision so\nthat the Organization will be able to address the major\nchallenges before it.\nSince joining the United Nations, the Kingdom\nof Bahrain has worked tirelessly to promote the noble\npurposes and principles of the United Nations, in\nparticular, the maintenance of peace and security and\nthe development of cooperation and friendly relations\namong nations on the basis of mutual respect. Guided\nby full respect for those principles, I am honoured to\nrepresent a country that acts upon its international\ncommitments and has laid the foundations of a modern\nState through initiatives, planning and political and\norganizational vision. We seek to build a modern\nsociety that is well organized and committed to its\nvalues in various fields, notably education, health,\nemployment, vocational training, economic reform and\nthe advancement of women.\nOur country, Bahrain, has opted for dialogue as\nan approach to all its modernization efforts aimed\nat meeting the requirements of its long history. We conducted municipal elections in the 1920s and\nparliamentary elections in the past few decades.\nImportant results have been achieved in providing a\ngreater degree of equality, participation, transparency,\npolitical rights and human dignity. That is truly a\nhistorical milestone on the path towards building a\nsociety based on competitive sustainability, justice,\nthe rule of law, equality and the consecration of the\nprinciples of popular participation and representation\nin the decision-making process.\nNotwithstanding all those remarkable national\nachievements, since last year the Kingdom of Bahrain\nhas faced some serious challenges to its security and\nstability, which it has addressed in full transparency,\ncommitment and honesty. In that context, we established\nthe Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry to\nascertain the truth and provide redress. Consequently,\nwe launched a comprehensive dialogue among the\nvarious sectors of society that resulted in a series of\nconstitutional and legislative reforms encompassing all\naspects of life \u2014 political, economic, social and legal.\nAgainst that backdrop, His Majesty King Hamad\nbin Issa Al Khalifa of Bahrain proposed the creation of\nan Arab court of human rights to lay the foundations of\nan environment conducive to the protection of human\nrights and the prevention of their abuse in the Arab\nworld, using the model of the Inter-American Court of\nHuman Rights, the European Court of Human Rights\nand the African Court on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights.\nThe Council of the League of Arab States endorsed that\nhistorical initiative, and arrangements are currently\nunder way to establish the legal basis for the court\u2019s\nestablishment. We hope that the court will become a\nreality in the near future.\nLast week, consistent with our efforts to build\na pluralistic Bahraini society and in full respect for\nthe protection and enhancement of human rights, the\nKingdom of Bahrain approved more than 90 per cent\nof the recommendations made by the Human Rights\nCouncil in Geneva during its Universal Periodic Review,\nincluding a possible accession to the Optional Protocol\nto the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel,\nInhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.\nThe challenges and threats facing our region have\nled the States members of the Gulf Cooperation Council\nto realize the need for greater synergies among them.\nThey have endorsed the proposal of the Custodian of\nthe Two Holy Mosques, King Abdullah Bin Abdulaziz Al-Saud, to move from cooperation to union as a\nmeans of addressing those challenges and threats and\nbuilding capacities to achieve a Gulf Cooperation\nCouncil society based on a shared vision of the future\nthat responds to the accelerating pace of the world and\nanswers to the aspirations of the peoples of the Gulf\nregion. They are convinced that their interests and\ngains can be served only through solidarity and unity\nwith a view to preserving national independence and\nState sovereignty and to meeting the needs arising\nfrom the strategic transformations on the regional and\ninternational scenes.\nMy country believes that the United Nations has an\nindispensable role to play in addressing international\nand regional problems and finding appropriate\nsolutions to them. Our region dearly needs that role\nto be fulfilled, given the catastrophic and fast-paced\ndevelopments taking place in Syria. The international\ncommunity, represented by the United Nations and\nits organs and bodies entrusted with the maintenance\nof international peace and security, is called upon\nto unify its position with a view to putting an end to\nthe humanitarian suffering of the Syrian people and\nfinding a political solution to the crisis that will end\nthe violence and bloodshed, preserve the unity of Syria\nand the cohesion of its people, and spare the region as a\nwhole serious repercussions that could spill far beyond\nthe borders of Syria.\nThe United Nations must therefore shoulder\nits responsibilities to protect unarmed civilians\nwithout allowing the Organization\u2019s procedures and\nmechanisms to impede its ability to prevent crimes\nagainst humanity from being committed. It must set\naside narrow geopolitical interests and proceed to\nattain the supreme goal of protecting civilians in armed\nconflicts and wars. My Government welcomes the\nappointment of Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi as Joint Special\nRepresentative of the United Nations and the League\nof Arab States, and wishes him every success in his\nendeavours to achieve the legitimate demands of the\nbrotherly Syrian people.\nOn the basis of the same humanitarian principle,\nwe should also stand by the Rohingya Muslims in\nMyanmar in their ordeal and provide them with\nassistance and support while providing good counsel to\nthe Government of Myanmar in that regard.\nAlthough the Syrian crisis is preoccupying\nthe international community today, the Palestinian\nquestion remains the core issue for the Arab States and the international community. The Kingdom of Bahrain\nbelieves that it is imperative to redouble efforts towards\na just, durable and comprehensive solution, notably\nthrough the creation of an independent Palestinian State,\nwith East Jerusalem as its capital, in conformity with\nthe relevant United Nations resolutions, the Arab Peace\nInitiative and the decisions of the international Quartet.\nWe are extremely concerned at attempts to violate the\nsanctity of the holy sites in Al-Quds Al-Sharif and the\nattempts to alter their identity.\nWe call on the international community to\nsupport Mahmoud Abbas, President of the State of\nPalestine, who is striving relentlessly to defend the\ncause of his occupied country and to achieve a just and\ncomprehensive peace in the region. We therefore urge\nthe international community to demand that Israel cease\nits settlement activities in the occupied Palestinian\nterritories and dismantle settlements that jeopardize\nthe chances for peace. We also stress the need to\nimplement the relevant General Assembly and Security\nCouncil resolutions by putting an end to ongoing Israeli\nviolations and aggression, and to ensure the principles\nof international legitimacy, notably the Fourth Geneva\nConvention of 1949, which prohibits any geographical\nor demographic alteration in occupied territories. We\nlook forward to peace in our region, which would serve\nthe interests of all its peoples.\nOne tenet of our foreign policy is to enhance peace\nand security in the region. In that regard, Bahrain\nreaffirms its unf linching position in favour of a\nnuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East. That will\nbe possible only by compelling Israel to implement\nrelevant international resolutions, to adhere to the\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons,\nand to subject its nuclear facilities to the supervision of\nthe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).\nMoreover, we stress that the Islamic Republic of\nIran must fulfil its commitments in full and transparent\ncooperation with the IAEA. Indeed, nuclear weapons\nconstitute a serious threat to peace and security in the\nentire region, and various parties must therefore assume\ntheir responsibility for peace and security and refrain\nfrom the language of intimidation, threats and counter-\nthreats that have recently dominated our region.\nIn that regard, we stress the importance of an\nexcellent preparation process for the 2012 conference\nto be held pursuant to the agreement reached in the\nFinal Document of the 2010 Review Conference of\nthe Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT/CONF.2010/50 (Vol. I)).\nWe also reaffirm that the principle of establishing\na nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East in no\nway precludes the right of all nations to access nuclear\ntechnology for peaceful purposes, provided that they\ndo so in full transparency and abide by the IAEA\nguarantee system.\nWhile the States members of the Gulf Cooperation\nCouncil (GCC) have extended their hand to their\nneighbour, the Islamic Republic of Iran, they have\nunfortunately found no positive Iranian response that\ncould facilitate confidence-building, peace and security.\nOn the contrary, we have had to endure constant\ninterference in our internal affairs from our neighbour.\nRecently, Iran has reiterated menacing threats to GCC\nMember States, in contradiction of the spirit of good-\nneighbourliness, thus generating tension and distrust in\nthe region. More importantly, the Kingdom of Bahrain\nreaffirms the need, either through direct negotiations\nor through arbitration by the International Court of\nJustice, to resolve the problem of the three United\nArab Emirates\u2019 islands of Abu Musa, Greater Tunb and\nLesser Tunb that are occupied by the Islamic Republic\nof Iran.\nWith regard to the situation in brotherly Yemen,\nwe are aware of the need for a successful transitional\nperiod in order to achieve security and stability\nin the country, in line with the agreement reached\nwithin the framework of the GCC initiative and its\nimplementation mechanisms. We welcome the steps\ntaken by Mr. Abdrabuh Mansour Hadi Mansour,\nPresident of the Republic of Yemen, to launch a national\nYemeni dialogue, and we are fully confident of his wise\nleadership of Yemen during this critical transitional\nperiod, so that the aspirations of the Yemeni people can\nbe realized.\nIn that regard, the Kingdom of Bahrain welcomes\nthe convening of the donors conference for Yemen,\nheld in Riyadh and sponsored by the Kingdom of\nSaudi Arabia, and fully supports the recommendations\nand conclusions agreed upon with a view to building\na brighter future for brotherly Yemen, as well as the\noutcome of the meeting of the Friends of Yemen, held\ntoday in New York.\nWe also reaffirm the unwavering, principled and\nconsistent position of the Kingdom of Bahrain, in\nsolidarity with the Kingdom of Morocco, regarding the\npreservation of the territorial integrity of Morocco and the peaceful settlement of the Moroccan Sahara issue\npursuant to relevant Security Council resolutions.\nIn regard to the current political developments\nin Somalia, the Kingdom of Bahrain welcomes the\nelection of Mr. Hassan Sheikh Mohamud as the new\nPresident of the Somali Republic in the context of\nthe transitional process. We call on the international\ncommunity to offer its support and assistance in the\nrestoration of peace and security in the country and in\nthe preservation of Somalia\u2019s territorial integrity and\npolitical independence. We commend the efforts of the\nSomali Government, together with the international\ncommunity, to restore peace, stability and cooperation,\nparticularly in combating piracy in the Horn of Africa.\nWe have recently witnessed ugly insults and\ndenigration addressed to our beloved Prophet\nMuhammad \u2014 peace be upon him, his family and\nhis companions. A typical example of that is the\nshameful video that the Kingdom of Bahrain condemns\nin the strongest terms, and which led to violence\nand destruction around the world. Our concern is\ncompounded by the unjustified aggression perpetrated\nagainst the diplomatic mission of the United States\nof America in Benghazi that killed Ambassador\nChristopher Stevens and a number of innocent\nAmerican diplomats, in f lagrant violation of the Vienna\nConvention on Diplomatic Relations of 1961.\nIn spite of these serious developments and\nrepercussions, we should not let that gloomy scene\novershadow the spectacle of the crowds that took to\nthe streets in Libya the following day to condemn that\nabominable attack on the American mission. We are\nall responsible, as peoples and nations, to teach each\nother about respect. We need to redouble our efforts to\nprevent the recurrence of insults to religions, prophets\nand other religious symbols as Allah commands us in\nthe Holy Koran:\n\u201cWe have created you from male and female\nand made you peoples and tribes that you may\nknow one another. Indeed, the most noble of you\nin the sight of Allah is the most righteous of you.\nIndeed, Allah is all-knowing and acquainted\u201d\n(The Holy Koran, XLIX:13).\nThe Kingdom of Bahrain is among the first to\nhave achieved most of the Millenium Development\nGoals (MDGs) before the prescribed time frame in the\nfields of education, the empowerment of women, the\nexpansion of social security to vulnerable groups, equal opportunities for men and women, and the enhancement\nof health services, notably for children. Therefore, the\nKingdom of Bahrain occupies an advanced position\nat the global level, as reflected in the United Nations\nHuman Development Reports issued during the past\nfew years.\nIf the international community is to overcome the\nchallenges facing Member States, we must be able to\nfully shoulder their responsibilities, especially as the\ndeadline for achieving the MDGs is approaching. We are\nonly three and a half years from that deadline. We have\nto redouble our efforts and review our policies in order\nto enhance national and regional capacities to avoid\nimbalances and to overcome challenges. According\nto the Millennium Development Goals Report 2012,\nand notwithstanding some negative indicators, child\nmortality has been decreasing across the world, the\npercentage of those living in extreme poverty has been\nhalved, and over 89 per cent of the world\u2019s population\nnow has access to safe drinking water.\nHowever, it seems that other objectives are still\nunattainable in many countries, and inequalities\ncontinue to rise in some areas such as public health that\nremains dismal and a cause for great concern. That also\napplies to the scarcity of water resources. We therefore\ncannot use the global financial crisis as an excuse\nfor reneging on our financial commitments to those\ncountries in greatest need.\nIn that regard, Bahrain welcomes the outcome\nof the United Nations Conference on Sustainable\nDevelopment, as well as the Secretary-General\u2019s vision\nwith regard to sustainable development. Much remains\nto be done, however, to ensure that people across the\nworld not only have access to the most basic needs, but\nthat they have the tools to maintain them over time.\nWe must acknowledge that sustainability is not merely\na response to needs but rather a principal element of\nhuman dignity.\nTo conclude, I believe that the formidable changes\nand challenges our world faces today present valuable\nopportunities that we can exploit through wisdom,\ncourage, patience and joint action. We must work with\nall our capacity to address the elements that divide us,\nparticularly backwardness, extremism and isolationism.\nAt the same time, we must continue to lend a hand\nto those most in need. We must use objectivity and\nhonesty to challenge immobility and prejudice in order to achieve the progress, dignity and prosperity to which\nour peoples aspire."

        "file_text": "\ufeffI\nwarmly congratulate the President on his election as\nPresident of the General Assembly at its sixty-seventh session. His election demonstrates the esteem in which\nhe and his country, Serbia, are held on the international\nscene. I can assure him that he has the support of\nmy country, Gabon. I also commend the outstanding\nwork done by his predecessor, Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz\nAl-Nasser, during his presidency of the Assembly at its\nsixty-sixth session. And I would like to reiterate our\nconfidence in the efforts that Secretary-General Ban\nKi-moon is undertaking as the head of the Organization.\nOur world more than ever needs a dialogue\nof civilizations and cultures. In order to build a\nmore peaceful world, it needs more tolerance, more\nunderstanding and more respect among peoples. During\nthis session, we are called upon to redefine the outlines\nfor better management of global challenges. I would\nlike to welcome the theme chosen by the President for\nthis session, namely, \u201cBringing about adjustment or\nsettlement of international disputes or situations by\npeaceful means\u201d, which will remain at the heart of our\ncommon efforts and is indeed an ongoing quest.\nThe debate we held yesterday on the rule of law\nat the national and international levels was also a\ndiscussion of the conditions for peace in our countries\nand around the world. By maintaining our focus on\nthat goal and working together, we can better tackle\nthe challenges of an international context that is still\nmarked by multifaceted crises, illustrated by many\nhotbeds of tension around the world. That is shown by\nthe situations in the Middle East and Africa, which are\nstill of concern to us.\nThe Syrian crisis, which arose as an extension of\nthe Arab Spring last year, is having a destabilizing\nimpact on several countries of the Middle East region.\nWe hope that the efforts undertaken by the Joint Special\nRepresentative, Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi, will help put a\nstop to confrontation and will open up a dialogue.\nWith respect to the situation in Mali, we condemn\nthe attempts to divide the country and the destruction of\nthe World Heritage sites in Timbuktu. Gabon supports\nthe efforts of the new transitional Government, the\nEconomic Community of West African States and the\nAfrican Union to try to re-establish territorial integrity.\nI urge the Security Council and Member States\nto support the United Nations integral regional\nstrategy on the Sahel, which addresses issues of\nsecurity, governance, development, human rights and\nhumanitarian concerns.\nWhen we served on the Security Council, we\njoined other members in responding to the appeals of\nthe Libyan people. The situation there is still dire, and\nwe encourage the United Nations to continue to work to\npromote political stability and reconstruction efforts.\nWe reiterate our condemnation of the attack on the\nUnited States Consulate in Benghazi.\nWith regard to the ongoing tensions in the eastern\npart of our brother country the Democratic Republic\nof the Congo, our collective support for the Congolese\nState must be maintained in security, political and\nhumanitarian matters.\nI welcome the progress made in Somalia with the\nadoption of its provisional Constitution and the election\nof the new President, Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, whom\nI congratulate and commend. Gabon will continue to\nhelp Somalia, as it did last year with humanitarian\ncontributions. I commend United Nations and African\nUnion involvement in Somalia. Thanks to the African\nUnion Mission in Somalia and to Government forces,\nsecurity is improving even far outside Mogadishu. I\nhave the highest praise for the country, whose troops\npay a heavy price on the ground.\nI honour the memory of the first Prime Minister of\nEthiopia, Meles Zenawi, who passed away on 22 August.\nAll of us know of his work for peace in Somalia and the\nSudan, his commendable tenures as Chair of the New\nPartnership for Africa\u2019s Development Heads of State\nand Government Orientation Committee and his focus\non climate change.\nIt goes without saying that the crises and conflicts\nthat continue to ravage the world constitute a profound\nbetrayal of the cry-from-the-heart aspirations of all\npeoples for peace and security, justice, development\nand the equal sovereignty of States. Those cries come\nfrom the people of Palestine and Cuba, who long for a\nbetter future. One wants recognition of a State living in\npeace and security with its neighbours, within secure,\ninternationally recognized borders, while the other\nwants an end to the economic, commercial and financial\nembargo it suffers under. The General Assembly has\nmany times spoken out on the side of those two peoples\u2019\naspirations, through numerous resolutions, which my\ncountry has unequivocally supported.\nTo fulfil the aspirations of all peoples, we need global\ngovernance that is more balanced, more democratic,\nbetter structured and based on the principles of the\nCharter of the United Nations. Such governance must be founded on the primacy of international law and\nrespect for the sovereignty of States in their quest for\ndemocracy and development.\nThroughout the coming sixty-seventh session we\nwill focus on certain priority issues, starting with\nvarious reforms of the Organization, especially the\nrevitalization of the General Assembly, to make it better\nable to play its part given the changes and current realities\nin the world. We must strengthen the Assembly\u2019s role\nas an active force and as the premier forum for global\ndemocracy. Likewise, in its commitment to Security\nCouncil reform, Gabon continues to support permanent\nand equitable representation for Africa.\nAs we did during our recent tenure on the Council,\nwe will continue our focus on mediation, prevention\nand the peaceful resolution of disputes and conflicts.\nWe believe action must be taken before disputes\nescalate into armed conflict, sparing the heavy expense\nof peacekeeping operations. But current realities force\nus to focus also on new, cross-cutting threats to peace\nand security, including trafficking in small arms and\nlight weapons and maritime piracy, which is ravaging\nthe Gulf of Guinea.\nThat is why we are working along with\nother countries in Central Africa to put in place\nconfidence-building measures, including the early\nwarning mechanism for Central Africa. We greatly\nappreciate the support offered by the United Nations\nRegional Office for Central Africa, which my country\nhosts, in promoting peace.\nDuring my tenure as Acting Chairman of the\nEconomic Community of West African States, I will\nemphasize regional integration as a means to common\neconomic development and strengthening peaceful\nconnections among member States.\nWe know that the conflicts shaking the world have\nnumerous and complex causes. Any lasting settlement\nof those crises requires an approach that combines\nsupport for institution-building and governance in the\naffected countries with initiatives to revitalize their\neconomies. Gabon will therefore follow with great\ninterest the issue of an increased role for the Economic\nand Social Council.\nMany countries remain concerned with economic\nconditions. We must therefore rethink our approaches\nto sustainable development initiatives. We must reflect\nclearly on the post-2015 development agenda, especially\non how to coordinate the Millennium Development\nGoals and the sustainable development goals enunciated\nin the outcome of the United Nations Conference on\nSustainable Development (Rio+20) (resolution 66/288).\nIt is also crucial to break the impasse in the\nWorld Trade Organization by rethinking the basis for\nnegotiations. We will thereby be better able to promote\nthe tripartite model of aid together with investment and\ntrade towards sustainable development.\nDuring last year\u2019s session I referred to work\nin progress in my country towards the goal we set\nfor ourselves to become an emerging country by\n2025. Since then that initiative has begun to produce\nresults in the creation of strategic infrastructures,\nstrengthening the rule of law and social, political\nand economic reforms. We continue to take steps to\ndiversify our economy through local promotion of the\nnatural resources we export, which encourages wealth\ncreation and employment. Those efforts must be based\non sustainable management of our forests and their\nbiodiversity, which plays an important role in the global\nenvironment. In that vein we are fighting poaching and\nthe illegal trafficking in protected species.\nI am also pleased at the adoption, on 21 June, of\nthe outcome of the Rio+20 Conference, which reflects\nthe international community\u2019s recognition of the need\nto work together to promote sustainable development\nthrough the joint efforts of individuals, Governments,\ncivil society and the private sector. Along those lines I\nhave instructed my Government to rethink our country\u2019s\ninstitutional framework for sustainable development,\nwith an eye to enacting legislation on the subject.\nGabon is also pursuing the opportunities offered by a\ngreen economy in eradicating poverty.\nWe are also continuing to develop our human\nresources, our financial services capabilities, new\ninformation technologies and ecotourism. Given\ncurrent economic challenges, I recently instituted\nmeasures to improve the daily lives of my fellow\ncitizens by tackling the cost of living \u2014 for instance,\nby suspending customs duties and the value added-tax\non several basic items and building materials.\nIn the social arena, we have put in place a national\nsystem of health coverage for all strata of Gabonese\nsociety. That coverage, which is part of our fight against\nHIV/AIDS, includes free antiretrovirals and prenatal\nand maternal care for all infected pregnant women.\nAt the political level, we have introduced biometrics\nto improve the organization of the next elections. We continue our efforts to talk with all leading players in\nthe nation, in particular through the National Council\nfor Democracy.\nTogether, those actions strengthen the climate of\npeace bequeathed to us by my illustrious predecessor,\nthereby creating an environment conducive to the well-\nbeing of citizens and to the security of investments\nneeded for the development of the country. We are\ntherefore ready to welcome diversified and mutually\nbeneficial partnerships and look forward to doing so.\nOur countries and the international community as\na whole must today overcome considerable challenges.\nOur efforts can fulfil the aspirations of our peoples only\nif we cooperate to achieve global governance based on\nrespect for the rule of law, dialogue among peoples,\nconflict prevention, protection of the environment and\nbiodiversity. Our ultimate goal must be, above all, the\nwell-being of our peoples.\nIt is in that spirit that my country will continue to\nmake its contribution both in our Organization and in\nour common work for peace, security, development and\nprosperity for all."

        "file_text": "\ufeffOn behalf of the\nAfrican continent and as Chair of the African Union, I\nwould like to congratulate you, Mr. President, on your\nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly\nat its sixty-seventh session, and at the same time\ncongratulate the Secretary-General for his leadership\nrole for the peace and prosperity of our people.\nIn our world, shaken by so many multifaceted crises,\nthe Assembly\u2019s general debate offers us the opportunity\nto transcend our national interests to contemplate\ntogether the ways and means to ensure international\npeace and security and to improve global governance\nfor healthy economic growth, which is the guarantor\nof sustainable human development. In that regard, I\nwelcome the relevance of the theme of this session,\non the settlement of international disputes by peaceful\nmeans. It is a logical follow-up to that of the previous\nsession, which focused on mediation in the settlement of\ndisputes, and amply demonstrates the importance that\nthe United Nations accords to international peace and\nsecurity, the foundation of a better world characterized\nby stability, equity, solidarity among nations, justice,\nrespect for human rights and fundamental freedoms\nand international cooperation.\nWith regard to the conflicts and other wars that\nshake our world, the African continent faces many\nchallenges which it cannot straighten out by itself. We\nhope that the General Assembly\u2019s attention, focused\nsince its previous session on the thorny question of\nconflicts and how to settle them peacefully, will help\nAfrica to find appropriate solutions so that it can\ndedicate its resources and energies to the sustainable\ndevelopment of its States and to the well-being of its\npopulations.\nThe major constraints on Africa\u2019s economic\ndevelopment and social progress are at once sundry and\nvariable. They include, inter alia, the illicit and massive\ncirculation of small arms and light weapons, which\nfeeds chronic insecurity and transnational organized\ncrime in States and regions of the continent heretofore\nhavens of peace and prosperity. There is an upsurge in\nterrorist acts in the Sahelo-Saharan area and activities\nrelated to transnational crime, such as abductions\nand illegal trafficking of all kinds, in particular of\nhumans, and trafficking in narcotics and counterfeit\nmedications. Piracy and armed robbery at sea confront\nthe States of the Gulf of Guinea and the Horn of Africa.\nWe see ongoing unemployment and underemployment,\nlack of food in some regions and chronic malnutrition in many countries. Soil degradation and erosion\nincrease, and natural disasters, the consequences of\nclimate upheavals and change recur. Poor governance\nin international economic relations engenders an\neconomic and financial crisis.\nIn spite of the difficulties and shortfalls noted in\ntheir operation, the different elections that have taken\nplace in many African States in 2011 and 2012 show\nthe determination of the African peoples and their\nadherence to the process of implanting democracy and\nthe rule of law in our dear continent.\nI take this opportunity to focus particularly on the\nefforts underway in the Economic Community of West\nAfrican States (ECOWAS), supported by the African\nUnion, to deal with the grave security and institutional\ncrises that have taken place in particular in Mali and\nGuinea-Bissau.\nIn Mali a very disturbing situation is developing\nwhich has to do with the occupation of the north of the\ncountry by terrorist cells that threaten to destabilize\nthe entire West African subregion and could threaten\nsecurity on the continent and throughout the world.\nThe terrorist cells share the same intolerance that is\ndestabilizing the democratic Government of the Federal\nRepublic of Nigeria. The international community\nhas a duty to act decisively against that terrorist and\nfundamentalist threat and ensure that human rights are\nrespected. I would like to reiterate from this rostrum\nmy pressing appeal for the international community to\ncommit itself, along with ECOWAS and the African\nUnion, to eliminate that serious threat to peace and\nsecurity in the subregion and to prevent large-scale\nhumanitarian disasters.\nI am not forgetting the situation in Guinea-Bissau,\nwhich continues to hold the attention of ECOWAS and\nof the African Union in spite of progress made through\nmediation between the different the parties concerned,\nincluding ECOWAS, the African Union, the Community\nof Portuguese-speaking Countries, the United Nations\nand the bilateral and multilateral partners. I hope that\nthe initiatives will continue to help to bring about a\ncoordinated approach to the crisis in order to reach an\ninternational and national consensus on the situation in\nthat country.\nI welcome the different efforts by the African\nUnion and the international community in pursuit\nof peace with regard to the various other hotbeds of\ntension on the continent, namely, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Somalia, the Sudan, South\nSudan, Madagascar, et cetera. We must strengthen the\nstrategic partnership established between the United\nNations Security Council and the Peace and Security\nCouncil of the African Union with regard to conflict\nprevention, mediation, peacekeeping, peacebuilding\nand the promotion of human rights and humanitarian\nlaw for the certain benefit of our people. We must also\nthink more deeply on ways to ensure predictable and\nsustainable financing for African Union peacekeeping\noperations, including the African Standby Force.\nAs shown by the crises that are shaking our planet,\nthe system of global governance that has prevailed up to\nnow is suffering from serious disfunctions. It is therefore\nhigh time to accelerate the process of reforming the\ninternational system in order to democratize the mode\nof operation of its institutions and mechanisms that\nregulate and promote cooperation among States.\nSince the 2005 World Summit, various measures\nhaving to do with rationalizing the United Nations\nsystem have been taken and have resulted in particular\nin the establishment of new bodies that have proven\nvery useful. The Peacebuilding Commission, created\nto break the cycle of violence in countries emerging\nfrom conflict, has contributed to their stabilization by\nproviding them targeted support to confront troubling\nsituations. Similarly, the Human Rights Council is\ncontributing to improving global governance with\nregard to the protection and promotion of human rights,\nhumanitarian law and fundamental freedoms.\nIn the same spirit, negotiations to reform the\nSecurity Council must be intensified to achieve in the\nnear term the establishment of an inclusive Council,\none that would repair the historical injustice done to\nAfrica with respect to its presence in that organ, which\nheads the collective security system established by the\nCharter of the United Nations.\nCompleting Security Council reform would, I am\nsure, result in more serenity in the handling of the world\u2019s\ncurrent major problems in the area of international peace\nand security. It would confer greater legitimacy upon\nthe actions of our common Organization and would\nallow it to renew its original vocation as an instrument\nof conflict prevention and resolution. It would also\nallow it to shed the inconsistencies that limit it to the\nincongruous role of an observer of carnage taking\nplace before its very eyes. Those laudable reforms must\nbe complemented by a system offering the youth and women an opportunity to get more involved in the life\nof the United Nations.\nPeace in the world is possible. We cannot ignore the\nsituation in the Middle East. Today the United Nations\nhas the means to find a fair and sustainable solution to\nthe Palestinian problem, and under no pretext should\nit shirk its duty and historical responsibility. We are\ntalking about security, stability and peace, not only\nin the Middle East, but for the entire world. Africa is\nfully in favour of the \u201cone land, two States\u201d solution to\nrestore lasting peace in the Middle East, because in the\nend the two peoples \u2014 Palestinians and Israelis \u2014 must\nbe able to live in love, friendship, peace and prosperity.\nAs the Assembly knows, the world economy still\nsuffers from the financial and economic crisis that\nwas unleashed in 2008. In spite of the macroeconomic\npolicies established by both developed and developing\ncountries, with the support of the national and\ninternational financial institutions, the economic\nslowdown that began in 2008 has persisted, with the\ncorollary of weak and fragile economic growth and\nmore than 75 million unemployed people throughout\nthe world, with very high unemployment rates in the\ndeveloping countries.\nThe prices of raw materials, which are the major\nsource of export earnings for developing countries,\nhave become very volatile, as have the prices of food\ncommodities. Flows of private capital meant for foreign\ndirect investment cannot escape the negative impact of\nthe crisis. At the same time, we see a tangible reduction\nof aid for development and other forms of official f lows\nfrom countries of the North to those of the South.\nWith regard to food security, almost 16 million\npeople in Sahel countries face problems of famine and\nnutrition, in spite of the many efforts made individually\nby our States and the collective initiatives in the\nAfrican Union through the New Partnership for Africa\u2019s\nDevelopment and through the Comprehensive Africa\nAgriculture Development Programme. In fact, of 40\ncountries facing a food shortage throughout the world,\n34 still are in Africa, even though about twenty of them\nhave allocated at least 20 per cent of their budget to\nagriculture. That is why the nineteenth ordinary session\nof the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of\nthe African Union adopted a decision declaring 2014\nthe Year of Agriculture and Food Security in Africa to\nmark the tenth anniversary of the Comprehensive Africa\nAgriculture Development Programme. The forecasted increase in food commodity prices, according to recent\nestimates of the Food and Agriculture Organization of\nthe United Nations, and the already high costs of energy\nare certainly additional burdens for already vulnerable\npopulations.\nWe also welcome the positive initiative of the\nNew Alliance for Food Security and Nutrition taken\nby President Barack Obama on the margins of the\nGroup of Eight Summit, held on 18 and 19 May at\nCamp David, which calls for bringing together donors,\npartner countries and the private sector for a common\ncause aimed at pulling 50 million people out of poverty\nin the next ten years. We hope that this will allow us\nto mobilize more assistance for African countries in\norder to improve food security and nutrition in order\nto accelerate their progress towards achieving the\nMillenium Development Goals.\nIt is also important not to disappoint the hopes raised\nby the conclusions of the United Nations Conference\non Sustainable Development (Rio+20), which adopted\nmore than 700 official commitments and promises of\ngifts totaling more than $500 billion. The impact of\nthose conferences will be measured by the fulfilment\nof the decisions and commitments.\nAfrica hopes that the results of the work of the\nhigh-level group of eminent persons selected by the\nSecretary-General to advise him on the post-2015\ndevelopment programme and the working group to\ndefine sustainable development goals will be able\nto achieve convergence in their efforts to suggest a\nvision of sustainable human development, capable\nof mobilizing the international community so as to\nachieve equity and attain a prosperity shared by all.\nAfrica, the cradle of humankind, is also a continent\nof the future, of hope and hopefulness. Indeed, thanks\nto the incalculable potential of its subsoil and to the\nyouthfulness of its population \u2014 which in 2050 will\nnumber 2 billion, 60 per cent of whom will be less than\n35 years old \u2014 Africa could become the driving force\nfor growth of the global economy, if that youth becomes\nprofessionalized.\nThat is why we raised to cardinal principles\nthe values of unity, stability, peace, security, good\ngovernance and the struggle against any impediments\nto our development, particularly corruption, impuntiy,\nthe loss of accountability, fratricidal wars, political\nand institutional instability and brutal challenges to\nthe constitutional order. We have affirmed all of those values through the African Charter on Democracy,\nElections and Governance, the African charter on\npublic service and the African peace and security\nmechanisms, et cetera.\nAfrica has decided to establish a free trade\nzone throughout the continent and is in the\nprocess of accelerating its economic integration\nthrough its ambitious programme of developing\ninfrastructure \u2014 namely, energy, railroad networks,\nairports and ports. That feeds the hope that we will\nhave support for private-public partnerships to finance\nthose wide-ranging infrastructure programmes.\nIn our implacable fight against poverty, Africa\nhas no choice but to persevere in its efforts to ensure\nprogress in the areas of food, nutrition, health, water\nprovisioning, sanitation, primary, technical and\nprofessional education for all, and the independence of\nwomen and children.\nThe fight against HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and\nmalaria is a top priority for the continent, and we\nwill not be idle as long as we have not achieved the\nobjectives that we set in Abuja. In that regard, we\nwelcome the decision adopted by the Assembly of\nHeads of State and Government of the African Union\nasking the Commission of the Union to develop a road\nmap for the African Union for shared responsibility and\nglobal solidarity in combating HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis\nand malaria in Africa for the period of 2012 to 2015.\nA high-level coordinating meeting on the subject will\ntake place tomorrow, 26 September 2012, at United\nNations Headquarters.  I call on the spirit of solidarity of developed\ncountries and of countries of the South that are\nexperiencing considerable economic expansion to set\nup, according to their historic responsibility and their\nabilities, opportunities to assist the efforts of African\ncountries, as was agreed during the fourth Ministerial\nConference of the Least Developed Countries, held\nin Istanbul, Turkey in May 2011, as well as at the\nGroup of 20 Summit in Los Cabos, Mexico, in June.\nThe recommendations of those bodies reflect well\nour common ambition to transition of half of the least\ndeveloped countries to the category of middle-income\ncountries by 2020 \u2014 an ambition that has been fully\nintegrated into the Rio+20 vision.\n\nMy fervent wish is that the current difficulties of\ndevelopment partners of the North, due to the sovereign\ndebt and bank crises, and the austerity measures that\nthey are rightly imposing on themselves do not def lect\nthem from their commitments to a significant increase\nin development aid. In that regard, I am pleased by the\nreaffirmation at the Rio+20 Conference on Sustainable\nDevelopment of the resolve of heads of State and\nGovernment to spare no effort to more promptly achieve\ninternationally agreed development goals, including\nattaining the Millennium Development Goals by 2015,\nwhile bearing in mind the concerns linked to the risks\nthat current production and consumption methods pose\nto the planet in terms of the accelerated depletion of\nresources and the challenges for future generations.\nI am convinced that a new world is possible. It\npresupposes inclusive governance in international\npolitical, financial and economic bodies. Moreover,\nthe continuing challenges facing humanity make us\nfully aware of our interdependence and the need for an\nagreed system of governance in managing international\nrelations rather than withdrawal and resort to\nunilateralism and coercive domination.\nI remain convinced that a new world characterized\nby peace, stability, security and the shared prosperity\nof our planet and our peoples will emerge only by the\ninternational community sharing its technology and\nfinancial resources, together with the wealth of the\nAfrican continent. May God bless our planet."

        "file_text": "\ufeffI would first like to\ncongratulate Mr. Vuk Jeremi\u0107 on his election to the\npresidency of the General Assembly at this year\u2019s\nsession. I also wish to place on record Saint Lucia\u2019s\nthanks to Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser for his\ncontribution as President of the Assembly at its sixty-\nsixth session.\nI would like to underscore the words of the\nPresident, of which we should be continually reminded,\nconcerning the fact that peace is not merely the absence\nof war. Indeed, poverty and prejudice are the flint and tinder for violent feud and furore. And so we embrace\nyour suggested theme, for while in the Caribbean we\ngenerally know peace, we are aware of the real struggle\nof humankind to achieve peace in the face of disaster,\ninjustice, inequity and conflict.\nBeyond this Hall lies a beautiful world. And\nwhatever the f laws and failures of mankind, we still\nare blessed to be given a world from which we can seek\nlife and livelihoods. It is difficult to imagine at times\nthat even in the face of turmoil, decimation and acts\nof brutality and calamity, humankind has progressed\nover the millennia. That is what must give us hope and\nconfidence for the future: that we have been through\nthis before and have come through colossal tragedies,\nunexplainable disasters, world wars and famine, and\nstill we are here. Our civilization continues to thrive.\nHowever, we can only succeed if we recognize and\ncelebrate our shared humanity. This, therefore, must\nbe a world that continuously affirms all human lives,\na world that recognizes our collective endowment, that\ncelebrates our ingenuity and our enterprise. A world, as\nis said in southern Africa, that is imbued with ubuntu.\nEach year for the past seven decades, we have sat\nhere as equals, everyone with a voice, everyone with a\nsay. Our size, whether defined by geography, population\nor both, has no relevance, albeit only temporarily for\nthe purposes of this discourse and dialogue. And even\nwhile some have sat here longer, we can all embrace a\ncommonality that is not transient or mutable. But even\nso, we can at times forget that behind every country\u2019s\nrepresentative are real people with real lives, who seek\ncherished moments despite their sea of despair.\nAnd let there be no doubt that, even when our\nleaders come here to speak, we will have, in all our\nown countries, differences of opinion, of philosophy,\nof faith. Yet despite all this, the beauty of democracy\nis that we can embrace a common pursuit: the pursuit\nof happiness, prosperity and enjoyment of life. Our\nphilosophies should therefore never destroy that\npursuit; they should affirm it. Our faiths should never\ntear this apart, they should form and fashion souls of\ncompassion, understanding and tolerance.\nFor our ancestors, from Africa to Asia, from the\nArctic to the Amazon, all knew conflict and what it cost\nin their lives. We know what it costs humankind right\nnow. And we should all know that history has repeatedly\nshown us that warfare is not the best way to solve our\nproblems. So then do we ignore the bombs and guns if they are not heard on our streets, in our cities and parks\nand playgrounds? Should the girl in Aleppo or Benghazi\nnot be able to share the same opportunities and dreams\nand hopes as a boy in Arlington or Birmingham?\nNo one expects a naive world, with utopian leaders.\nNor do we suggest that our world will not have conflict,\nfor disagreement is inevitable in all aspects of life.\nHowever, I ask that we have the courage to be bold\nabout the world we want. I ask that we act when we\nknow we can. I ask that those leaders who hold the seats\nof higher authority always remember the minorities,\nthose who are easily forgotten, easily marginalized,\neasily wiped out. There should never be a season for\ninjustice, never a season for corruption, never a season\nfor poverty, never a season for brutality and never a\nseason for torment.\nSaint Lucia therefore welcomes a peaceful\nresolution to the conflict in the Syrian Republic and\nan immediate end to what is clearly carnage, a human\ntragedy. We continue to support the efforts of the\nSpecial Envoy and the Secretary-General in this body\u2019s\nefforts to induce the parties to focus on coming to the\ntable for negotiations, with a view to finding a path\ntowards a resolution of the conflict that is acceptable\nto the majority of the people of Syria and takes into\naccount the necessity of ensuring the welfare and\ninterest of minorities in that State.\nWe are, of course, also very concerned about\nthe resort to violence in the Middle East, aimed at\nconfronting either religious or ideological contentions.\nWe condemn all attempts at disparagement of religious\nprophets, deities, symbols or practices, and we appeal\nfor tolerance and understanding. In the same vein, we\ndeplore the brutal murder in Libya of the Ambassador\nof the United States, and we share that country\u2019s pain\nand anguish. Religious intolerance is combustible and\ndangerous and ensnares even those nations far from the\ntheatres of conflict.\nSaint Lucia is very conscious of the active\nattempts in the Middle East to develop new systems\nof governance, as recent systems appear, in some\ncountries, to have outlived their usefulness for the\nmajority of their citizens. Apart from our commitment\nto global and regional peace, we must also recognize\nthat turbulence in the Middle East has the undoubted\neffect of distorting the price of the dominant global\ncommodity, oil, and that those distortions harm the\ninterests and development processes of large and small\ncountries alike. The world desperately needs a peaceful\nMiddle East. We express our hope for the continued\nevolution of peaceful and consensus approaches to\nissues of governance in that area.\nSaint Lucia believes that all efforts to promote\npeace and prosperity for everyone, while of course\nprotecting the health of our planet, should be embraced.\nThe Government of Saint Lucia is well aware of the\ndetermination of the Chinese people to unify their\ncountry, as signalled to the world when China took its\nrightful place in the United Nations. In that context,\nSaint Lucia welcomes the emerging dialogue and\ncooperation between the People\u2019s Republic of China\nand the Republic of China on Taiwan. Such cross-strait\ndialogue and cooperation will surely facilitate global\nharmony. We look forward to a continued evolution of\nthe ongoing peaceful rapprochement among the Chinese\npeople as they search to unify their civilization.\nSaint Lucia also wishes to support the calls for\nAfrica to gain its rightful permanent representation on\nthe Security Council, as supported by the Presidents\nof Mali and South Africa. As we recognize the perils\nof conflict and warfare in Africa so too should we\nrecognize the ability of Africa to bring peace to itself.\nThe voice of one billion people and that of an entire\ncontinent should no longer go unheard.\nSaint Lucia welcomes the resolution of the\nlongstanding dispute in the Sudan, the achievement of\nself-determination for the new State of South Sudan\nand its introduction into the community of nations. It\nis pleasing that that process has occurred in a context\nin which the States of the African continent have\nnow themselves been creating new spaces in a bid to\ntake advantage of the development of the continent\u2019s\nresources in a changing economic environment.\nWe cannot have global collaboration and\ncooperation, and start anew unless extreme disparities\nare reduced or eliminated. So it is necessary to\ndetermine the causes and respond purposefully in\ntackling the inequities that exist in the world. While\none of the obvious building blocks for development is\nthat of good governance \u2014 political structures that are\nethical and not fuelled by greed and abuse \u2014 and while\nwe can strengthen the rule of law, ensure property rights\nand hold fair elections, those measures by themselves\ndo not and cannot secure democracy. While democracy\nhas no place for dictators or demigods, it is still rather\nmeaningless to a person with no food on the table. The dispossessed will have no passion and no will. The\ndepressed will not vote, nor will the downtrodden.\nWe cannot continue to ignore the age-old injustices\nof slavery, of forcing people into labour and of\ndecimating their culture and identity. Many of us here\ntoday are the descendants of the survivors of slavery. As\na part of that recognition, we support the Government\nof Jamaica in calls for the recognition of the impacts\nof the transatlantic slave trade and the need for a frank\ndialogue on the status of people of African descent.\nFurthermore, like Africa, we all need the opportunity\nto trade equally and fairly. We all know that the death\nof the Doha talks was due to the unwillingness of some\nnations to relent on large-scale subsidies on farming\nand agriculture.\nOne of the injustices that is a relic of an era of\nfear and dispute long gone is the embargo imposed\nupon the people of Cuba, purely for purposes of\npolitical retribution and punishment. I must take this\nopportunity to reiterate the conclusion of the Caribbean\nCommunity (CARICOM) as a whole, most recently\nin December 2011, that it is time to end the embargo\nimposed on the Republic of Cuba by the United States.\nSaint Lucia is part of the Group of Latin American\nand Caribbean States and wishes to pursue the fullest\nmeasure of economic integration in the hemisphere,\nas an instrument of our own economic growth and in\norder to maximize economic and social cooperation in\nthe area. Blockades and embargoes, in that context, are\nanachronistic and outmoded. In an era of globalization\nand economic liberalization they cannot be tolerated or\njustified.\nAnother relic of colonialism is that of our Caribbean\nCommunity member, Haiti. The suffering of the people\nof Haiti can only be matched by their perseverance. It is\na country that was tormented into paying compensations\nto its former colonial master. That was an extraordinary\nand crude example of trade loss. Today the world\u2019s first\nblack independent country is the Western hemisphere\u2019s\npoorest nation. It is still very much deserving of the\nsupport of the United Nations in overcoming its recent\npains and indigence brought on by the earthquake of\n12 January 2010. It should not be forgotten. Haiti is a\nmember of the CARICOM family of nations, and so we\npay due respect and regard to those countries in our\nhemisphere that came to the support and assistance of\nHaiti in its hour of need.\n\nWe in the Caribbean continue to experience the\nchallenge of our skilled population seeking to settle in\nregions to the north, where they are generally greeted\nwith open arms. Meanwhile, we also have to contend\nwith the reverse f low of guns which, owing to the\nnarcotics trade, is finding its way into our jurisdictions.\nWe cannot have internal peace in our islands if our\nyoung people are too easily being given guns. We\nraised the matter as one of great concern to our security\nat the Summit of the Americas in Cartagena, Colombia,\nin April this year.\nIt is now clear that the current policies to combat\nthe consumption and trafficking of illicit drugs across\nand within borders have failed, creating yet another\nhuman tragedy of immense consequence. Lives are\nbeing lost either to guns or to the consumption of drugs.\nWe remain resolute in wanting the whole matter of the\ndrug trade to be reviewed. Collectively, we must craft\nnew solutions to this problem. We also wish to place\non record our continued concern about the practice of\ndeporting seasoned criminals back to our small States,\nwithout any regard for the capacity of our internal\nsecurity arrangements.\nIn all this there is a sobering reality for the leader\nof any small State like Saint Lucia. Even as I have the\ndistinction of standing here today, I know that many of\nthe decisions that affect our world and my country are\nstill made in the capitals of other countries, sometimes\nunilaterally and sometimes multilaterally by groups of\n5 or 8 or 20 or 30. It is said that 80 per cent of the\nworld\u2019s trade and economic activity is accounted for by\n20 countries. I can assure everyone that Saint Lucia,\nindeed all of the Caribbean Basin, lies beyond the limits\nof that geopolitical circle. With few or no resources,\ndiplomatic or otherwise, Saint Lucia can only speak\nwith its moral courage, authority and convictions.\nSmall islands are special places with special\npeculiarities that make us both unique and vulnerable.\nStill, we know that, if there is a willingness to support\ntheir growth and development, then small islands\ncan be success stories. Consider for instance that our\n15-member Caribbean Community has a combined\npopulation of 17 million and an economy of about\n$89 billion. The United States territory of Puerto Rico,\nitself part of the greater Caribbean, has a gross domestic\nproduct of about $100 billion. Those numbers clearly\nsuggest that, given support in trade and investment,\nthough we may be small, our economies could grow.\nThey could find sustainability.\n\nThe Caribbean Community has continuously made\nthe point that many small States are deceptively classed\nas middle-income merely on the basis of per capita\nincome. A country the size of Saint Lucia, with the\nvulnerabilities that we face, should not be subjected to\nsuch a measuring tool for determining whether a State\ncan stand on its own.\nFor instance, Saint Lucia experienced a category 2\nhurricane in 2010 that caused damage totalling nearly\n30 per cent of our gross domestic product. As in the\ncase of other small States like ours, we were then\nforced to become even more indebted as we borrowed\nto replace infrastructure, such as arterial roads and\nbridges, without which our country\u2019s economy would\nhave faced further contraction. On top of that, we were\nfurther impacted by unilateral domestic measures\nwhich, showing insensitivity to such matters as our\ndependence on tourism, some major developed States\nimplemented, making us an even less desirable tourist\ndestination.\nOther islands that are highly dependent on\ninternational financial services are now suffering as\na result of the attempts by some States to sully their\nreputations. Though we live in a beautiful part of\nthe world, the reduction of foreign direct investment\nf lows due to the global economic crisis, and the recent\nannouncement by the World Trade Organization that it\nhas cut its forecast for global trade growth from 3.7 per\ncent to 2.5 per cent, can cause the outlook to look grim.\nThis means that development cannot be just about\nassistance and that small States require there to be\nsome fairness and balance in the world economic space.\nFrom the point of view of the developing countries, the\ncollapse of the Doha Round was a disappointing portent\nof the difficult times to come in the discussions between\ndeveloped and developing countries. This trend was\ntypified in our hemisphere by the lack of progress in the\ninitiative for a free trade area of the Americas. At the\nsame time, however, there were increasing indications\nof the emergence of countries in Asia, Africa and the\nFar East as competitors in global economic competition.\nWe look to a future in which the United Nations\nand other global institutions become more targeted and\ndifferentiated in their interventions and policies. We\nlook to a world in which the Millennium Development\nGoals are realized and in which the international\ncommunity crafts a new post-2015 strategy to tackle the major impediments to growth as well as to promote\nthe major creators of wealth and prosperity.\nA major issue is, of course, climate change. As\nexpressed in the Mauritius Strategy for the Further\nImplementation of the Programme of Action for the\nSustainable Development of Small Island Developing\nStates and in the Global Conference on the Sustainable\nDevelopment of Small Island Developing States held in\nBarbados in 1994, small States are committed to seeing\naction taken on climate change and tangible support for\nthe requisite adaptations and interventions needed at all\nlevels.\nWithin the Caribbean Community, the Liliendaal\nDeclaration issued by Heads of Government in 2009\nencapsulated our concerns as small island States subject\nto major dislocation as a consequence of the threat of\nclimate change. It notes that\n\u201c[the region\u2019s] efforts to promote sustainable\ndevelopment and to achieve the internationally\nagreed development goals, including the\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs), are\nunder severe threat from the devastating effects of\nclimate change and sea-level rise.\u201d\nIn particular, it notes the \u201cincreasingly frequent and\nintense extreme weather events\u201d that have resulted\nin severe damage to the region\u2019s resources and\nsocio-economic base, and it emphasizes that\n\u201cdangerous climate change is already occurring in\nall Small Islands and Low-lying Coastal Developing\nStates (SIDS) regions, including the Caribbean, and\nthat many SIDS will cease to exist without urgent,\nambitious and decisive action by the international\ncommunity\u201d.\nSaint Lucia is therefore in full support of the\nconclusions of the United Nations Conference on\nSustainable Development in Brazil on the challenges and\npotential solutions to the climate crisis and interrelated\nfactors, which continue to inhibit the achievement of a\nsustainable world capable of facilitating the activities of\nall countries, large and small. We are comforted by the\nwords of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon that we will\nsecure a legally binding agreement to tackle climate\nchange by 2015. With climate change, we cannot afford\nany unfinished business, for there is but one world. We\nalso hope that there will be a strong commitment to\ntechnology transfer and building local human capacity\nto deal with climate change and attendant disasters.  \n\nSaint Lucia looks forward to the President\u2019s tenure\nin directing the work of the sixty-seventh session of\nthe General Assembly as one in which the upsurge of\nconflicts now characterizing our globe will be subjected\nto meaningful deliberations among our Member States.\nOur concern as small countries is that persistent\nconflicts in respect of issues and problems currently\nplaguing various regions of the globe can serve to\ndistract our United Nations from devoting both attention\nand resources to persisting with solutions to the serious\nproblems of economic transition and adjustment now\ncharacterizing international economic relations in\nparticular. In the cacophony of regional conflicts that\ninevitably draw the attention and involvement of the\nmajor Powers, the problem of the survival of small\ncountries in the environment of larger States has\nbecome more and more intractable.\nWe in Saint Lucia, as members of the Caribbean\nCommunity, look forward to an enhanced cooperation\nwith the countries of a continent in which a large\nproportion of our population finds its ancestry. We\nbelieve that it is possible to pursue this process through\nthe United Nations development institutions in our\nsphere and on the African continent, and we propose\nthat this be done.\nAs is now well known, the traditional economic\nrelations under the auspices of the Commonwealth\nsystem and the African, Pacific and Caribbean\ninstitutional relationships in the context of our trade\nwith Europe are diminishing. We look forward to new\navenues of relationships, a task in which the United\nNations can be of great assistance to us.\nI wish to extend to the President the best wishes\nand support of my country and delegation for success\nin his task over the coming year."

        "file_text": "\ufeffAllow me to congratulate\nthe President on his well-deserved election to the\npresidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-seventh\nsession. My delegation and I would like to assure him\nof Malawi\u2019s full support during his tenure of office.\nIt is an honour to address the Assembly today for the\nfirst time in my capacity as President of the Republic of Malawi. As the Assembly may be aware, I took office\nin April of this year after the death of my predecessor,\nHis Excellency Professor Bingu Wa Mutharika. On\nbehalf of all Malawians, I express our appreciation for\nthe support that the world gave us during that difficult\ntime in our country. I would like to also acknowledge\nin particular the support I received from leaders from\nthe Southern African Development Community and the\nentire African continent when I assumed the presidency.\nThe support that I received is a mark that Africa has\nindeed embraced women\u2019s leadership.\nJoining the world\u2019s leaders here and becoming only\nthe second female Head of State in Africa\u2019s history,\nafter Her Excellency President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf of\nLiberia, is a moment of pride for me. However, mine\nis not the story of the success of an individual, but of\na people. A peaceful and constitutional transition of\npower was not inevitable when my presidency began.\nIt is the courage and determination of the people of\nMalawi that made it possible. The people of Malawi\nhave made a decisive choice. They have chosen\ndemocracy, they have chosen peace and they have\nchosen to work together to realize their destiny. It is my\npeople\u2019s courage and determination that has taken me\nto the presidency, and which we will now apply to our\nnational development.\nThe theme of the general debate this year is \u201cBringing\nabout adjustment or settlement of international disputes\nor situations by peaceful means\u201d. It allows us to reflect\non some of the conflict situations around the world,\nincluding in Africa. Those conflicts have a devastating\neffect on the lives of millions, especially women and\nchildren. The impact of conflict goes beyond the people\ndirectly involved, affecting the region and the world.\nLet me agree with Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon\nwhen he said in his reappointment speech that one of\nthe greatest opportunities we have for a better world\nwithout conflict is through sustainable development.\nThe biggest threats to security and peace are poverty,\nlack of opportunity and lack of hope. It is unacceptable\nto me as the President of Malawi, as it should be to the\nglobal community, that we have children continuing to\nsuffer from malnutrition, or that they yearn to learn but\nhave to sit under trees rather than in proper classrooms.\nIt is unacceptable that a mother should die while giving\nbirth because the nearest health centre is far away, or\nthat thousands die of diseases that we have answers\nfor. It is unacceptable that the youth who represent the\nfuture of our world have few opportunities to realize their potential, or that they are not guaranteed a society\nwhere they can speak their mind. It is unacceptable that\nfarmers and other workers continue to toil to make the\nbest of what they have, but do not enjoy the fruits of\ntheir labour due to lack of modernization, a supportive\npolicy environment and access to markets; and that\nthey are buried under global tariffs and taxes. It is when\nthose frustrations are in place that conflict takes root.\nFor decades, I have fought these issues in Malawi\nas a social justice and human rights activist and\nthrough my work at the gra-ssroots. I have experienced\nthe struggles of the poor and the suffering of Malawian\nwomen. I have championed the advancement of the\noppressed and marginalized, fought for the rights of\nwomen and children, campaigned for the betterment of\nthe rural and urban poor. I can attest to the fact that\nthe experience of a poor and disadvantaged Malawian\nis intimately intertwined with that of Africans, and\nindeed with that of the people of the least developed\ncountries.\nNow, as the President of the Republic of Malawi,\nI have a vision. My vision is to eradicate poverty\nthrough economic growth and wealth creation. Malawi\naims to create wealth by transforming the structure of\nthe economy, promoting the private sector in order to\nachieve economic growth, accelerating job creation\nand protecting the vulnerable and the excluded within a\ndecentralized and democratic environment.\nSpecifically, my vision is to transform Malawi\ninto one of the fastest-growing African economies in\nthe next decade. For me, growth is not merely related\nto gross domestic product. Growth is about wealth and\nprosperity for all, opportunity for all, happiness for all,\npolitical and economic freedom for all. Growth is also\nabout growing the number of children in school and\nyoung people in jobs. Growth is about increasing the\nnumber of mothers who give safe birth in a hospital and\nof growing the number of families who have plenty of\nfood.\nAs the Assembly may be aware, for the past\nthree years Malawi has faced severe economic and\nsocial challenges brought on by poor political and\neconomic governance, which could have impacted our\nability to accelerate the attainment of the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). Therefore, upon assuming\noffice I immediately put in place an economic recovery\nprogramme to restore macroeconomic stability in the\ncountry so that we can not only address our immediate macroeconomic issues, but also secure Malawi\u2019s ability\nto meet the MDG targets.\nI would like to share that we are certain that we will\nbe able to achieve five of the eight MDGs by 2015. And\nwe will continue to strive to achieve our goals of the\nthree remaining MDGs: universal primary education,\npromoting gender equality and empowering women,\nand improving maternal health. Coincidentally, these\nthree MDGs are related to issues that I have worked on\nthroughout my life, and I will personally ensure that\nMalawi redoubles its efforts to make improvements in\nthose areas.\nMy Government realizes that the potential of\nMalawi \u2014 the potential of our land, our resources\nand, most importantly, our people \u2014 is great. But\nthat opportunity will be seized only through our own\nefforts. That is why my vision is not just hopeful words.\nOur willingness to take tough decisions does not end\nhere. Our plans need to be translated into action. To that\nend, within my first 100 days in office, Malawi held an\ninclusive national dialogue on the economy to narrow\ndown five priority sectors within our medium-term\nnational development framework, the Malawi Growth\nand Development Strategy II. The five priorities are\nenergy, tourism, agriculture, mining and infrastructure\ndevelopment.\nCentral to those priorities is our emphasis on\ndelivery through partnership with the private sector.\nWe will facilitate that by making changes aimed\nat improving the business climate. My Cabinet has\nidentified three specific projects within each priority\nsector and translated that into an implementation\nplan for the next two years. The projects range from\nthe completion of essential roads and rail lines, to\nsetting up alternative energy sources and undertaking\nbusiness climate reform to attract investment into\nagro-processing and mining. The projects will set our\ncountry on a path of fulfilling its full potential.\nIn addition, I have also launched two initiatives \u2014 the\nPresidential Initiative on Maternal Health and Safe\nMotherhood, and the Presidential Initiative on Poverty\nand Hunger Reduction \u2014 to fast-track the interventions\nneeded to address the social needs of disadvantaged\ngroups, especially women and youth.\nMalawi refuses to accept what others may consider\nto be our destiny \u2014 the status of underdevelopment.\nMalawi is committed to change that perception. But in\nso doing, my Government and, indeed, the people of Malawi know that we need to engage the rest of the\nglobal community. That is why, within days of taking\noffice, I reopened dialogue and engagement with our\nneighbours, with African leaders and with the rest of the\nworld. The people of Malawi are grateful for the good\nwill that many have shown us, and we are encouraged\nby the support of our partners.\nMalawi will continue to need global support in\nthe short and medium terms. We need this support\nto protect the rural poor from food shortages caused\nby prolonged dry spells in some parts of the country.\nMalawi is looking for partnerships to build its energy\ncapacity. Malawi needs support to attract private\ninvestment for the rich potential we have in agroprocessing\nand mining, among others. We are looking\nfor partnerships to support the development of our\ntransport and communications infrastructure in order\nto improve access to markets.\nBefore I conclude I wish to draw the Assembly\u2019s\nattention to the following three issues that have a\nbearing on most of the least developed countries.\nFirst, I call upon the General Assembly to ensure that\nthe Istanbul Declaration and Programme of Action,\nadopted in Turkey in May 2011, will be implemented\nin their entirety in an effective and timely manner.\nIn particular, duty-free and quota-free market access\nand supply-side capacity must be ensured to the least\ndeveloped countries.\nSecondly, most least developed countries are facing\nthe adverse effects of climate change, which is causing\nf looding, land degradation and drought. In that regard,\nMalawi welcomes the recent outcome of the United\nNations Conference on Sustainable Development held\nin Brazil, where international consensus emerged\nand agreement was reached on important areas of sustainable development. The implementation of these\nagreements is very crucial for our future.\nFinally, on the issue of the reform of the United\nNations, Malawi fully supports the expansion of the\nSecurity Council in both permanent and non-permanent\ncategories. As members of the Assembly are aware,\nAfrica represents one of the single largest regions\nwithin the United Nations, and a very significant\nproportion of issues discussed in the Security Council\nconcern the African continent. It is for those reasons,\ntherefore, that Malawi joins the rest of the African\nnations in demanding at least two seats in the permanent\ncategory and five seats in the non-permanent category,\nas stipulated in the Ezulwini Consensus. Africa has to\nlead its own development, and that will be a step in\nensuring that it can.\nAt this moment, I say to the Assembly that Malawi\nis on a journey \u2013 a journey to change its trajectory; a\njourney to make real change happen; a journey to foster\nprivate-sector growth; a journey to be an integral part\nof the global community. Malawi is ready to take its\nturn to grow, not just in wealth, but in opportunities,\nhopes and freedoms for all of the Malawian people.\nAs a new President and a new member of the global\ncommunity of leaders, I ask for the Assembly\u2019s support\nas this one African country journeys to realize its full\npotential \u2014 for its people, for Africa and for the world."

        "file_text": "\ufeffI am honoured to address\nthe General Assembly at its sixty-seventh session on\nbehalf of Mr. Tillman J. Thomas, Prime Minister of\nGrenada, and the people of Grenada.\nGrenada commends the work of the United Nations\nover the past year, with special commendation for the\nleadership and stewardship of the outgoing President,\nQatari diplomat Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser.\nLooking ahead, we place our confidence in you, Sir,\nand your team, and look forward to your guidance of\nthe work this year under the general theme \u201cBringing\nabout adjustment or settlement of international disputes\nor situations by peaceful means\u201d. We extend Grenada\u2019s\nfull esteem and support to our able Secretary-General,\nMr. Ban Ki-moon, whom we thank for his continued\nleadership and service to Member States.\nGrenada recommits unwaveringly to the principles\nof the United Nations, as embodied in the Charter.\nOur commitment in national and international life\nto the norms of peace, equality and justice, and to\nhuman rights and multilateralism, is clear. Over the\npast year, Grenada ratified and deposited instruments\nof ratification with the United Nations, including for the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court.\nIn ratifying the Rome Statute, Grenada became the\nMember State that brought that Treaty into force. That\nexemplifies our commitment to the principle of the\nrule of law, which resonates with every Grenadian as\na result of our enthusiasm for justice and for ending\nimpunity. Grenada welcomes the Declaration of the\nHigh-level Meeting of the General Assembly on the\nRule of Law at the National and International Levels\n(resolution 67/1) of 24 September, and expects to make\na voluntary pledge.\nOn the domestic front, in April Parliament passed\nthe End Violence against Women Legislative and\nPolicy Reform Bill. Aware that by itself the passage\nof a law is insufficient to change society\u2019s entrenched\ncultural attitudes and practices, we are also embarking\non public education and on strengthening the capacity\nof Government departments, among other things.\nWe will continue on that path to secure the rights of\npeople, for we are convinced that law and security are\nthe sine qua non for the facilitation of the peaceful\nsettlement of disputes, which is itself the foundation\nfor an international environment of peace. Indeed,\ndemocracy, good governance, social inclusion, conflict\nresolution, development and sustained overall progress\nare all helped by the rule of law within our countries\nand in the international system.\nGrenada is a small island developing State. Nature\nhas been especially generous to us, and our people\nare extraordinarily hard-working and big-spirited. Yet\nthe fruits of nature and of our own efforts have been\nundermined by Hurricane Ivan in 2004, Hurricane Emily in 2005 and the advent in 2008 of the global\nfinancial and economic crisis. That notwithstanding,\nwe remain confident that a pathway to success exists\nfor us, based on our own efforts and the support of the\ninternational community and this great Organization.\nFrom Grenada\u2019s perspective, the highlight of the\npast year has been the renewed international political\ncommitment to sustainable development; indeed,\ninterest continues to grow and to gain momentum.\nSustainable development is one of our declared priorities\nin Grenada. It is a priority this year since the Secretary-\nGeneral announced that sustainable development would\nbe the number one item on his agenda during his second\nterm, and you, too, Sir, declared it a priority.\nIn June, more than 120 heads of State and\nGovernment endorsed the paradigm of sustainable\ndevelopment in Rio, and the outcome document,\nentitled \u201cThe future we want\u201d, declares: \u201cWe resolve to\ntake urgent action to achieve sustainable development\u201d\n(resolution 66/288, annex, para. 12). Leaders agreed to\narticulate policies and programmes that would promote\nsocially inclusive behaviour to quickly and equitably\nbring about prosperity and to do so in a manner that\nwould instil hope and create livelihood opportunities\nfor those yet to come.\nBecause of our tremendous green and blue\nendowments and the fact that our people live\nintelligently with them, Grenada has long considered\nitself an island of sustainability. That describes a\nholistic policy framework that defines our consumption\nand production path as spelt out in our five strategic\ndevelopment pillars: energy development; education,\nhealth and wellness; information and communications\ntechnology; tourism and hospitality; and agribusiness.\nGrenada is committed, then, to a path of\nsustainability. Its determined efforts are led by our\nenergy policy aimed at reducing fossil-fuel usage by\n20 per cent by the year 2020 and at being completely\ncarbon-neutral by 2030. The manufacturing sector is\nrapidly emerging as a producer of indigenous green and\norganic products, and the hotel sector is going green.\nIt should be recalled that Grenada is building itself\nback from the World Bank-determined loss of 204 per\ncent of its gross domestic product as a result of the\nhurricane destruction we experienced in 2004 and 2005.\nWe have made great strides with recovery due to the\ngenerosity of our neighbours and friends everywhere,\nfor which we remain forever indebted and grateful.\nSince 2008, our situation has been compounded\nby the weight of the global financial and economic\ndownturn, which is dwarfing development efforts\ndue to loss of tourism and port receipts and even\nof remittances. However, we recognize with deep\nappreciation that, as our economy has slowed in direct\nresponse to the global economic crisis, our neighbours\nare again coming to our assistance.\nGrenada is defined as a middle-income country,\nand yet its stability and growth are challenged by\nserious socioeconomic predicaments. We are facing\nthe high cost of fuel and food, costs associated with\nconfronting the illicit trafficking in drugs and small\narms and light weapons and related crime, and an\nincrease in unemployment and poverty.\nWhat is consistent in that context is that, like so\nmany of the Caribbean and small island developing\ncountries, Grenada contributes least to the financial\nand economic crisis, greenhouse-gas emissions and\nthe production of arms and illicit drugs, and yet those\nscourges have a disproportionate impact on us as\ncompared to the countries that produce them, and of\ncourse our ability to respond effectively is far inferior.\nSo what, then, is the way forward? The way\nforward lies primarily in improvement of the domestic\nenvironment. We continue to achieve this through laws,\neconomic and social policies and our national spirit of\nperseverance. Among our many initiatives, in January\n2013, for example, Grenada will be co-hosting a meeting\nin the Caribbean with business innovator Sir Richard\nBranson on ensuring the sustainable management of\nour marine and coastal resources.\nYet small island developing States need a far more\nsupportive international policy climate and affordable\nfinancing for a safe and secure way forward into\ngreater sustainability. That will be the way we hold on\nto the hard-earned progress made so far with respect\nto the Millennium Development Goals and how we\nwill be able to expand it. We hope then to be guided\nby the sustainable development goals and the post-\n2015 development framework to further support our\nambitious economic and social transformation agenda.\nWe continue to believe that peace and security and\na reduction in military spending in the international\ncommunity will be good for a global economic\nrecovery, which in turn will be good for the financing\nof sustainable development. Unless there is recovery in\nthe large economies to which our own economic life remains tied, we will see no sustained recovery. We\ntherefore call for commitments made to developing\ncountries to be met, and we remain willing partners in\nSouth-South cooperation.\nThe staggering loss of life in Syria must be\nbrought to an end by all those responsible. We call for\na politically negotiated and urgent settlement, and we\nreiterate Grenada\u2019s support for the diplomacy work\nbeing carried out, inter alia, by the United Nations and\nthe Arab League. We call for policies of inclusion and\nopenness that will accommodate all just aspirations of\nall members of society in the Middle East and elsewhere.\nWe reiterate our call for a State for the Palestinian\npeople in a negotiated two-State agreement with Israel\nthrough a peace plan. The injustices meted out to the\nPalestinians, including widespread unemployment,\npoverty and displacement, must end now. The\nPalestinian people, led by their Government, the\nPalestinian Authority, have our strong support for their\njust aspirations. We are convinced that the two nations\ncan coexist side by side in peace and harmony, like so\nmany other countries.\nGrenada takes this opportunity to extend once\nagain its heartfelt condolences to the Government\nand people of the United States of America and to the\nbereaved families of Ambassador Chris Stevens and\nhis colleagues. We deplore those senseless acts and\ncontinue to call for the improvement of the protection\nof all diplomats serving abroad.\nGrenada calls for the cessation of the trafficking\nof weapons through our Caribbean region and for a\nfirm and comprehensive, yet expeditious, agreement on\nsmall arms and light weapons. We also renew our call\nfor the preservation of the Caribbean Sea as a zone of\npeace and development and for the bringing of an end\nto the passage of nuclear waste in our waters.\nGrenada looks forward to the third Global\nConference on the Sustainable Development of Small\nIsland States in 2014, and we call on the international\ncommunity to lend its fullest and broadest support\nto that Conference. We further call on the General\nAssembly to designate 2014 as the International Year of\nSmall Island Developing States so as to raise awareness\nof the special situation of small island developing\nStates (SIDS) and to mobilize international support\nfor their sustainable development. Support for SIDS\nfrom China in energy efficiency and from Norway in renewable energy is already forthcoming, as is support\nfrom Australia.\nWithout a legally binding climate regime to uphold\nenvironmental integrity, Caribbean and other small\nisland States would lose the opportunity for achieving\nsustainability soon, and some could even disappear. We\ntherefore see the upcoming eighteenth Conference of the\nParties to the United Nations Framework Convention\non Climate Change in Doha, Qatar, as an opportunity\nto move decisively away from that scenario, and we\nwelcome the commitment of the European Union to\nagreeing to an ambitious second commitment period\nof the Kyoto Protocol and to climate financing. We\ncall on other developed countries to do likewise, and\non the Secretary-General to encourage States parties\nto move steadfastly towards finalizing a new binding\nclimate treaty by 2015 and a gap-free period of climate\nfinancing starting in January 2013.\nIf the United Nations is to continue to lead the way in\nsustainability, peace and security, it must be reformed.\nThe centrepiece of that change must be reform of the\nSecurity Council, particularly so as to include a seat\nfor small island developing States. Only a revitalized\nUnited Nations can continue to play its historic\nrole in guiding the world, its international financial\ninstitutions included, through the geopolitical volatility\nthat is destabilizing the global economic and financial\norder. Reorganization should not mean, however,\nthe loss of vital country programmes, especially for\nsmall countries. The United Nations must continue its\nirreplaceable work on behalf of women, and Grenada\nis pleased to serve on the board of UN-Women and to\ncontribute to its endeavours.\nRevitalization and reform must also take place in\nthe Caribbean. To that end, we call for the complete\nremoval of the economic, commercial and financial\nblockade of our sister Caribbean State of Cuba. The\nUnited States embargo against Cuba, now almost\n50 years old, is in complete contradiction to the spirit\nof the United Nations Charter. Removal of the embargo\nhas been specifically called for by the leaders of the\nCaribbean Community as well as by an overwhelming\nmajority of States Members of the United Nations. Cuba\nplays a significant humanitarian and development role\nin the Caribbean and its economic liberation from the\nembargo will allow it to contribute even more through\nthe dynamic of growing South-South cooperation.\nFurthermore, Cuba is now playing a facilitating and\nmediating role in one of the hemisphere\u2019s longest political crises and thus making a major contribution\nto peace and security in the Latin American and\nCaribbean region.\nTwo years after the unfathomable national disaster\nin our sister nation of Haiti in 2010, thousands of\nHaitians are nonetheless still homeless and suffering,\nas their Government remains without sufficient means\nto complete national rebuilding. Grenada extends its\nthanks, first and foremost, to all who have pledged and\nrealized those pledges for the benefit of the Haitian\npeople, for we are but one in the Caribbean. Grenada\nremains steadfast in its commitment to this imperative,\nand we renew our appeal to the international community\nto fulfil all its commitments and, where possible, to\nincrease its contributions to the humanitarian and\ndevelopment needs of Haiti.\nJust some 100 days ago in the city of Rio de Janeiro,\nour Prime Minister, Mr. Tillman Thomas, said:\n\u201cThe United Nations is indispensable to the\nfuture we need. Grenada considers the United\nNations to be best placed for decision-making\naffecting the international body politic. Indeed,\nthe United Nations has the full legitimacy needed\nto command authority [and] secure consensus and\nthe necessary trust among all global stakeholders.\nWe recommit to the United Nations and support its\nreforms.\u201d\nTo conclude, on 6 August, Grenada made history,\nwinning its first Olympic medal, a gold in the men\u2019s\n400-metre race, thus becoming, according to one\ncalculation, the country with the highest medal per\ncapita ratio in the world. Our people have not yet\nceased to celebrate winning gold. Another enduring\nact celebrated around the world, however, was the\ngraciousness demonstrated by the eventual winner,\nKirani James, when he embraced and exchanged bibs\nwith his co-competitor Oscar Pistorius, the outstanding\ndouble amputee from South Africa, who despite\nrunning an extraordinarily good race came in second\nbehind the soon-to-be Olympic gold medallist. It was\na simple Grenadian gesture of admiration, friendship\nand solidarity, but one that underscores that the human\nspirit must prevail in relations among individuals and,\nwe dare say, among nations. That one simple act of\nrecognition of the right and, far more important, the\nnobility of another human being transformed two\nrunners into two brothers, one South African, one\nGrenadian, one shared humanity. We name that the Kirani spirit, and we charge\nthis institution with the Kirani spirit \u2014 \u201ccharge\u201d as\nin giving it energy; charge as in commanding to do\nlikewise; charge as in holding the collective responsible\nfor our humanity; charge as in charging each nation and\neach people with their own big-spiritedness."

        "file_text": "\ufeffThe\ncurrent session of the General Assembly gives us a\ncomplete picture of today\u2019s world with all its challenges\nand opportunities. We can also glimpse various paths\nopening up before us to help us meet the needs of\nhumankind and of nations.\nI would like to focus on the three main areas of\nactivity of the United Nations \u2014 peace and security;\ndevelopment; and human rights, democracy and the rule\nof law. In our approach we believe that the realities of the\nlast decade have confirmed the profound and complex\ninterdependence that exists between these areas. There\nis no peace and security without development and\nrespect for human rights and democracy. Development\nis a catalyst for democracy and respect for human rights,\nand, at the same time, an essential factor for peace\nand security. In their turn, respect for human rights,\ndemocracy and the rule of law strengthen development\nand create the conditions for lasting peace and security.\n\nNew situations of internal instability, civil strife\nand insecurity, with spillover effects, have arisen in the\nMiddle East and other regions. It is regrettable that the\nnew session of the Assembly is beginning in the shadow\nof the sorrow over the recent events in Benghazi.\nAttacks on diplomatic representatives are unacceptable\nfor any reason. Diplomats are bridges between cultures,\nlinks among nations. Their inviolability is part of\nancient custom. I strongly condemn the attacks and\noffer my sincere condolences to the families of the\nvictims. The perpetrators must be brought to justice\nthrough a fair and equitable trial. At the same time, the\nideals of democracy must be preserved. Stability and\nthe rule of law should be the future pillars of society\nin Libya and elsewhere. We are firmly committed to\nsupporting the efforts of the international community\nto consolidate stability and security, tolerance and\nreligious understanding.\nThroughout 2012 we have been confronted with the\ndire effects of the crisis in Syria, where human rights\nviolations are now rampant. The Syrian Government must comply with its international commitments and\nobligations relating to human rights. Justice must be\ndone in all cases of violations of human rights and all\nthose who are guilty must be permitted a fair trial,\neven if it was not something they allowed their victims.\nRomania has stated throughout that it is imperative\nthat the international community curb the escalating\nviolence in Syria; and of course we favour a political\nsolution.\nIn that regard, I would like to voice our firm support\nfor the mission of Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi in his new\ncapacity as Special Representative of the United Nations\nand the League of Arab States for Syria. We were also\na wholehearted supporter of the full implementation\nof the Joint Special Envoy\u2019s six-point plan for Syria\nand, similarly, gave full and direct support to the\nactivitiees of the United Nations Supervision Mission\nin the Syrian Arab Republic. In that context, I would\nlike to remind the Assembly that Romanian monitors\nwere part of its structure. I strongly believe that the\nonly future for Syria must be an inclusive one for all\nSyrians, irrespective of religion or ethnic group. Any\nother option would be nothing less than a nightmare.\nThe time has come for a more structured response\non the part of the United Nations, based on a consensus\napproach by the Security Council. Obviously, we\ncannot and should not allow violence to prevail when\npeople in Syria rely on our capacity to offer stability\nand predictability and when regional stability and\nsecurity are at stake.\nRecent developments in the area of peace and\nsecurity, at both the global and regional levels, do\nnot offer many reasons for optimism. The year 2012\nhas seen limited progress with the Middle East peace\nprocess. The expectations raised by the statement of the\nQuartet for the Middle East on 23 September 2011 will\nremain unfulfilled as long as direct Israeli-Palestinian\nnegotiations are not resumed.\nRomania is a strong supporter of all efforts to\nachieve a comprehensive peace in the Middle East.\nWe support all the initiatives of the Quartet and the\nfull implementation of the road map\u2019s vision of two\nStates, Israeli and Palestinian, living side by side in\npeace and security. We are also concerned about the\nlack of progress in finding negotiated solutions to\nprotracted conflicts in the Black Sea region, such as\nthose in Transnistria and Nagorno Karabakh and that\nin Georgia involving Abkhazia and South Ossetia. We must all keep our attention focused on these unsettled\nsituations. Meanwhile, we express our satisfaction\nwith the efforts carried out over the past 12 months by\nthe special representatives of the United Nations, the\nEuropean Union and the Organization for Security and\nCooperation in Europe.\nOver the past year, the Security Council reacted\npromptly to new crises by adopting resolutions aimed\nat preventing the escalation of conflict or calling for the\nre-establishment of constitutional order or for efforts by\nall the parties involved to find negotiated solutions to\nnew problems. The resolutions adopted have not always\nmet expectations. In spite of the fact that the mandates\nof several United Nations peacekeeping missions were\nextended, little progress was made.\nUnder the auspices of the United Nations, through\na joint innovative and intellectual effort, the conceptual\napproach has been enlarged to include human security,\nthe responsibility to protect, and mediation. There\nis still a long way to go before those concepts are\noperational. When the time comes, Romania stands\nready to implement them.\nNew categories of participants must be included\nin our common endeavour. Beside Governments,\nnon-governmental organizations, civil society,\nparliaments and local communities are already acting\nto identify optimal solutions. Based on my previous\nexperience as Chairman of the Foreign Affairs\nCommittee of the Senate, I consider that the role of\nparliaments as elected bodies could be increased in\nprevention activities or in efforts to settle existing\nconflicts. In that respect, cooperation and interaction\nbetween the United Nations, national parliaments and\nthe Inter-Parliamentary Union in peacebuilding efforts\nis highly relevant.\nOver the past 15 years, my country has taken a\nkeen interest in, and offered important contributions\nto, civilian and military missions under United Nations\nmandates. Today Romania is honoured and proud to\nhave contributed in a consistent way to various United\nNations operations. I pay my deepest respect to the men\nand women of Romania who have lost or risked their\nlives in conflict areas, as well as to all the military,\npolice, gendarmes and civilian personnel serving all\nover the world to bring peace and security under the\nf lag of the United Nations.\nAs I have already mentioned, development is\nequally a major area of interest, action and cooperation within the United Nations. One area where we could\nfind solutions within the United Nations framework is\nimproving the functioning of the banking and financial\nsystems and institutions. National and international\nbanking and financial institutions should become\never greater partners for Governments \u2014 a part of the\nsolution to the economic crises confronting countries\nand regions.\nYoung people are the future of our nations and of\nour world. The United Nations has, in the past, takem\nup the problems facing younger generations, including\nthrough programmes of action adopted by the General\nAssembly. The time has come to revisit this area of\ninterest to assess the achievements as well as the steps\nto be taken in order to meet the current expectations\nand needs of youth.\nWe should reconsider from a broader perspective the\nvital role of the education sector in providing support,\nespecially but not exclusively, to young people. Such\nsupport should include universal access for younger\ngenerations to education; professional training allowing\nrapid and efficient integration into the labour market;\nand participation in, and contribution to, the shaping of\nfuture societies in all the countries, especially in those\nin transition.\nFor many years now, water has been a major concern\nas climate change affects its availability in all regions.\nWater, our planet\u2019s most precious resource, must not be\nallowed to become our most disputed resource and a\nsource of bitter conflict.\nOur attention should be focused on the follow-up to\nand implementation of the decisions recently adopted\nby the United Nations Conference on Sustainable\nDevelopment. Relevant resolutions on enhancement\nof the institutional framework for sustainable\ndevelopment, agreement on sustainable development\ngoals, and determination of certain financial aspects of\nthe achievement of those goals are expected by all of us.\n\nI should like to share some thoughts relating to the\narea of human rights, which is of growing relevance\nfor our cooperation in the framework of the United\nNations. International cooperation and discussions\npromoting human rights received renewed momentum\nwith the establishment of the Human Rights Council.\nAs an elected member of the Council since it began\nits work, Romania has contributed to the development and adoption of its working methods, based on a more\nanalytical approach as well as on in-depth cooperation\nand interactive dialogue with Member States. The\nmain objective of the Romanian presidency of the\nHuman Rights Council in 2007 was to strengthen\nand more actively promote human rights at the global\nlevel. We believe that the universal periodic review\nis an appropriate instrument for implementing the\ninternational protection of human rights in all its\naspects. It can also respond to new human rights\nchallenges, such as those posed by the Internet.\nThis spring in Geneva, Romania, together with\nMorocco, Norway, Peru, Qatar and Tunisia, promoted a\ndraft resolution entitled \u201cHuman rights, democracy and\nthe rule of law\u201d, which was sponsored by 124 countries\nfrom all regional groups. The broad support for the\nresolution, and the large number of Member States\nthat supported its adoption by the Council, confirms\nthe interest of Member States in this subject. We saw\na broad recognition of the close interlinkage of human\nrights, democracy and the rule of law. We would like to\nsee in the near future the same approach taken by the\nGeneral Assembly in the form of a similar resolution.\nIn that respect, Romania is ready to set to work and to\nact together with other interested Member States.\nIn conclusion, I would like to reaffirm my country\u2019s\ncommitment to the principles and values promoted\nand constantly enhanced by the United Nations. We\nrecognize that there is no alternative to the framework\nof cooperation offered by the United Nations system,\nwhich aims to resolve the complex and interrelated\nproblems of our day. Reforming and adapting the\nsystem to the new realities of the world depends entirely\nupon us as Member States. It depends on our political\nwill as political leaders. By doing so, we will meet the\nexpectations of our peoples."

        "file_text": "\ufeffFirst of all, on behalf of the Government of Sao Tome\nand Principe, and in my own name, I would like to\ncongratulate Vuk Jeremi\u0107 on his election as President\nof the General Assembly at its sixty-seventh session.\nI am convinced that his experience as Minister for\nForeign Affairs of the Republic of Serbia will be a most\npositive contribution to strengthening the affirmation\nof the principles of the United Nations Charter for\nworld security and peace, and I trust that he will lead\nthe work of this session with clarity and balance.\nThe Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe\nalso wishes to express its great appreciation for the\nwork of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and for his\nrole in expanding our Organization and encouraging\nit to continue its efforts to achieve the objectives of\nworld peace and security. I would also like to take this opportunity to thank Ambassador Nassir Abdulaziz\nAl-Nasser for his highly positive contribution during\nthe sixty-sixth session.\nAs it did during the debates of the sixty-sixth\nsession of the General Assembly, the Democratic\nRepublic of Sao Tome and Principe reiterates its\nhope that the United Nations will play a key role in\nmediating international conflicts. Unfortunately, today\nwe continue to look on with concern as conflicts that\ncould jeopardize international peace and security\npersist and further exacerbate the deep economic and\nfinancial crisis that is devastating the world. Sadly,\nour Organization continues to suffer from roadblocks\nthat prevent urgent decisions from being taken and\nthat undermine this forum\u2019s credibility. That inaction\ntranslates into impunity for leaders who martyrize their\nown peoples, paving the way for more international\ndisorder, despair and the sentiment of injustice that is\nexperienced when peoples receive unequal treatment.\nWe need no further evidence of the urgency for\nin-depth reforms of our Organization, primarily the\nSecurity Council, than our inability to put an end to\nthe horrific images of children, symbols of purity and\ninnocence, who are killed daily in Syria, to prevent the\ndestruction of the world\u2019s historic and cultural heritage,\nas by gangs of destructive criminals in Mali and in\nAfghanistan, and to forestall coups d\u2019\u00e9tat or obvious\nattempts to destabilize States and democratically elected\nGovernments that in fact solve nothing and irreparably\ndelay the lengthy process of building democracy and\nfighting poverty.\nWe must prevent the disintegration of territories\nand remedy the abnormal and degrading situations\nof peoples who have already suffered from the\npoverty and exclusion created by a lack of democratic\nleadership or of effective and democratic rule of law.\nIn the specific case of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau,\nwith which Sao Tome and Principe maintains deeply\nrooted historic, cultural and linguistic links, the\ninternational community should bring both firmness\nand persistence to bear in finding a credible, inclusive\nand lasting solution that will ensure that coups d\u2019\u00e9tat\ndo not recur in that country. To do so necessarily\nrequires a reform of the armed forces as well as a\nstrong warning to the political class as a whole to make\na steadfast commitment to respect political dialogue\nand democratic legality. On our side, we will continue\nto make efforts, in cooperation with the Community\nof Portuguese-speaking Countries and other engaged\nregional and international organizations, to guarantee a\nbetter future for the people of Guinea-Bissau.\nRegarding the occupation of the north of the\nRepublic of Mali by groups of terrorists and the persistent\nconflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Sao\nTome and Pr\u00edncipe acknowledges and applauds the\nefforts the international community has made through\nthe United Nations and the African Union to establish\npeace, security and stability. However, it seems that it is\nbecoming increasingly essential for us to ask the States\nthat share borders with those two African countries to\nestablish more effective, intelligent and effective ways\nto cooperate, based on trust and on a matrix of mutually\nbeneficial and realistic economic interests.\nIt is common knowledge that the forces of\ndestabilization, despair and terror are fuelled and\nfurthered by differences and distrust between\nStates, which in turn paralyses the international\ndecision-making process. However, we must point out\npositive signs in the trends of a few conflicts on the\nAfrican continent, such as the cases of the Republics of\nthe Sudan, South Sudan and Somalia. Consequently, we\ncannot fail to applaud the recent agreement signed by the\nRepublic of the Sudan and South Sudan. Through that\nframework, the two countries will be able to live in peace\nand harmony. We also welcome the positive role of the\nAfrican Union Mission in Somalia, which paves the way\nto returning the political, economic and social situation\nof that country and the region to normalcy. Moreover,\nin our opinion, the important recommendations of the\nSecretary-General\u2019s report on the situation concerning\nthe Western Sahara (S/2012/197) are a positive asset for\na permanent resolution.\nThe social movements that took place in North\nAfrica in 2011, which had the merit of reinstating\nthe right to freedom and democracy for the different\npeoples, were popular movements that in many cases\nwere mobilized through social networking and modern\ninstruments of technical communication. Various\nsituations of insecurity and reprehensible acts, as well\nas the acts recently committed in Benghazi of which\nAmerican diplomats were the victims, raise the issue of\nhow we may live in this new context of the circulation\nand dissemination of images and information at the\nglobal level, in a world that we want to be free, open\nand tolerant, but in which large segments of the world\npopulation still live in a state of extreme poverty, with\nno access to education and with the growing conviction\nthat they face exclusion and discrimination.\n\nHow do we deal with the offences committed\nby people, including even some persons with public\npolitical responsibilities such as State leaders, who\nfail to recognize the right of other peoples and States\nto exist? In that regard, we would like to take the\nopportunity that this platform affords us to express\nto the mourning families of diplomats, journalists,\nmembers of non-governmental organization and\npeacekeepers our sincere and deep condolences as well\nas our unfailing solidarity. Our ongoing obligation to\nwork to build a better world and to invest in education\nand the promotion of human and democratic values is\nfundamental, beginning with Member States complying\nwith all United Nations resolutions.\nThe massacres in Syria must cease, the integrity\nand security of the State of Israel must be effectively\nguaranteed, the Palestinian people must have their\nown State, the embargo against Cuba must end,\ncountries, including Iran, must have the right to civil\nnuclear technology and must scrupulously observe the\ncommitments that that entails, and polluters must be\nthe principal payers. It must be our ambition, and not\na mere hope, to ensure that we return here next year\nwith an agenda that includes fewer of these troublesome\nissues, many of which are recurring.\nWe are pleased to note a few positive signs in the\ndialogue between the Republic of China on Taiwan\nand the People\u2019s Republic of China on the one hand,\nand, on the other, the willingness of the United States\nCongress and the European Parliament to admit Taiwan\nas a member of international organizations. Sao Tome\nand Principe supports initiatives such as these, which\nwill make it possible for the people of Taiwan to make a\nsignificant contribution to international issues without\nignoring the necessity for the two parties in the Straits\nof Formosa to work peacefully to agree to frame and\nnormalize their relations.\nThe High-level Meeting that preceded the general\ndebate was an excellent opportunity for Member States\nto share information on how democratic reforms are\nbeing implemented and the rule of law strengthened\nboth in individual countries and at the international\nlevel. It is very pleasing that this discussion is leading\nto significant progress in implementing the democratic\nand institutional reforms that can help to strengthen the\nrule of law, internally and internationally. In that regard,\nSao Tome and Principe congratulates the Republic\nof Angola on its recent successful and transparent\ngeneral elections, since they also constitute another\nstep towards strengthening the democratic process in\nits sister country of Sao Tome and Principe.\nThreats to our global security, particularly\ntransnational crimes such as piracy and the trafficking\nand sale of arms and drugs, are a matter of great concern\nfor Sao Tome and Principe, a country with a long\ncoastline located in the Gulf of Guinea. Such events\nare threats that we cannot ignore; they demand that we\ncooperate as closely as possible both with the States\nwe share the coastline with and the other partners and\norganizations that have experience in dealing with such\nissues, and adopt mechanisms \u2014 which we resolve to\nstrengthen \u2014 for preventing, managing and resolving\nconflicts caused by organized crime in order to improve\nour collective security.\nIn that context, we applaud the important resolutions\n2018 (2011) and 2039 (2012) adopted by the Security\nCouncil on maritime safety and security in the Gulf\nof Guinea. As part of the Gulf of Guinea region, we\nrepeat our firm pledge to do everything we can, jointly\nwith our partners, to prevent that region, rich as it is in\nraw materials of strategic importance to industrialized\neconomies, from becoming a stage for maritime piracy\nand other scourges that hinder economic trade, peace\nand security in the region. To that end, we reiterate that\nwe are absolutely ready and willing to help implement\ninitiatives to hold an international summit on maritime\npiracy in the Gulf of Guinea.\nThe substantial transformations that have occurred\nin the international political arena as a result of the grave\nglobal financial crisis have forced the citizens of small\nStates, and of Sao Tome and Principe in particular, to\nmake major sacrifices. In that regard, Sao Tome and\nPrincipe believes that the continuing international\nand economic financial crisis and its effects on the\neconomies of small countries, which have included\nreductions and slowdowns in official international aid,\ntend to threaten social cohesion as well as previous\nimprovements in fiscal discipline, the business climate\nand political stability itself. The acceptability of\ncontrolling and reducing public deficits in developing\ncountries such as ours is reaching its limits where\nour citizens are concerned, and good governance now\ndemands measures that can effectively jump-start our\neconomies through productive investments.\nWe believe that the most vulnerable populations,\nin both the northern and southern hemispheres of our\nplanet, are demanding changes in the practices and rules of the international financial system, and new\nworld financial governance that is better able to hold\naccountable the financial stakeholders and speculators\nwho undermine the efforts of Governments and their\npeoples to develop economies that bring progress.\nInternally, the Government of the Democratic\nRepublic of Sao Tome and Principe is making efforts\nto reduce poverty and increase transparency in public\nmanagement and economic growth. Institutional\nreforms in the areas of public finance, justice and\nnational defence, whose purpose is to strengthen the\ncapacities of our democratic institutions and develop\nthe country, have been progressing at a good pace.\nRegarding the Millennium Development Goals, for\nwhich the United Nations has set a deadline of 2015,\nthe Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe can\nreport significant progress, particularly in the areas\nof education, with a literacy rate of 92 per cent of the\npopulation, and health, especially in the fight against\nmalaria. However, we realize that meeting the deadline\nwill require further effort.\nTo achieve those goals, our country hopes to\ncontinue to receive support in many forms from the\ninternational community. In that regard, I would like\nto take this opportunity to extend the sincere thanks of\nthe Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe to\nthe entire international community, and in particular\nUNESCO and all of its member States, for designating\nthe island of Principe a UNESCO World Biosphere\nReserve, thus recognizing and providing further\nincentives for our efforts to defend and preserve the\nenvironment.\nI would like to conclude by repeating that the\nGovernment of Sao Tome and Principe, which I have\nthe honour of representing, stands ready and willing to\ntake part in efforts to mobilize the will and synergy\nneeded to achieve the honourable goals that guided the\ncreation of the United Nations."

        "file_text": "\ufeffOn behalf of\nUkraine, I sincerely congratulate Mr. Vuk Jeremi\u0107 on\nhis election as President of the General Assembly at its\nsixty-seventh session. I wish him every success in the\npost and hope that all his actions bear fruit.\nThe theme of this year\u2019s debate, \u201cBringing about\nadjustment or settlement of international disputes or\nsituations by peaceful means\u201d, is always a pressing\none. That imperative was enshrined in the Charter of\nthe United Nations by its founding members, including\nUkraine. I am convinced that the fundamental principle\nof the peaceful settlement of disputes remains today\nthe cornerstone of the modern system of international\nrelations. It is the underlying mission of our Organization\nand the immediate duty of every Member State.\nToday, we are closely watching the situation in\nSyria, which remains extremely alarming. Ukraine\nshares the deep concern of the international community\nregarding the escalation of violence in that country. We\ncall on all relevant parties to make every effort to settle\nthe conflict on the basis of respect for the principles of\nthe Charter of the United Nations and the universally\nrecognized principles of international law.\nThe people of Ukraine have never been and will\nnever be indifferent to human suffering. We make no\ndistinction between our grief and that of others. Last\nyear, thanks to Ukraine\u2019s humanitarian mission to\nLibya, people of many nationalities, mostly women and\nchildren, were evacuated and saved from hostilities. In\nreferring to that case, we are speaking not just about\none action but about Ukraine\u2019s resolute intention to use\nits capabilities to protect civilian populations in hot\nspots.\n\nThat is why this year, when the situation in Syria\ndeteriorated, we immediately evacuated the first group\nof Ukrainian and Polish citizens who had stated their\nintention to return home. Let me assure the Assembly\nthat any Ukrainian aircraft and ships available for\nevacuation purposes in hot spots will always be at\nthe disposal of those in need of help, regardless of\ntheir nationality. Ukraine has approved a decision to\nextend humanitarian assistance using United Nations\nmechanisms to Syria\u2019s internally displaced persons and\nrefugees. I am confident that through the joint efforts of\nthe international community we will manage to ensure\nthe safety of the civilian population in Syria. I believe\nin international solidarity in that regard.\nRecently, on 11 September, we witnessed the\ntragic attack on the United States consulate in Libya.\nUkraine roundly condemns any act of violence against\ndiplomatic missions and their personnel.\nFor many years, Ukraine has actively supported\nthe expansion of preventive diplomacy in international\nrelations, with, of course, the leading role played by\nthe United Nations. Guided by that approach, Ukraine\ninitiated a dialogue in the Human Rights Council on the\nprevention of human rights violations, in particular by\ninitiating a relevant thematic resolution.\nMr. Kanda (Ghana), Vice-President, took the Chair.\nEnsuring early conflict prevention was among\nthe key elements stressed by Ukraine during its first\nmembership in the Security Council as an independent\nState, in 2000-2001. We also are conducting relevant\nwork in the Peacebuilding Commission. The same goal\nfeatures among the priorities of Ukraine\u2019s chairmanship\nof the Organization for Security and Cooperation in\nEurope (OSCE) in 2013.\nWe intend, during our OSCE chairmanship, to\nmake every effort to strengthen security in our region\nand to consolidate the democratic institutions of\nMember States. We will also promote the enhancement\nof the OSCE\u2019s efficiency as a regional organization,\nin accordance with Chapter VIII of the Charter of the\nUnited Nations. We will also underscore the need for\nnew impetus to be given to the resolution of protracted\nconflicts in Europe and to address new threats and\nchallenges to security, in particular energy security.\nWe will strive to increase OSCE efficiency in early\nconflict prevention. The Ukrainian chairmanship will\nactively contribute to the deepening of international  cooperation and dialogue so as to maintain stability,\nresolve crisis situations and ensure post-conflict\nreconstruction. We will devote special attention to\nnegotiations on the Transdniestria conflict; Ukraine\nhas for many years actively participated in efforts to\nsettle that conflict.\nWe will promote in every possible way the Nagorno\nKarabakh settlement process, as well as the Geneva\ndiscussions on security and stability in the Caucasus.\nI would like to stress that Ukraine, as a non-bloc\nState, cannot but be concerned with the erosion of\nthe Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe.\nWe consider that international legal document to be\na cornerstone of stability on the continent and that\ntherefore States parties should make every effort to\nensure its fully fledged and efficient application.\nUkraine, in the framework of its OSCE\nchairmanship, will therefore pay special attention to\nthe resolution of the crisis surrounding that Treaty.\nPeaceful settlement and conflict prevention will be the\nfoundation and the starting point of Ukraine\u2019s activities\nif it is elected to non-permanent membership in the\nSecurity Council for 2016-2017.\nAt the beginning of this year, Secretary-General\nBan Ki-moon made public a five-year Action Agenda\nfor the Organization. We fully support the priorities\nidentified in the agenda and consider them a road map\nfor United Nations activities in the near future.\nWe are currently going through a period of\nunprecedented change. Unfortunately, and especially\nin view of the world crisis, there are global tendencies\ntowards the stagnation of economic development,\ngrowing poverty and social inequality, and increasing\ninstability in certain States and regions.\nIt stands to reason that the only way to effectively\ncounteract those threats is for the international\ncommunity to deploy joint efforts. In that regard, we\ndeem it especially advisable to increase the efficiency\nof international cooperation among security and law-\nenforcement agencies, develop best practices for\naddressing new challenges and threats, and introduce\nreliable confidence-building measures.\nIt should be noted that this year\u2019s United Nations\nConference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20) left\nopen a number of issues, given the close interconnection\nof the environmental and socioeconomic aspects of\nmodern life. However, we view the Rio+20 Conference as an important milestone in the development of\ninternational cooperation under the auspices of the\nUnited Nations in that sphere. The outcome document\nof the Conference has proved the ability of countries\nof different political and economic weights to reach a\ncompromise, even in today\u2019s difficult times.\nWe support the complex approach that has been\ninitiated in connection with sustainable energy for\nall, sustainable consumption and production, the\nelimination of hunger, and ensuring urban infrastructure\ndevelopment.\nUkraine welcomes the decision of the Conference\nto consolidate the United Nations Environment\nProgramme with a view to a system-based management\nof the whole complex spectrum of environmental\nproblems.\nWe deeply appreciate the establishment of a high-\nlevel political forum on sustainable development and\nthe creation of an intergovernmental working group\nthat will chart post-2015 sustainable development\ngoals. That theme is of special interest for Ukraine,\nas demonstrated by the voluntary presentation of\nUkraine\u2019s national achievements with respect to the\nMillennium Development Goals, which took place\nat the Economic and Social Council in July. I avail\nmyself of this opportunity to assure the Assembly that\nparticipation in the sustainable development efforts of\nthe United Nations will remain Ukraine\u2019s unwavering\npriority.\nGlobal, man-made climate change represents a\nthreat on a planetary scale. Therefore, we consider\nefforts to counteract that challenge to be a priority task\nfor humankind as a whole. Let me note that Ukraine\nhas voluntarily acceded to the second commitment\nperiod of the Kyoto Protocol, undertaking to reduce\nits greenhouse-gas emissions by 20 per cent by 2020.\nBearing that in mind, Ukraine will also promote\ndiscussions, in the framework of its future OSCE\nchairmanship, on the environmental impact of energy-\nrelated man-made activity, energy efficiency and the\nuse of renewable energy sources.\nTurning to international security problems, I\nshould like to stress that Ukraine is deeply committed\nto the cause of bringing about a safer and more secure\nworld. That commitment emanates from the national\nconscience of the people of Ukraine, who have\nexperienced the scourge of war, totalitarianism and\nartificial famines, as well as the consequences of the Chernobyl disaster, the largest man-made disaster in\nhuman history.\nTherefore, Ukraine\u2019s aspiration to save the world\nfrom tragedies similar to those that we have experienced\nstems from the very hearts of the Ukrainians people.\nDuring the more than two decades of its independence,\nUkraine has been a steadfast supporter of global\nnuclear disarmament and non-proliferation. We have\nvoluntarily renounced the third-largest nuclear arsenal\nin the world; we kept our word this year and completed\nthe removal of the last stocks of highly enriched\nuranium from our country.\nI consider those important steps, as well as\nthe Kyiv Summit on the Safe and Innovative Use\nof Nuclear Energy, held last year, to be examples\nworthy of following. I also view in that light the joint\ndeclaration by Ukraine, Mexico and Chile \u2014 countries\nthat have made special efforts to neutralize the risks\nof the exploitation of highly enriched uranium. The\ndeclaration remains open for signing. Unfortunately,\nthe ambitious goal of the gradual complete liquidation\nof nuclear weapons remains unachieved.\nIn that regard, we insist that the security guarantees\nfor States that have renounced their nuclear stockpiles\nand made other strategic concessions should be\nreflected in internationally binding legal instruments.\nThis year Ukraine marked the twentieth anniversary\nof its participation in United Nations peacekeeping\noperations.\nI am truly proud of the contribution of the sons and\ndaughters of Ukraine \u2014 servicemen, law enforcement\nofficers and civilian personnel who have served and\ncontinue to serve the noble ideals of peace under the\nUnited Nations f lag. During these years, over 34,000\nUkrainians have performed noble peacekeeping\nmissions in over 20 international operations under the\nUnited Nations mandate, from Guatemala to Timor-\nLeste, from Croatia to Mozambique. The experience\nthey have acquired gives Ukraine the right to speak\nabout achievements and advantages, as well as\nabout problematic issues in modern United Nations\npeacekeeping operations. The latter include the\nthreatening situation related to air mobility and legal\ngaps in investigations of crimes committed against Blue\nHelmets. I count on the continued support of Ukraine\u2019s\ninitiatives aimed at resolving the current problems\nfacing United Nations peacekeeping operations.\n\nUkraine welcomes the successful completion of the\nGeneral Assembly\u2019s High-level Meeting on the rule of\nlaw that took place here in New York on 24 September.\nAt the Meeting, Ukraine announced the political\nobligations that we will fulfil consistently. We are\ncertain that international efforts to ensure the rule of\nlaw should remain centred around the United Nations.\nAt the same time, relevant international\norganizations should continue to play an important role\nin that sphere. For Ukraine, such an organization would\nbe the Council of Europe and its Venice Commission\nin particular. Our close cooperation with the Council\nand the Commission has assisted us in making steady\nreforms to ensure the rule of law and thereby realize\nour aspirations to European integration. That process\nis actively promoted by Ukraine\u2019s Constitutional\nAssembly, a special political institution established to\nfind a nationwide consensus on the provisions of the\nbasic law. In the course of constructing and developing\nUkraine\u2019s Constitution, we will study and take into\naccount best practices from other countries.\nI am deeply confident that global advances in each of\nthe crucial areas I have mentioned would be impossible\nwithout a United Nations that is more efficient, viable\nand updated to the realities of the twenty-first century.\nThe key here is to deepen United Nations reform,\nand primarily that of the Security Council. Ukraine\u2019s\nposition is well known. We are ready to discuss all\nprogressive concepts of Security Council reform\ncapable of achieving the broadest possible consensus\namong States Members of the United Nations. The\nlatter invariably make allowances for the legitimate\nrequirements of all regional groups, in particular those\nof Eastern Europe.\nOnly the United Nations is up to the task of\nstrengthening humankind to face contemporary\nchallenges. The united will of all 193 Member States\nrepresents an overwhelming force capable of coping\nwith the most complicated global crises. We must\nstrengthen and preserve our unity. I believe that the\nsixty-seventh session of the General Assembly will be\nconducive to that noble goal.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAt the outset, I would like to express my sincere\nappreciation to Mr. Vuk Jeremi\u0107 upon his election\nto serve as President of the General Assembly at its\nsixty-seventh session. It is my firm belief that, with\nhis extensive experience and constructive initiatives,\nhe will guide the Assembly towards achieving its\nobjectives while serving the common interests of all its\nmembers.\nMay I also take this opportunity to extend my\nprofound congratulations to Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz\nAl-Nasser, President of the General Assembly at its\nsixty-sixth session, on the successful discharge of his\nduties.\nLikewise, I would like to commend Secretary-\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon for tirelessly leading United\nNations efforts to meet its obligations and achieve its\nobjectives, as well as working to improve the overall\nworking methods of the United Nations.\nOver the past two years, the international\ncommunity has encountered complex challenges in\nall areas. Regional political complexity and unrest,\nespecially in the Middle East, seem unlikely to be\nresolved any time soon. The use of violence in any form,\nas seen in attacks on diplomatic compounds in Syria,\nis unacceptable to us. In addition, the global economic\nand financial crisis affecting all parts of the world has\nreached an alarming point, causing great concern for\nall nations, and even for the European Union \u2014 a major\neconomic force.\nSuch crises have challenged the capacity\nand credibility of the existing global governance\nmechanisms designed by the international community\nto address global challenges. This is a clear indication\nthat our joint efforts and actions have not yet produced\ntangible outcomes.\nNegotiations on climate change have shown no\nprogress, although the Kyoto Protocol is expiring this\nyear. Efforts to formulate an international instrument\nto govern arms trade and prevent illegal trading,\nwhich started some years ago, have also failed. There\nhas also been little commitment on the part of the\ndeveloped countries to help the most vulnerable groups of countries: the least developed countries (LDCs),\nthe landlocked developing countries (LLDCs), and the\nsmall island developing States.\nIn the light of the current situation, it is more\ncrucial than ever to strengthen the United Nations,\nthe only universal Organization, in order to increase\nits effectiveness in addressing important global issues.\nTo that end, all Member States should strive to extend\ntheir full support and cooperation to revitalize the\nUnited Nations, finding a harmonious balance between\nnational and international interests in order to address\nthe enormous global challenges in a timely and effective\nmanner.\nIn the current context, regional organizations have\nplayed an increasingly important role in addressing\nthe global issues. In that connection, more and more\ncountries in the world now attach greater importance to\nthe Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)\nand the ever-expanding ASEAN-initiated cooperation\nframeworks. ASEAN is entering a crucial stage in\nimplementing its leaders\u2019 commitment to establishing\nan ASEAN community comprised of three pillars \u2014 a\npolitical-security community, an economic community\nand a social-cultural community \u2014 by 2015. I firmly\nbelieve that, by utilizing its own resources combined\nwith external support, especially from its dialogue\npartners, ASEAN will be able to realize its ultimate\ngoal of becoming a community that is politically stable,\neconomically integrated and socially and culturally\nharmonious, thus contributing to the cause of peace and\nprosperity in the region and the world at large.\nAs a member of the international community, the\nLao People\u2019s Democratic Republic has done its utmost\nto fulfil its international obligations by pursuing a\npolicy of cooperation with other countries based on the\nprinciples of equality, mutual benefit, and respect for\nthe principles of national independence, sovereignty\nand non-interference in each other\u2019s internal affairs,\nthus building an international environment conducive\nto national development.\nOver the past year, despite numerous challenges,\nthe Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic has continued to\nenjoy political stability and social order. There has been\ngood progress in developing the national economy. That\nhas laid a solid foundation for attaining the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) by 2015 and created\nconditions conducive to the country\u2019s graduation from\nleast developed country status by 2020.\n\nDespite those achievements, the Lao People\u2019s\nDemocratic Republic continues to face numerous\nchallenges and constraints. In addition to problems\nresulting from the global and regional economic crises,\nnatural calamities and the remnants of war, such\nas unexploded ordnance, continue to harm people\u2019s\nlives and pose major obstacles to national social and\neconomic development, including the attainment of\nthe MDGs. In that regard, we call upon all countries to\nbecome party to the Convention on Cluster Munitions\nwith a view to fully banning the use of such weapons.\nThe Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic feels\nhonoured to be entrusted with hosting the 9th Asia-\nEurope Summit Meeting, which will be held on\n5 and 6 November in Vientiane, the capital of the Lao\nPeople\u2019s Democratic Republic. That will provide a\ngreat opportunity for the leaders of Asia and Europe\nto discuss and exchange their views on global issues of\nmutual interest.\nThe international community wishes to see the\nrestoration of peace and stability in the Middle East.\nThe conflict between Israel and Palestine will not\nbe resolved without the full implementation of the\nrelevant Security Council resolutions supporting the\nestablishment of two States, Israel and Palestine, living\nside by side in peace. The Lao People\u2019s Democratic\nRepublic reaffirms its support for the membership of\nPalestine to the United Nations.\nThe economic, financial and trade embargo\nimposed on the Republic of Cuba has long caused\nconsiderable hardship to the standard of living of the\nCuban people. That embargo must be unconditionally\nand immediately lifted.\nOwing to their geographical locations, the\nlandlocked developing countries are among the most\nvulnerable Members of the United Nations. The special\nchallenges and major development obstacles they face\nare the result of their great distance from world markets\nand high transit transport costs, which impede their\nnational sustainable development efforts. Each year, the\nlandlocked countries bear a heavy financial burden in the\neffort to improve their transit transport infrastructure\nnetwork in order to ensure that their export products,\nwhich constitute a crucial part of their national income,\nhave better access to world markets. Those problems\nare compounded when their national economies are\naffected by financial or social crises, natural disasters\nand climate change, inter alia. In addition, 50 per cent of the LLDCs are also LDCs. I therefore urge the\ninternational community to devote greater attention and\nprovide assistance to that vulnerable group of countries\nthrough full implementation of the Almaty Programme\nof Action, as well as to play an active part in the 10-year\nreview of the implementation of the Almaty Programme\nof Action, to be held in 2014.\nThe Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic reiterates\nonce again its firm commitment and determination\nto continue working closely with the international\ncommunity to build a peaceful world under a just and\nmore democratic new order, based on cooperation with\nall countries in tackling the various global challenges\nfacing us. I am convinced that only through firm\ndetermination will we be able to achieve the immediate\nand long-term development objectives and ensure that\nthe world is secure, peaceful and prosperous."

        "file_text": "\ufeffLet me begin by\ncongratulating Mr. Jeremi\u0107 on his election to the\npresidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-seventh\nsession. My delegation assures him of its full support in\nthe discharge of his responsibilities.\nI also take this opportunity to place on record our\nprofound appreciation to the outgoing President, His\nExcellency Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser, for having\nsuccessfully presided over the sixty-sixth session of the\nAssembly. Let me also express our sincere gratitude\nto Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his strong\ncommitment and dedication in serving the United\nNations.\nIn establishing the United Nations at a time when\nthe world was emerging from the ashes of successive\ndevastating wars, our founding fathers envisioned\na peaceful, stable, just and prosperous world. Nearly\nseven decades later, the lofty objectives of the United\nNations Charter are yet to be fully realized. Threats to\ninternational peace and security remain unabated, with\ntraditional sources of threats continuing alongside the\nemergence of new sources and forms of conflict. In\nfact, the sense of insecurity seems to be more pervasive today as people around the world continue to face a\nwide range of situations, characterized by the legacy\nof colonialism, injustice, domination, exploitation,\nhatred, intolerance, exclusion, xenophobia and so on.\nEconomic insecurity in the face of the heightened global\neconomic and financial crises and fierce competition\nfor dwindling resources and energy security also play\ntheir part in generating tensions in many parts of the\nworld.\nThe concept of collective security being the core\npillar of the United Nations Charter has often been\nundermined through recourse to dispute-settlement\nmeans that are outside the purview of a multilateral\nmechanism. Unilateralism and the selective\ninterpretation of the provisions of the Charter risk\ninciting more conflict and confrontation rather than\nunderstanding and cooperation. That necessitates\nwider respect and observance of the principles of\nsovereignty, territorial integrity, political independence\nand non-interference as the bedrock principles of\ninternational relations. Those principles cannot\nand should not be put to the political test under any\ncircumstances.\nThe growing challenges do not mean that the role\nand importance of the United Nations have diminished,\nbut rather demand a more effective and stronger\nOrganization. We must internalize that reality and\nmove forward, grasping the true spirit of its founding\nprinciples and purposes.\nNepal supports a just and lasting solution to the\nMiddle East. It is our principled position to support\nthe legitimate right of the Palestinian people to self-\ndetermination and a fully independent and sovereign\nPalestinian State on the basis of the United Nations\nresolutions. The peaceful and secure coexistence of the\nindependent States of a sovereign Palestine and Israel\nare crucial to ensuring lasting peace in the Middle East.\nWe call for an end to the violence and the peaceful\nresolution of the Syrian crisis by the Syrian people\nthemselves. The sovereignty, territorial integrity and\nindependence of Syria must be upheld.\nWe are of the firm opinion that the protracted\nembargo on Cuba is unjustified and needs to be ended\nimmediately and unconditionally.\nWe recognize the legitimate rights of every\nsovereign State to pursue the development of nuclear\ntechnology solely for peaceful purposes and under effective international supervision. We stand firmly\nagainst nuclear proliferation, the arms race and the\nmisuse of nuclear technology for ulterior motives.\nWe strongly oppose and renounce violence and\nphysical attacks on diplomats anywhere under any\npretext.\nWe reiterate our call for general and complete\nelimination of nuclear and all other weapons of mass\ndestruction in a time-bound manner. The international\ncommunity should work in unison to strengthen\ncontrols over small arms and light weapons to prevent\ntheir pervasive abuse by criminal elements.\nIt is heartening to note that, as a major troop-\ncontributing country, Nepal has already provided\nover 92,000 professional and dedicated peacekeepers\nto the United Nations for various operations since its\nfirst participation in 1959. We remain steadfast in our\ncommitment to international peace and security and\naffirm that our contribution to that noble cause will\ncontinue. While calling for timely reforms in that\nf lagship activity, we stress the importance of equitable\nrepresentation of troop-contributing countries, at the\nleadership level, both at United Nations Headquarters\nand in field missions.\nI would like to reaffirm Nepal\u2019s unreserved\ncondemnation of terrorism wherever it occurs and in\nall its forms and manifestations. We renew our call\nfor an expeditious conclusion of the negotiations on a\ncomprehensive convention on international terrorism.\nAs we continue to combat terrorism, we must not forget\nthat durable peace can be built only on the firm pillars\nof the prevention of conflict, the peaceful resolution of\ndisputes, persistent efforts for disarmament, poverty\nreduction, development and respect for diversity,\nfairness and justice. There is a need to differentiate\nbetween terrorism and struggles for liberation, freedom\nand sustainable peace and development.\nOur commitment to democracy, human rights, the\nrule of law and inclusive development is unf linching.\nThe mutually reinforcing effects of such principles foster\nthe active participation of the people in governance\nprocesses towards safeguarding peace, security\nand development. To address Nepal\u2019s post-conflict\ntransition needs, we have established mechanisms and\nprocesses for the protection and promotion of human\nrights and for their monitoring at the highest level and\nat various tiers of the sub-national level. As a party to 22 human rights conventions,\nincluding seven core instruments, we have established\nseveral laws that ensure the rights of all sectors of\nsociety, including women, children and marginalized\nand deprived communities. We are committed to\ncontrolling cross-border human trafficking and to\ndoing our utmost to ensure that the rights and interests\nof migrant workers are protected in countries that are\ndestinations for labour. The National Human Rights\nCommission, which is an independent constitutional\nbody, operates as the country\u2019s all-powerful watchdog\nfor the protection and promotion of human rights.\nWe are committed to strengthening that specialized\nnational institution as a true custodian of human rights.\nNepal has provided shelter to a large number of\nrefugees on humanitarian grounds. While we appreciate\nthe assistance of the international community in\nsupporting refugees, we reiterate that their voluntary\nrepatriation to their homeland with dignity and honour\nis the only durable solution to the refugee problem.\nWe underscore that the rule of law at the\ninternational level is as important as at the national level\nin ensuring the sovereign equality of all States, respect\nfor their territorial integrity and political independence\nand non-intervention in their internal affairs. Those\nare essential principles for peaceful coexistence and\nmutual cooperation among States.\nThe issue of sustainable development has come\nto the forefront of today\u2019s global discourse. It was the\nfocus of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable\nDevelopment (Rio+20). We believe that we need to\npursue not only sustainable development goals, but\nalso a development path towards equal prosperity\nthrough meaningful development opportunities by\neradicating the deeply entrenched inequalities and\nglobal exploitative practices. In our opinion, freeing\nall human beings from the dehumanizing clutches of\npoverty and hunger should be the first essential step\ntowards that end. The outcome document of Rio+20\n(resolution 66/288, annex) sets out a broad framework\nfor global action for \u201cThe future we want\u201d and a post-\n2015 global development agenda. The need of the hour\nis to ensure effective implementation.\nAs we all have come to realize, climate change is\none of the greatest challenges of our time. Its insidious\neffects are visible everywhere and are compounded\nby disasters of increasing magnitude and frequency.\nCountries like Nepal, which make a negligible contribution to greenhouse gases but have to bear the\ndisproportionate brunt of the impacts of climate change,\ndeserve special assistance in creating and maintaining\nclimate-resilient societies. Negotiations under the\nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate\nChange should continue to be guided by the principle\nof common but differentiated responsibilities in letter\nand spirit. Nepal hopes that the successor mechanism\nof the Kyoto Protocol ensures binding commitments\nand climate justice. The various funding mechanisms\nfor climate change adaptation and mitigation measures\nmust be activated, and action must be taken on an\nurgent basis.\nThe world we live in is more unjust today than when\nwe inherited it. Contrary to much-touted popular belief,\nthe profusion in knowledge, the revolution in science\nand technology and increased mobility in ideas and\nglobal capital, though often termed as advancements\ncharacteristic of the modern world, have failed to\ndeliver significant contributions to making our planet\nsafer and more just. They could have, but that is not\nthe reality. It is an irony that our capacities to produce\ngoods and services have increased manyfold, leading\nto an unprecedented accumulation of wealth, but over\none third of the world\u2019s population is forced to live in\nabject poverty.\nThe rapid globalization of finance and an\nunsustainable consumption of resources have made\na few people enormously rich at the cost of the rest,\nmaking for the greatest inequality among human beings\never in history. Obviously, the transformative power of\nglobalization has not been utilized for the benefit of the\nmasses. The direction and pattern of the current form\nof economic globalization therefore call for a change in\nits mode of operation so that it becomes more inclusive\nand responsive to the needs of poor and marginalized\npeople.\nNepal views the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM)\nand the Group of 77 and China as important multilateral\nforums that should play an active role in advancing\nthe United Nations agenda, in line with the Charter\nobjectives of pursuing the shared goals of peace, progress\nand prosperity. The principles and purposes of NAM are\nof continued relevance in forging developing countries\u2019\ncollective moral resolve to create an equitable, fair and\njust world order, combating the conservative forces of\nrepression, invasion, intimidation and injustice. The\nideals of NAM, as reiterated at its recently held sixteenth\nsummit in Teheran, go a long way towards fostering better understanding and cooperative relations among\ncountries and peoples of the world.\nThe least developed countries (LDCs) are suffering\nfrom dehumanizing marginalization and deprivation\nof the basic necessities of life. This state of affairs\nis a blemish on the sheer aff luence achieved in the\nglobalized world. Global sustainable development will\nnot be possible without sustainable development for the\nLDCs, including substantial improvement in the quality\nof life of their 880 million people. The world must pay\ndue attention in deeds as well as in words to the special\nand different needs and requirements of the LDCs.\nThe landlocked LDCs (LLDCs), among which Nepal\nfigures, have to bear the additional disadvantages of\nphysical and non-physical barriers in trade. That results\nin increased transactional costs for transit transport,\nwhich renders their international trade uncompetitive.\nTransit countries, regional groups, the international\nfinancial institutions and other development partners\nshould work together to overcome those difficulties by\ninvesting in transport infrastructure links and trade\nfacilitation measures. We underline the central role\nof the United Nations in promoting the development\nagenda, taking into account the special needs and\ndevelopment challenges confronting the LDCs, the\nLLDCs and other vulnerable groups of countries.\nTimely and ongoing reforms of the United\nNations are necessary to strengthen and revitalize\nthis world body so that it can respond to increasing\nglobal challenges. The General Assembly must be\nstrengthened and endowed with decision-making\npower and authority commensurate with its global\nrepresentation. Nepal supports the expansion of the\nSecurity Council in both member categories and hopes\nto see greater accountability and transparency in its\nworking methods. The Economic and Social Council\nmust be strengthened for the promotion of international\neconomic cooperation, coordination, policy review and\ndialogue. It must also formulate and develop the social\nand economic agenda and work for the implementation\nof agreed international development goals, with special\nemphasis on development for LDCs, LLDCs and small\nisland developing States, among others.\nWe seek an increased role for the United\nNations system in global economic governance, with\nstrengthened coordination and cooperation with\nthe Bretton Woods institutions and the World Trade\nOrganization, to reflect the dynamics of change. Let me brief ly say a few words about the current\nsituation in my country. The historic task we face is\nstill to positively conclude the historical transition\nwe are undergoing as early as possible. We need the\nConstituent Assembly to promulgate a new constitution\nand we need to finally complete the peace process.\nBased on the historic people\u2019s movement of 2006, which\nwas the culmination of many decades of struggle by the\nNepalese people against autocracy, we abolished the\nmonarchy and established a republican State. We also\nadopted other important principles, such as secularism,\nfederalism and inclusive, proportional representation\nand participation, although they are yet to be codified\nin a new constitution.\nThe Constituent Assembly was elected for the\nfirst time in Nepal\u2019s political history in 2008 and\nwas mandated to draft a constitution addressing the\naspirations of the people for change, a restructuring of\nthe State and an end to all forms of exploitation and\ndiscrimination based on class, ethnicity, gender and\nregion. The Constituent Assembly worked for four\nyears to draft the new constitution and completed 80\nto 90 per cent of the drafting, but never finalized the\ntext. Not having met its deadline, and after the Supreme\nCourt ruled against extensions, it was dissolved on\n27 May this year.\nWe have made qualitative progress on the technical\nside of the peace process, mainly the integration of\nformer Maoist combatants. There is no outstanding\nproblem left in that regard and the process is near\ncompletion. A transitional justice mechanism is in place\nto promote the peace and reconciliation process needed\nfor the completion of the peace process. But we have\nyet to find a solution to the Constituent Assembly\u2019s\ninability to create a constitution. Political parties are\nengaged in dialogue and negotiations in that regard\nand are seriously committed to finding a consensus\nsolution. National consensus is the only option to find a\nway out of the current impasse. We hope we will be able\nto do so without excessive delay.\nAs we go through the process of institutionalizing\nchange, we are of the firm belief that democracy,\ndevelopment and peace are interrelated and\ninterdependent. By \u201cdemocracy\u201d, we mean inclusive\nand participatory democracy, and by \u201cdevelopment\u201d\nwe mean people-centred development with social\njustice and socioeconomic transformation. Without\ndemocracy and development, there cannot be lasting\nand sustainable peace. And democracy, development, peace and stability should safeguard national\nsovereignty. Thus democracy, development, peace and\nnational sovereignty are the major components of our\nprocess of change. From our experience, we can say that\ndemocracy has both universal and particular aspects.\nWe thank the international community, including\nthe United Nations, for its continued support for and\ncooperation in our peace and constitution-making\nprocess from the very beginning, and hope that it will\ncontinue in the future.\nNature has blessed us with an outstanding mountain\nrange with gushing rivers, incredible biodiversity and a\nlandscape spectrum of contrast and vibrancy. We are\nequally rich in ancient cultural heritage, multiple ethnic\ncultures and a diverse mosaic of hardworking people.\nWe need a stable and peaceful environment if we are\nto make effective use of those diverse endowments for\nsocioeconomic transformation, along with ongoing\nState restructuring. Only then will it be possible to\ntranslate the historic achievements we have made on\nthe political front into tangible results in economic and\nhuman development terms.\nAs a symbolic gesture to institutionalize peace\nfor development in the national, regional and global\ncontexts, we want to develop Lumbini, the birthplace of\nLord Buddha, the apostle of peace, into an international\ncity of peace. In that respect, we call for international\nsupport and cooperation to realize the initiative.\nIn conclusion, I would like in all humility to draw\nthe attention of all world leaders to the core reality\nthat if we do not reach the goal of global peace and\nprosperity together, then nobody will. That is why we\nmust act together accordingly."

        "file_text": "\ufeffI congratulate Mr. Vuk\nJeremi\u0107 and the people of Serbia on his election to\nthe presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-\nseventh session. I would like to assure him of Liberia\u2019s\nfull cooperation and support as he carries out the\nresponsibilities entrusted to him in steering the affairs\nof this session. I would also like to pay tribute to his\npredecessor, Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser of the\nState of Qatar, for his capable stewardship of the affairs\nof the sixty-sixth session and the many bold initiatives undertaken in the interests of world peace during his\ntenure.\nMy highest commendation goes to Secretary-\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon, who continues to demonstrate\nsound leadership in the face of new and complicated\nchallenges. He has begun his second term with renewed\nvigour and a clear articulation of the priorities that\nrepresent the major concerns of the international\ncommunity.\nThe selection of the theme for this session, which\ncalls for the settlement of disputes by peaceful means,\ncould not have been more appropriate. When we\nreview the state of the world, we see an international\nlandscape checkered with armed conflict, economic\ncrises and environmental degradation. For those who\nhave been through the painful experience of conflict,\nincluding my own country, Liberia, this year\u2019s theme\nbecomes very pertinent. The cost of conflict in lives\nand infrastructural destruction makes us doubly\nappreciative of the value of preventive action in\naverting conflict. The need for conflict prevention\ntakes on added urgency, because most conflicts are\ninternal, engendered by marginalization, inequity and\ninjustice. It becomes imperative, therefore, to identify\nand remove those triggers of conflict before they cause\nexplosions.\nOur Government\u2019s efforts to achieve the twin\nobjectives of conflict prevention and peace consolidation\nare being reinforced through our engagement with the\npeacekeeping and peacebuilding architecture of the\nUnited Nations. In an environment of peace, we have\nprioritized actions aimed at re-establishing the rule\nof law by building the capacity of our institutions\nand processes to deliver justice and security. We have\nformulated a road map for national reconciliation to\nensure that peace is sustainable.\nOur development partners, including the United\nNations and its specialized agencies, have remained\nfaithful to our national agenda. They have supported\nour priority programmes for women\u2019s empowerment,\nincreased agricultural productivity and food security,\nroads and infrastructure, and job creation. All the United\nNations agencies must be supplied with the capacity to\nprovide support to Government programmes in those\nareas. That is particularly critical for the new gender\nentity, UN-Women, which is the youngest among them\nand whose viability must be assured. We have made\nstrong strides in gender equality, but much more must\nbe done for girls\u2019 education and women\u2019s empowerment.\nTremendous progress has also been made in health-care\ndelivery.\nWe are particularly pleased by the recent UNICEF\nreport, which shows a sharp reduction in the level of\nchild mortality. However, there are still many challenges\nto overcome before we can ensure universal access to\nhealth care.\nMany developing countries, such as Liberia, have\nstructured their economies around the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). While some countries\nhave made considerable progress in reaching some of\nthe Goals, many others will be unable to achieve them\nby 2015. There is an emerging consensus that efforts\nmust be accelerated in order to achieve maximum\nprogress in reaching the MDGs over the next three\nyears.\nI am honoured and humbled to have been selected\nby the Secretary-General as one of the co-Chairs of\nthe High-level Panel of Eminent Persons on the Post-\n2015 Development Agenda. We are mindful of the\ndifficulty of our task, which requires us to propose a\nframework that builds on but goes beyond the MDGs\nin the establishment of goals that are ambitious but\nachievable. We know that the results of our work must\nreflect the broad political consensus of the public and\nprivate sectors and civil society. We know that the\ndefined goals should enable all people in all countries\nto be freed from the shackles of poverty through\nsustainable development.\nLiberia remains fully committed to the ideals and\npurposes of the United Nations. We believe that the\nOrganization should continue to occupy the centre of\nglobal governance by leading efforts to meet our collective\nchallenges to peace, security and development. To meet\nthat objective, the intergovernmental negotiations on\nSecurity Council reform need to come to an early and\nlogical conclusion. My Government is encouraged\nthat an increasing number of Member States support\nthe enlargement of the Council in both the permanent\nand the non-permanent categories. That would ensure\na fairer and more equitable participation, ref lective of\nthe world demography. In that regard, Liberia supports\nthe African common position, based on the Ezulwini\nConsensus adopted by the African Union.\nIn the same vein, we must ensure that the General\nAssembly is revitalized in order for it to fully assume\nall the responsibilities entrusted to it under the Charter.\n\nIt remains, after all, the most representative body of the\nUnited Nations.\nThe high-level United Nations Conference on the\nArms Trade Treaty, which ended recently here in New\nYork, sought to develop the highest possible international\nstandards for the trade in conventional weapons.\nHowever, strong national positions on that sensitive\nglobal issue prevented an agreement on a binding arms\ntrade treaty. Yet, nations of goodwill and countries like\nLiberia that have experienced devastation from the\nillicit trade in and diversion of conventional weapons\nmust continue our strong advocacy, taking into account\nthe full range of differences and disagreements. We\nwould therefore encourage bilateral consensus-building\nahead of a new round of negotiations. At the same time,\nwe are convinced that the final draft text of the arms\ntrade treaty, though imperfect and incomplete, contains\nessential elements, upon which future negotiations can\nsucceed.\nWe express our deep condolences on the death of\nthe United States Ambassador and staff and the Libyan\nnationals in the attack on the United States consulate\nin Benghazi. All nations should be concerned about\nthe spreading of violence in reaction to a film that\ndemonstrates unacceptable insensitivity to the Islamic\nfaith. Even in such circumstances, we must all be\nmindful that democracy requires freedom \u2014 freedom\nof ideas, freedom of association, freedom of religion\nand, more important, freedom of expression. That\noften results in statements and actions that may offend.\nTolerance, not violence, is the appropriate response to\nprevent further violence. Liberia is a clear example,\nwhere, were it not for our own tolerance of our new-\nfound freedom of expression, our country would be\nback in chaos.\nWhile the majority of the countries in our\nsubregion are consolidating economic and social\ngains, underpinned by democratic processes, some\nare, regrettably, still dogged by serious challenges\nthat risk undermining the peace and progress of the\nentire region. We in Liberia, like many other countries\nin the region and the world at large, were particularly\nappalled by the unconstitutional unravelling of the\ndemocratic Governments in Mali and Guinea-Bissau in\nthe early part of this year. We unequivocally condemn\nsuch attempts to seize power through unconstitutional\nmeans.\nAccordingly, Liberia endorses the decisions of\nthe Economic Community of West African States\n(ECOWAS), which sought the full restoration of\nconstitutional order in both countries in the shortest\ntime. Liberia enjoins the world community, particularly\nthe Security Council, to buttress the efforts of ECOWAS\nin restoring peace in our region, most especially in\nMali.\nAs the current Chair of the four-nation Mano River\nUnion, comprising Liberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea and\nC\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Liberia has committed itself to never\nallowing an inch of its territory to be used in order\nto destabilize its neighbours. In that context, we\ncategorically condemn all attempts to undermine the\npeace and democratic gains in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire and are\nworking closely with the Ivorian authorities and the\nUnited Nations peacekeeping bodies in both Liberia\nand C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire to protect and consolidate the peace in\nour two countries. We call on all countries in our region\nto work in concert so that those intent on destabilizing\nsome parts of our region are treated as enemies in all\nparts of it.\nWe are all part of a rapidly changing world in which\nthe forces of globalization cannot be reversed. Our\nfarming systems must adjust to the unusual weather\nconditions. The places where we live and work will\nneed, in some cases, to be relocated from traditional\nsafe areas. Our societies must also find responses to the\ndistractions resulting from the demonstration effect.\nDeveloping countries, such as my own, must make\nglobalization work if we are to achieve our growth\ntargets and lift our people out of poverty. That means\ngreater commitment and effort on our part to create an\nenvironment that ensures economic growth based on\nmutual benefits and responsibilities.\nSince its founding, Liberia has been a complex\nnation, and the divisions that led to decades of war still\nrun deep.\nOur experience clearly shows that success has its\npitfalls. Displaced citizens returning from refugee\ncamps in the subregion and deportees from around the\nworld swell the ranks of the desperate unemployed,\nthereby intensifying our vulnerability. Communities\nlong deprived of basic services demand instant attention\nto their individual needs, thereby straining our capacity.\nCivil servants lacking a decent wage for two decades\nrightfully clamour for raises, thereby undermining the\nbudgetary process.\n\nAs Liberia moves towards its tenth year of\nsustained peace, we can say with conviction that our\ncountry has turned the corner. Liberia is no longer a\nplace of conflict, war and deprivation. We are no longer\nthe country our citizens f led, our international partners\npitied and our neighbours feared. Our stabilization\nefforts over the past six years have resulted in average\nannual growth of over 6 per cent, major foreign\ninvestment, expanded fiscal space and unprecedented\ndebt cancellation. More important, we have earned our\nrightful place on an irreversible path to sustained peace,\ngrowth and development. Our Vision 2030, resulting\nfrom a robust nationwide consultation, is a long-\nterm programme for transformation that prioritizes\nyouth development, infrastructure, reconciliation and\ncapacity development.\nYet, our Government is keenly aware of the\nchallenges to be faced over the next three years.\nUnited Nations peacekeeping forces are gradually\nbeing withdrawn from Liberia. In our discussions\nwith various United Nations teams that have come to\nLiberia \u2014 the technical assessment mission in March\nand the Security Council delegation in May \u2014 we\nhave emphasized the need for a responsible transition,\nthrough a gradual process occurring over a period\nof three to five years. We also seek the alignment of\ntransitional activities with our budget cycle, reflecting\nGovernment priorities.\nWe wish to express our appreciation to the United\nNations, which has been a very committed and effective\npartner. We owe the Organization much gratitude for\npreserving an enabling environment for peacebuilding\nand State-building.\nIn conclusion, I wish to note that today, for the first\ntime in two generations, Liberia has a second successive\ndemocratic Government elected by the will of the\npeople. Despite the distractions, local and external, our\npeople are determined to take their destiny into their\nown hands, and determined that our ambitious goal of\nmaking Liberia a middle-income country by the year\n2030 will be achieved."

        "file_text": "\ufeffI speak on behalf of Mr. Paul Biya, President\nof the Republic of Cameroon, who has had to remain in\nCameroon owing to painful circumstances. He asked\nme to read the following statement.\n\u201cAllow me, first of all, to warmly congratulate\nthe President on his election to the presidency of\nthe General Assembly at its sixty-seventh session.\nThe experience he brings as former head of the\ndiplomatic corps of his country leads me to believe\nthat he, like his predecessor, Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz\nAl-Nasser, will lead the discussions with the\nrequisite agility and talent. I would also like to express to Mr. Al-Nasser my country\u2019s appreciation\nfor his action as President of the General Assembly\nat its sixty-sixth session.\n\u201cFinally, I would like thank Secretary-General\nBan Ki-moon for his devotion to serving the ideals\nof the Organization.\n\u201cThis has been an active year for the\nOrganization. We have held major meetings to\ndiscuss the important questions of the day and\nexamined the most appropriate course of action to\naddress them. Allow me to return to two of them.\n\u201cFirst of all, there is Rio+20, the United\nNations Conference on Sustainable Development,\nwhich was held in June 2012 to commemorate the\ntwentieth anniversary of the historic Earth Summit.\nThe meeting enabled us to define the future we want\nto leave our children.\n\u201cI am pleased that the vision adopted at the\nend of the meeting recognizes the need to further\nincorporate at all levels of activities the economic,\nsocial and environmental aspects of sustainable\ndevelopment. If we want to leave a liveable world\nto future generations, the green economy seems the\nmost effective way of ensuring that development\nmeets the needs of populations while at the same\ntime preserving the environment.\n\u201cFor our part, Cameroon has already begun\nactions in that respect. We intend to work further to\npreserve our natural capital and to seek low-carbon\nsolutions, as well as to promote production and\nconsumption patterns that are sustainable.\n\u201cIn our view, progress towards the green\neconomy must be gradual and enjoy the support\nof the international community. In that respect,\nthe document adopted at the end of the Rio\nConference committed the international community\nto upholding the many obligations that had been\nundertaken with respect to Africa in terms of\nsustainable development, while ensuring, inter alia,\nappropriate technology transfer. The international\nfinancial institutions and the United Nations\nConference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD)\nare called upon to strengthen their activities to that\nend. That is a significant step forward.\n\u201cThe second important meeting that we should\nnote is the thirteenth quadrennial session held by\nUNCTAD in Doha, Qatar. Less commented upon by the media than the Rio meeting, that session aimed\nto curb the excesses of globalization and to refocus\nit on development. Globalization, because of what it\nhas brought to the development of trade, economic\nand technological progress and the rapprochement of\ncultures, can be considered a positive phenomenon.\nThe fact remains, however, that because of poor\nmanagement and poor regulation, it was unable to\nprevent economic crises and relegated problems of\nunderdevelopment to the backburner. UNCTAD,\nafter the Doha meeting, was reinforced in its role in\nterms of trade and development, which is something\nto be welcomed.\n\u201cSince 2008, we have seen a slowdown in global\neconomic activity. Industrialized countries, be they\nEuropean Union or the United States or Japan,\nhave, to varying degrees, been experiencing serious\ndifficulties \u2014 slower growth or even recession,\nincreased debt and public deficits, imbalances\nin foreign trade, and so on. Emerging countries\nthemselves, which had seen high growth rates,\nhave been experiencing a slowdown as well. As to\ndeveloping countries, even if they continue to make\nmoderate progress, they fear the effects of a crash of\nthe global economy and a possible contagion.\n\u201cA few moments ago I said that globalization,\neven if it does have some positive aspects, has not\nachieved its main objective, that is, ensuring the\nharmonious functioning of the global economy\nand global finance while taking into account the\ninterests of all concerned parties. That relative\nfailure has revealed an urgent need for regulation.\nRight now it is hard to see how and when that need\ncan be met.\n\u201cMajor forums, such as the Group of 20, of\nwhich industrialized countries make up the majority,\nand the World Trade Organization have, for their\npart, discussed several times the question of the\nglobal economy and outlined solutions that could\nre-establish an overall balance. But it has to be said\nthat, given the scale of the task, the lack of available\nresources and the difficulties that major countries\nthemselves are having to face, the discussions have\nnot always been followed by action. From that\nstandpoint, the international community seems to\nbe going through a period of doubt and concern.\nEvery one of us is aware that urgent and large-scale\naction is required, but, preoccupied with our own problems, we seem to be in a state of paralysis and\nunable to take the decisions that need to be taken.\n\u201cThe obvious risk is one of a return to\nprotectionism \u2014 a temptation that is already\nevident. If we believe the signs, that could only\nbring temporary respite and in time could exacerbate\nthe recession. African countries, and Cameroon\nin particular, which have undergone a long crisis\nmarked by declines in gross domestic product,\nthe harsh discipline of structural adjustment plans\nand the worsening of social hardship, are in a\ngood position to evaluate the consequences of\na deterioration of the economy. That is why they\nplace their hopes in a broad consultation with a\nview to the comprehensive regulation of economic\nand financial flows that would take into account the\nsituation of the different categories of countries and\nprovide opportunities for international solidarity to\nplay a role.\n\u201cFor its part, Cameroon has drawn lessons\nfrom the current situation. Back on its feet, thanks\nto the sacrifices of its population and relieved of\nthe weight of their debt by external partners, the\neconomy of Cameroon is now focused on taking\nadvantage of its natural resources. Well endowed\nby nature, my country intends to develop modern\nagriculture in order to consolidate its food self-\nsufficiency and encourage exports. Also, aware\nthat its industrialization requires the availability of\nsufficient energy, we have set in motion a programme\nto exploit our vast hydroelectric potential. Finally,\nseveral mining projects, together with the building\nof adequate road transport and port infrastructure,\nare under way. We hope to make progress on the\nroad to development and the improvement of the\nliving conditions of our population.\n\u201cI would now like to express my appreciation\nfor the President\u2019s choice of theme for the general\ndebate, namely, \u2018Bringing about adjustment or\nsettlement of international disputes or situations by\npeaceful means\u2019. That subject follows on from last\nyear\u2019s theme and enables us to revisit the Charter of\nthe United Nations and to remind ourselves of the\nvalues that it promotes and that should guide our\nactions.\n\u201cThe theme recalls recalls the fundamental\nprinciples of the Organization, which are, inter\nalia, the maintenance of international peace and security through the adoption of effective collective\nmeasures and the settlement by peaceful means\nof disputes which could lead to a breakdown of\npeace, in accordance with the principles of justice\nand international law. That reminder is not without\nvalue at the present moment, when tensions persist\nin the Sahel, especially in Mali, when the Sudan and\nSouth Sudan struggle to normalize relations, and\nwhen Syria is ravaged by internal conflict. Those\ntensions highlight the risk of force being used to\nresolve differences.\n\u201cThe use of force can be justified in some\ncases, such as to respond to international terrorism,\nviolations of human rights and democracy, threats\nto the security of persons or violations of the\nsovereignty and territorial integrity of States.\nHowever, it is clear that, before resorting to that\nextreme, peaceful means must first be used to\nresolve disputes, so as to avoid setting off a vicious\ncircle of violence and retaliation. Far be it from me\nto indulge in utopianism. There are situations when\nmilitary intervention is perhaps inevitable. But it\nis our responsibility to reduce to the minimum the\nlikelihood of military action by taking a maximum\nof precautions. In any case, clearly the preferred\nway to settle disputes is still through prevention and\nnegotiation.\n\u201cFor the greater part of international public\nopinion, the United Nations embodies the noblest\nhuman values and the hope for a future in keeping\nwith the ideals of peace, security and development,\nas enshrined in the United Nations Charter. Let\nus strive to keep that hope from being yet again\nbetrayed.\u201d"

In\nthat regard, the Charter of the United Nations, the\nmajor human rights treaties and the treaties governing\nhumanitarian law, along with the Vienna Conventions\non the law of treaties and diplomatic law and the key\nconventions on disarmament, may be viewed as a nearly\nuniversal legal corpus that promotes social relations\nbased on the law and that furthers durable peace.\nThat is a historically unprecedented development\nand a genuine achievement of the United Nations; it\nstands as a credit to the United Nations and certainly\nas one of its most successful achievements with respect\nto the aims enshrined in the Preamble and first Article\nof the Charter.\nOver the course of the 67 years since the\nestablishment of the United Nations, the world\nhas undergone profound transformation. Growing\ntechnical and economic interdependence, along\nwith the exponential development of new forms of\ncommunication, has led to the advent of what has\ncommonly been known, ever since the middle of the\ntwentieth century, as the global village: a diverse and\ncontinuously evolving village that has experienced\nastonishing development but that has also seen terrible\ninjustice. In that regard, the labour of legal construction\nundertaken by the United Nations is a worthy response that promotes the development of that global village, a\nresponse that deserves the continued and wholehearted\nsupport of Governments and social organizations.\nHuman history has always presented paradoxical\nor conf lictive situations that have given rise to\nfrustration and feelings of injustice. Today, in a\ncontext of generalized interdependence, the disparity\nbetween wealth and poverty is more pronounced and\nunacceptable than ever. The disorderly expansion of\ntechnical and economic progress has intensified the gap\nbetween those who have the education and the means to\nadvance and those who lack both. The multiple legal\nand economic ties that unite nations are not sufficiently\njust and equitable, and they have become a conveyor\nbelt for the serious economic and financial crisis, which\nhas spread as quickly as a forest fire, affecting the\nmost vulnerable first. For some of the world\u2019s people,\nresorting to crime and terrorism or waging war in the\nname of ideological, ethnic or cultural beliefs seems to\nbe the easiest, if not the only available way to escape\npoverty and become the heroes of the global village.\nSuch acts of violence are abetted by the perverse use\nof communications technology and by the excessively\neasy access to the tools of war.\nIf, in the 1990s, the state of legal and political\nprogress allowed us to believe that the danger of nuclear\nwar had receded, today the likelihood of regional\nconflicts with unpredictable outcomes has once again\ncreated a threatening atmosphere that should impel us\nto intensify our efforts to establish a truly constructive\ndialogue within the international community.\nDuring the period of the Cold War, the United\nNations was a meeting place and a point of discussion\nand balance between the opposing Powers. The\nOrganization managed to support the decolonization\nand independence of a large number of new States and\nto mitigate, and even at times resolve, regional, bilateral\nand civil conflicts in a context that was nonetheless\nmarked by severe ideological confrontation. At the\nsame time, United Nations agencies made an important\nintellectual, political and judicial contribution to the\nuniversal recognition of human rights and strengthened\ncooperation for development and regional economic\nintegration. Those advances constituted fundamental\nprogress towards strengthening the rule of law, which\nitself provides a favourable framework and is the best\nguarantor of human rights and peaceful international\ncooperation. Allow me here to welcome the Declaration\nof the High-level Meeting of the General\nAssembly on the Rule of Law at the National and\nInternational Levels (resolution 67/1), which was\nadopted at the beginning of this session. The 67\nyears since the establishment of the United Nations\nalso include a distinguished history of humanitarian\ninterventions, peacekeeping operations and, more\nrecently, peacebuilding operations. Also of special\nimportance for the fate of humanity as a whole have been\nthe adoption of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\nNuclear Weapons and the activities of the International\nAtomic Energy Agency aimed at promoting universal\naccession to the Treaty, controlling the implementation\nof the Treaty and facilitating international cooperation\non the peaceful use of the atom.\nOver the past 20 years, the United Nations, together\nwith regional organizations, has made an essential\ncontribution to resolving a number of urgent situations,\nparticularly in Africa, by collaborating with the\nAfrican Union and other institutions of that continent.\nNonetheless, the current reality presents us with a\nUnited Nations system without the strength of unity and\npersuasion that could legitimately be expected of it; a\nsystem in which, unfortunately, power relationships are\nplayed out to the benefit of specific strategic interests.\nYet the possibilities that emerged at the end of the\nCold War seemed to portend a possible strengthening\nof the institutional and political presence of the\nUnited Nations in the service of world\u2019s most critical\nchallenges, such as climate change and the preservation\nof the environment. How is it possible that, despite\nuniversal adhesion to the Charter of the United Nations\nand the essential treaties, we are still unable to establish\na just and true form of global governance?\nThe Holy See would like to offer a moral answer\nto that question by calling attention to the importance\nof the values that, of necessity, underlie all human\nsocieties. Indeed, before engaging in political or\ntechnical considerations, it is important to ask whether\nthe crises currently convulsing the planet are linked to\na crisis of trust in the collective values enshrined in\nthe very Charter of the United Nations. Moreover, the\nquestion arises whether the crises afflicting the planet\nare linked to a serious anthropological crisis, which\nis to say the lack of a shared understanding of what it\nmeans to be human.\nToday we are witnessing a weakening in the\npractical reach of the purposes and principles set out in the Preamble and Chapter I of the Charter.\nI note in particular saving succeeding generations\nfrom the scourge of war, practicing tolerance with\na spirit of good-neighbourliness, uniting strength\nfor the maintenance of peace and security, recourse\nto peaceful means to settle disputes, in conformity\nwith the principles of justice and international law,\nand cooperation to solve international problems of an\neconomic, social, cultural or humanitarian character\nand to promote and encourage respect for human rights\nand for fundamental freedoms.\nThe loss of trust in the value of dialogue and the\ntemptation to favour a priori one party in national\nor regional conflicts endanger respect for the legal\nmechanisms of the United Nations. However, the\npre-eminence of the values affirmed by the Charter\nshould lead to the adoption of all means possible to\nguarantee the protection of the most vulnerable, uphold\nthe rule of law and human rights, and safeguard ancient\ncultural and religious balances.\nMr. Gaspar Martins (Angola), Vice-President, took \nthe Chair.\nThe urgency of the situation is all the more obvious\ngiven the events taking place in the Middle East,\nespecially in Syria. There can be no solution outside\nthe rules of international law and humanitarian law\nand implementation of mechanisms established by the\nCharter of the United Nations. All parties concerned\nmust not only do everything possible to facilitate the\nmission of the Joint Special Representative of the\nUnited Nations and the League of Arab States for Syria,\nbut also to guarantee humanitarian aid to populations\nin distress. The international community must unite its\nefforts to ensure that all parties concerned substitute\nnegotiation for recourse to arms and demand effective\nrespect for religious freedom, human rights and all\nfundamental freedoms.\nAs Pope Benedict XVI recently reiterated during\nhis trip to Lebanon, we should import ideas of peace\nand creativity, we should find ways of accepting each\nperson in his otherness, we should therefore make\nvisible before the world the respect that religions have\nfor one another, respect for man as a creature of God,\nand love of neighbour as fundamental to all religions. In\nthat way, using all possible means, including material\nassistance, we must help to bring an end to war and\nviolence so that all can help rebuild the peace. On his\nreturn from Lebanon, the Holy Father called on Arab countries, as brothers, to propose workable solutions\nthat respect the dignity, the rights and the religion of\nevery individual. Those who wish to build peace must\ncease to see in the other an evil to be eliminated. It is\nnot easy to see in the other a person to be respected and\nloved, and yet that is necessary if one desires to build\npeace, if one desires fraternity.\nMoreover, only an international community\nstrongly rooted in values that genuinely uphold human\ndignity can provide viable solutions to the new types\nof conflict perpetrated by transnational groups,\nwhich spread a pseudo-religious hegemonic ideology\ncontemptuous of individual rights and civil peace. We\nthink of the instability and the recent terrorist attacks\nin some countries of Africa and Asia, or the collusion\nbetween drug trafficking and terrorism in other regions\nof the world.\nBeyond even situations of conflict, today all\nStates, rich and poor, see their stability threatened by\nthe economic crisis to which no true and sustainable\nsolution has been found to date. Just a few years\nago international discussions were essentially about\npotential ways to share the resources of the rich\ncountries, where well-being appeared to be firmly\nestablished, or about the legitimate recognition of\nthe rights of developing countries. The debate was\nabout finding the right balance between free trade\nand financial assistance; the transfer of know-how,\ntechnologies and direct aid to the poorest populations;\nthe clash of ideas about the foreign debt of the poorest\ncountries; the role of the World Trade Organization and\nits connections to the United Nations; the reform of\nmultilateral financial institutions; and comprehensive\naccess to essential drugs.\nThat unavoidable debate must be continued, even\nif today it is overshadowed and made more complex by\nthe issues related to financial stability, whose impact is\nglobal. In fact, we can all see that the financial stability\nof the most developed societies has been seriously\nendangered, especially because of shortsighted\neconomic policies often based only on maximizing\nshort-term profits.\nThe threat of collapse of financial systems in\neconomies that were until now the most prosperous\nhas serious consequences for social cohesion. It has led\nto the resurgence of old fantasies such as exacerbated\nnationalism, populism and xenophobia. Add to that the\ntragedy of millions of people weighed down by hunger, the lack of basic health care and abject poverty, as well\nas of vast populations living in inhuman conditions,\ndisplaced populations and refugees, among whom are\nthousands of children.\nGiven the difficulty of finding common solutions\nthat respect the principles of self-determination,\nindependence, and the equality of States and the right\nof peoples, the anthropological crisis of which I spoke\nhas emerged, that is, a lack of conviction in the supreme\ndignity of every individual, even when they have just\nbeen conceived or are in a vegetative or terminal state.\nIt is an illusion to want to create true harmony\namong peoples, to guarantee peaceful coexistence\nand real cooperation between States if we confine\nourselves to a vision of mankind that \u2014 without in\ntheory denying the importance of the dignity and\nfundamental rights of the individual \u2014 consigns the\nprofound dimension of the person and his uniqueness\nto the rank of secondary factors, and insists on vague\ncollective concepts that reduce the individual to the\nsimple category of consumer or agent of production in\nthe market. A human being is not a mere number in\nthe masses of the global population. And the masses of\nthe global population cannot be viewed coldly or with\nsuspicion as a danger threatening the environmental and\nsocial balances. We are talking about men and women,\neach with dignity and rights. Ideological visions that\ndo not take that into account lead irreparably to social\ndisintegration and conflict.\nIn that sense, we must reject attempts to view the\nMillennium Development Goals and the post-2015\ndevelopment agenda, as well as the interpretation of\nhuman rights treaties, on the basis of a limited and\nrelativist vision of humankind that, cleverly using\nambiguous expressions, threatens the right to life and\npresents a deconstruction of the family model based on\nthe union of a man and a woman and oriented towards\nprocreation and the education of children. In the end,\nthose attempts risk the irremediable weakening of the\ncredibility and legitimacy of the Organization as a\nuniversal tool for sustainable cooperation and peace.\nIt is of the first importance to provide an effective\nsolution to the open debate on the reform and\nimprovement of the functioning of United Nations\norgans in order to revitalize its ability to anticipate\nconflicts and resolve them peacefully. However, that\nwill be possible only with a constantly renewed effort\nto return to the founding vision of the Organization.  Sustainable peace will not be possible without each and\nevery one of us engaging in a constructive dialogue\ndirected toward achieving dignified and decent living\nconditions for all human beings.\nThat can be done only through a shared belief with\nregard to fundamental values that guarantee respect\nfor human life. In that regard, respect for religious\nfreedom is essential, within national public life as well\nas internationally. Reason tells us that each person has\ntranscendental dignity, which brings with it freedom\nto determine one\u2019s own ultimate destiny and which\nnational and international authorities, as well as social\nmechanisms, must fully respect. That is why actions\nby Governments and international organizations must\nnecessarily strive to promote comprehensive human\ndevelopment, creating legal, economic and social\nconditions that genuinely reflect the importance of\nhuman dignity and its transcendental dimension, both\nat the personal level and collectively.\nReligion should not be thought of other than as\na factor of peace and progress, a living force for the\nwell-being of all. Indeed, it leads human beings to\novercome every egotistical interest and to devote their\nenergies to the service of others, including for peace\namong peoples. That is why all forms of fanaticism\nand exclusivism and all acts of violence towards\none\u2019s neighbour are an exploitation of and a deviation\nfrom religion. Moreover, history has shown that a\nbiased concept of secularism, or tolerance that would\nlimit religious matters to the private sphere, can only\nundermine the bases for peaceful coexistence, at both\nthe national and international levels.\nThe Holy See has been involved in international\ncooperation activities since they were first given\ninstitutional structure. We established our Permanent\nMission to the United Nations in New York in 1964. The\nreason for its presence as a subject of international law in\nthis intergovernmental institution is first of all its desire\nto offer to the international community a transcendent\nview of life and social relations, recalling in particular\nthe dignity of the individual and his fundamental\nrights, in the first place the right to religious freedom.\nThe international community has always welcomed\nthis contribution, which allows common initiatives\nto put back into a profound perspective, in which the\nunderlying unity of the human family and the call to\nthe generosity of individuals and peoples must always\nbe reaffirmed.  It is in that spirit that the Holy See wishes to offer\nits contribution to the present session of the General\nAssembly, aligning itself with the wish you expressed in\nyour inaugural address, Mr. President, that all Member\nStates, which share the responsibility to implement the\nprinciples and objectives of the Organization, would\nrenew their commitment to resolve disputes by peaceful\ndialogue and not by resorting to confrontation. Only\nin that way will the aspirations and hopes of all be\nachieved. Only in that way can the United Nations play\nits indispensable role in peace and development."

        "file_text": "\ufeffI would like to congratulate\nPresident Jeremi\u0107 on his election and to thank Mr. Nassir\nAbdulaziz Al-Nasser for having successfully presided\nover the General Assembly at its previous session.\nI also wish to express my deepest gratitude to\nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon for having visited my\ncountry this past July. As we are marking the twentieth\nanniversary of our admission to the United Nations, his\nvisit came as a recognition of the fact that Bosnia and\nHerzegovina has travelled a long way since joining the\nOrganization, having transformed itself from a recipient\nof security assistance into a contributor to global peace\nand security.  I also want to commend the Secretary-General for\nhis tireless efforts to advance dialogue and cooperation,\nand for his firm commitment to the core values and\nprinciples of the United Nations. We in Bosnia and\nHerzegovina recognize the importance of, and fully\nsupport, his action agenda, which identified five\ngenerational imperatives: prevention, a more secure\nworld, helping countries in transition, empowering\nwomen and youth, and sustainable development.\nToday\u2019s world is the scene of unfolding crises and\nmounting global challenges. The first and foremost of\nthese is the disaster in Syria. As we stand here, our\nfellow Syrians are fighting against a brutal regime.\nThey are fighting to take their destiny into their own\nhands. The regime of Bashar Al-Assad is answering\ntheir yearning for freedom and democracy with guns\nand bombs, just as his father\u2019s regime did 30 years ago.\nThat is revolting and morally reprehensible \u2014 but so is\nour collective failure to stop it.\nOnce again, we are idly standing by while a human\ntragedy of dramatic proportions is unfolding before our\neyes. We should do our part to help the Syrian people\u2019s\nhistoric stand for freedom. We should do our part to\nsave the people of Syria from tyranny. We should, but\nwe are not.\nThe images coming from Syria remind us of the\ntragedy of Bosnia. We in Bosnia and Herzegovina feel\nthe pain of the Syrian people as our own because we\nwent through the same horrors not that long ago. When\nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon visited Srebrenica with me this July to pay his respects to the genocide\nvictims, he said:\n\u201cThe international community must be united\nnot to see any further bloodshed in Syria because\nI do not want to see any of my successors, after 20\nyears, visiting Syria, apologizing for what we could\nhave done to protect the civilians in Syria \u2014 which\nwe are not doing now\u201d.\nHis predecessor, Kofi Annan, stated in the report\non the fall of Srebrenica:\n\u201cThrough error, misjudgment and an inability\nto recognize the scope of the evil confronting us,\nwe failed to do our part to help save the people of\nSrebrenica ... The tragedy of Srebrenica will haunt\nour history forever\u201d (A/54/549, para. 503)\nToday, those words about the Organization\u2019s failure to\nrespond to the tragedy in Syria ring true.\nThe best way to honour the victims of the Srebrenica\ngenocide would have been to learn the lessons of that\nfailure and never commit the same errors again. Sadly,\nthe United Nations, especially the Security Council,\nhas failed to do that. The international community has\nchosen yet again to repeat the trial-and-error pattern\nof the policies that failed in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\nThe resolutions, statements of concern, ineffective\nsanctions, observers, and missions with no mandate\nto protect civilians are actions that have deadly\nconsequences, as demonstrated in my country.\nMake no mistake. Unless we act now, and act\ndecisively, to help the people of Syria and put an end to\nthe bloodshed there, that tragedy will haunt our history\nforever, just like Srebrenica.\nDevelopments at the beginning of the twenty-first\ncentury defy rational prediction. Indeed, who could\nhave predicted such an explosion of freedom in the\nMiddle East? In the last few years, we have witnessed a\nhistoric awakening in the Arab world. Profound social\nand political changes aimed at creating democratic\nsocieties are under way now \u2014 changes that have been\nfermenting for decades. They are the best confirmation\nthat Muslims strive vigorously for freedom, dignity\nand human rights. A well-educated, free-thinking\ngeneration of young Arabs has finally broken the\nchains of dictatorship. No force can prevent that new\ngeneration from taking charge of its destiny.\nAs a non-permanent member of the Security\nCouncil, Bosnia and Herzegovina strongly supported\nthe Arab peoples\u2019 aspirations for greater freedom and\ndemocracy. We acted to ensure that the international\ncommunity supported those who wanted free societies\ninstead of closed ones, the rule of law instead of\nthe rule of one individual, democracy instead of\ndictatorship, justice and fairness instead of oppression\nand corruption.\nThe stalemate in resolving the Israeli-Palestinian\nconflict is also deeply troubling. The peace process is\nnot moving forward, and the chain of violence has not\nbeen broken. A new impetus to negotiations is urgently\nneeded, because there is no alternative to a negotiated\nsolution. The Palestinians have every right \u2014 historical,\nmoral and legal \u2014 to a State of their own, but Israel has\nevery right to its security. The occupation of Palestinian\nterritories must end, but so must the terror and violence.\nAll attempts to create new realities on the ground in the\nhope that they will be accepted as a starting point for\nfuture negotiations must be rejected. The continuation\nof settlement activities in the occupied Palestinian\nterritories continues to pose the most serious obstacle\nto peace. Israel should immediately end all settlement\nactivities in the occupied Palestinian territories,\nbecause those activities are illegal under international\nlaw. Doing so is in Israel\u2019s own best interest if it truly\ndesires peace with the Palestinians.\nThe state of affairs of 60 or 6,000 years ago is not\nthe right point of reference. The right point of reference\nfor a solution is the principle of the peaceful coexistence\nof two sovereign States \u2014 an independent Palestine and\na secure Israel. That is the only realistic way to bring\nabout a just resolution to the conflict and to ensure\nstability and progress in the Middle East. To achieve\nsuch a solution, a more sincere attempt at good-faith\nnegotiations is needed, especially on the part of Israel.\nThe road to peace does not include ignoring United\nNations resolutions, squeezing the Palestinians onto\nbits and pieces of the land that once belonged to their\nfathers, and building settlements on those remaining\nbits of land.\nThe Organization needs to send a strong message\ndemanding that its resolutions be respected and that\nthere be no double standards or chosen peoples when\nit comes to the application of international legal norms\nand human rights principles. Over the past few weeks, we have witnessed\ndisturbing violence linked to intolerance. The video\nthat sparked those developments is deeply insulting. It\ndeserves the strongest condemnation, and we absolutely\nreject its content and message. There is no justification,\nhowever, for responding to that movie with violence.\nViolence in response to speech is unacceptable. There\ncan be no debate about that. Violence is no way to\nhonour religion. Responding to bigotry with violence\nonly further fans the flames of intolerance. We must\ndraw the line at violence, but we must also find a way to\nprevent hate speech and bigotry. Yes, there is the right\nto free speech, but there is also the right to dignity.\nWe cannot impose our ideology or our religion on\nanyone else. We must promote tolerance, but we must\nalso promote mutual respect. That is why, as responsible\nleaders, we should have a frank debate about the outer\nlimits of free expression when that freedom is abused\nto incite hate and deliberately slander the dignity of\nothers.\nThere is no inherent contradiction between Islamic\nand Western values. On the contrary, those values are\ncompatible. After all, they are derived from the same\nsources. Throughout history, interactions between\nthose values have led to tremendous achievements.\nThere need be no clash. There are only those who need\nto create a false perception of a clash in order to come\nto power or maintain their hold on it.\nSo many societies in today\u2019s world are in transition,\nyearning to find a balance between traditional and\nmodern values. The relationship between the West and\nthe Islamic world and between their respective value\nsystems is going to be one of the most critical issues\nof our time. That relationship will go through crises\nand periods of misunderstanding and intolerance. In\nthe modern age, we need to continue to seek a formula,\nwhich is to say a model, for how to reconcile Islamic\nand Western values, East and West. No matter how hard\nit may be, finding that formula is going to be essential\nin the time ahead of us.\nThe human condition is one of diversity. Our human\nrace is a mosaic composed of a rich variety of peoples,\ncultures and religions that shine together in a dynamic,\nsparkling pattern. Our responsibility is to nurture and\nprotect that mosaic.\nI come from a country whose historical experience\ncan offer valuable lessons in finding a model for peaceful\ncoexistence within such diversity. The whole world can benefit from the lessons that my country has learned\nfrom constantly seeking to improve its understanding\nand management of diversity. For hundreds of years,\nits citizens lived in harmony, helping each other build\nhouses of worship that are physically almost leaning\non each other. The westernmost range of Orthodox\nChristianity and Islam, the easternmost range of\nCatholicism, Bosnia is a meeting point of civilizations,\na bridge between East and West. Its unique multi-ethnic\nculture has been woven through a thousand years of\ntolerance and respect among its citizens, regardless of\ntheir ethnic and religious affiliation. That is why its\npreservation and success, as a specific microcosm, is\ncrucial for the whole world.\nHowever, owing to our recent past, a great struggle\nis now under way in my country between the idea of\ncoexistence and the idea of division. I believe that the\noutcome of that struggle will have a significant bearing\non resolving one of the greatest challenges of our\ntime, that of conflict versus cooperation. If the idea of\ncoexistence and cooperation does not prevail in Bosnia,\nit can hardly prevail anywhere else in the world. If the\nunique social fabric of my country, which was torn by\ncrimes and force, is not restored, that will be a defeat\nfor the very idea of coexistence, which will produce a\nwidening gap at one of the most delicate fault lines of\nthe world.\nThe growing power of humankind brings progress\nand prosperity. Yet the selfish side of that power cuts\ninto the very substance on which our future depends,\nnamely, our physical habitat and our spiritual essence.\nThe world we live in is changing at a speed and\nin a direction that is rightfully worrisome. Inequality,\ninjustice and intolerance are on the rise. There is more\nconflict and less cooperation. There is ever more\nviolence and ever less compassion, solidarity, mutual\ncare, healthy interpersonal relations and family life.\nPeople around the world are taking to the streets, which\nis a dramatic warning that there is less and less fairness\nin the societies in which they live.\nThose unsettling trends can be reversed only by\ndecisive and coordinated global action. The future we\ndesire will not be just a utopia if we join our forces\nto find the right solutions. Cooperative approaches are\ndifficult to accomplish but are needed more than ever. We are not perfect, and we can be better. We can\nbe wiser, more responsible, more willing to learn from\nour past mistakes. Too often we have been prisoners\nof our own mentalities. We perceive willingness to\ncompromise as a weakness, but just the opposite is\ntrue \u2014 compromise requires courage. To build a future\nwe must make compromises. To succeed we must\nstop indulging in manipulative kinds of populism. We\nmust break out of the worn and frayed patterns of the\npast. We must turn to the future. Instead of having\nendless debates about what has been, we must devote\nourselves to reaching agreements about what can be.\nWe must more correctly interpret the interests of those\nwe represent. We must listen to the views of others, no\nmatter how different those views might be. We must\nunderstand each other better and respect each other\nmore.\nOur most important mission in the time to come\nwill be to build bridges between cultures, religions and\ncivilizations \u2014 bridges of trust, understanding and\nrespect, bridges to reach out to problems the true nature\nof which we have only begun to understand. That is hard\nwork that requires daring leadership. The Organization\nhas undergone difficult trials, but it has always been the\nbest framework for building those bridges. Let us keep\nit that way as we go forward."

I wish him every success in his endeavours.\nWe would also like to commend the efforts of His\nExcellency Ambassador Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser\non his successful presidency of the previous session.\nI would be remiss if I did not pay tribute to His\nExcellency Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his\ncontinued efforts in leading the Organization and\nspreading its noble message on the maintenance of\ninternational peace and security. I wish him every\nsuccess in achieving the priorities he has set for\nhis second term, in the political, economic and\nhumanitarian fields.\nOn our part, we reaffirm the continued cooperation\nof the State of Kuwait and its full commitment\nto support the efforts of the United Nations in its\nendeavours to achieve the aims and purposes of the\nCharter, as well as to strengthen and activate its role in\nfollowing up the outcomes agreed upon in international\nforums. In that context, the State of Kuwait emphasizes\nthe need for a thorough preparation of the 2012\nconference on the establishment of a Middle East zone\nfree of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass\ndestruction, as agreed in the Final Document of the\n2010 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on\nthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. Numerous\nchallenges face the Organization as it nears its seventh\ndecade. From its inception, the United Nations and all\nof its organs and agencies have worked to contain and\nresolve many crises and to meet political, humanitarian\nand economic challenges. However, in this era of\nglobalization and the information revolution, poor\ncoordination, f laws in joint actions and the failure of\nsome States to fulfil their obligations have prevented\nthe United Nations from reaching conclusive solutions.\nTherefore, in fulfilment of the aspirations of the\npeoples we represent, it is important for us to work on\nreforming, developing and refining the United Nations,\nas well as providing the firm political will to enhance\nits performance and to face up to new challenges.\n\nThere have been two decades of discussion and\nin-depth negotiation on the reform of the Security\nCouncil, focused mainly on the expansion of the\nCouncil\u2019s membership, including how many members\nare needed to achieve an equitable degree of\nrepresentation, and on improving its working methods.\nThe State of Kuwait reaffirms the need to reform\nthe Security Council to reflect the new international\nreality and to ensure that Arab and Islamic States are\nrepresented fairly, in conformity with their size, their\ncontributions and their role in advancing the purposes\nand principles of the Charter of the United Nations.\nI should like to quote from the statement delivered\nby His Highness the Amir of the State of Kuwait at the\nSummit of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation\nheld in the Holy City of Mecca on 13 August:\n\u201cThe killing and destruction that we witness on a\ndaily basis in sisterly Syria evokes grief and pain.\nSadly, a child who has lost his parents and his home,\na mother mourning her nearest and dearest, cities\nthat have turned into ghost towns owing to the\nhorrific destruction that has befallen them \u2014 these\nhave become all too familiar sights. Such scenes\nredouble our responsibilities before the Almighty\nas well as before all our peoples. I call upon us to\nmove without delay to put an end to this bloody\ntragedy\u201d.\nWe would like to congratulate Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi,\nJoint Special Representative of the United Nations and\nthe League of Arab States for Syria, on his appointment.\nKuwait supports him in his undertaking and his\ndetermination to continue the work of his predecessor,\nMr. Kofi Annan, which yielded the six-point plan that\nwould have resulted in a peaceful resolution of the crisis,\nhad it been actively considered. We reaffirm Kuwait\u2019s\ncommitment to international efforts to reach a political\nsolution that fulfils the demands and aspirations of\nthe Syrian people. We would also like to redouble our\nefforts with the international community, to which\nwe appeal for additional humanitarian assistance to\nalleviate the pain and suffering of the Syrian people,\nboth within and outside Syria.\nThis November, the State of Kuwait will celebrate\nthe fiftieth anniversary of the ratification of its\nConstitution, which is regarded as the culmination\nof four centuries of political progress and growth.In\nconsolidation the development of relations between ruler\nand ruled towards the effective practice of democracy, the Constitution is considered the beacon that guides\nthe State of Kuwait, its Government and people towards\na dignified life by establishing rights and duties,\nguaranteeing basic freedoms, outlining general policies\nand regulating foreign relations without interference in\nthe internal affairs of other States. The Constitution\nserves as an interpretation of Kuwait\u2019s political vision,\nbased on its belief in, and pursuit of, peace, together\nwith its determination to develop and foster its relations\nwith neighbouring countries, in accordance with the\nprinciples of mutual respect and common interests.\n\nRelations between Kuwait and Iraq have\nprogressed very positively, and the State of Kuwait\nregards the painful wound of invasion as healed. The\nparticipation of His Highness Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad\nAl-Jaber Al-Sabah, Amir of the State of Kuwait,\nin the Arab Summit held in Baghdad in March did\nmuch to bring about a qualitative leap forward in our\nbilateral relations. Moreover, the visit to Kuwait by\nHis Excellency Mr. Nuri Kamel al-Maliki, Prime\nMinister of Iraq, created an atmosphere of trust and\ndetermination that has helped to turn the page with\nrespect to commitments and relations between our two\ncountries. Subsequently, a second round of meetings\nof the Joint Kuwait-Iraq Ministerial Committee was\nconvened in Baghdad in April, reflecting the desire of\nboth sides to turn away from the past.\nImportant understandings reflecting the interests\nof the our countries have been reached on some\nof the outstanding bilateral issues. There has been\nagreement also on a work programme to accelerate\nIraq\u2019s implementation of its remaining international\nobligations, in accordance with the relevant Security\nCouncil resolutions, whereupon Iraq will have fulfilled\nits obligations under Chapter VII of the Charter of the\nUnited Nations and will be able to exercise its natural\nrole regionally and internationally. That development\nwill help to improve the climate for achieving regional\nsecurity and peace, which are prerequisites for the\nprosperity and progress of a region that has suffered\nfrom wars and devastating conflicts for the past three\ndecades.\nOn the regional level, the State of Kuwait renews\nits call to the friendly Islamic Republic of Iran to take\ndeliberate and effective steps towards cooperating\nwith international efforts aim at reaching a political\nsettlement with regard to its nuclear programme and at dispelling doubts surrounding its goals and purposes,\nthereby averting further crises and conflicts, which,\nunfortunately, have become associated with this vital\nregion of the world. We hope that the Islamic Republic\nof Iran will be a positive and active party in the region,\nexercising its role in accordance with the basic rules\nand principles of mutual respect and common interests,\nthereby creating a normal environment of cooperation\nthat will serve the peoples of the region, free from\ninterference in their internal affairs.\nAlong the same lines, we also hope that the Islamic\nRepublic of Iran will cooperate and respond to the\ninitiatives intended to resolve the conflict over the\nthree occupied Emirati islands, in conformity with the\nprinciples and norms of international law.\nThe continued Israeli occupation of Palestinian\nterritories testifies to the inability of the international\ncommunity to come up with solutions that will put\nan end to the plight of the Palestinian people. The\nIsraeli Government, in gross violation of international\nconventions and norms, persists in its intransigence and\nillegal policies through its expansion of settlements in\nthe occupied Palestinian territory, as well as through its\nblockade of the Gaza Strip. Those actions do not help\nthe cause of the just and lasting peace we desire in the\nMiddle East. We therefore demand that the international\ncommunity, represented by the Security Council, put\npressure on Israel and compel it to implement the\nresolutions of international legitimacy, the principle of\nland for peace, the Quartet\u2019s road map and the Arab\nPeace Initiative, so as to guarantee the establishment of\nthe Palestinian State, with East Jerusalem as its capital,\nand the total Israeli withdrawal from all Arab territories\noccupied since 4 June 1967.\nSome States face special and chronic challenges that\nhave led to their marginalization on the international\nscene for many long years. They are at risk of becoming\nfailed States if the international community does not\nredouble its efforts to help them get back on their\nfeet and start them on a path that will enable them to\nfunction normally and to become effective participants\nin today\u2019s world.\nIn that regard, the State of Kuwait welcomes the\ndecisions and steps taken by President Abdrabuh\nMansour Hadi Mansour and the Yemeni Government\nto implement the Gulf Cooperation Council\u2019s initiative\nand its implementation mechanism, and to support\nfinalization of the Initiative\u2019s remaining items. We\nalso reaffirm our confidence that Yemen, under an elected President and a Government of national unity,\nis capable of achieving the development and progress in\nvarious areas that the fraternal Yemeni people aspire to.\nWe also reaffirm our continued backing and support for\nthe Yemeni Republic\u2019s efforts to ensure political and\neconomic stability.\nWe would also like to congratulate the\nfraternal Republic of Somalia on the great historic\naccomplishment represented by its ratification of a\nprovisional constitution and the election of Mr. Hassan\nSheikh Mohamud as President. We hope that these\npositive developments will help lift Somalia from a\nstate of conflict and national chaos to one governed\nby constitutional institutions, thus launching a\nnew political future that will see the ambitions and\naspirations of the fraternal Somali people fulfilled.\nWe commend the positive reaction of the United\nNations and the international community to the bloody\nevents that the Muslim minority in Myanmar has been\nsubjected to, and hope that those efforts will help to\nstop the violence, preserve people\u2019s legitimate rights\nand enable peace to prevail.\nThe President returned to the Chair.\nThe peoples and Governments of Islamic countries\nhave expressed their strong condemnation and outrage\nover the film denigrating the Prophet Muhammad,\nGod\u2019s blessing and peace be upon him, and the Islamic\nfaith and its benevolent values. That irresponsible and\nimpudent act has ignited extreme rage among Muslim\npeoples and communities all over the world, including\nacts of violence, destruction, and killings in some\ncountries. While the State of Kuwait has denounced\nthe film in the strongest possible terms, as well as the\nsubsequent killing and destruction, which are very far\nfrom the spirit and essence of Islam, in this context I\nwould like to recall what His Highness Sheikh Sabah\nAl-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah, Amir of the State of\nKuwait, proposed at the General Assembly\u2019s high-\nlevel meeting on the culture of peace, held on 12 and\n13 November 2008:\n\u201cThe best outcome to our well-intended\ngathering in this Hall would be a joint international\ncommitment to respect all religions and to avoid\ndamaging, interfering with or ridiculing their\nsymbols, while endeavouring to deter such acts and\nthose who advocate them.\u201d (A/63/PV.46, p. 10) We urge the Assembly to give serious consideration\nat this session to the Amir\u2019s proposal and adopt a\nresolution to implement it for the benefit of the whole\nof humankind and to promote social peace and security\namong nations.\nOur world faces numerous environmental, economic,\nsocial and security issues. Those issues are intertwined\nand complex and the source of many challenges to\nStates and peoples, particularly in developing and least-\ndeveloped countries. The consequences of the global\nfinancial crisis, the rise in basic commodity prices, the\nclear negative impact of climate change, the growing\nfrequency of natural disasters and the intensification\nof terrorism have put the focus on the ugly face of\npoverty and hunger, as well as the spread of epidemics\nand communicable and dangerous diseases. Despite the\nnotable accomplishments of many States in their efforts\nto reach the Millennium Development Goals, we have\nnot yet achieved all the objectives we set ourselves as\na whole. It is essential, therefore, that we pursue our\njoint efforts to limit the effects of the challenges we\nface and contain them in order to ensure our ultimate\nfull attainment of these noble goals.\nWhile the State of Kuwait is itself considered a\ndeveloping country, since gaining independence in\n1961 it has embarked on a steady course in which we\nattach great importance to helping developing and least-\ndeveloped countries. We do this through numerous\nmechanisms and initiatives, including the Kuwait\nFund for Arab Economic Development, which gives\ndevelopment aid to Arab, Asian and African countries,\nas well as countries in Central and Latin America,\nbased on our belief in the importance of international\ncooperation and helping nations and peoples in need.\nBased on our desire to increase joint regional and\ninternational activities and enhance their effectiveness,\nand in recognition of the fact that various forums held\naround the world have become major channels for\nexamining regional and economic cooperation and\nmaximizing the benefits derived from sharing States\u2019\nsuccessful experiences, in October last year Kuwait\nhosted the most recent meeting of the Asia Cooperation\nDialogue (ACD), held annually for the past 10 years\nat the level of Foreign Minister of the participating\ncountries. Kuwait also called for the convening of the\nfirst Summit of the ACD countries, to be held in Kuwait\non 15 and 16 October. We hope that this meeting will\ngive leaders of Asian States the opportunity to discuss\nevery topic of importance in the areas of economic, environmental and humanitarian affairs. In March\n2013 Kuwait will also host the Arab-African Summit,\nwhich we hope will deepen Arab-African cooperation\nand open new horizons to serve stability, development\nand cooperation among the peoples of these two groups\nof countries.\nIn conclusion, I affirm the State of Kuwait\u2019s\nallegiance to the multilateral international system and\nto the principles and purposes of the United Nations\nCharter. We also believe in the necessity for all States\nto abide by the obligations and responsibilities they\nhave committed to in international agreements and\nconferences, thus contributing to finding just and fair\nsolutions to global threats and challenges.\nThe State of Kuwait believes that dialogue and the\npromotion of a culture of tolerance, moderation and\nrejection of violence and extremism are ideal means\nfor advancing the values of equality and justice, in\norder to reach our higher goal \u2014 the maintenance of\ninternational peace and security."

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt is a great honour\nto deliver these remarks on behalf of Montenegro. At the\noutset, allow me to address two friends and colleagues.\nI would like to congratulate you, Sir, on your election to\npreside over the General Assembly at its sixty-seventh\nsession. You will enjoy, as always, the full cooperation\nand support of Montenegro in this important task. I\nwould also like to pay tribute to Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz\nAl-Nasser for his contribution to the work of the\nGeneral Assembly, especially in promoting mediation\nas a means of settling disputes by peaceful means.\nI extend special appreciation to Secretary-General\nBan Ki-moon for his efforts to promote multilateralism\nand joint action in ensuring a peaceful, secure and\nprosperous world. I would especially like to reiterate\nour satisfaction with his recent successful visit to\nMontenegro, which confirmed the strong partnership\nbetween the United Nations and my country.\nMontenegro has always been strongly committed\nto multilateral cooperation and respect for the purposes\nand principles enshrined in the Charter of the United\nNations. We have demonstrated this in our region by\npromoting good-neighbourly relations and regional\ncooperation, as well as worldwide through support\nfor and participation in global efforts to build and\nmaintain peace.\nThe High-level Meeting on the Rule of Law that\npreceded the general debate once again stressed the\nimportance of democratic governance and respect\nfor human rights. These are preconditions for the\nprosperity of all our citizens and of society as a whole.\nFailure in this regard is our common concern. We\ntherefore stress the individual responsibility of all\ncountries to strengthen the rule of law and promote\nhuman rights, as well as the role of the United Nations\nin providing adequate and efficient support to these\nefforts. Respect for the rule of law at the international\nlevel, national ownership of rule of law activities, and\nthe incorporation and effective implementation of\ninternational norms within our domestic legal systems\nare our key objectives.\nStrengthening international partnership in\nmaintaining and building peace and security is\ncrucial. As a Mediterranean country, we share the\nconcerns of the international community for the recent\ndevelopments in the southern Mediterranean and the\nMiddle East.\nThe scale and consequences of the violence in\nSyria serve as a stern reminder of the importance of\npreventive measures in preserving international peace\nand security; hence the need to enhance United Nations\npreventive capacities and the role of dialogue and\nmediation in peaceful conflict resolution. Montenegro\nstrongly advocates an approach that emphasizes the early prevention and elimination of threats before they\nevolve into sources of conflict.\nThe responsibility to protect and its\noperationalization remain a key task. In the era\nof accountability, perpetrators of crimes against\nhumanity should not go unpunished. Countries need\nto demonstrate strong commitment to the rule of law,\nrespect for human rights and freedoms, democracy and\nnon-use of force in settling disputes.\nMontenegro stands ready to increase its participation\nin peacekeeping operations, in accordance with its\ncapacities and in line with international efforts. We\nsupport in particular United Nations initiatives aimed\nat improving civilian protection and the development\nof civilian capacities for maintaining stability by\nadvancing the mandates of peacekeeping missions.\nIn that context, we fully support the implementation\nof Security Council resolution 1325 (2000) and\nstrengthening the role of women in conflict and post-\nconflict situations.\nMy country is firmly dedicated to the comprehensive\nimplementation of the United Nations Global Counter-\nTerrorism Strategy, as well as the United Nations\nsanctions regime. With regard to the Global Strategy\nreview, we fully endorse the proposal of the Secretary-\nGeneral to appoint a United Nations counter-terrorism\ncoordinator in order to improve strategic coordination,\ncoherence and substantive implementation of the\nStrategy.\nWe strongly support global efforts for disarmament\nand non-proliferation, while stressing that the\nfight against transnational threats, such as human\ntrafficking, cybercrime and the illicit drug trade,\nrequire a comprehensive approach.\nAs a multicultural country, Montenegro builds\nits society on principles of understanding, tolerance\nand mutual respect. Diversity does not divide but\nenriches our society, thanks to tradition and trust built\nthroughout the long Montenegrin history. As we have\nrecently witnessed, differences can be abused and\neasily turn into senseless acts of violence against the\ninnocent, which is unacceptable. My country therefore\nremains committed to promoting intercultural dialogue,\ntolerance and respect at all levels.\nIn the six years following the restoration of its\nindependence, Montenegro has achieved significant\nprogress, both in internal development and in\ninternational relations. We have very good relations\nwith all our neighbours, while the region as a whole\nstands before a unique challenge to demonstrate that it\nis capable of reinforcing overall cooperation.\nMontenegro actively participates in all regional\nprocesses and initiatives aimed at intensifying mutual\nand constructive cooperation and strengthening\nsecurity and stability in South-East Europe. After\nits turbulent past, the region is brought together by\nthe common strategic goal of European integration.\nAlthough there remain issues that need international\nassistance and support, we have achieved a new\nlevel of trust, development and maturity that have\nresulted in the individual progress of each country in\nEuropean and Euro-Atlantic integration. The opening\nof European Union accession negotiations in June this\nyear and our continuous progress on our Euro-Atlantic\npath represent strong recognition of the results we have\nachieved. We are fully focused on and committed to\ncontinuing the implementation of reforms and reaching\nthe highest international standards, in particular in the\nareas of the rule of law, human rights and freedoms, and\ndemocratic governance. Strengthening institutional and\nhuman capacities will reinforce our political stability\nand economic prosperity, as is essential in this time of\never-evolving crises that affect us all.\nProgress in the integration processes does not mean\nthe absence of problems. We attach great importance\nto resolving issues essential for the development of our\nsociety, such as the empowerment of women, improving\nthe situation of the Roma population, and settling the\nstatus of refugees, internally displaced persons and other\nvulnerable groups. We are fully committed to tackling\nthese complex challenges through efficient and lasting\nsolutions and models for the better social integration\nof every individual. We are particularly aware of this\nat times when social and economic disparities become\nmore visible and demand stronger efforts by the State\nfor their elimination.\nThe promotion of and respect for human rights\nare important goals in our internal and foreign policy\nagenda. We are therefore confident that Montenegro\nwill gain the trust of States Members of the United\nNations this coming November and be elected to the\nHuman Rights Council for the period 2013-2015. We are\nstrongly committed to contributing to the efficiency and\neffectiveness of the Council and the system of protection\nand improvement of human rights and freedoms.\nSupport for the United Nations High Commissioner for\nHuman Rights, full cooperation with the Council and its special procedures, and active promotion of human\nrights and freedoms at the international level in order\nto respond in a timely manner to situations of human\nrights violations in the world \u2014 these will be major\nguidelines for our activities in the Council.\nThe results of the implementation of the United\nNations Delivering as One reform programme speak\nin favour not only of reform of the Organization,\nbut also of even greater effectiveness in adapting\nthe United Nations to the development needs of a\ncountry. Montenegro has achieved tangible progress\nin implementing an integrated programme and, to\na certain extent, is already implementing the joint\nprogramming model as a next phase of Delivering\nas One. Strengthening national ownership and joint\nprogramming, as well as making use of the relative\nadvantages of the various United Nations agencies,\nare fundamental principles on which our cooperation\nprogramme is based up to 2016. We will continue to\nsupport all efforts aimed at improving the United\nNations system and its effectiveness and operational\nactivities in the field.\nSustainable development, poverty reduction and\neconomic growth, conflict and post-conflict situations\nare just some of the issues that require joint action.\nIn that context, sustainable development with all its\npillars stands out as our priority. Montenegro is among\nthe countries that are on track to meet the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). In that regard, we stress\nthe importance of the MDGs as a basis for defining\nsustainable development goals, which must be a central\npart of the global post-2015 development agenda and\nthus help us to form a clear expression of political\ncommitment to sustainable development. We stand\nready to actively contribute to shaping and determining\nthe necessary indicators, as well as timelines for\ntheir implementation. We believe that the question\nof sustainable development, as well as the issue of\nreaching legally binding agreements on climate change\nwithin the United Nations Framework Convention on\nClimate Change, must involve compromise on the part\nof United Nations Members. We therefore hope to see\npositive developments at the Doha Conference.\nA shared determination, openness and willingness\nto reach compromise and accept reality are all truly\nnecessary in order for us to move forward. Our\ncommitment to meeting the MDGs should not be\nneglected, however difficult the economic and financial\nsituation worldwide. Eradicating poverty, and creating partnerships with civil society and the private sector so\nas to enable us to achieve sustainable energy for all by\n2030, as well as the Zero Hunger Challenge launched\nby the Secretary-General, are our common objectives.\nTogether we can achieve those goals.\nAt a time when interdependence and integration\nare major trends in global politics, no country on its\nown can handle the increasingly demanding challenges\nposed by modern society. Cooperation is a prerequisite\nfor success. I am confident that small countries like\nMontenegro can play an important role and be part of\nthe solution. We remain dedicated to the principles of\ncooperation and mutual trust, and strongly committed\nto contributing to strengthening the United Nations\nsystem and its role in global governance, at both the\nnational and the international levels.\nBefore I conclude, allow me to add a small, personal\nnote. The first time I attended the General Assembly,\nI was an attach\u00e9 from the then Socialist Federative\nRepublic of Yugoslavia. Today, many years and three\ndifferent States later, I have the privilege of standing\nbefore the Assembly as head of the delegation of my\ncountry, Montenegro. The world may have changed in\nways we never anticipated, but our Organization and\nwhat it stands for have weathered the challenges and\nremain globally important and equally valuable for\nevery one of us."

        "file_text": "\ufeffI extend warm congratulations\nto Mr. Jeremi\u0107 and his country, Serbia, on his election\nas President of the General Assembly at its sixty-\nseventh session. My delegation is confident that, under\nhis leadership, this session will address all burning\nissues on its agenda. I assure him of my delegation\u2019s\ncooperation and support. I also wish to thank his\npredecessor for presiding over the General Assembly at\nits sixty-sixth session. Similarly, I wish to congratulate\nHis Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon on assuming his\nsecond mandate as Secretary-General at the beginning\nof this year.\nThe unresolved conflicts around the world demand\ncommitment and resolve from us all in order to find\ndurable solutions. I therefore commend the President\nfor choosing the theme for the debate at this session,\nnamely, \u201cAdjustment or settlement of international\ndisputes or situations by peaceful means\u201d. Namibia\nfirmly believes that, if we all dedicate ourselves to\nfinding lasting solutions to conflicts by peaceful\nmeans, our collective efforts will be successful. There\nis no better way to achieve peace than by upholding the\ncardinal principle of the peaceful settlement of disputes,\nas provided for under Chapter VI of the United Nations\nCharter.\n\nIn that regard, we should renew the original\ncommitment to peace and progress as essential values\nof the United Nations. Namibia believes that respect for\nthe sovereign equality of States, territorial integrity and\nindependence constitute the pillars of international law\nand, indeed, the bedrock of peaceful relations among\nnations. The violation of any of those principles poses a\nserious threat to international peace and security.\nRegional and subregional organizations are\nimportant partners in solving conflicts in affected\nareas throughout the world. Their contribution to\nconflict resolution is provided for under the United\nNations Charter. There is therefore a compelling need\nfor the United Nations to take into account the views\nof regional organizations in the areas of mediation\nand peacemaking. Such institutions should be fully\nsupported in finding lasting solutions to violent\nconflicts around the world.\nIn Africa, since its inception, the African Union\nPeace and Security Council has cooperated with the\nUnited Nations Security Council towards those shared\ngoals of conflict resolution. Similarly, the subregion\nof the Southern African Development Community has\nestablished initiatives to resolve political conflicts in\nthe region through mediation.\nHowever, we are concerned about the deteriorating\nsecurity situation in the eastern Democratic Republic of\nCongo. We therefore urge the international community\nto support the regional initiative aimed at resolving\nthat conflict and to provide humanitarian assistance to\ndisplaced persons. We call on all neighbouring countries\nto work together with the Congolese authorities to help\nresolve the conflict and to ensure that the sovereignty\nand territorial integrity of the Democratic Republic of\nthe Congo is not violated.\nIn Madagascar, we urge the Malagasy political\nactors to expedite the full implementation of the road\nmap leading to the holding of free, fair, inclusive and\ncredible elections.\nWith regard to the Sudan and South Sudan, Namibia\ncalls on the two countries to resolve all outstanding\nissues peacefully. In the Darfur region of the Sudan, we\nurge the Government and the other parties concerned to\nfind a negotiated and peaceful solution to the conflict.\nWe denounce the unconstitutional changes of\nGovernment in Mali and Guinea-Bissau that took place,\nrespectively, in March and April this year. Equally, Namibia resolutely rejects the secessionist attempts\nin northern Mali and the destruction of ancient\nshrines in Timbuktu. We wish to commend the role\nplayed by the Economic Community of West African\nStates (ECOWAS) in helping to resolve the conflicts\nin those two countries. At the same time, we urge\nthe international community to provide support and\nassistance to ECOWAS.\nNamibia welcomes the recent positive political\ndevelopments in Somalia, including the election of His\nExcellency Mr. Hassan Sheikh Mohamud as President\nof that country. I congratulate him and wish him well\nin the noble task of bringing normalcy and stability\nto that sister country. The international community\nshould continue to support the people of Somalia as\nthey embark upon the path to rebuild their country.\nFor many decades, the people of Western Sahara have\nbeen denied their inalienable right to self-determination\nand independence. Namibia reiterates its call for the\nimmediate and unconditional implementation of the\nUnited Nations Settlement Plan, leading to the holding\nof a free and fair referendum in Western Sahara.\nEqually, we wish to reaffirm our unequivocal\nsupport for the inalienable rights of the Palestinian\npeople to self-determination and national independence\non the basis of the relevant United Nations resolutions.\nEach year during the general debate, the majority\nof States Members of the United Nations express their\nconcern over the continued economic, commercial\nand financial blockade unilaterally imposed against\nthe Republic of Cuba, with its adverse effect on the\nCuban people. Thus, Namibia reiterates its call for the\nimmediate and unconditional lifting of the embargo\nagainst Cuba.\nNamibia attaches great importance to sustainable\ndevelopment and the search for the best ways to\nmitigate the adverse effects of climate change. In that\nregard, we will continue to actively cooperate with the\ninternational community to address climate change.\nIn that context, Namibia seeks the support of\nMember States in hosting the secretariat of the\nGreen Climate Fund in our capital city, Windhoek If\nsuccessful, that would provide an opportunity for a\ndeveloping country to host a United Nations agency\nof great importance. Given the opportunity, Namibia\nstands ready to discharge its obligations arising from hosting the Green Climate Fund secretariat. We count\non Member States\u2019 support.\nThe reform of the United Nations and its principal\norgans should seek to strengthen the Organization in\norder to make it more efficient, effective and responsive\nto the needs of all its Members. In that context,\nstrengthening the role and authority of the General\nAssembly is of paramount importance. Equally, the\nreform of the Security Council is at the core of the wider\nUnited Nations reform, given its primary responsibility\nfor the maintenance of international peace and security.\nNamibia reiterates its support for the common African\nposition on the reform of the Security Council.\n\nLet us rededicate ourselves to the principle of the\nsettlement of international disputes by peaceful means\nin order to save current and succeeding generations\nfrom the scourge of war and build a prosperous future\nfor our children."

Today, I want to raise and discuss such\nissues from a different perspective. Thousands of years\nhave passed since the children of Adam \u2014 peace be\nupon him \u2014 started to settle down in various parts of\nthe Earth. Peoples of different colours, inclinations,\nlanguages, customs and traditions persistently pursued\ntheir aspirations to build a noble society for a more\nbeautiful life, blessed with lasting peace, security and\nhappiness.\nDespite all of the efforts on the part of righteous\npeople and justice-seekers and the sufferings and pains\nendured by masses of people in the quest to achieve\nhappiness and victory, the history of humankind is\nmarked, except in rare cases, with unfulfilled dreams\nand failures.\nImagine, for a moment, that there had been no\negoism, distrust, malicious behaviour or dictatorships,\nwith no one violating the rights of others. Imagine that\nhumanitarian values had been viewed as the criterion\nfor social dignity instead of aff luence and consumerism\nImagine if humankind had not experienced the\nDark Ages and if the centres of power had not hindered\nthe flourishing of knowledge and constructive thoughts.\nImagine if the Crusades and the ensuing periods of\nslavery and colonialism had not happened, and if the\nsuccessors of the Dark Ages had followed a course\nbased on humanitarian principles.\nImagine if the First and Second World Wars in\nEurope, the wars in Korea, Viet Nam, Africa, Latin\nAmerica and in the Balkans not happened, and if,\ninstead of the occupation of Palestine and imposition\nof a fake Government, displacement and genocide of\nmillions of people around the globe, the truth behind\nthose wars based on justice had been revealed. Imagine\nif Saddam Hussein had not invaded Iran and the big Powers had supported the rights of the Iranian people\ninstead of siding with Saddam.\nImagine if the tragic incident of 11 September and\nthe military actions against Afghanistan and Iraq that\nleft millions killed and homeless had not happened, and\nif, instead of killing and throwing the culprit into the\nsea without trial or without informing the world and\npeople of America, an independent fact-finding team\nhad been formed to make the general public aware of\nthe truth behind the incident and to prepare the way for\nthe perpetrators to be brought to justice.\nImagine if extremism or terrorism had not been\nused to secure political goals, if arms had been turned\ninto pens, and if military expenditures had been used to\npromote well-being and amity among nations. Imagine\nif the drums of ethnic, religious or racial conflicts not\nbeen beaten, and if differences had not been used for\nthe purpose of advancing political agendas.\nImagine if the right to criticize the hegemonic\npolicies and actions of world Zionism had been\nrecognized so as to allow the world media to report\nfreely and shed light on the realities, instead of making\ndeceitful gestures of seeming to back freedom but in a\nway that offends the sanctities and most sacred beliefs\nof human beings and divine messengers, who, as the\npurest and most compassionate human beings, are the\ngift of the Almighty to humankind.\nImagine if the Security Council had not been under\nthe domination of a limited number of Governments,\nthus preventing the United Nations from carrying out\nits responsibilities in a just and equitable manner.\nImagine if international economic institutions had\nnot been under outside pressures and were allowed\nto perform their duties and functions by using their\nexpertise based on fairness and justice.\nImagine if world capitalists had not weakened or\nvictimized national economies in order to make up for\ntheir own mistakes. Imagine if integrity and honesty\nhad prevailed in international relations and if all nations\nand Governments were treated equally and justly in\nglobal efforts to build and expand happiness for all\nhumankind. And imagine if tens of other unfavourable\nsituations had not occurred throughout history, how\nbeautiful and pleasant our lives and how lovely the\nhistory of humankind would have been.\nLet us take a look at the state of the world today.\nWith regard to the economic situation, poverty is on the rise and the gap between the rich and the poor is\nwidening. The total foreign debt of 18 industrialized\ncountries exceeds $60 trillion, while the repayment\nof half of that amount would be sufficient to eradicate\npoverty in the world. Economies dependent on\nconsumerism and the exploitation of people only serve\nthe interests of a limited number of countries.\nThe creation of worthless paper assets through\ninfluence and control over the world\u2019s economic\ncentres constitutes the greatest abuse in history\nand is considered a major contributor to the global\neconomic crisis. It has been reported that $32 trillion\nin paper assets were printed by one Government alone.\nDevelopment planning, based on a capitalist economy,\nwhich runs in a vicious circle, triggers unhealthy and\ndevastating competition and is a failed practice.\nWith regard to the cultural situation, from the\nstandpoint of the politicians who control the centres of\nworld power, concepts such as moral principles, purity,\nhonesty, integrity, compassion and self-sacrifice are\ntypically rejected as defunct and outdated notions and\nan impediment to the accomplishment of their goals.\nThey openly talk about their disbelief in the relevance\nof ethics to political and social affairs.\nAuthentic and indigenous cultures, the product\nof centuries \u2014 old national efforts, the common\ndenominator of which reflects profound human feelings\nand love towards beauty and is the force that breeds\ndiversity, cultural life and social dynamism, are under\nconstant attacks and risk extinction. A specific lifestyle,\ndevoid of individual or social identity, is being imposed\non nations by the organized and systematic destruction\nand the humiliation of identities.\nThe family, the most noble social institution and\na centre emanating love and humankind, has been\nseriously weakened and its constructive role is on the\ndecline. The sublime role and nature of women as\nheavenly beings, manifestations of the divine image\nand beauty and the main pillars of every society, have\nbeen damaged and abused by the powerful and the\nwealthy. The human soul has become frustrated and the\nessence of humankind humiliated and suppressed.\nWith regard to the political and security situation,\nunilateralism, the application of double standards\nand the imposition of wars, instability and foreign\noccupation in order to ensure economic interests and\nexpand dominance over sensitive centres of the world\nhave become the order of the day. The arms race and intimidation by nuclear weapons and weapons of mass\ndestruction by the hegemonic Powers have become\nprevalent. Testing new generations of ultra-modern\nweaponry and the pledge to disclose those armaments\nin due time is now being used as part of a new language\nof threat against nations to coerce them into accepting\na new era of hegemony. The continued threat by the\nuncivilized Zionists to resort to military action against\nour great nation is a clear example of this bitter reality.\nA state of mistrust has cast its shadow on international\nrelations, while there is no trusted or just authority\nto help resolve world conflicts. No one feels secure\nor safe, even those who have stockpiled thousands of\natomic bombs and other arms in their arsenals.\nWith regard to the environment, which is a common\nresource and heritage of all humankind that ensures\nman\u2019s survival, it has been seriously damaged and\ndevastated as a result of the irresponsible and excessive\nuse of resources, particularly by capitalists across the\nworld. That situation that has caused massive drought,\nflood, and pollution, inf licting irreparable damage and\nseriously jeopardizing human life on Earth.\nDespite advances in scientific knowledge and\ntechnology, the aspirations of Adam\u2019s children have\nnot yet been fulfilled. Does anybody believe that the\ncontinuation of the current order is capable of bringing\nabout happiness for human society? Today everyone\nis discontented and disappointed with the current\ninternational order. Human beings do not deserve the\ncontinuous sufferings brought about by the present\nsituation. The God of wisdom and compassion, who\nloves all human beings, has not ordained such a destiny\nfor humankind. He has ordered humans, as the supreme\ncreatures, to make the best and most beautiful life on\nEarth along the lines of justice, love and dignity.\nWe must therefore think of a solution. Who is\nresponsible for all the sufferings and failures? Some\npeople try to justify it by saying that everything is\nnormal and a ref lection of divine will, thereby putting\nthe blame on States for all prevalent vices and evils.\nThey are of the opinion that it is States that succumb to\ndiscrimination and tyranny. It is States that surrender\nto dictatorship and greed.\nIt is States that submit to the hegemony and\narrogance of expansionist Powers. It is States that are\ninfluenced by the propaganda tactics of other Powers,\nand most of the evils in our world are the result of their passivity and willingness to live under the sway of the\nworld Powers.\nSuch are the arguments raised by those who tend\nto blame States for the unfavourable conditions that\nprevail around the world, with the aim of justifying\nthe attitudes and destructive behaviour of the ruling\nminority. Such supposedly genuine claims can in no\nway justify continuing with the current oppressive\ninternational order, because in fact poverty is being\nimposed on States, and the Powers\u2019 are pursuing their\nambitions and goals either by deceit or by resort to\nforce. To justify their inhuman actions, they promote\nthe theory of the survival of the fittest.\nYet in principle, what most Governments and States\nand their peoples are seeking is fairness; they submit\nhumbly to what is right and what they want is to foster\ndignity, prosperity and constructive relations. The\nvast majority of people have no interest in expanding\ntheir territories, nor do they seek enormous wealth.\nThey have no disputes among themselves on matters\nof principle and have never played a part in unleashing\nthe disastrous events of history. I do not believe that\nMuslims, Christians, Jews, Hindus, Buddhists or others\nhave any problems among themselves, or are hostile\nto one another. They get along comfortably and live\ntogether in an atmosphere of peace and amity. They are\nall devoted to the cause of justice, purity and love.\nThe general tendency of States has always been\nto work towards positive common aspirations to the\nqualities that reflect great beauty and nobility, divine\nand human. The current abysmal state of the world\nand the bitter incidents of its history are due mainly to\niniquitous management by the self-proclaimed centres\nof power, which have dedicated themselves to the Devil.\nThe order that is rooted in the anti-human concepts of\nslavery and colonialism, old and new, is responsible\nfor poverty, corruption, ignorance, oppression and\ndiscrimination in every corner of the world.\nThe current world order has certain characteristics.\nIt is founded on materialism and thus is unmoored\nfrom moral values. It has been shaped by selfishness,\ndeception, hatred and animosity. It believes in\nlabelling human beings, humiliating other nations and\ndominating and trampling on the rights of others. It\nseeks to expand its domination by spreading discord\nand conflict among ethnic groups and nations. It aims\nto monopolize power, wealth, science and technology.\nThe policies of the world\u2019s main centres of power are based on the principles of domination and conquest.\nSuch Powers seek only supremacy; they do not desire\npeace and they definitely do not promote it in the\nservice of their nations.\nAre we to believe that those who spend hundreds\nof millions of dollars on election campaigns have the\ninterests of the peoples of the world at heart? Despite\nwhat the big political parties in the capitalist countries\nclaim, the money that goes into election campaigns is\nusually nothing but an investment on the part of the\nruling parties. In such countries, people have to vote for\nparties that represent only a small percentage of voters.\nThe will and views of the masses have little impact or\ninfluence on big decisions, especially those concerning\nmajor domestic and foreign policies in the United States\nand Europe. Their voices go unheard even when they\nconstitute 99 per cent of their societies. Human and\nethical values are sacrificed in order to win votes, and\nany willingness to listen to the demands of the people\nhas become merely a tool to be used at election time.\nThe current world order is discriminatory and based on\ninjustice.\nWhat should be done, and what is the way out of the\ncurrent situation? There is no doubt that the world is in\nneed of a new order and a fresh way of thinking. We\nneed an order that recognizes man as God\u2019s supreme\ncreature, possessing both material and spiritual\nqualities and a pure and divine nature, filled with the\ndesire to seek justice and truth; that aims to restore\nhuman dignity and believes in universal happiness and\nthe possibility of perfection; that seeks peace, lasting\nsecurity and welfare for everyone, in all walks of life,\naround the globe; that is founded on trust and kindness\nand brings our thoughts, hearts and hands closer\ntogether and in which rulers love their people; that is\njust and fair, makes everybody equal before the law,\nand has no double standards; that allows world leaders\nto see themselves as committed servants of their people,\nnot their superiors; and that sees authority as a sacred\ngift from a people to its rulers, not an opportunity to\namass power and wealth.\nCan such an order exist without the contribution\nof all to the way the world is run? It is abundantly\nevident that when all peoples and Governments start\nto think, commit themselves to the aforementioned\nprinciples, focus on internationally important issues\nand participate in decision-making, it will be possible\nfor their desires to be realized. In raising collective\nawareness, the possibility of governing the world jointly becomes more real and the chances of putting it\ninto practice increase.\nTogether, therefore, we must trust in God Almighty\nand stand up to the rapacious minority with all our\nstrength in order to isolate them, so that they can no\nlonger decide the destiny of other nations. We must\nbelieve in the bounty of God\u2019s blessing and mercy\nand seek it within the integration and unity of human\nsociety. Governments that are born of free national will\nmust believe in their own unlimited capabilities and\nknow that they can achieve victory if they fight fiercely\nto combat an unjust world order and to defend human\nrights.\nWe must lay the ground for united world rule by\ninsisting on justice in all its aspects, strengthening\nunity and friendship and expanding economic, social,\ncultural and political interaction in independent and\nspecialized organizations. We must care about the\ninterests of all the people of the world and join hands\nto reform the current United Nations entities with joint\nefforts and cooperation. The United Nations belongs to\nits Member States, and therefore the existence of any\ndiscrimination among those Members is a great insult\nto all. Any discrimination or monopolization of power\nin the Organization is unacceptable.\nWe must make a more coordinated effort to create,\npromote and firmly establish the language needed\nto enable us to design the bodies needed for a united\nworld rule that is imbued with justice, love, freedom\nand amity. Participation in global management is the\nbasis of lasting peace.\nThe Non-Aligned Movement, the second largest\ntransregional group after the United Nations, held its\nsixteenth summit in Tehran with the motto of \u201cJoint\nglobal management\u201d, cognizant of the importance\nof this issue and of the shortcomings of the current\nmismanagement in the emergence of crises and\nproblems afflicting the world today. During the summit,\nparticipating Heads of State and representatives of\nmore than 120 countries underscored the necessity of\nmore serious and effective participation of all nations\nin global management.\nFortunately, we are now at a historic juncture. On\nthe one hand, Marxism is no longer around; it has been\npractically eliminated from management systems. On\nthe other hand, capitalism is bogged down in a self-\nmade quagmire. Indeed, it has reached a deadlock and\nappears to be unable to come up with any noteworthy solutions to the world\u2019s various economic, political,\nsecurity and cultural problems. The Non-Aligned\nMovement is proud to again emphasize the rightfulness\nof its historic decision to reject the power polarities and\nunbridled hegemony ruling the world. On behalf of the\nmembers of Non-Aligned Movement, I would like to\ninvite all the countries in the world to play a more active\nrole in making it possible for everybody to contribute to\nglobal decision-making processes. The need to remove\nstructural barriers and to encourage the process of\nuniversal participation in global management has never\nbeen greater.\nThe United Nations lacks the efficiency to bring\nabout the required changes. If this inefficiency persists,\nnations will lose hope in the ability of global structures\nto defend their rights. If the United Nations is not\nrestructured, international interactions and the spirit of\ncollective global cooperation will be tarnished, and the\nstanding of the United Nations will be damaged.\nThe United Nations, which was established with\nthe purpose of expanding justice and reinstituting\nuniversal human rights, has in practice been engulfed\nby discrimination, preparing a supportive ground for\ndomination by a few powerful countries. Consequently,\nUnited Nations inefficiency has increased. Moreover,\nthe existence of the veto right and monopolization of\npower in the Security Council have made it nearly\nimpossible to defend the rights of the nations.\nThe issue of United Nations restructuring is vital;\nthe need has been emphasized time and again by State\nrepresentatives. That goal that yet to be accomplished.\nI would like to urge the States Members of the United\nNations and the Secretary-General and his colleagues\nto place the issue high on their agenda and to devise\nan appropriate mechanism to make it happen. The\nNon-Aligned Movement stands ready to aid the United\nNations in that essential endeavour.\nCreating peace and lasting security with a decent\nlife for all, although a great and historic mission, can\nbe accomplished. Almighty God has not left us alone in\nthat mission and has said that it will surely happen. If\nit does not, then that will contradict his wisdom. God\nhas promised us a man of kindness, a man who loves\npeople and absolute justice, a man who is a perfect\nhuman being, named the Imam Al-Mahdi \u2014 a man\nwho will come in the company of Jesus Christ and the\nrighteous. By using the inherent potential of all the\nworthy men and women of all nations \u2014 I repeat, the inherent potential of all the worthy men and women of\nall nations \u2014 he will lead humanity into achieving its\nglorious and eternal ideals.\nThe arrival of the ultimate saviour will mark a new\nbeginning, a rebirth and a resurrection. It will be the\nbeginning of peace, lasting security and genuine life.\nHis arrival will be the end of oppression, immorality,\npoverty and discrimination and the beginning of\njustice, love and empathy. He will come, and he will\ncut through ignorance, superstition and prejudice by\nopening the gates of science and knowledge. He will\nestablish a world brimming with prudence, and he\nwill prepare the ground for the collective, active and\nconstructive participation of all in global management.\nHe will come to grant kindness, hope, freedom and\ndignity to all humankind as a gift. He will come so that\nhumankind will taste the pleasure of being human and\nbeing in the company of other humans.\nHe will come so that hands will be joined, hearts\nwill be filled with love, and thoughts will be purified and\nwill be at the service of the security, welfare, happiness,\nwell-being and peace of all. He will come to return all\nthe children of Adam, irrespective of their skin color,\nto their innate origin after a long history of separation\nand division, linking them to eternal happiness and joy.\nThe arrival of the ultimate saviour, Jesus Christ and the\nrighteous, will bring about an eternally bright future\nfor humankind, not by force or by waging wars but\nthrough thought-awakening and developing kindness\nin everyone. Their arrival will breathe new life into the\ncold and frozen hearts and bodies of the world. He will\nbless humankind with a spring that puts an end to our\nwinter of ignorance, poverty and war with the tidings\nof a season of blossoming. He will end the winter of\nignorance for humankind.\nNow we can sense the sweet scent and the soulful\nbreeze of the spring, a spring that has just begun and\nthat does not belong to a specific race, ethnicity, nation\nor region, a spring that will soon reach all the territories\nin Asia, Europe, Africa and the Americas. He will be\nthe spring of all the justice seekers, freedom lovers\nand the followers of heavenly prophets. He will be the\nspring of humankind and the greenery of all ages. Let\nus join hands and clear the way for his eventual arrival,\nwith empathy and cooperation, in harmony and unity.\nLet us march on this path to salvation for the thirsty\nsouls of humankind to taste immortal joy and grace.  Long live this spring, long live this spring \u2014 again\nand again, long live this spring."

        "file_text": "\ufeffI should like\nto begin by extending my congratulations to His\nExcellency Mr. Vuk Jeremi\u0107 on his election as President\nof the Assembly at its sixty-seventh session, and I\nwish him every success. I would also like to commend\nAmbassador Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser, President of\nthe Assembly at its sixty-sixth session, for his positive\ncontribution to the proceedings of the Assembly. I\nwould like to reiterate to Secretary-General Ban Ki-\nmoon the encouragement and support of Senegal in\nthe conduct of his delicate mission at the head of our\nOrganization.\nOn 25 March 2012, in a two-round, keenly contested\npresidential election, the Senegalese people, inspired\nby its values of democracy and freedom, calmly and\nserenely voted massively, by more than 65 per cent, for\nchange and the respect of republican norms. We were\nsupported by friendly countries and organizations\nin that great undertaking, which was aimed at the\nconsolidation of our democratic tradition, especially\nthrough the improvement of our electoral institutions\nand the monitoring of the various stages of the process.\nI would like to express here my deep gratitude to all\nthose who supported that process.\nIn my capacity as Senegal\u2019s newly elected President,\nlet me reiterate our faith in our shared values and in\nthe mandate of the United Nations to promote, through\ncooperation, the advent of a better and friendlier world\nfor all.\nBuilding a better world entails, undoubtedly and\nabove all, working together for peace to reign among\nand within our peoples, as suggested by the theme of\nthis session: \u201cAdjustment or settlement of international\ndisputes or situations by peaceful means\u201d.\nBorn out of the ashes and ruins of war, the United\nNations is the expression of the dream of and hope for\na world free from the spectre of antagonism and of any\nManichaean view whereby the good are on one side and\nthe bad on the other.\nSixty-seven years on, through mediation efforts\nand good offices, conciliation, arbitration and peace\nmissions, the United Nations has made a considerable contribution to the pacification of international\nrelations. Yet, although commendable progress has\nbeen achieved, threats to peace and security remain\nworrisome and have radically evolved.\nThat is the case in northern Mali, where organized\nand heavily armed terrorist groups, living off\ntrafficking of all kinds, are occupying, in complete\nillegality, two thirds of the country, sowing despair\namong the population and destroying symbols of the\nworld\u2019s cultural heritage. Northern Mali has become a\nlawless area, used as a safe haven for recruitment and\ntraining by the international terrorist nebula, which\nwrongly uses Islam as a pretext to disguise its criminal\nactivities and seeks to attack foreign interests as well\nas extend its reach to other countries of the subregion.\nAs the guarantor of the collective security of\nMember States under the Charter of the United Nations,\nthe Security Council has an obligation to act in order\nto bring an end to such a situation. If it does not do\nso, it will have failed to live up to its responsibilities.\nTherefore we call once again on the Council to authorize\nall actions required to combat those terrorist groups\nand restore the country\u2019s territorial integrity.\nIn addition, I reiterate our firm rejection of any\npartition of Mali and our condemnation of the 22 March\n2012 coup d\u2019\u00e9tat. It is our conviction that in Africa as\nelsewhere, the place of the army is in the barracks,\nunder the command of a civilian authority.\nAs for Guinea-Bissau, we, like other Economic\nCommunity of West African States member States,\nappreciate the efforts made by the transitional\nGovernment towards national reconciliation, the\nre-establishment of the country\u2019s institutions, the\nholding of credible elections and the definitive\nwithdrawal of the army from the political arena.\nAlready ravaged by years of institutional and\neconomic instability, Guinea-Bissau also faces the issue\nof foreign drug traffickers. The country deserves the\nattention and support of the international community.\nThe same holds true for Palestine.\nIn its capacity as Chairman of the Committee on\nthe Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian\nPeople, Senegal restates its support for the creation of\na viable and independent Palestinian State, with East\nJerusalem as its capital and with a seat here among\nfree nations. A viable and independent Palestine, living\nin peace with the State of Israel, each within secure and internationally recognized borders, is one of our\nlongest-standing unfulfilled promises, even though\nits fulfilment is the only guarantee for a peaceful,\nfair and lasting settlement of the Middle East crisis.\nIn the interest of all the peoples of the region and the\nworld, it is high time that the Holy Land of the three\nrevealed religions no longer be a land of fire, blood and\ntears. The light of wisdom emanating from its spiritual\nlegacies requires it instead to be a land of peace and\nhuman fraternity.\nIn Africa, as in the rest of the world, Senegal\nwelcomes and supports the progress of democracy\nand fundamental freedoms. We are deeply concerned\nbecause some leaders deny the obvious fact that the\ndestiny of humankind is to live free, and respond to\nthe legitimate aspirations of their people with appalling\nviolence against innocent civilians.\nThe adjustment or settlement of international\ndisputes or situations by peaceful means, the apt theme\nof this session, should not overshadow other emergencies\nand unmet needs. More than ever before, we live today\nin an era of paradoxes and unanswered questions.\nThe greatest paradox of our time is that never before\nin human history has the world accumulated so much\nwealth even though never before in human history has\nthe world counted so many poor. So what will the world\nof tomorrow be like? The question is indeed difficult,\nbut to govern is to foresee and we cannot dodge it.\nWhat kind of world do we want when, 20 years after\nthe Rio Earth Summit, it is a proven fact that continuous\nenvironmental degradation as a result of human activity\nthreatens to jeopardize the conditions for life on Earth?\nWhat kind of world do we want when, according to\nestimates by the Food and Agriculture Organization\nof the United Nations, more than 900 million people\nsuffer from undernourishment even though agriculture\nhas the potential to feed more than twice the planet\u2019s\npopulation? What kind of world do we want when,\nin our towns and villages, millions of human beings\nhave no access to basic social services and millions of\nwomen die in childbirth?\nWhat kind of world do we want when millions\nof young people, after years of study, hard work and\nsacrifice to escape their misery, rather than realizing\ntheir dreams are rewarded with nothing but the\nnightmare and indignity of unemployment? What\nkind of world do we want when millions of fathers\nand mothers working for the minimum wage wake up one morning unemployed because the company has\ngone bankrupt, while those responsible enjoy generous\ngolden parachutes?\nIn a time of so many old and new challenges, history\nhas shown that paradigms have changed and that old\nsolutions will definitely not work. We need to redefine\nour priorities, invest in the real economy and agree on\na new and fairer world order. The African continent,\nhaving endured centuries of slavery and exploitation,\ncannot afford to accept yet another Trojan Horse and be\nduped into forfeiting its resources in a contest hobbling\nits progress and well-being.\nWe call for new relations with Africa, not acting\nupon Africa and Africans but acting with Africa and\nAfricans, in a spirit of cooperation and fairness, taking\ninto account all parties\u2019 priorities and interests. That\nis the hope we declare here in the United Nations. It\nis also what we call for in the relations between the\nNew Partnership for Africa\u2019s Development, on the one\nhand, and the Group of Eight, Group of 20 and other\npartnership mechanisms, on the other hand.\nAs for Senegal, beyond the demands of democracy\nand good governance, about which we agree, our national\npriorities must more than ever focus on agriculture,\ninfrastructure and energy. That is the only path to the\nprogress that will improve people\u2019s day-to-day lives,\nthe sine qua non of development and democratization.\nWith respect to the reform of the Security Council,\nSenegal reaffirms its belief in the African position\nexpressed in the Ezulwini Consensus. It is only justice\nand common sense that Africa, the continent with the\nlargest number of countries at the United Nations, and\nwhose problems take up most of the work of the Council,\nshould be fairly represented in that body. Indeed, the\ndemocracy required of States should also be required of\nthe Organization to which they all belong.\nTo conclude, on behalf of the Organization of\nIslamic Cooperation, currently chaired by Senegal,\nI hope to renew our common faith in dialogue and\nthe peaceful coexistence of religions, cultures and\ncivilizations. Entering into dialogue and learning to\nlive together depends on recognizing and respecting\nour differences as a source of richness rather than as a\nspringboard for confrontation. It requires rejecting the\ndefamation of religions and violence in all its forms.\nIt demands renouncing any thought of domination by\none culture or one civilization over others. It is about\npromoting mutual understanding in order to overcome unfounded feelings of suspicion and fear that deform\nour common humanity.\nIf humankind embraces the \u201ccivilization of the\nuniversal\u201d advocated by my illustrious compatriot,\nthe late President and poet L\u00e9opold S\u00e9dar Senghor,\nman will no longer be a wolf to man, as Hobbes said.\nInstead, as the saying in our country goes, man will\nbecome a remedy to man. We owe that to ourselves and\nto future generations."

        "file_text": "\ufeffLet me start by congratulating\nMr. Jeremi\u0107 on his election as President of the General\nAssembly at its sixty-seventh session. I have no doubt\nthat under his able leadership the work at this session\nwill progress to a successful conclusion. I also wish\nto acknowledge the excellent work of his predecessor,\nAmbassador Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser, who guided\nthe affairs of the sixty-sixth session with diligence\nand consummate skill. I must seize this opportunity to\napplaud Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for the able\nmanner in which he has continued to guide and lead the\nSecretariat of our Organization.\nWhen I addressed the Assembly last year on the\ntheme of the role of mediation in the settlement of\ndisputes by peaceful means (see A/66/PV.11), the world\nwas witnessing important and dramatic changes. The\nArab Spring had broken out, setting new political\nstandards for social contracts between Governments\nand the governed. Also, South Sudan, today sitting at\nthe family table of the United Nations, had just gained\nindependence.\n\nSince then, we have witnessed considerable\nprogress and also some setbacks. Knowing that the\nfuture remains uncertain and perilous, we have always\nbelieved that much more needs to be done to protect\nour gains, including developing new strategies for\npreventing and resolving conflicts.\nThe situation in Syria, which continues to weigh on\nthe collective conscience of the world, is a case in point.\nEvery day since the conflict began, innocent people\ncontinue to lose their lives and livelihoods, while tens\nof thousands of others f lee into neighbouring countries\nseeking refuge. I seize this opportunity to call on\nthe Syrian people, in the face of a seeming lack of\nconcerted positive international action, to pause and\nfind a solution to the crisis in a way that will benefit\nthe Syrian nation.\nIndeed, it was in the context of tackling the many\ncrises that plagued our world that I proposed the\nestablishment of a conflict mediation commission, under\nthe Secretary-General\u2019s Office, to further strengthen\nthe early warning and peacebuilding initiatives of the\nUnited Nations. Experience elsewhere gives us reason\nto believe that there is value in the creation of such a\nmechanism. Nigeria stands ready to work with other\ncountries to make the protection of innocent civilians\ncaught in conflict situations a priority of the United\nNations.\nI see a consonance between the theme of the sixty-\nsixth session and that of sixty-seventh session \u2014 the\nadjustment or settlement of international disputes or\nsituations by peaceful means. Both are concerned with\nthe peaceful settlement of disputes. This consonance, in\nmy view, is evidence of the United Nations continuous\nand justifiable preoccupation with issues of peace and\nsecurity.\nMembership in the Security Council in 2010 and\n2011 afforded Nigeria an opportunity to work with\nothers to promote the complex peace and security agenda\nof the United Nations. It was indeed a privilege for us\nto contribute to the United Nations and international\nefforts to make the world a safer and better place.\nNigeria and other emerging nations continue to\ndemonstrate the capacity to add value to the work of\nall the organs of the United Nations, including the\nSecurity Council. For that reason, we must now commit\nourselves to accelerating the long-overdue reforms of\nthe Security Council. They will no doubt make the\nCouncil more equitable, more inclusive and more effective. Nigeria believes that a reformed Security\nCouncil with expanded permanent membership would\nbenefit from the unique experiences and capacities that\nregional representatives could bring to bear on its work.\nIt is a matter of great concern that many regions\nof the world, including the West African subregion,\nare plagued by political crises and insurgency. In\nsome parts of my own country, for instance, we are\nexperiencing threats from extremist and militant\nactivities with quasi-terrorist tactics. Our response has\nbeen multifaceted, as we seek to address the root causes\nof those threats, exploring opportunities for dialogue\nand improving law enforcement to ensure public safety\nand security.\nInternational cooperation has also been a key factor\nin tackling our security challenges. We have signed\nbilateral agreements with our neighbours: Cameroon,\nthe Republic of the Niger and Chad. On the multilateral\nfront, the Lake Chad Basin Commission has been an\nexcellent platform for cooperation. Those efforts are\naimed at safeguarding the security of our individual\ncountries and denying extremists the use of our region\nas sanctuary. We are confident that those measures will\nstem the f low of and access to small arms and light\nweapons, which have indeed become Africa\u2019s weapons\nof mass destruction and the most potent source of\ninstability. Indeed, the free f low of small arms and light\nweapons from the developed countries that manufacture\nthem to Africa is one of the greater challenges the\ncontinent is facing in the contemporary world.\nNigeria continues to regard the General Assembly\nas a veritable platform for collective action to address\nissues of common interest to all nations. One such issue\ndeserving the serious attention of the United Nations\nis the adoption of a legally binding arms trade treaty.\nI believe that important instrument could galvanize\nthe international community to regulate the transfer\nof conventional weapons and curb the illicit trade in\nsmall arms and light weapons. There is no doubt that\nthe absence of a global consensus on controlling the\nf low of such weapons, including small arms and light\nweapons, is fuelling conflicts, constraining growth and\ndevelopment and increasing human rights violations.\nA ray of hope was offered early this month with\nthe successful conclusion of the second United\nNations Conference to Review Progress Made in the\nImplementation of the Programme of Action to Prevent,\nCombat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects, including the\nunprecedented adoption of an outcome document under\nNigeria\u2019s presidency. We expect that those positive\nachievements will have an impact on the entire United\nNations disarmament process, including the Conference\non Disarmament, the Disarmament Commission and\nother disarmament mechanisms.\nThe correlation between disarmament, peace\nand security, and development is axiomatic and\nself-evident. The work of the United Nations\nCommission on Life-saving Commodities for\nWomen and Children \u2014 which I have the honour to\nco-chair with Mr. Jens Stoltenberg, Prime Minister of\nNorway \u2014 recognizes the need to serve and improve\nthe health of women and children for the benefit\nof the future progress of the world. That is indeed a\nlaudable achievement, for which we commend the\nvision of the Secretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon.\nThe Commission\u2019s overarching objective is to provide\nmedical resources and other life-saving commodities\nin a more affordable, accessible and timely manner,\nthereby saving the lives of at least 4 million women and\nchildren worldwide by 2015 and helping to achieve the\nhealth-related targets of the Millennium Development\nGoals (MDGs). Concerned with the unf lattering\nstatistics on maternal and child mortality in Nigeria,\nmy Government has adopted measures for reversing\nthat unhappy trend, in close collaboration with the\nCommission and the related Every Woman Every Child\nmovement.\nWe believe, therefore, that it is time that the world\nlooked beyond 2015 to the post-MDG era. The year\n2015 is not a destination but only a milestone on the\nlong journey to a better, safer, healthier and more caring\nworld. It is in that spirit that Nigeria will participate in\nthe forthcoming intergovernmental process to consider\nthe development of specific and action-oriented\nsustainable development goals beyond 2015.\nSustainable development and progress are two\nultimate aspirations of any nation, and they cannot be\nachieved without peace and security. Guided by that\nrealization, Nigeria has committed and shall continue\nto commit itself to the attainment of regional and\ninternational peace and security, in close collaboration\nwith the United Nations, the African Union and\nthe Economic Community of West African States\n(ECOWAS).\nRecently, however, our subregion has suffered\nsome setbacks in terms of unconstitutional change of Governments and the emergence of insurgency, among\nothers. In Mali, the political crisis stemming from that\nreality has escalated to an insurgency that is threatening\nthe unity of the country. Nigeria and ECOWAS are\nworking in concert to address that threat, which has the\npotential to spill over into neighbouring countries and\ndestabilize the entire region. Guinea-Bissau is another\nf lashpoint of instability in the subregion in which\nNigeria and the Economic Community of West African\nStates are engaged. Indeed, the contact group, headed\nby Nigeria, was set up by the authority of the Heads of\nState and Government of ECOWAS to help establish\na transitional Government with a view to returning\nthat country to political and constitutional order. In\nfurtherance of that objective, Nigeria provided the sum\nof $10 million to the interim Government in Guinea-\nBissau to assist in the stabilization of the country.\nThe overall security situation in the West African\nsubregion should continue to be a matter of interest and\nconcern to the rest of the international community. I\nbelieve I speak for many in the Assembly when I state\nthat West Africa can ill afford renewed insurgency.\nAlthough ECOWAS is taking measures to address the\nsituation in Mali, particularly in the north, the urgent\nassistance of the United Nations and the support of\nother partners will be needed to build on recent gains\nto secure peace and stability in Mali and across the\nsubregion.\nNigeria\u2019s long-standing commitment to the\npromotion of issues of particular concern to Africa\nis widely acknowledged. Nigeria has stood firm and\nplayed critical roles in all the recent developments in\nAfrica, including the struggle for independence and\nself-determination and the fight against apartheid,\ncolonialism and discrimination.\nToday, we are in the vanguard of the fight against\nextremism, terrorism and all forms of mindless\nviolence. We shall remain undeterred and unf linching\nin our resolve to protect our citizens and other persons\nliving within our borders and to extend such protection\nwherever we can to other countries in our region.\nWe know that no country has unilaterally defeated\nthe dark forces of violence and terrorism. They\nevidently represent an evil that requires international\ncollaboration. We therefore call upon the international\ncommunity and all like-minded stakeholders to address\nthe matter with all the seriousness it deserves. I cannot end my statement without alluding to the\nimportance of the support that Nigerians are continuing\nto give to the United Nations in not only advancing but\nalso upholding international peace and security. We\nshall strengthen and deepen our cooperation with the\nUnited Nations in peacekeeping operations around\nthe world. We shall remain focused and committed to\nensuring a meaningful and effective contribution to\nits presence and, if need be, to crucial peacekeeping\noperations, particularly in Africa.\nThe events of recent weeks have demonstrated how\nincreasingly interconnected our world has become and\nthe extent to which an incident in one area can cause\nreverberations in others. The lesson is that freedom\nof expression should not be construed as a licence to\nincitement. The freedom that we all hold dear and true\nshould be exercised wisely and consciously. Freedom of\nexpression and religious tolerance must not be mutually\nexclusive but should be complementary to each other.\nWe eschew violence and deplore needless loss of lives\nand destruction of property. We condemn the deliberate\ndenigration of religious and cultural beliefs and\nsensitivities, which in turn leads to counter-reactions.\nAs the world grows in knowledge and prosperity,\nso must humankind grow in maturity and wisdom. Care\nand compassion for our fellow beings must inform all\nour actions. We must ensure that no nation and no part\nof the world is left behind in terms of human progress.\nWorking together with commitment and common\npurpose, we can succeed in building an inclusive, safer\nand prosperous world for present and future generations.\nThe United Nations must lead that effort with renewed\ncommitment."

        "file_text": "\ufeffOn behalf of the\nGovernment and people of the Commonwealth of\nDominica, I would like to congratulate Mr. Jeremi\u0107 on\nhis election to the presidency of the General Assembly\nat its sixty-seventh session and to wish him every\nsuccess. We also express our appreciation and gratitude\nto his predecessor, Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser, for\nthe able manner in which he presided over the sixty-\nsixth session.\nThe sixty-seventh session of the General\nAssembly has convened at a time when we face myriad\nchallenges \u2014 the impact of climate change, civil\nconflicts, hunger and starvation, poverty, HIV/AIDS and\nchronic non-communicable diseases. Those challenges,\nhowever, are equally matched by the tremendous\nopportunities created by the rapid advancement in\nscience and technology and the unprecedented level of\ninternational cooperation.\nWe therefore need the political will to harness\nthose opportunities for the benefit of our peoples.\nThat would necessarily require the transformation of\nmultilateral institutions, such as the United Nations,\nincluding its organs and agencies, the World Bank and\nthe International Monetary Fund, to reflect equity and\ninclusion. Those changes must be supported by a shift\nin our systems of production and consumption and by a\nnew economic system, built on the principles of fairness\nand differentiated treatment on the basis of the unique\nchallenges of countries, especially the vulnerability of\nsmall island developing States (SIDS). I am confident\nthat, with such an approach, we will be able to overcome\nthose challenges in a functioning multilateral system.\n\nThe unsustainable consumption and production\nsystems that continue to deplete the world\u2019s resources\nand that simultaneously contribute to global warming\nremain a major threat to the survival of those of us who\nlive close to the world\u2019s oceans. The United Nations\nConference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20) was\na commendable effort by the international community\nto take stock of the human impact on the Earth\u2019s\nresources and to commit to reversing the present\ntrend. The outcome document, entitled \u201cThe future\nwe want\u201d (resolution 66/288, annex), falls short of our\nexpectations. However, it remains a work in progress\nand presents a useful platform for the ongoing discussion\nof multilateral resolutions to the growing concern of\nsustainable development. More important, the outcome  document is indicative of what the international\ncommunity can achieve when collective energies are\nharnessed to present an international response.\nThe Commonwealth of Dominica is pleased that\nRio+20 reaffirmed an international commitment to\nsupport small island developing States. We especially\nwelcome the agreement to convene the third Global\nConference on the Sustainable Development of SIDS\nin 2014 in the Pacific region. In fact, we are of the\nview that the third Global Conference will provide an\nopportunity for the implementation of the outcomes of\nRio+20, the Barbados Programme of Action and the\nMauritius Strategy for the Further Implementation of\nthe Barbados Programme of Action.\nAs a small island developing State, Dominica is\ncommitted to the fundamental principle of environmental\nsustainability. That is clearly demonstrated by our\napproach to sustainable development as the \u201cNature\nIsland\u201d. The sustainable use of our natural resources\nhas contributed to our tourism product, while at the\nsame time blessing our citizens with the most beautiful\nplace on Earth to call home. Notwithstanding that, our\ngreat vulnerability continues to put us at the mercy\nof countries that promote and employ unsustainable\npractices. The challenges include an international\neconomic system dominated by the strong and the\npowerful that pays little or no regard to the vulnerable.\nIf multilateralism is to survive, we need to focus on\ncorrecting that lopsided system, which is destined to\nannihilate SIDS.\nDominica\u2019s very vulnerability to the effects of\nglobal warming underscores our commitment to a\nmultilateral approach aimed at combating climate\nchange. The impact of climate change continues to\nmanifest itself in a number of ways, resulting in greater\nchallenges to the survival of SIDS. The failure to date\nto reach a legally binding outcome on climate change is\na cause of grave concern. While the debate continues,\nthe challenges to our islands increase.\nWe are encouraged, however, by the fact that the\nrecently concluded climate talks in Bangkok prepared\na fertile ground for the United Nations Framework\nConvention on Climate Change in Doha later this\nyear. Nevertheless, Dominica continues to stress the\nimportance of extending and amending the Kyoto\nProtocol before it lapses. The timely creation of a road\nmap for a new legally binding document must be treated\nas a matter of urgency. We look forward to the Doha\ntalks, of which we have great expectations.\nOne major contributor to climate change is the\nconsumption of fossil fuels for the production of\nelectricity. The importation of fossil fuels also has the\ngreatest impact on the economic vulnerability of many\nsmall island developing States. Addressing energy\nissues is therefore central to responding to the challenges\nof climate change and sustainable development. Today,\nthere is still a significant portion of many remote and\nrural island communities that has little or no access to\nmodern and affordable energy services.\nThe low-carbon economies in SIDS therefore\nprovide an opportunity to reduce greenhouse-gas\nemissions, while decreasing dependence on imported\nfossil fuels. By generating their own energy from\nnatural renewable sources, SIDS will be able to achieve\nenergy security. The savings realized from avoiding\nthe cost of importing fossil fuels could be used for\nadaptation and developmental needs. For that and\nother reasons, the SIDS Sustainable Energy Initiative,\nknown as SIDS DOCK, was instituted. The Initiative\ncurrently provides a global platform for SIDS to pursue\ntheir renewable energy ambitions by building capacity\nand by providing technical support to member States.\nThe Governments of Denmark and Japan, the United\nNations Development Programme and the World Bank\ncontinue to play a significant role in making energy\nindependence a reality for SIDS. The recent partnership\nwith the Clinton Foundation has given new hope to a\nnumber of islands that are vigorously pursuing their\nrenewable energy aspirations.\nDominica has the honour of serving as Chair of\nSIDS DOCK. My delegation, on its own behalf as well\nas that of SIDS DOCK, fully endorses the Barbados\nDeclaration on Achieving Sustainable Energy for All\nin Small Island Developing States, signed by ministers\nand other heads of delegation of the Alliance of Small\nIsland States at the ministerial conference held in\nBridgetown in May. The commitments made and targets\nset to increase the percentage of renewable energy and\nincrease energy efficiency in energy portfolios are\ntestimony to our region\u2019s commitment to the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s Sustainable Energy for All initiative. We\ncongratulate the Secretary-General on launching the\ninitiative, which SIDS DOCK joined and is committed\nto actively supporting.\n\nDominica, the \u201cNature Island\u201d, continues to pursue\nthe development of its geothermal resources. We are\npleased to announce that the recently concluded test-\ndrilling in the Roseau Valley has confirmed that our\ngeothermal resources have the potential to supply our\ndomestic needs and provide an exportable surplus. That\nwill allow us to move away from the importation of fossil\nfuel for the generation of electricity within the next five\nyears, while also reducing the cost of electricity for our\npeople. At the same time, the development of a power\nplant for export to the French territories of Guadeloupe\nand Martinique will provide a source of revenue for\nthe island. Negotiations are ongoing and expected\nto conclude by the end of 2012. Work is expected to\ncommence on the first power plant in the first quarter\nof 2013. Dominica\u2019s energy initiative has the potential\nto transform its economy and to improve the quality\nof life of its people. The Government of Dominica, as\ntrustee of the island\u2019s resources on behalf of its people,\nis therefore ensuring that it manages that process\nresponsibly.\nWe have sought and are receiving assistance from\nsome of the most reputable consultants in the world. The\nsupport of the Clinton Climate Initiative has allowed us to\nnavigate through the complex challenges of the project.\nWe therefore wish to express our gratitude to President\nBill Clinton for his continued support in that initiative.\nWe anticipate that, by 2017, all of our electricity needs\nwill be met by a combination of sources, namely, hydro\nand geothermal. By 2020 we expect to be exporting\nelectricity to our neighbouring islands via submarine\ncables. That, coupled with our sustainable development\npractices, means that Dominica will go beyond carbon\nneutrality to being carbon-negative by the year 2020.\nLike Dominica, many SIDS are pursuing national\nrenewable energy initiatives, and more than 20 SIDS\nhave made pledges under the Sustainable Energy for\nAll initiative. However, unsustainable debt and the\nlack of technology make it impossible for them to\nachieve their goals. We therefore invite other developed\ncountries and the international community to join the\nGovernments of Denmark and Japan and the Clinton\nClimate Initiative in the SIDS DOCK partnership,\nand the Government of Norway in its Energy for All\ninitiative, in providing critical support to SIDS.\nThe global community should heed the prolonged,\nand in some cases recent, cries of peoples around the\nworld. The response should not be selective or be based\non narrow national interests. Injustice anywhere and in\nany form should not be tolerated. The so-called Arab\nSpring has been one expression of people\u2019s discontent.\nThe international community must support the wishes\nof people as they struggle to create their own democratic\nsystems, driven by their aspirations.\nThe recent spate of attacks on United States\nmissions and personnel, or attacks on the diplomatic\nfacilities of any country, does nothing to advance the\ncauses of those who may be marginalized or who feel\noffended by other democratic systems. Regardless of\nwhat may have led to the protests, the Commonwealth\nof Dominica condemns those unjustified attacks, which\nresulted in the unfortunate loss of life of United States\nAmbassador Christopher Stevens and his colleagues.\nWhile we are heartened by the attention that has\nbeen given to the recent outcries from some corners\nof the globe, we remain concerned that in our part of\nthe world the cries of people who have been suffering\nfor decades have aroused less sympathy. The suffering\nof our brothers and sisters in the Republic of Haiti\npersists, much to the concern of Dominica and the\nCaribbean Community (CARICOM). We are grateful to\nthose countries that have responded and to others that\nhave supported and continue to support the rebuilding\nefforts in Haiti. However, we are still far from assisting\nthe people of Haiti to reach a state of normalcy where\nthey can enjoy the basic necessities of life. We therefore\ncall upon the international community to heed the cry\nof Haiti and to provide support in the rebuilding efforts.\nThe Caribbean region also continues to witness the\nunheeded call for the discontinuation of the economic,\nfinancial and trade embargo on our brothers and sisters\nin the Republic of Cuba. We call upon the Government\nof the United States to allow the people of Cuba to be\nfully integrated into the global trading system, thereby\nenabling them to improve their lives and allowing the\nworld to benefit from their tremendous contributions,\nespecially in the area of science and technology.\nThe international trade, transfer and use of\nconventional arms, weapons, munitions and ammunition\ncontinue to threaten international peace and security.\nDominica, like its sister nations in CARICOM, is not\nimmune to that debilitating phenomenon. Our region\ncontinues to be affected by an increase in gangs\nand violent criminal activities born out of the trade\nand transfer of illicit arms and drugs throughout the\nCaribbean region, from North to South America. We\nare therefore perturbed that, despite four weeks of rigorous deliberations and intense negotiations, the\nUnited Nations Conference on the Arms Trade Treaty\ndid not result in the finalization of the treaty. However,\nlike the rest of our CARICOM colleagues, we believe\nthat the 26 July text from the Chair of the Conference\nprovides a blueprint for a possible final document.\nAs leaders, the task is now ours to finalize a legally\nbinding document in the interests of the protection of\nour people.Dominica remains optimistic that that can\nbe achieved during the current session of the General\nAssembly, and we reaffirm our commitment to the\nrealization of a robust arms trade treaty.\nDominica would like to take this opportunity\nto applaud the role and efforts of the United Nations\nin combating the proliferation of small arms and\nlight weapons in the global community. The long-\nterm socioeconomic development of many nations,\nparticularly SIDS such as Dominica, is severely\ncompromised because of the proliferation of small\narms and light weapons in our region. Associated with\nthat illicit trade is the trafficking of narcotics through\nthe Caribbean region, from South to North America,\nwhich has presented new challenges to the maintenance\nof peace and security in our region. It underscores\nthe urgent need for a legally binding international\ninstrument that addresses the control and monitoring\nof the illicit trade in small arms among States and\nnon-State actors.\nIn conclusion, Dominica remains committed\nto collaborating with the United Nations and all its\nagencies, as well as with all Member States, to strengthen\nthe mission of this noble body that, notwithstanding\nits imperfections, is critical to maintaining world\npeace and security. We reaffirm our confidence in the\nUnited Nations system as the ultimate negotiating and\ndeliberative body for addressing the major challenges\nconfronting the world.\nMay we all rise to the occasion and resolve to bring\npeace, security and prosperity to every corner of the\nglobe.\nBefore I finish, Sir, I hope that, given that I am the\nlast speaker, you will allow me the latitude to address\na word of thanks to the interpreters and the rest of the\nUnited Nations staff for their hard work over the past\nweek. We know that their task has not been easy, and\nwe appreciate their contribution.\nMay God bless the United Nations. May God bless\nus all."

        "file_text": "\ufeffTo begin\nwith, I offer my deep congratulations to Mr. Vuk\nJeremi\u0107 on his election as President of the General\nAssembly to steer its work at its sixty-seventh session.\nWe trust in his capacity to ably manage the affairs of\nthe Assembly during this session. I would like also to\nthank Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser, President of\nthe General Assembly at its previous session, for all of\nhis efforts. We also commend Mr. Ban Ki-moon for his\nwise management of the affairs of the United Nations\nand his interest in the developments in my country.\n\nDuring the past few weeks the Islamic world has\nexperienced a wave of outrage and anger as the result of\na film containing explicit denigrations directed at the\nMuslim Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, and\nthe values of true Islam. It is deplorable that a campaign\nexists with the aim of deliberately insulting Islam and\nMuslims in order to distort their image worldwide and\nto sow seeds of hatred between nations and religions.\nYet given all of that, such behaviour has attracted\npeople who defend the film based on the justification\nof freedom of expression. Those people, however, must\nnot overlook the fact that there should be limits on the\nfreedom of expression, especially if such freedom is\nused to blaspheme the beliefs of nations and defame\ntheir religious figures and symbols.\nWhile my country has strongly denounced\nthe film, it has also called for respect for religions\nand religious figures, enhanced understanding and\ndialogue between religions and civilizations, and the\nadoption of international instruments to prevent any\nfurther similar practice or abuse of the right to freedom\nof expression. My country also calls for adherence to\npeaceful expressions of opinion, while denouncing\nviolence and incitement to hatred that contradict the\nvalues of true Islam.\nThe current session of the Assembly is being held\nwithin the context of important global developments\nand events that are directly affecting political,\neconomic, social, security and environmental situations\nin all nations of the world. Those circumstances have\nresulted in various pressures on all international actors\nand have destructively impacted the least developed\n\ncountries \u2014 the so-called the countries of the\nSouth \u2014 including my country, the Republic of Yemen.\nThese days we are celebrating the fiftieth\nanniversary of the 26 September 1962 Revolution and\nthe forty-ninth anniversary of the 14 October 1963\nRevolution. I therefore take the opportunity to extend,\nfrom this international rostrum, my warmest greetings\nand best wishes to the great people of Yemen on this\noccasion. No doubt, the 50 years since the Yemeni\nrevolution have contributed to sparking the Yemeni\npeople\u2019s aspirations for change and for freedom,\nequality and national dignity that resulted in a new\nreality where the wheel of change continues to turn,\ndespite all difficulties obstacles and barriers.\nRecently, we experienced the historic achievement\nof a peaceful transfer of power for the first time in the\ncountry. That transition would not have been possible\nwithout the Yemeni people\u2019s determination to fulfil\nthe goals of the revolution: freedom, sovereignty,\nan end to autocratic and family rule forever, and the\nestablishment of a republican regime governed by the\nConstitution under a new social contract between the\nState and its people.\nAll Members know that Yemen is one of the so-\ncalled Arab Spring countries. We Yemenis experienced\na difficult situation for over a year that could have\nled to catastrophe. However, the country avoided that\ntrajectory because the disputing parties were wise\nenough to follow a role model designed to reach an\nagreement. Thus, they accepted the political settlement\nunder the initiative of the Cooperation Council for the\nArab States of the Gulf (GCC) and its implementation\nmechanism, which had become the accepted reference\nfor all parties and enjoyed international support.\nEarly presidential elections were conducted\nrepresenting a public referendum for change. The\nreferendum granted the new authorities full legitimacy\nto pursue the implementation of the provisions of the\nGCC initiative with a view to steering the country\ntowards the safe side and a brighter future where\npeople have faith in their future and can freely and with\nconviction choose their rulers and thus contribute to\nbuilding the new Yemen.\nIn that respect, please allow me to express my\ngratitude and appreciation to the Custodian of the Two\nHoly Mosques, King Abdullah Bin Abdulaziz Al-Saud\nof Saudi Arabia, the leaders of the GCC countries\nand the Secretary General of the GCC, Mr. Abdellatif\nZayani, for all of the various forms of attention and\nsupport they have extended towards the political\nsettlement of the crisis.\nThanks also go to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon;\nthe five permanent members of the Security Council;\nMr. Jamal Benomar, Special Adviser of the Secretary-\nGeneral on Yemen; the League of Arab States and its\nSecretary General; and the European Union for all\nof their efforts to bolster the political settlement and\nprovide the necessary economic support to Yemen in\nall areas, including for convening the national dialogue\nconference.\nThe conference will outline the future of Yemen by\naddressing various situations such as conflict, war and\npending problems, including the monopoly of power\nand wealth. The aim is to build a modern civil State\nbased on the principles of the rule of law, equality,\ninclusion, equal opportunity, the fair distribution of\nwealth, participation in decision-making and managing\nelements linked to the new State\u2019s sovereignty at the\nnational level under a political regime to be decided by\nthe people of Yemen in the awaited national dialogue\nconference. I stress that the doors of the national\ndialogue conference are open to all Yemeni parties\nand all issues and demands. The conference shall be\nthe means for correcting mistakes, achieving national\nreconciliation and developing the principles of a\nmodern civil Yemeni State, under a unified Yemen, as\nstipulated by Security Council resolutions.\nThe current political arrangements in Yemen\nfor the implementation of the settlement agreement\nand resolutions 2014 (2011) and 2051 (2012) have the\nsupport of the brothers and friends of Yemen. However,\nYemen still faces many political, economic, security\nand social obstacles and impediments. Those obstacles\nrepresent weaknesses and jeopardize the progress\nand prosperity of Yemen in the coming decades. It is\na fact that 95 per cent of the Yemeni people have the\nwillingness and ambitions to move with the rest of the\nworld into the twenty-first century. The political and\nsocial problems and the escalating political conflicts,\nanarchy and acts of violence and extremism shall never\nstand as obstacles in the way of the Yemeni people.\nTherefore, the right way to address the situation in\nYemen is to adopt an overarching vision that takes into\naccount all circumstances and conditions related to the\ncountry\u2019s history and geography and the challenges of\nthe present and the future. A key factor is the strategic\nlocation of Yemen at the juncture of trade routes and in the heart of international sea navigation routes. Yemen\nfaces the security challenges of organized crime, piracy\nand terrorist acts, in addition to the influx of illegal\nmigrants and refugees to its coasts.\nThere is an increasing trend of unemployment\namong young people under 30, who represent 70 per\ncent of the total population of the country. The youth\nlook forward to a better future and a modern civil State.\nThat requires the international community and donor\ncountries to understand those factors and to provide\nurgently needed support to our country in various\nfields, including in the areas of establishing a modern\ncivil State based on democracy, good governance,\nrespect for human rights and social justice. There\nis a need to abandon the traditional standard and\nbureaucratic mechanisms adopted by donor countries\nand international parties supporting the path towards\nsettlement in Yemen.\nAs for us, we stand ready to provide a favourable\nand appropriate atmosphere for their work, absent of\nany complex Government bureaucracy, by adopting a\nhigh level of transparency and removing any obstacles\nthey may face. I confirm that it is investment that\nresults in stability, and not vice versa.\nTerrorists, who have pervaded our country for more\nthan 10 years and were recently poised to seize control\nof different Yemeni regions and provinces, represent a\nhuge threat to local, regional and international peace\nand stability. Although, following the heroic acts of the\nYemeni armed forces and local popular committees and\na series of defeats, Al-Qaida is today much weaker than\nbefore, we cannot underestimate its desperation. Due to\nits failure to adapt after its successive defeats, Al-Qaida\nhas equipped its members with explosive belts and\ntransformed them into time bombs against innocent\nand unarmed people. That has resulted in Al-Qaida\nlosing any local or national sympathy.\nWe reaffirm our commitment to eradicating\nterrorist elements and demand that its sources of\ninternal and external support be eliminated. We invite\nour international partners in the fight against terrorism\nto provide more logistical and technical support to our\nsecurity forces and counterterrorism units, and that\nthey expand intelligence cooperation and coordination\nin that field.\nI cannot pass up the opportunity to draw attention\nto the humanitarian crisis in Yemen as a result of the\nterrorism and acts of violence in Sadah and the events of the past year that have resulted in the displacement\nof more than 500,000 people from their villages, in\naddition to the increasing number of refugees from\nthe Horn of Africa region. That led the United Nations\nand its agencies to launch an appeal for approximately\n$600 million. However, the funding gap stands at\n50 per cent of the required amount. I therefore call\non brotherly and friendly countries to respond to the\nappeal of the United Nations to enable it to meet the\nbasic needs of internally displaced persons and refugees\nin our country.\nIt has been more than six decades since the General\nAssembly, which I have the honour to address today,\nissued the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. It\nis deplorable that, after all these years, many nations\nstill suffer violations of their rights and dignity. The\nPalestinian people have been subjected to a gruesome\nescalation of Israeli violence. Israeli settlements are\nexpanding, innocent Palestinians are maimed, activists\nare besieged, prisoners and detainees are oppressed\nand the attempts of the Israeli side to demolish the\nAl-Aqsa Mosque are continuing. That requires a\nstronger role and a more united and effective presence\nof the United Nations and its various agencies against\nIsraeli arrogance and f louting of the resolutions of\nthe international community and its rejection of all\npeaceful proposals and initiatives.\nThe lack of international pressure on Israel\nrepresents a key failure in international justice standards.\nThe role of the United Nations and international forces\nin achieving justice and freedom requires the exertion\nof pressure to implement international resolutions. In\nthat regard, I ask: has Israel forgotten that its State\nwas created on the basis of an international resolution?\nWe declare our full support for the application of the\nState of Palestine to become a full State Member of\nthe United Nations in order to affirm its legitimacy\nand to ensure respect for its recognized rights under\ninternational law.\nWe also call on the United Nations to adopt\nappropriate solutions to end the crisis and internal war\nin Syria and to put an end to all forms of violence against\nthousands of civilians in Syria, including women and\nchildren. Proposed initiatives and announced peaceful\nsolutions shall be revived to end the crisis and to\nmake a success of the mission of the Joint Special\nRepresentative of the United Nations and the League of\nArab States for Syria, Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi.\n\nI reiterate the call on all concerned parties in Syria,\nthe Government and the insurgents, to heed and respond\nto repeated calls to initiate dialogue and make mutual\nconcessions as the only way to stop the bloodshed.\nThe only option for our brothers in Syria is to agree\non an initiative to mark the path towards change and a\npeaceful transfer of power through the ballot box.\nThere is no doubt that Somalia has been living in\ndire crisis since the early 1990s. Yemen and Somalia\nhave deep historical relations and both provide\nstrategic depth for each other. On that basis, Yemen\nplayed a leading role in restoring peace and stability\nin Somalia by supporting the reconciliation efforts\nand hosting various rounds of negotiations between\ndifferent parties. Yemen did not stop there; it opened its\ndoors to more than a million Somali refugees, despite\nthe difficult circumstances Yemen is encountering and\nall the economic, health and security impacts of the\nrefugee process.\nWhile we congratulate the Somali people on their\nsuccess on their accomplishing a peaceful transfer of\npower and electing Mr. Hassan Sheik Mohamud as their\nnew President in a democratic environment, we hope\nthat those elections will lead to reconstruction of State\ninstitutions; the restoration of peace and security to\nSomalia; and an end to the humanitarian suffering and\nits consequences, including the suffering of a million\nSomali refugees in our country. We reaffirm the\nRepublic of Yemen\u2019s position of support for the elected\nSomali president and the Government he is forming. We\nwill spare no effort to enhance relations between our\ntwo brotherly countries for our mutual benefit and in\nthe interests of security and stability and of countering\nterrorism and piracy in the region.\nIn that context, the continuing and intensive influx\nof migrants and asylum seekers into Yemen represents\na real threat to national security, peace and stability\nin the region. It is essential that the international\ncommunity share that burden with Yemen, especially\nsince Yemen\u2019s resources are being drained. Under the\nexceptional conditions that Yemen is dealing with, it is\nextremely difficult for us to cope with the continued\nf low of arrivals.\nThe brutal ethnic cleansing of Muslims in Myanmar\nmakes it incumbent on the international community to\npay attention to that humanitarian tragedy and take\nconcrete steps to stop the series of violent and savage\nacts being committed against that group. Considering the acts of ethnic brutality and other practices that have\noccurred in recent months, it is not enough to issue\nstatements condemning and denouncing them. An\ninternational committee should be set up to investigate\nhuman rights violations against Muslims in that\ncountry, deliver humanitarian aid to them and provide\nguarantees to protect them against further violence and\natrocities.\nFinally, I would like to reiterate my thanks to the\nPresident of the General Assembly and the Secretary-\nGeneral. We greatly appreciate the role of the United\nNations as an international platform that brings together\nall countries and nations of the globe for the sake of\npeace, security, freedom, human rights and coexistence\nbetween nations, religions and civilizations and their\ncommon interests."

        "file_text": "\ufeffI would like to congratulate\nMr. Jeremi\u0107 on his election as President of the General\nAssembly at its sixty-seventh session and to commend\nAmbassador Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser for the\nmanner in which he guided the proceedings of the\nAssembly last year.\nJust over two weeks ago, Somalia took a bold and\ndecisive step away from decades of division, disorder\nand conflict, and instead towards the reconstitution\nof a more representative, more democratic Somali\nRepublic, at peace with itself, with its neighbours and\nwith the rest of the world. On 1 August this year, a\nNational Constituent Assembly adopted the new Somali\nConstitution and on 20 August a new Parliament was\nsworn in, which elected our new President, Hassan\nSheikh Mohamud, on 10 September. In the coming\nweeks, the President will appoint a Prime Minister and\na new cabinet will be duly established.\nLet me take this opportunity to convey the sincere\nregrets of President Mohamud. He would have liked to\nbe here himself to address the Assembly on this great\noccasion. However, the tremendous scale and urgency\nof the challenges facing him as leader of Somalia and\nthe demands of his new role did not permit him to travel\nhere to New York to present his remarks in person. He asked me to come here to convey his warm greetings\nand his vision for Somalia\u2019s future.\nFor more than two decades of crisis, the Somali\npeople have suffered and endured, but we have not done\nso alone. The United Nations has stood by us, providing\nhumanitarian assistance to those of our people in need,\nhelping us to rebuild from the ruins of war, bringing\nus time and again to the negotiating table to resolve\nour differences and maintaining the dignity of the\nSomali nation by keeping our f lag f lying throughout\nthese long, dark years. As we emerge from the long,\ndark days, I wish to express my personal thanks, and\nthose of the Somali people, to the Secretary-General\nand his Special Representative, Augustine Mahiga, for\ntheir tireless support and crucial role in helping to open\nthis new chapter in Somali history.\nSomalia\u2019s progress is also due in great measure\nto the self less courage and sacrifice of our brothers\nand sisters in the African Union, including our closest\nneighbours, whose forces have fought long and hard,\nwith so many laying down their lives in the battle to\ngive our children a better future. With the support of\nthe African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM)\nand other partners, our armed forces are becoming\nincreasingly experienced and capable, but we will need\nAMISOM\u2019s steadfast presence and mentoring for some\ntime to come, and we call upon our brothers in the\nAfrican Union to renew their commitment as we move\nforward to assume our own responsibilities in full. We\nthank our international partners who are diligently\nsupporting AMISOM, especially the European Union\nand the United States, among others.\nThe members of the League of Arab States and\nthe Organization of Islamic Cooperation have also\nextended the hand of friendship to the Somali people\nduring these difficult times. We are especially grateful\nto the Government and people of Turkey for their faith,\ncourage and leadership in ending our long isolation and\nbuilding bridges between Somalia and the rest of the\nworld.\nBut now, with all these partners standing by us we\nmust increasingly learn to travel our own path with our\nown energies, developing the ability to stand on our\nown feet and step free from reliance on our kind friends.\nAlready, the Somali diaspora from around the world are\nreturning to the country with investment and skills that\nwill build the future Somalia. We can also learn from\nhow peace and growing prosperity have developed in other parts of the country. We must build on the return\nof normality in Mogadishu, and elsewhere in Somalia,\nand on the growing public confidence in the future. It\nis the Somali people in the villages and the nomadic\npastoralists, with their resilience, drive and dynamism,\nwho are best placed to lend real stability to Somalia\u2019s\nfuture.\nThe end of Somalia\u2019s transition was brought about\nby the tremendous joint efforts of the Transitional\nFederal Government, Somali regional administrations,\ncivil society and our traditional elders. Against all\nodds, within one year Somalis were able to adopt a new\nprovisional Constitution, create a new Parliament and\nelect a new President, heralding the beginning of a new\nera. This one-year experience has shown several things.\nWhen we put our minds to it, we Somalis are capable\nof overcoming tremendous obstacles and delivering\non expectations. It has shown that we can effect our\npolitical transitions within our own country. It has\nshown that Somalis are indeed ready for a new chapter\nand are calling for a permanent Government that can\nbuild on the foundations of this remarkable year.\nSomalia\u2019s transition has officially ended, but\nthe work of rebuilding our nation continues. The\nnew administration has four short years to translate\nagreements and objectives made on paper into concrete,\ntangible progress for our people, and to place Somalia\nfirmly on an irreversible path to enduring peace and\ngrowing prosperity.\nThe most urgent challenge is to restore peace\nand security throughout Somali territory. Our forces,\ntogether with our African Union allies, are making\ngreat progress in that regard. But a stable peace\ncannot be achieved through military means alone. We\nmust practise the politics of inclusion, establishing\na credible, representative, inclusive and capable\nGovernment \u2014 a Government by the people, for the\npeople, not a Government of the few, serving the\ninterests of the few. Initially, that Government must be\nabout delivering real governance and connections with\nthe people. It must be about the process of building\nlocal representation, addressing community justice\nand seeking to build basic services, rather than about\ndistant institutions of Government from Mogadishu,\nor even provincial centres. Power and responsibility\nmust be devolved as close to the people as possible, in\naccordance with the principles of federalism. It will be\nimportant to recognize the existence of other Somali\nauthorities, as well as de facto political and military forces across the country, with which we will work to\nestablish a vibrant, prosperous and stable representative\nGovernment democracy, firmly adhering to and\ngrounded in Somali and Islamic values.\nWe will also require a fair and independent judiciary,\none resistant to executive interference, and one that will\nmeet the needs and earn the trust of ordinary citizens,\nwhile bringing an end to the culture of impunity that\nhas gripped our nation for the past two decades.\nWe have repeatedly extended an olive branch to the\nGovernment\u2019s adversaries, and, although this has been\nrepeatedly rejected, our new President will continue\nto reach out and offer peace. Al-Shabaab is a complex\nand heterogeneous movement. Most of its members are\nordinary citizens who have aligned themselves with\nAl-Shabaab out of fear or a sense of grievance. At the\nsame time we must also be honest with ourselves and\nadmit that some of the members come from a nationalist,\nconservative faction of our fractured country, which\nhas been disillusioned and damaged by decades of\nconflict, and they have sought refuge in an extreme and\nharsh source of justice and security. To them we must\nprove that there is a better way. To them we have always\nsaid and will continue to say, \u201cBrothers and sisters, lay\ndown your arms and let us talk\u201d.\nWe Somalis have a saying \u2014 after every war comes\npeace. So let us remember that we have no choice as a\nnation but to live together. Let us settle our differences\nthrough dialogue and compromise, so that there is no\nlonger any justification for any Somali to take up arms\nagainst another. To those few ideological extremists in\nAl-Shabaab\u2019s ranks who remain committed to the use\nof terror and the murder of innocents to achieve their\naims, we say, \u201cThere is no place in Somali society, nor\nin international society, for you and your violent creed.\nWe will fight you until Somalia is once again a nation\nfounded on the peace, tolerance and management that\nconstitute the true spirit of the great religion of Islam\u201d.\nAs we focus our energies on these immediate\nchallenges, we must nevertheless keep our longer-\nterm goals clearly in view. The new Government\nunderstands clearly that its purpose is not to entrench\nitself indefinitely in power, but to lay the foundation\nfor a democratic system of governance, anchored in\nIslamic values and based on universal, competitive\nelections, by August 2016.\nThe new Government has just four short years\nwithin which to establish the states and regions of this federation, and to do so in a way that unifies our people\nrather than dividing them. We must validate the new\nConstitution through consultation and referendum, and\nestablish systems of governance that serve the interests\nof the Somali people. We must design representative\nelectoral systems that serve to heal the divisions of our\nsociety rather than to aggravate them.\nAs we move away from transitional Government\ninto the era of permanent Government, we must establish\na new compact for national coexistence in which the\naspirations of all Somalis, not only some, are reflected.\nWe recognize that the bonds of love and solidarity that\nbound us together in 1960 have been heavily damaged\nand sorely tested. The talks initiated earlier this year\nbetween the Transitional Federal Government and the\nSomaliland administration have begun well, and we\nintend to continue them. We will not use military or\npolitical coercion to bring out an artificial unity; we\nwant a genuine unity that results from negotiations,\nmutual respect and mutual agreement.\nThe durability of our stabilization efforts will\ndepend in large part upon our ability to revive and\ndevelop the Somali economy. Security and durable\npeace cannot exist without jobs and food, and therefore\nwe must work hard to ensure that food is on the table of\nthe average Somali family, to create job opportunities\nand to enable Somalis to work for themselves.\nOur country is abundant in resources; we have the\nlongest coastline in Africa, 9 million acres of fertile\nland, the highest per capita number of livestock in the\nworld. We have oil and minerals. We are strategically\nlocated at the gateway of the Middle East and Africa,\nat the conf luence of the Indian Ocean and the Red Sea.\nOur challenge as Somalis is to use those resources to\nbring our country and our people back onto the global\neconomic playing field.\nOn the topic of resources, we are committed\nto strengthening the Government\u2019s financial\naccountability. Somalia is a poor country, and we\ncannot afford corruption. We seek the assistance of our\ninternational partners in establishing and strengthening\ntransparent systems of public financial management.\nThe problems of Somalia have spilled far beyond\nour borders. Foreign countries have taken in hundreds\nof thousands of Somalis f leeing the crisis in our country,\nat considerable sacrifice to their own citizens; Somali\npirates have become the scourge of shipping far from\nour shores. Extremists from across the world have used our territory as a base from which to plan and launch\nattacks against foreign countries.\nAs Somalia reclaims its status as a full member\nof the international community, we must acknowledge\nour responsibility as a nation, both for the proliferation\nof these problems and for their eventual resolution.\nWe recognize the urgency of tackling these threats\nto international security, but we are also conscious of\ntheir complexity and of the fact that lasting solutions\ncan be achieved only through ref lection, consultation,\nthe force of law and only, as a last resort, the judicious\nuse of force. We intend to engage with our international\npartners on all of these fronts, as we strengthen our\ninternal capacity to address these challenges.\nThe road ahead is long, but we, the Somali people,\nare committed, and we are ready. We have created the\nguideposts, and we have chosen a new leadership to\nhelp us move forward. We are grateful for the support\nof the world community; we would not be here today\nwithout its moral, political and financial support. Most\ndear to us is the personal sacrifice made by our African\nbrothers and sisters who came in person to help us\nprotect our country and people. We cannot thank them\nenough, and we hope one day to be able to repay them.\nAs many today have noted, the United Nations\nwas founded on the conviction that the nations of the\nworld could come together in the spirit of cooperation\nto tackle their common problems for the sake of the\nwhole of humanity.\nThe world is going through a challenging\nperiod \u2014 economic crises, religious tensions and\nresource disputes. Every nation has its own challenges\nand priorities. And yet we come together as the United\nNations to forge a common way forward, because we\nrecognize that this small Earth is all the space we\nhave, and we must find a way to share it and coexist\npeacefully.\nAs Somalis, we have learned this hard lesson\nthrough bitter experience, and we are living through\nit every day, each time another young man chooses\nto take his own life and the lives of others; each time\na young mother has to bury a child. Let us not forget\nthat in rebuilding a nation, or in steering the world to\na better place, we are dealing with the lives of human\nbeings, each life as precious as the next. For the future\nof our children, we must work harder to make our world\npeaceful and prosperous. In that context, on behalf of the Somali people, I\nwant to convey our condolences to the United States\nand Algeria on the recent violent loss of their senior\ndiplomats. Diplomacy is a peaceful calling and the\nfoundation of the United Nations, and we must protect\ndiplomats for their important role in promoting dialogue\nand better understanding across countries and cultures.\nThe members of the Assembly are not strangers\nto conflict and war. Many countries have experienced\nviolence and destruction equal to or greater than my\nown. But few other countries in modern times have\nexperienced such a prolonged period of statelessness:\na nation without a recognized Government, a valid\npassport or a convertible currency.\nBut it is not just the material attributes of statehood\nthat we have missed. To be stateless in this world of\nStates is injurious to a people\u2019s identity, to its rights and\nprivileges as a nation, and to its dignity. It is time for us\nto reclaim Somalia\u2019s rightful place in the community of\nnations, to shoulder our duties and obligations, and to\nplace our country in the service of peace, security and\nprosperity on this planet we share."

        "file_text": "\ufeffAllow me to\ncongratulate the President on his assumption of the\npresidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-seventh\nsession. I assure him of the full support and cooperation\nof the Jamaican delegation. I would also like to place on\nrecord my delegation\u2019s appreciation to His Excellency\nMr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser for his invaluable\nguidance of the work of the Assembly during its sixty-\nsixth session. I also thank the Secretary-General,\nMr. Ban Ki-moon, and the staff of the Secretariat for\ntheir dedication and hard work in serving Member\nStates.\nThere is a tale of a young woman from a rural\nvillage in Jamaica who was approached by a political\ncandidate seeking to represent her community. \u201cWhat\nis it you want most from your representatives?\u201d the\ncandidate asked. The young woman considered the\nquestion for a moment. Slowly and thoughtfully she\nreplied, \u201cAll I want is an opportunity. I want you to\nprovide me and my family with a living environment in\nwhich I can work, contribute and prosper. Most of all, I\nwant you to provide for my family an environment that\nis safe and secure\u201d.\nFor hundreds of years, our respective peoples have\nlooked to their leaders with great expectations. They\nelected Governments that they felt could provide them\nwith the greatest sense of well-being and security. Historically and to the present day, they looked to\nheads of State and Government to provide them,\ntheir families, their communities and ultimately their\nrespective nations with leadership and direction that\nfoster that all-important sense of well-being and of\nfeeling secure. Over time, across the world, there has\nbeen an increasing sense of impatience and agitation\nborn of a sense of growing global insecurity.\nAccordingly, the United Nations agenda has\nexpanded its focus to address the multifaceted\nchallenges of food security, climate change, global\npandemics and the global economic and financial\ncrisis. We have already witnessed citizens from several\nnations spring into action with demands for change.\nOthers chose to occupy various spaces in protest. In the\nlight of that reality, many of those here \u2014 indeed, many\nof us as leaders \u2014 stand as buffers between apathy and\nanarchy.\nThe theme for this year\u2019s session of the Assembly,\n\u201cBringing about adjustment or settlement of\ninternational disputes or situations by peaceful means\u201d,\nis most appropriate and timely, given current events in\na number of countries and regions that pose a threat to\ninternational peace and security. It reflects the call by\nthat young woman, who simply asked her representative\nto provide for her and hers an environment that is safe\nand secure. Yet her request is not as simple as it appears.\nThe insecurity, impatience and unease that have\nemerged worldwide are explosive accelerants. They\nemerge from the heartbreaking scourge of poverty that\nwas so aptly described by the Jamaican national hero,\nMarcus Mosiah Garvey, who reminded us that poverty\nis\n\u201ca hellish state to be in. It is no virtue. It is a crime.\nTo be poor is to be hungry without possible hope\nof food; to be sick without hope of medicine; to be\ntired and sleepy without a place to lay one\u2019s head;\nto be naked without the hope of clothing; to be\ndespised and comfortless\u201d.\nWe must seek to rid ourselves of the conditions that\nlead to poverty. We must pursue social and economic\npolicies that will ensure social equity and justice for\nour people and increase their well-being and sense of\nsecurity. That can be achieved only if we, as Member\nStates, work together in good faith to secure the\nsustainable future we agreed to at Rio de Janeiro. Let\nus create the future we want, and let us put our people\nfirst. The global economy continues to be beset by\nuncertainty. That is compounded by the lingering\nnegative effects of the financial and economic crises.\nThe global shocks have affected all our peoples.\nThey threaten our communities, weaken our families\nand challenge individuals everywhere, regardless of\nhemisphere or region or whether they live in so-called\ndeveloped or developing countries or in the north, south,\neast or west. Some have fewer options than others. That\nis a vicious circle of insecurity.\nWe must not forget that a significant proportion\nof the world\u2019s poorest citizens live in middle-income\ncountries. That diverse group includes both large\ndeveloping economies and small island developing\nStates, such as those in the Caribbean. Many of us face\ncommon challenges. Several are highly indebted and\nextremely vulnerable to external shocks and natural\ndisasters. We face significant obstacles in our efforts to\nspur economic recovery and growth. We are hampered\nby the volatility of energy and food prices, decreases\nin export commodity prices, and weak capital inf lows.\nIncreasing food prices create untold hardships for many\nof our people, particularly the most vulnerable in our\nsocieties. Small countries need greater support in order\nto build resilience to economic and environmental\nshocks.\nI come to the Assembly today from such a nation.\nJamaica is a nation small in size but enormous in\nspirit \u2014 a nation with a people whose speed defies\nthe laws of physics, whose musical messages have\ninspired positive and revolutionary global change and\nwhose minds have given the world myriad solutions in\nareas that include science, law and medicine. Yet many\nnations like Jamaica have great possibility and potential\nthat are not reflected in, or ref lective of, their current\neconomic indicators.\nReforms in global economic governance,\nincluding of the international financial institutions,\nare required in order to take into account the need\nof small and vulnerable economies for special and\ndifferential treatment. Refocusing financial f lows in\nthe development agenda will also go a long way in\nhelping to bolster our natural resilience and resolve.\nWe commend the United Nations Conference on Trade\nand Development on the work it has done over the last\n48 years to advance the trade and development agenda\nand assist developing countries. There is still much to\nbe done, and we look forward to working with the full\nrange of development partners.\n\nWomen and children make up one particularly\nvulnerable group of our world. What we call external\nshocks cause real and serious dislocation in their daily\nlives. Too many mothers have to face tough choices to\nmeet their basic needs. Too many children are subjected\nto violence and abuse. Children, especially girls, are\nbeing used as pawns for economic gain, including\nthrough human trafficking and other exploitive actions.\nHuman trafficking is a dastardly threat to the welfare\nof our women, girls and boys. Our ancestors fought for\nour freedom. It is disgraceful that at this juncture of\nworld history we should see the emergence of a form\nof modern-day slavery that allows women, girls and\nboys to be traded as chattel. Many vulnerable young\nwomen are deceived and lured away by attractive\noffers to get them and their families out of poverty.\nThey then find themselves in a strange land, with no\nsupport, no identity and no hope of returning home;\nsold into modern-day slavery, their very bodies used as\na currency of exchange.\nJamaica is resolute in its commitment to\nstrengthening local and national programmes to\neliminate violence against women and children. At the\nsame time, I call on the international community to take\nbold action to address this scourge. Issues that affect\nwomen and children must be central to decision-making\nprocesses. We look forward to continued collaboration\nwith UN-Women and the international community to\nhelp break this cycle of exploitation and insecurity.\nThe devastating impact of HIV/AIDS and\nnon-communicable diseases also propels the cycle\nof global insecurity. Jamaica is cognizant of the\nconsiderable investment that the United Nations and the\ninternational community have made in the fight against\nHIV/AIDS. That support has allowed developing\ncountries, including Jamaica, to make a difference in\nthe lives of those affected. Nevertheless, inadequate\nhuman and financial resources constrain our ability to\nscale up testing and treatment, as well as to implement\nprogrammes for increasing awareness and reducing the\nrisk of new infections.\nThe developing world and lower-income populations\nare hardest hit by the impact of non-communicable\ndiseases (NCDs). The high social and developmental\ncosts of NCDs demand concerted policy action at the\nnational and international levels. We must implement\nthe outcomes of the High-level Meeting on NCDs held\nlast year. We are on the threshold of 2015, the target date\nfor the achievement of the Millennium Development\nGoals. The results thus far have been uneven. We\nneed to reinvigorate Millennium Development Goal\n8, the Global Partnership for Development. I wish\nto underscore the situation associated with our\nmiddle-income country status. Country categorizations\nshould not serve as obstacles to delivering support to\nthe world\u2019s poorest and most vulnerable. We urge that\nmiddle-income countries not be pushed to the margins of\nthe development agenda, nor be put on the fringe of the\ndevelopment assistance provided by the international\ncommunity. A review of the factors used by the relevant\nmultilateral agencies in measuring a country\u2019s wealth\nis urgently needed. We are supportive of the proposals\nput forward by the Economic Commission for Latin\nAmerica and the Caribbean for an alternative but\ncomplementary approach to the criterion of per capita\nincome in the allocation of financing for development.\nI now turn to global political developments. The\ncycle of insecurity transcends borders. Recent events\nhave called attention to the fragility of peace and\nsecurity in many parts of the globe, and underscore the\nimportance of respect for the rule of law, democracy\nand good governance. Jamaica reiterates its adherence\nto the principles of the United Nations Charter,\nmultilateralism and the inviolability of diplomatic\ninstitutions in the conduct of relations among States.\nWe will continue to add our voice to the ongoing work\nat the United Nations to secure human rights, justice,\nsocial equity and the peaceful settlement of disputes.\nTransnational crime, narco-trafficking and the\nillicit trade in small arms and ammunition are major\ncomponents of the cycle of insecurity. They continue\nto endanger lives, undermine the rule of law and\nfuel violent crime. We remain resolute in our call for\nencouraging partnerships in fighting this scourge, and\nwill continue to work with all delegations to achieve a\ncomprehensive and robust arms trade treaty.\nThe conflict in Syria poses a real threat to\ninternational peace and security. We are deeply\nconcerned at the escalating internal violence and the\nresulting loss of life. It is our conviction that this\nconflict can still be resolved through political and\ndiplomatic means.\nWe continue to urge the leaders of Israel and the\nPalestinian Authority to resume negotiations as early as\npossible, based on the two-State solution and relevant United Nations resolutions. Those resolutions address\nIsrael\u2019s right to exist within secure borders, as well\nas the aspirations of the Palestinian people to self-\ndetermination and statehood.\nWe must ensure that the United Nations remains\nrelevant to its membership through a process of\nreform of its organs, including the Security Council.\nNegotiations should proceed urgently towards a\nsatisfactory conclusion.\nMore than two years after the devastating\nearthquake, Haiti\u2019s plight remains deeply troubling.\nWe are concerned that only a disappointing fraction\nof the pledges made have been disbursed, and yet the\nhumanitarian situation in Haiti is perilous. As a close\nfriend and neighbour of Haiti, with strong historical ties,\nI encourage members of the international community to\nmake good on their commitments. The Haitian people\nneed our continued support.\nThe long-standing trade and economic embargo\nagainst Cuba, another close neighbour and friend of\nJamaica, has had severe negative effects on its growth\nand development. Jamaica reiterates its call for an end\nto the embargo against Cuba and the extraterritorial\nmeasures aimed at extending its reach to include third\ncountries.\nJamaica continues to work with our partners to\nerect a memorial at the United Nations to honour the\nvictims of slavery and the trans-Atlantic slave trade.\nWe are grateful for the generous contributions received\nto date to erect the permanent memorial, and reiterate\nthe call for continued financial support.\nFifty years ago, upon gaining our independence,\nJamaica committed itself to the aims of the United\nNations and fully accepted the responsibilities of\nmembership. Our national pledge commits each and\nevery Jamaican to stand up for justice, brotherhood\nand peace and to play our part in advancing the welfare\nof the whole human race. We will not resile from that\ncommitment.\nLet us work together to end the cycle of global\ninsecurity. Let us provide an opportunity for every man,\nwoman and child to fulfil their God-given potential. I\nleave members with the words of Robert Nesta \u201cBob\u201d\nMarley, who sang: \u201cOne love, one heart\u201d. I hope that the\npeoples of the world will one day live together in peace,\nlove, security, unity and prosperity."

        "file_text": "\ufeffI stand\nhere today in order to convey to the General Assembly\nthe sincere regards and best wishes of the people of\nIraq, who wish to share in forging closer bonds of\namity and cooperation between peoples and countries,\nat a time when my country is undergoing a structural\ntransformation at every level, a process that will enable\nit to reform itself, achieve its goals and consolidate its\ngains.\nWe are building a future through the conscious\nunderstanding of our history as the cradle of civilization\nand where the earliest writing system and codifi cation of\nlaws were born. Iraq has been successful in establishing\na democratic, pluralistic and federalist State on the basis\nof an enlightened Constitution, drafted by our people\u2019s\nrepresentatives and voted on by our people.\nOur Constitution lays out the aspirations of our\npeople to a free and decent life based on freedom,\ndemocracy and the peaceful transfer of authority,\ncitizenship and human rights. Iraq has regained its\nsecurity, political and economic health in record time\nand under extremely difficult conditions, where the\nforces of darkness had been betting that terrorism would\nderail the experiment. However, thanks to God and the\npatriotic vigour and self-awareness of our nation, our\npeople were able to turn the page. Our efforts are based\non a cultural history of about 10,000 years and on a\ngreat human legacy created by the heavenly messages and laudable human experiences that flourished in our\nglorious land.\nOur renewed ambition to build a modern State\nwhere the Iraqi people enjoy freedom, development\nand prosperity requires us to move towards the\nestablishment of good, friendly and equal relations\nwith all nations in the world, within the framework of\na cooperative international system governed by clear\nrules that prevent the problems and crises that could\nundermine its prosperity and stability. The new Iraq\nhas chosen to embark on the path of cooperation and\ncoordination with the international community in the\npolitical, economic and development spheres. Those\nefforts have been coupled with significant qualitative\nleaps in our economic growth that will qualify Iraq to\nreturn to the realm of the world economy and to emerge\nwithin the international economic system, based on a\nrealistic vision that has achieved a number of positive\ndevelopments over recent years.\nAccording to various indicators, our gross\ndomestic product (GDP) has doubled, which has in turn\ndoubled the per capita share of the GDP. According to\nprojections by the International Monetary Fund, Iraq\u2019s\nGDP is expected to reach approximately $150 billion\nin 2014. The Iraqi Government has also succeeded in\nimplementing policies to curb inflation and to control\ngovernmental spending, in addition to our success in\ncollaborating with the international community to\nreduce the debt accumulated by the country over past\ndecades.\nWe have embraced a theory of balanced growth in\nour national development plans for the upcoming years,\nin which the oil sector is to serve as the engine for\nother sectors. Iraq has oil reserves amounting to about\n143 billion barrels and potential reserves surpassing\nthe current estimated proven reserves, in addition to\nlarge reserves of natural gas amounting to 126.7 trillion\ncubic feet. We expect investments to contribute to\nsubstantial development in the oil industry in Iraq\nthrough licensing rounds, establishing refineries\nand other oil- and gas-related sectors and industries.\nEstimates suggest that from 2017 to 2020 production\nwill reach more than 10 million barrels of oil per day.\nThe development plan will include all sectors and\ninfrastructure in order to provide secure and promising\ninvestment opportunities. The Iraqi Government has\nprepared legislation to promote confidence in the Iraqi\neconomy by providing legal protection for foreign\ninvestments in Iraq through the guarantees listed in the investment law itself and through Iraq\u2019s accession to\nthe Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency in 2007\nand through bilateral treaties to guarantee and protect\ninvestments.\nWe were able to establish solid foundations for\npolitical conduct, which has matured rapidly as our\npeople have grown to accept those unlike themselves\nand to live according to the principle of citizenship,\nthe rule of law, the independence of the judiciary and\nthe freedom of expression. We proudly announce that,\nowing to our freedom of opinion and expression, we\ndo not have a single prisoner jailed for his beliefs or\nopinions. In our fight against terrorism, human rights\nremain a cherished principle that we respect and\npromote as a just cause. We do not have any justification\nto tamper with such rights.\nIt is true that confronting terrorism has cost Iraq a lot\nof blood, tears, sweat and financial resources, but that\nconfrontation has rewarded our people with a permanent\nimmunity against violence. It has also created extreme\nsensitivity vis-\u00e0-vis violence as a means to resolve our\nstrife with others. Therefore, as much as we care about\nsparing our people the ravages of fighting, we hope that\nother countries, especially neighbouring countries, will\nlearn from the Iraqi experience and spare their peoples\nunnecessary turmoil. We call upon them to adopt the\nprinciple of negotiation to resolve conflicts and the\nuse of dialogue, logic, reason, laws and the peaceful\ntransfer of power.\nThat is the essence of Iraq\u2019s position regarding\nthe revolutions of the Arab Spring, which we cannot\ndo anything about except to be entirely on the side of\nthe people and their legitimate aspirations, their right\nto self-determination and the right to choose their own\nrulers. We share the concerns regarding the issues facing\nthe peoples and States Members of the Organization;\nthose concerns represent a humanitarian, legal and\nmoral burden, because all of us share one world, which\nis affected by conflicts and their aftermath.\nBased on that, the Syrian issue and the humanitarian\ndiffi culties facing civilians in that country occupy a\ngreat deal of our attention. We think that the escalating\nviolence in Syria is a reason for distress and concern,\nand it is incumbent upon the leaders gathered here to\nwork in earnest to stop the bloodshed, which claims the\nlives of tens and perhaps hundreds of people every day\nin Syria. We would like also to draw attention to the\ndanger of providing the fighting parties with weapons, which only leads to more violence, bloodshed and loss\nof life. The situation is endangering the social fabric\nof the Syrian people and may lead to fragmentation\nand disintegration of that people, whom we cherish and\nwhose unity and sovereignty we care about.\nWe also realize that the facts on the ground suggest\nthat regional and international intervention could\nadversely impact the Syrian issue and might cause\nunlimited chaos and devastation that would spare no\none, including the interveners. We therefore sincerely\ncall for dialogue and a peaceful solution as the only\nmeans to end a crisis that could engulf the whole region\nand exacerbate the current situation.\nThe events in Syria have demonstrated that\nresolving the crisis through violence and force could\ndouble the costs incurred by the Syrians and the region,\nfor such means only increase the suffering of civilians,\ndestroy infrastructure and multiply the number of\ndisplaced persons and refugees. That is why we hope\nthat all the parties to the conflict understand that the\nmilitary solution alone is a dangerous move and gamble.\nFrom this rostrum, we call upon kings, presidents and\nother heads of State here today at this humanitarian\ngathering to support reconciliation and dialogue among\nall Syrians and endorse the United Nations and Arab\nLeague initiative promoted by Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi\nafter the noble efforts of Mr. Kofi Annan reached at an\nimpasse.\nIn that regard, we do not hide our concern about\nthe consequences of the ongoing crisis, which could\nonly worsen if sectarian and ethnic strife is triggered.\nThat, in turn, could lead the region and its peoples into\na spiral of fighting with no end on the horizon. Such\na prospect makes it incumbent upon us on us to try in\nearnest to contain and peacefully resolve the crisis,\nwhile preserving the interests of the Syrian people and\npreventing further deterioration of the situation.\nIraq\u2019s initiative aimed at resolving the Syrian crisis\ncontinues to stand as a beacon of peace, as we search\nfor an exit acceptable to all the forces of good. Our\ninitiative is based on the following two points. First,\nIraq has a keen desire to see Syria remain intact as a\nState, and we support the hopes and aspirations of the\nSyrian people for a free and dignified life. Secondly,\nIraq is concerned at the possible repercussions of the\nviolence and destruction caused by Syria\u2019s internal\nwar and sectarian strife, which we fear could have a\nspillover effect.\n\nIraq\u2019s unwavering and well-known position does\nnot deviate from the Arab ranks on issues of crucial\nimportance to our Arab nation. We accordingly\nsupport the establishment of the State of Palestine in\nthe occupied Palestinian territories, with Jerusalem as\nits capital, and declare our support for the membership\nof the State of Palestine in the United Nations. We\nalso declare our unequivocal rejection of the policies\nof oppression, Judaization and usurpation of land\nthat Israel pursues without regard for international\ncondemnation of its unjust practices, including the use\nof brutal force. We also reject Israel\u2019s disregard for the\nrepeated international calls to sign the Treaty on the\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and to place its\nmilitary arsenal and facilities under the supervision of\nthe International Atomic Energy Agency.\nWe have tirelessly called for the establishment\nin our region of a zone without nuclear weapons.\nTherefore, within the international framework, we are\ncontributing to efforts to implement a Middle East zone\nfree of all weapons of mass destruction, chief among\nwhich are nuclear weapons. That is why we endorse the\npreparations for the Helsinki conference to be held this\nyear with a view to setting up a process that would set\nup such a zone. Any failure in that endeavour would\nlead to an arms race in a region that is in dire need of\npeace and stability.\nWe condemn and reject the discriminatory policies\npursued against religious and ethnic minorities in\nmany countries the world over. We especially condemn\nthe inhumane violations of the rights of Muslims in\nMyanmar, who face genocide. The world\u2019s conscience\nshould not remain untroubled by the gravity of their\nplight. Such situations run counter to all the principles of\nhuman rights law, religious teachings and international\nconventions.\nOur good and friendly relations with our\nneighbours, the region and the entire world are\ngoverned by a balanced foreign policy based on mutual\nrespect, common interests and non-interference in the\naffairs of others. We also uphold the principles of goodneighbourliness\nand dialogue in our relations with the\nArab and Muslim worlds, as well as with the entire\nworld. Iraq hosted the League of Arab States Summit\nin March, which marked a return to our active, natural\nand pioneering role in joint Arab decision-making and\naction. That was followed by Iraq\u2019s hosting of one of\nthe rounds of international negotiations on the Iranian\nnuclear issue, which we undertook in the objective, balanced and responsible spirit that characterizes Iraq\u2019s\nclear position with respect to that issue. It is a position\nthat declares our firm support for international efforts\nto prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons, while\naffirming the right of peoples and countries to benefit\nfrom the peaceful use of nuclear energy.\nWe call upon the international community,\nrepresented by the United Nations and its Secretary-\nGeneral, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, whom we highly respect\nand revere, to extend support to Iraq\u2019s efforts to exit\nfrom the Chapter VII provisions imposed on us as a\nresult of the mistaken policies of the former regime\nfollowing Iraq\u2019s invasion of Kuwait, especially as there\nis no longer any justification for such international\naction. Iraq is no longer a threat to anyone and has\nfulfilled most of its obligations, as is confirmed by\nthe renewal of our brotherly relations with the State\nof Kuwait, seen specifically in the mutual visits of\nhigh-level officials of our respective countries and the\nserious and constructive dialogue based on a sincere\ndesire and sustained efforts to resolve all outstanding\nissues between us.\nI would be remiss if I failed to speak of the\nrepulsive abuse directed at the great Prophet\nMuhammad \u2014 peace be upon him \u2014 and the wave of\nviolent protests that shook the Islamic world because\nof a ridiculous movie that attacked the image of our\nProphet \u2014 peace be upon him \u2014 a movie that nearly\ncaused relations between East and West to unravel. We\nneed to conduct a sincere and serious examination on\nhow to prevent the recurrence of such insults through\nan international ban that criminalizes those who insult\nreligions, disrespect religious symbols or insult the\ngreat prophets and messengers. Such actions constitute\na blatant aggression against everything great, holy and\nsacred. The recurrence of those obscene actions will\nsupply terrorists with prime material for recruiting\nangry youth for use in violent actions that threaten\npeace and security, which could cause many casualties,\nas recent events have shown.\nWe therefore clearly need to contain such attacks\nand prohibit the production and dissemination of similar\nprovocative materials. As nobody in the Islamic world\nis able to contain the consequences of such disregard\nfor Islamic values and their sanctity, we believe that the\nUnited Nations should play a central and constructive\nrole in this matter, with a view to preventing potentially\nfar-reaching and dangerous ramifications.\n\nIn conclusion, we, the people and Government of\nIraq, extend our hand to the other Member States with a\nview to increased collaboration aimed at achieving our\ncommon goals. Those are noble goals, based on lofty\nprinciples and cherished human values, and honour all\nhuman beings as supremely deserving of leading a free\nand safe life and enjoying fundamental freedoms. We\nhope that when we meet again our world will be a safer\nplace, our peoples will enjoy better conditions and the\ninternational climate will have improved."

        "file_text": "\ufeffI extend my warmest\ncongratulations to Mr. Jeremi\u0107 on his election to preside\nover the General Assembly at its sixty-seventh session.\nThe demanding agenda of this Assembly makes that\nno easy task, but I assure him of Malta\u2019s support and\nfriendship.\nOver a year ago, the protagonists of the Arab Spring\nproclaimed that their time had come. They shed their\nblood for freedom, calling for an end to the status quo\nof oppression and injustice. Unfortunately, extremists\npersist in their efforts to derail that call. United States Ambassador Christopher Stevens was, sadly, one of\ntheir victims. One cannot stress strongly enough the\nimportance of protecting the inviolability of diplomatic\npremises and personnel, and reiterate our collective\ncondemnation of the deplorable acts perpetrated\nrecently in various capitals of our neighbourhood.\nMany doubted the success of the Arab Spring;\nmany feared its call for change. Yet change did come.\nWe are now witnessing the first seeds of democracy\nblossoming in places where that would previously have\nbeen unthinkable. And more change is yet to come.\nPeople around the world are calling for it. Theirs is a\ncall that pits us against conventional thinking, pushing\nus out of our comfort zone and into the unfamiliar \u2014 a\ncall for humankind to go beyond the borders of human\ndifference and indifference. We have the choice to heed\nthat call or to ignore it, but make no mistake \u2014 we do\nhave a choice.\nMalta knows all too well what the call for change\nis about. It experiences it first hand as it receives those\nf leeing war, hunger and persecution, arriving on its\nshores after a perilous journey in search of a better\nlife. Malta recognizes that we need to give those people\nsafe refuge, and we do so with a sense of solidarity and\na strong belief that every human life is worth saving.\nWe are committed to giving assistance, and we remain\nsteadfast in our belief that Malta will continue its\nhistorical role of welcoming those who are bereft of\nhuman rights and dignity.\nIt is in that spirit that Malta calls upon the\ninternational community to give those people genuine\nalternatives, and to no longer accept that it is a problem\nin someone else\u2019s backyard. We want to ensure that\nthe attainment of the Millennium Development Goals\ndoes not become a simple check-marking exercise, but\ninstead underscores a truly global effort that will lift\nmillions out of situations of deprivation, disease and\ndiscrimination. Those goals must be sustained long\nafter the media has gone and the speeches are over, and\nwe urge the Assembly to spare no effort in seeing that\nit is done.\nThe choice of freedom has seen Malta\u2019s neighbour\nto the south hold its first free and fully democratic\nelections in 60 years. We salute Libya on its recent\nsuccesses. For many, the act of voting was a success in\nitself. The Libyan people voted for their policy-makers.\nThey did not vote for ideology, but for visionaries who\nwill breathe life into their aspirations. It is a time of celebration for our neighbours, and Malta joins others\nin recognizing their achievements, as well as the\nachievements of the other countries of the Arab Spring.\nYet as we bear witness to the wave of democratic\nreform drifting across the southern Mediterranean\nshores, we must also recall that others are still struggling\nfor freedom. The situation in Syria cannot but trouble\nus. Oppression and violence are never the solution.\nThey only stif le the inevitable for a short while, for\nthe human spirit can never be defeated. And it is our\nduty, as the international community, to respond. It is\nnot a question of resolutions and syntax. It is our moral\nobligation to ensure that the people of Syria are not\nabandoned to a tragic fate.\nThe time to sit on the fence and live with prejudices\nand division is over. Malta firmly believes that now\ncan be the right time for a new era \u2014 not just for the\nsouthern littoral shores of the Mediterranean Sea, but\nfor the whole basin. The Mediterranean region has\nknown too many wars, too many divisions and far too\nmany prejudices. As the heart of the Mediterranean,\nMalta understands well the nuances of the basin, and\nit is this understanding that pushes us to reaffirm our\ncommitment to the promotion of prosperity and peace\nacross the whole Mediterranean region and beyond.\nMalta\u2019s initiative to convene a European Union-League\nof Arab States ministerial meeting in Malta in 2008\nwas specifically aimed at attaining that. We salute the\ndecision for the \u201cMalta II\u201d meeting to take place in\nCairo next November.\nOur efforts did not stop there. In a few days\u2019 time,\nMalta will host the 5+5 Heads of State and Government\nMeeting of the Western Mediterranean Forum. That\ngrouping should offer an excellent opportunity to\ndiscuss such issues. The summit meeting coincides\nwith the dramatic changes taking place in the political\nlandscape in North Africa. The expectation for\nthe implementation of concrete action in the Euro-\nMediterranean region, transcending ineffective\ndeclarations, statements and conclusions, is important.\nI hope that the Malta Summit will meet the aspirations\nof the peoples of the northern and southern basin of the\nMediterranean. We cannot fail in that regard. We owe\nit to our peoples.\nHowever, if we want to truly embrace the changes\nthat are taking place around us, we must take them\nfurther. The call to rise above stalemate and stagnation\nis nowhere more evident than in the Middle East peace process, where the fear of change is holding all\nthose involved back. The parties concerned must face\nsome uncomfortable truths in order to overcome the\nstumbling blocks. Bickering over who does what when\nis not the way forward. Forging common ground does\nnot equate with giving in.\nMalta believes that the international community\nmust redouble its efforts in that process and that there\ncan be no rest until the world welcomes a truly stable\nand secure Middle East. We owe it to the Palestinians\nand the Israelis. We owe it to the wider Mediterranean\nregion, which has now been deadlocked for far too\nlong in the grips of that struggle. There really is no\nother option than that, for the alternative is further\nentrenchment of the positions held and more extremism\nand instability. Malta reaffirms its commitment to the\nefforts of the United Nations and the European Union,\nin particular towards the attainment of the goal of two\nviable States living side by side in harmony. However,\nthat solution is possible only if it is feasible on the\nground. That means no unilateral action, which would\nmake it an unattainable reality.\nA year from now, we should no longer be talking\nof a Middle East peace process but of a Middle East\nin peace, and that is that. The sceptics among us will\nnote that that is what was said last year and, of course,\neven the year before. For over 60 years, we have been\nmaking that call but we must not let the opportunity\nslip away once again. The Arab Spring shows us that\nwe need to answer the call of history now. It can be\ndifferent this time.\nThe events happening around us highlight not only\nour sense of duty to promote and protect human rights\nworldwide but also our sense of responsibility, for the\nactions that we take or fail to take today will have a\nbearing on future generations. Malta drew the attention\nto that belief with its call for a universal declaration on\nhuman responsibilities, made in this very Hall during\nthe sixty-fourth session of the Assembly in 2009.\nWe know that we are not alone in the endeavour.\nWe share with other Member States a commitment to\nsolidarity, cohesive ideas and a harmonious discourse\nin favour of the sustainability of the planet and the\nstewardship of its peoples. That conviction encourages\nus to push forward with our efforts for we are certain\nthat history will be on our side.\nIn conclusion, our destiny is what we perceive\nour future to be. We are convinced that the United Nations stands for the betterment of humanity. We\nremain committed to living up to the expectations and\naspirations to which we adhere under its Charter. Most\nof all, we need to embrace change. The future begins\nwith the choices that we make today."
